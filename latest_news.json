        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has announced new import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts coming into the US.\nTrump said the latest tariffs would come into effect on 2 April, with charges on businesses importing vehicles starting the next day. Taxes on parts are set to start in May or later.\nThe president said the measure would lead to \"tremendous growth\" for the industry, promising it would spur jobs and investment in the US.\nBut analysts have said the move is likely to lead to the temporary shutdown of significant car production in the US, increase prices, and strain relations with allies.\nTrump's latest move threatens to upend global car trade and supply chains.\nThe US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade and roughly half of overall sales. \nMexico is the top supplier of cars to the US, followed by South Korea, Japan, Canada and Germany. \nMany US car companies have operations in Mexico and Canada as well, set up under the terms of the longstanding free trade agreement between them. \nThe new tariffs on car parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt while US customs and border patrol set up a system to assess the duties, the White House said. The neighbouring countries see goods worth billions cross borders each day.\nAhead of the announcement on Wednesday, shares in General Motors slid roughly 3%, while Stellantis - the owner of Jeep and Chrysler - fell 3.6%.\nIn a post on X, Elon Musk said Tesla would be affected by the measures. \"The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" he said.\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.\nThe companies that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government. Firms may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers.\nTrump's plan for car tariffs is his latest in his wider drive to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing within the US. \nBut while the measures can protect domestic businesses, they also raise costs for businesses reliant on parts from abroad.\nAnalysts have estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle, according to the Anderson Economic Group.\nTrump told reporters the tariffs would be \"permanent\" and reiterated his reasoning that: \"If you build your car in the United States there is no tariff.\"\nThe prime minister of Japan, the world's second largest exporter of cars, said it would put \"all options on the table\" in response to the tariffs. \nShares in Japanese carmakers - including Toyota, Nissan, Honda - all fell on Thursday.\nThese new tariffs are expected to come in on the same day as other countries are set to impose penalties on the US in retaliation against previously announced taxes.\nIt is not clear how the car tariffs might affect those plans.\nThe US was the top sales market for British-based Jaguar Land Rover last year, exceeding sales in the UK and China.\nUK Chancellor Rachel Reeves told the BBC the new tariffs would be \"bad for the UK, and bad for the US as well\", adding the UK was involved in \"extensive\" talks to avoid them being imposed in Britain.\nFor the UK, the US is the second largest car export market after the EU, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).\nIts chief executive Mike Hawes urged the UK and US governments to \"come together immediately and strike a deal that works for all\".\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called Trump's announcement a \"direct attack\" on his country and its car industry. \nEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc would consider the measures before any potential response.\nEarly on Thursday, Trump threatened \"far larger\" tariffs if the European Union and Canada worked together to do what he described as \"economic harm\" to the US.\nThe car industry is already grappling with the expanded tariffs on steel and aluminium.\nFord and General Motors among other major car firms have urged Trump to exempt the industry from any further duties.\nA 2024 study by the US International Trade Commission predicted that a 25% tariff on imports would reduce imports by almost 75%, while increasing average prices in the US by about 5%.\nWhite House officials said it wanted US workers make more parts, not simply assemble them, and have maintained their action is pushing firms to relocate. \nA day before the latest tariffs, South Korea's Hyundai announced it would invest $21bn (\u00a316.3bn) in the US and build a new steel plant in Louisiana.\nTrump hailed the investment as a \"clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work\".\nUnited Autoworkers union leader Shawn Fain, who had opposed Trump in the election, said the president was \"stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working class communities for decades\".\nElsewhere, head of trade group the American Automotive Policy Council, Matt Blunt, said car makers were \"committed\" to Trump's vision of \"increasing automotive production and jobs in the US\".

        "article_text": "Some coach operators say they will no longer visit a village in the Cotswolds due to new \"ill-thought-through\" drop-off and parking zones.\nA coach ban was considered in Bourton-on-the-Water after it became \"choked\" with vehicles when a private car park stopped accepting coaches in December 2023.\nBusinesses argued an outright ban would cost them money, and now a trial will see a drop-off point created. However, some operators fear the Meadow Way location is \"not safe\" and is too far to walk to the village centre.\nGloucestershire County Council insists the walk is \"short\", saying feedback will be \"welcome\" during the trial as it will be able to \"make changes\".\nThe six-month trial is set to begin around Easter and will allow coaches to stop at Meadow Way for 10 minutes to drop off and pick up passengers. Parking will then be available at the Pulhams Coaches site between 09:00 and 16:00 each day.\nA long-term plan is in the works, which would involve coaches parking in Cotswold School, although it has yet to be confirmed.\nArea director at Pulhams, Alex Chutter, said he is optimistic about the trial.\n\"It's welcome relief really,\" he said.\n\"I think there was a level of uncertainty in previous seasons and at least operators now know what the plans are and what options they have available. \n\"Hopefully that can entice them back to the area.\"\nThe council has shared Mr Chutter's hopes the scheme will encourage coach companies who stopped offering trips to Bourton-on-the-Water to return.\nHowever, multiple firms told the BBC they are not convinced by the plans.\nJason Edwards is the deputy chair of the Coach Tourism Association, a trade body representing coach tour operators. \nHe said: \"In a sort of way, it's a positive step because they have realised how important tourism is. But do we think they have got it right, no we don't.\"\nHe said the biggest sticking point is the 0.7 mile (1.1km) distance between the proposed drop-off point and the village's shops and attractions, particularly for older customers.\n\"We've got a higher-end age demographic, certainly when it comes to UK domestic coach passengers,\" he said.\n\"And for them to have a 15 to 20-minute walk, laden with shopping bags, with the British weather as unpredictable as it is, it just wouldn't work.\"\n\"They vote with their feet,\" he added. \"If there is any problems with walking distance or not having weatherproof facilities, they won't book that trip.\"\nMr Edwards, from South Wales, also runs his own coach tour business which offers tours to the Cotswolds. \n\"We dropped Bourton-on-the-Water completely,\" he said. \"We went to Stow-on-the-Wold and other areas around the Cotswolds.\n\"We wouldn't want to expose our customers to areas that aren't coach-friendly or welcoming. It has a detrimental effect to our business.\"\nHe said many operators represented by the Coach Travel Association also made the decision to avoid Bourton-on-the-Water or reduce the frequency of trips there.\nAmong the operators who continued to visit the village regularly last year was Middleton Tours. \nBut the firm said it had been forced to rethink its plans due to concerns over the trial and a recent incident where a resident shouted at one of its tour guides and passengers.\nTour manager Richard Smith said: \"The site that they have chosen is right at the junction so it's not safe. \n\"There is no shelter and no signage. There is apparently the provision for three coaches. Anybody that knows Bourton-on-the-Water, particularly during the main season, knows how busy it can get.\n\"It's ill-thought-through and could be prone to operational disasters. Until there is a  solution that works for the customer and coach operators, we have made the decision not to return to Bourton-on-the-Water.\"\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Gloucestershire County Council said the trial will give coaches a \"dedicated area\" to drop off and pick up customers which is a \"short walk\" from the centre of the village.\n\"The parish council would welcome feedback on the scheme from residents, visitors and coach operators,\" they added.\n\"The county council will be able to make changes to the scheme during the trial to ensure the best possible results.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "When Jeffrey Goldberg published a bombshell story outlining how some of the most senior US officials had mistakenly shared sensitive information with him, he obtained the biggest scoop of the year. The Atlantic editor also became the prime target for every senior Trump administration official in Washington.\nIn the last couple of days, he's been called a \"loser\" and a \"sleazebag\" by President Trump, as well as a liar and \"scum\" by US National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, who appeared to have mistakenly added Goldberg to a group chat earlier this month.\nBefore he became a political lightning rod, however, Goldberg watched on his phone as cabinet officials - including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, CIA director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard - discussed the sensitive details, timings and targets of an upcoming military operation in Yemen. They did not seem to notice his presence.\nIn an interview with the BBC on Wednesday, he told me it all began when he got a message on his phone, via the publicly available Signal messaging app, which allows users to send each other encrypted messages. It's popular among journalists and government officials. An account under Waltz's name had messaged him, which he assumed was a hoax.\n\"I wish there was a Le Carr\u00e9 quality here, you know,\" he said, referring to the late British spy novelist. \"But he asked me to talk. I said yes. And next thing I know, I'm in this very strange chat group with the national security leadership of the United States.\"\n\nAs the fall-out of the episode has engulfed Washington, Waltz has taken responsibility for mistakenly adding Goldberg to the group chat, suggesting that he meant to invite somebody else.\nHe has insisted that he has never met the editor, saying: \"I wouldn't know him if I bumped into him, if I saw him in a police lineup\". \nBy Goldberg's account, the two have actually met several times, though he declined to go into detail about their relationship.\n\"He can say obviously whatever he wants, but I'm not commenting on my relationship or non-relationship,\" Goldberg told me. \"As a reporter, I'm just not comfortable talking publicly about relationships that I may or may not have with people who are news makers.\"\nStill, one thing is clear: you must already have someone's contact information to reach them on Signal, and so Waltz had Goldberg's phone number. The top security adviser has said he has asked Elon Musk, tech billionaire and the White House's government efficiency czar, to investigate how the mistake happened - a move that was ridiculed by Goldberg.\n\"Really, you're going to put Elon Musk onto the question of how somebody's phone number ends up in someone's phone? I mean you know, most 8-year-olds could figure it out,\" he said.\nThe bigger question? \"Should you, as national security officials, be doing this on Signal on your phone?\" Goldberg said.\nIn his Monday Atlantic story - the first to report his access to the chat - Goldberg withheld the precise details that were shared around the bombing mission that attacked Houthi rebel targets in Yemen on 14 March. But Trump administration officials downplayed the report, calling him a liar and challenging his claims that classified information was shared.\nAnd so two days later, the magazine printed the full text messages, including several from Hegseth that included operational specifics. I asked him if that was a tough decision to make.\n\"Once Donald Trump said there was nothing to see here, essentially, and once Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe said there was no sensitive information, no classified information, et cetera - we felt like, hm, we disagree,\" he said. \"They're saying that, and we're the ones who have the texts, so maybe people should see them.\"\nThere are text messages in the group chat - sent before the first wave of strikes - detailing exactly when F-18 fighter jets would take off, when the first bombs would drop on Houthi targets and when Tomahawk missiles were going be fired. Hegseth has pushed back, saying they were clearly not \"war plans\" and none of it was classified information.\nPresident Trump expressed his support for Hegseth on Wednesday, saying he was \"doing a great job\" and describing Goldberg as a \"sleazebag\". The White House has also attempted to argue that the information shared was not technically war planning. \nGoldberg did not appear swayed by their insults and claims. \n\"If Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, is texting me, telling me the attack was about to be launched on Yemen - telling me what kind of aircraft are going to be used, what kind of weapons are going to be used, and when the bombs are going to fall two hours after the text is received - that seems sensitive information, war-planning information to me,\" he said.\nThis isn't the first time that the veteran editor has been on the receiving end of Trump's ire: in 2020 he published a piece in The Atlantic where senior military officials quoted Trump as having referred to fallen American soldiers as \"suckers\" and \"losers\", something the president and his administration have vigorously denied.\nI asked him how he felt about the vitriolic personal attacks against him, coming from the very highest levels of the government.\n\"This is their move. You never defend, just attack,\" Goldberg said. \"So I'm sitting there, minding my own business. They invite me into this Signal chat and now they're attacking me as a sleaze bag, I don't even get it.\"\n\nTrump has, so far, been defending his national security team and doesn't seem inclined to sack anyone over what he is calling a press \"witch-hunt\". But Goldberg says there's a widespread feeling in the White House that Waltz made a serious error, as well as deeper concern about how the incident is being handled.\n\"If you're a Air Force captain, currently working with the CIA and the State Department, and you mishandled sensitive information the way that they've obviously mishandled sensitive information? You'd be fired, you'd be prosecuted,\" Goldberg said. \nHe said there is now some \"buzz\" among the ranks around the apparently differing accountability standards for leaders in the Trump administration.\nGoldberg didn't stick around in the chat for the fallout. He decided the responsible thing to do was to leave the group. Some journalists have expressed incredulity that he would voluntarily exit. \nBut what happens next will play out in the White House and Congress, where Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have demanded an investigation.\n\"There's a part of me that would love to see what else is happening in there. But there's a lot of different issues here related to law and ethics and all kinds of other issues that I really can't go into, \" Goldberg said. \"Believe me when I say that I made that decision with good advice from various parties.\"\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "When Cyclone Alfred barrelled over Australia's east coast earlier this month, it also blew the government's election plans off course.\nHoping to capitalise on some rare good news on interest rates, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was on the cusp of announcing an April polling date. Instead he had to pivot and focus on responding to the natural disaster. It was, one Labor Minister told me, a decision taken from him by \"an act of God\".\nYou might say that's been a theme of his government: big plans often derailed by unpleasant surprises \u2013 trying global economic conditions and a cost-of-living crisis which is battering many countries, foreign wars and tricky geopolitics, post-pandemic fallout and rising national divisions, and now giant storms.\n\"Global conditions are real,\" Albanese, who leads the Labor Party, said as he officially announced a 3 May election.\nThough, despite those challenges, he says his party has delivered. \"Landing where we have is like landing a 747 [jet] on a helicopter pad,\" he said, pointing to a recent increase in wage growth and falling inflation. \nBut he wants a second term to reset.\nStanding in his way is Peter Dutton - a conservative who leads the Liberal Party, the dominant member of the so-called Coalition with the National Party of Australia \u2013 who just two years ago polling indicated was deeply unpopular.\nBut the race between them is now so tight and the rise of independents or minor parties such that many are expecting a hung parliament.\nSo how has it unravelled for Prime Minister Albanese?\nHis victory in May 2022 was seen as a fresh start after nine years of conservative rule.\nClimate action was big on the agenda, as was addressing the cost-of-living and restoring stability to the country's leadership.\nBut the legacy he eyed for his government was on Indigenous affairs. He opened his victory speech reiterating a pledge to hold a historic referendum on an Indigenous Voice to Parliament, an advisory body that would inform the government on issues that affect First Nations people.\nAlbanese spent most of 2023 campaigning for a \"Yes\" vote. This was the moment, he hoped, that First Nations people would get constitutional recognition - finally catching up with other former British colonies - and that Australia would begin mending what many see as a very broken relationship with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.\nBut the proposal was decisively rejected, leaving many Indigenous people feeling disappointed and betrayed. Albanese was also left licking his wounds after a damaging campaign.\nSome critics blamed confusion and misinformation for why about 60% of Australians voted \"No\". But while Albanese was campaigning for the \"Yes\" vote, opposition leader Peter Dutton campaigned for \"No\", attacking Albanese for spending money on the referendum while a cost-of-living crisis intensified.\n\"[Dutton] not only won on the referendum, but also he won on positioning Labor as the government that's not completely focused on the issues that matter to Australia,\" says Kos Samaras, political consultant and a former Labor strategist.\nDuring Albanese's tenure, interest rates have been put up 12 times (and cut once, in February), inflation soared post-pandemic, the country's housing crisis deepened, and Australians increasingly felt stretched.\nThough the prime minister would lay the blame for many of those issues at the previous coalition government's feet, voters want to know who is best placed to deal with all of them now.\nIn Anthony Albanese's victory speech in 2022, he said Australia was \"the greatest country on earth\". Australian voters though are increasingly questioning whether that's still true \u2013 and perhaps more importantly, whether politicians from traditional parties are the ones able to fix it.\nSo though many are disillusioned with Labor, this won't necessarily translate as a vote for Dutton's Coalition at the ballot box.\nSupport for minor parties and independents reached record levels at the previous election, and similar is expected this time around. If neither party reaches the magic number of 76 seats in the House of Representatives, which poll after poll paints as unlikely, independent candidates could be the kingmakers of any future government.\nIf that happens, Australia would be another page in a story unfolding all over the world - disenfranchised voters seeking more radical solutions and voting for change. In many places this is a real threat to democracy as people stop trusting the system.\nBut while Australia faces the same challenges as other parts of the world, a few quirks in its electoral system have thus far guarded against more radical swings that we've seen in other countries, like the US, France and Germany.\nExperts all agree that mandatory voting is a key factor in Australia's political stability. In the 2022 elections, just under 90% of the population voted \u2013 much, much higher than the average OECD turnout of 69%. The fine for not voting in a federal election is a mere A$20 but there's a sense of duty here to go out and vote.\nWhat that means is politicians don't have to mobilise their bases \u2013 turnout is a given, it's just about pushing your narrative. Where voting is optional, there's a tendency for special interest groups to become overly influential as those who are less engaged decide not to cast a ballot. Plus, if everyone, no matter their politics, education or their wealth, goes to vote, it tends to pull the result towards a more representative centre.\n\"[Australia's] elections are decided in the middle,\" says the country's chief election analyst Antony Green. \"That means getting your message through those people who aren't paying much attention.\"\nThe other big stabiliser for Australia, say experts, is preferential voting \u2013 where voters effectively number their candidates in order of who they want to win. It's why in recent years the Greens have emerged on the left and One Nation on the right but still, Labor and the Coalition dominate. Experts say preferential voting tempers the effects of polarisation and forces the two major parties to appeal to people who aren't necessarily voting for them first in order to receive their next preferences, which also helps moderate policy.\nWhile the campaign will focus on problems close to home, the candidates would be foolish to ignore the global political headwinds.\nDuring last year's presidential election, few analysts I spoke to seemed to think a Trump White House would massively impact Australia, this comparatively small and distant democracy.\nBut five months feels like a lifetime in today's politics. Not a day goes by without Donald Trump making the headlines and Australians are tuning in to watch.\nWith Trump's obvious disregard for longstanding alliances as well as constant talk of tariffs and trade wars, all this plays a part in Australians' fears about their place in the world \u2013 and importantly, the future of what is arguably its most important diplomatic and military relationship.\nPeter Dutton argues he'd be much better than Albanese at dealing with Trump. But there are doubts that anyone really knows how to handle this new administration \u2013 politicians of all stripes around the globe are feeling their way with how best to manage their relationship with the US.\nWith Albanese firing the starting gun today, Australians have just over a month of intense campaigning to help them determine who they want to lead them through the next three years.\nWhile Labor's handling of the ex-cyclone Alfred has improved its chances \u2013 the Prime Minister's approval ratings have risen to their highest level in 18 months \u2013 polling in recent months has pointed towards a Dutton administration.\nIt's still incredibly close, and the Albanese government faces the unenviable prospect of being the first which fails to win a second term since 1931.",

In the US, General Motors dropped 7%, while Ford fell more than 2%. \nTrump has threatened to impose \"far larger\" tariffs if Europe works with Canada to do what he describes as \"economic harm\" to the US.\nThe fresh car tariffs will come into effect on 2 April, with charges on businesses importing vehicles starting the next day. Taxes on parts are set to start in May or later.\nTrump has long maintained the tariffs are part of a drive to help US manufacturing and says if cars are made in America there will be \"absolutely no tariff\".\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.\nWhile the measures can protect domestic businesses, they also raise costs for companies reliant on parts from abroad.\nThe firms that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government. Firms may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers.\nThe US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade and roughly half of overall sales.\nMexico is the top supplier of cars to the US, followed by South Korea, Japan, Canada and Germany.\nAnalysts have estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle, according to the Anderson Economic Group.\nGerman Economy Minister Robert Habeck said the European Union must \"respond firmly\".\n\"It must be clear that we will not give in to the US. We need to show strength and self-confidence,\" he added.\nFrance backed this joint approach, with its finance minister saying Europe must retaliate with tariffs on US products.\nAt a press conference on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron said it was \"not the time\" for the US to be imposing tariffs.\n\"Imposing tariffs means breaking value chains, it means creating in the short term an inflationary effect and destroying jobs,\" he said in Paris. \n\"All of this is rather a waste of time and will create a lot of worry,\" he added, urging Trump to reconsider. \nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called the tariffs a \"direct attack\" on his country and its car industry, adding it \"will hurt us\", but trade options were being discussed.\nIn the UK, car industry body the SMMT said the car tariffs announcement was \"not surprising but, nevertheless, disappointing\".\nUniparts founder John Neill said the Trump tariffs were \"a gift to the Chinese\", because international consumers would respond to a trade war by buying Chinese alternatives.\nMeanwhile, China accused Trump of violating World Trade Organization rules.\n\"There are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war. No country's development and prosperity has been achieved by imposing tariffs,\" a spokesman for the foreign ministry said.\nThere are warnings from Japan that there will be a \"significant impact\" on the economic relationship it shares with the US.

It was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties.Meanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said three Ukrainian drones were either intercepted or shot down over the western Belgorod region.In his video address late on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky again accused Russia of targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure - in violation of a temporary moratorium agreed earlier this month in talks involving the US.Moscow has also repeatedly blamed Ukraine for attacking Russia's energy sector.Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested earlier this week that Ukraine should temporarily be placed under UN control to elect what he called a more \"competent\" government.It was seen as the latest attempt by the Kremlin to challenge the legitimacy of the Kyiv government - a move widely condemned by Ukraine's allies.Ukraine accused Putin of proposing \"crazy\" ideas to delay further movement towards a ceasefire deal being championed by US President Donald Trump.Washington said on Tuesday that the two sides had agreed to a limited truce in the Black Sea.But Russia then put forward a list of conditions, including the lifting of some Western sanctions, prompting concerns that Moscow was trying to derail any moves towards a ceasefire.In a separate development, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that France and the UK were moving forward with plans for a \"reassurance force\" in Ukraine.The proposal was discussed at a summit of the \"coalition of the willing\" - Ukraine's allies from more than 30 countries -  in Paris.Russia has repeatedly warned that the deployment of any European troops in Ukraine would be unacceptable, and such forces would be seen by the Kremlin as a legitimate target.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.Zelensky hopes US will 'stand strong' in face of Russian demandsWhy Trump is struggling to secure fast ceasefire in UkraineEuropeWar in UkraineFranceVolodymyr ZelenskyRussiaVladimir PutinUnited StatesUkraine",

        "article_text": "What will it take for India's private companies to begin investing in building new factories and firms?\nIt's a question that's confounded policymakers for years. As a share of gross domestic product (GDP), private investment in India has been on the decline since the global financial crisis of 2007, even while the overall economy clocked world-beating growth rates.\nAfter a long hiatus, the investment rate picked up slightly in 2022 and 2023, but latest data from a leading ratings agency shows private sector expenditure as part of the overall investments in India's economy dipped again to a decadal low of 33% this financial year.\nAnalysis from Icra of 4,500 listed companies and 8,000 unlisted companies reveals that while the pace of investments made by listed players moderated, those by unlisted entities actually contracted.\nOver the years, several economists have raised similar concerns about a slowdown in private investments. \nBanking tycoon Uday Kotak is among many who've raised concerns recently about India's fading \"animal spirits\", urging young business owners who had inherited companies to build new businesses rather than sitting tight and managing their existing wealth.\nData from investment advisory firm Value Research shows Indian non-financial businesses were sitting on cash worth 11% of their total assets, corroborating the view that companies are not spending money in making fresh investments. \nSo why are Indian corporate houses choosing to do that?\nWeak domestic consumption in urban areas, muted export demand and an influx of cheap Chinese imports in some sectors were among the factors that \"restricted the capacity expansion plans of Indian corporate houses\", Icra's Chief Rating Officer K Ravichandran said in a note.\nBut beyond the more immediate reasons, private investment impulse has been low because of \"global uncertainties and overcapacity\", India's economic survey pointed out earlier this year.\nSlowing private investments have a direct bearing on India's growth prospects.\nInvestments by companies in assets such as factories, machinery or construction \u2013 also called gross fixed capital formation \u2013 make up around 30% of GDP and are its second largest contributor following private consumption.\nIndia's full-year GDP is expected to close at 6.5%, sharply lower compared to last year's 9.2%. Growth has flagged on account of slower consumption.\nWith all the key levers of growth, including exports, slowing down and US President Donald Trump's tariffs exacerbating global uncertainties, kick-starting private investment will be fundamental for India to hit its long-term growth targets, experts say.\nAccording to the World Bank's latest estimates, India will need to grow by 7.8% on average over the next 22 years to achieve its high-income status ambition by 2047.\nKey to this would be to increase private and public investment to at least 40% of GDP from 33% currently, the bank estimates.\nThe government on its part has significantly increased spending, especially on infrastructure. It also cut corporate tax rates from 30% to 22% and doled out billions of dollars in production-linked subsidies to manufacturers over the years. Availability of bank credit isn't a constraint any longer, and regulation has eased with regulatory restrictions halving between 2003 and 2020.\nBut none of this has prodded corporate India to boost spending.\nAccording to Sajjid Chinoy, JP Morgan India's Chief Economist, the big problem is the lack of demand in the economy to justify putting up additional capacities.\nIndia's post-pandemic recovery has been uneven, with the consumer class not expanding quickly enough. Demand for goods and services has thus been hit, with spending capacity further curtailed by a fall in wages, even though corporate profitability has soared to a 15-year high this year.\n\"Just because companies are financially strong doesn't mean they will automatically invest. Companies will only invest if they expect good returns,\" Chinoy said at an event in Mumbai earlier this year.\nRathin Roy, a former member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC), points to other deeper structural issues arresting investment appetite.\n\"Entrepreneurs have been lacking the energy to produce goods that might generate new demand. A classic example of this is construction - where there's unsold inventory in the urban areas, but an incapacity among builders to go into tier two and tier three towns and tap newer markets,\" Roy told the BBC.\nHe said he also agreed with Mr Kotak's views on the growing trend of business heirs turning wealth managers rather than building businesses ground up.\n\"Business houses discovered during Covid-19 that they don't need to do business to make money. They can just invest and multiply it without building anything new,\" said Roy. And these investments aren't just happening in the domestic stock market. \"A lot of money is just flowing out of India and chasing returns elsewhere,\" he added.\nBut things could be turning a corner, according to Icra.\nInterest rate cuts as well as a $12bn income tax relief provided to individuals in the federal budget \"augurs well for supporting domestic consumption demand\", according to the report.\nIndia's central bank also says more private companies have shown an intention to invest this year compared to last year, although how much of that intent results into actual money deployed remains to be seen. \nThe uncertainties related to global trade tariffs could delay any anticipated investment pick-up, according to Icra.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "We have all heard of carmaker Ford, but what about its one-time rivals Abbot-Detroit, Acme, Adams and Aerocar?\nNo? Well that is hardly surprising because unlike Ford they all went bust very early on. And they are just some of the failed car companies starting with the letter \"A\".\nWe only remember the winners who went on to dominate the world's motor industry, and the current high-tech sector is much the same.\nA great many investors backed the wrong horseless carriages around a century ago and lost their money. Only a few picked Ford or Chrysler, which is almost exactly what is happening now, only to the tech sector.\nTech shares have been hugely volatile over the past year, as has been widely reported, with share price graphs often looking like rollercoaster rides, even before President Trump's tariffs have caused wider stocks falls.\nA principle reason for this tech sector volatility, according to Elroy Dimson, professor of finance at the University of Cambridge, is that like the once nascent car industry we don't know which tech firms will win in the long run.\n\"If you go back to the beginning of the last century there were an awful lot of motor companies, and it was clear that automobiles were going to make a huge difference,\" says Prof Dimson. \"But almost every company went bankrupt, you didn't know which company you should be buying.\"\nThen, of course, not all high-tech businesses are making money. The measure of the return on an investment in shares uses two factors, the growth in profits or dividends, and the growth in the value of the shares.\nBoring companies might pay reliable dividends and see their shares gradually increase in value. But many high-tech companies are not paying out much if anything in dividends. Instead, they are investing in future growth, and so their share prices fluctuate based on hopes of future profits.\nAs Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at UK financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, puts it: \"Tech shares are more volatile, they have high valuations and their price-earnings ratios are very high, and growth stocks are more sensitive to interest rate movements.\"\nBut also, investors in such shares are, as Ms Streeter puts it, gambling on \"not jam today but jam tomorrow\". They are all trying to pick the next future big winner, not the one paying out profits now, but the one that will eventually pay huge dividends sometime in the future.\nSo, any news or even suggestion that future growth is not going to be as good as previously expected means share values can collapse.\nOn the other hand, any good news boosts share prices even if current profits, or even losses, don't change at all, as investors pile into what they think is the future winner. The shares are more volatile because they are not underwritten by current profits or dividends.\nThat means as Prof Dimson puts it, \"that small changes in growth expectation can lead to large changes in share value\", which can effect a large number of companies at the same time.\n\"You have companies that are reasonably similar, so when growth rates change it is effecting quite a few companies in a similar way,\" he says.\n\"This is not different from the dotcom boom at the beginning of the 2000s. There were companies with huge growth prospects. And when the growth prospects disappeared, these were the companies that disappeared.\"\nAlso, even today there are not that many really large high-tech companies. In America they are colloquially known as the \"magnificent seven\" - Nvidia, a chipmaker, Alphabet, which owns Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, the parent of Facebook, and Tesla.\nSo, it does not take much to spook the market, especially since several of these firms are really quite young, and are dominant in sectors where previous leaders have crashed and burned. Anyone remember Ericsson, Boo or Compaq?\nTechnology, unlike say steel production or food manufacturing, is changing at a very rapid rate, and there is obviously the chance that a new high-tech company will come along and destroy the business model of its most established rivals.\nThere is simply no guarantee that today's \"magnificent seven\" will remain magnificent or even stay as the same seven firms.\nTake Tesla for example, its sales have recently fallen in response to two widely-reported factors. Firstly, some potential customers are opposed to Tesla owner Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's government. And secondly, Chinese electric car firms such as BYD are increasingly strong competitors.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia saw its share price drop sharply at the start of this year following the release of Chinese artificial intelligence chatbot DeepSeek.  This app was reportedly created at a fraction of the cost of its rivals.\nThe instant popularity of DeepSeek has raised questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning. This concerns Nvidia because it is at the forefront of making microchips for AI processing.\nAI is now the biggest tech game in town, and it seems that absolutely everyone is claiming that AI is transforming their industry, their products and their profits. They can't all be right.\nOr as Prof Dimon puts it: \"At least in 1910 you knew what automobiles did, but today with AI companies you have to rely on the wisdom of the crowd, and for AI companies that isn't good enough.\"\nAnd not all AI firms can win, adds Robert Whaley, professor of finance at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. \"AI is certainly contributing to tech volatility. The race is on.\"\nThat means that AI shares are sensitive to predictions. And any sign that a particular firm is lagging in the AI race may mean that lots of investors, most of whom don't understand the subject, abandon it for another that seems to be further ahead.\nThen there are investors who seemingly don't seem to care which companies' shares they buy, so long as they are in the \"booming\" high-tech sector, as they are speculating and spreading their risks.\nIn short, share prices are not always a rational measure of a firm's value, especially in the high-tech sector, or even of its prospects. Instead, they can represent the optimism of investors. And optimism does not always last.\nIt is often short-lived, passing, and faddish. And sometimes optimism comes face to face with reality or just plain fades away. It is, in short, volatile.",

They move up to fifth position in the table to improve their chances of clinching a top eight-place, which would guarantee a spot in the end-of-season knockout stages and qualification for the Champions Cup.\nThe Stormers remain in contention too after picking up bonus points for scoring four tries and being within seven points and with four home games to come to complete their regular league campaign.\nThe Cape Town side took a second-minute lead when back-rower Roos raced away to score after the hosts had been turned over on their own 22, and Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu played him through a gaping hole in the Ulster defence.\nThe visiting fly-half added the extras and soon after executed a drop goal from long range to increase the lead to 10-0.\nThe South African side's superb start continued when Loader broke away to score after Dave McCann's pass in the tackle on halfway fell loose and was latched on to by the wing. Feinberg-Mngomezulu kicked the conversion from the right-hand touchline.\nUlster responded on 11 minutes as Baloucoune marked his return to action after an 11-month absence by going over in the corner after collecting Murphy's 20-yard spin pass.\nThe home side enjoyed the better of the possession and pressure thereafter in the first half and were rewarded when prop Warwick barged over from close range, Cooney adding the additional two points.\nFeinberg-Mngomezulu then steered a penalty from 35 metres wide after the ball fell off the tee - a let-off for Richie Murphy's side.\nThe Stormers number 10 was at the centre of the action again as he received a yellow card for taking out Baloucoune in full flight after the wing had kicked the ball forward into space.\nSoon after, Murphy crossed when the ball was spun to him on the left after Ulster rucked up close to the Stormers' line and he finished the move superbly.\nCentre Stewart Moore scored the last of Ulster's six tries in a high-scoring game\nAfter the sides went in level at the break, Ulster got off to a storming start on the resumption by touching down for his side's bonus-point score.\nUlster opted for a tap and go at a penalty and worked the ball to the left, where Mike Lowry unselfishly passed to Stockdale who cantered over. Cooney was successful with his kick to put two between the sides.\nThe Stormers suffered a further setback when they had captain Fouche sent-off by referee Andrea Pairdi after he consulted with the Television Match Official [TMO].\nThe prop was adjudged to have committed a dangerous challenge to the head of centre Carson, who left the field injured.\nFeinberg-Mngomezulu reduced his team's arrears when he returned to the field after his 10 minutes in the bin, notching a second drop goal, this time firing between the sticks from 40 yards.\nThat proved to be only a brief respite, however, as Ulster scored try number five. Stockdale burst through the midfield before offloading to the right flank to flying replacement Ward, who sprinted over the line. Murphy had the simple task of adding the conversion from in front of the posts.\nThe Stormers were not finished though as substitute Engelbrecht darted in beside the posts, Feinberg-Mngomezulu adding the two points to put just four between the sides.\nUlster's sixth try came on the counter-attack, Lowry scorching down the right flank and passing to Nick Timoney, then Doak, then Moore who dashed over adjacent to the uprights.

Feinberg-Mngomezulu kicked the conversion from the right-hand touchline.Ulster responded on 11 minutes as Baloucoune marked his return to action after an 11-month absence by going over in the corner after collecting Murphy's 20-yard spin pass.The home side enjoyed the better of the possession and pressure thereafter in the first half and were rewarded when prop Warwick barged over from close range, Cooney adding the additional two points.Feinberg-Mngomezulu then steered a penalty from 35 metres wide after the ball fell off the tee - a let-off for Richie Murphy's side.The Stormers number 10 was at the centre of the action again as he received a yellow card for taking out Baloucoune in full flight after the wing had kicked the ball forward into space.Soon after, Murphy crossed when the ball was spun to him on the left after Ulster rucked up close to the Stormers' line and he finished the move superbly.High scoring continuesImage source, InphoImage caption, Centre Stewart Moore scored the last of Ulster's six tries in a high-scoring gameAfter the sides went in level at the break, Ulster got off to a storming start on the resumption by touching down for his side's bonus-point score.Ulster opted for a tap and go at a penalty and worked the ball to the left, where Mike Lowry unselfishly passed to Stockdale who cantered over. Murphy had the simple task of adding the conversion from in front of the posts.The Stormers were not finished though as substitute Engelbrecht darted in beside the posts, Feinberg-Mngomezulu adding the two points to put just four between the sides.Ulster's sixth try came on the counter-attack, Lowry scorching down the right flank and passing to Nick Timoney, then Doak, then Moore who dashed over adjacent to the uprights. Doak's kick extended his side's advantage to 11 points.Again, the Stormers came back strongly as Roos barged over from close range for his second of the night, the conversion bringing their side to within four.Ulster hung on for a crucial win, however, the victory ensuring that the record of no South African side having ever won at the Kingspan Stadium continues.Team line-upsUlster: Michael Lowry, Rob Baloucoune, James Hume, Stuart McCloskey, Jacob Stockdale, Jack Murphy, John Cooney, Andrew Warwick, Rob Herring, Tom O'Toole, Alan O'Connor (capt), Kieran Treadwell, Matty Rea, Nick Timoney, David McCannReplacements: Tom Stewart, Callum Reid, Scott Wilson, Harry Sheridan, James McNabney, Nathan Doak, Ben Carson, Zac WardDHL Stormers: Damian Willemse, Ben Loader, Suleiman Hartzenberg, Dan du Plessis, Leolin Zas, Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu, Dewaldt Duvenage, Ali Vermaak, Joseph Dweba, Neethling Fouche (capt), Connor Evans, Ruben van Heerden, Dave Ewers, Marcel Theunissen, Evan RoosReplacements: Andre-Hugo Venter, Brok Harris, Sazi Sandi, Gary Porter, Willie Engelbrecht, Paul de Wet, Jurie Matthee, Wandisile SimelaneRelated topicsUlsterIrish RugbyNorthern Ireland SportRugby Union They move up to fifth position in the table to improve their chances of clinching a top eight-place, which would guarantee a spot in the end-of-season knockout stages and qualification for the Champions Cup.The Stormers remain in contention too after picking up bonus points for scoring four tries and being within seven points and with four home games to come to complete their regular league campaign.See-saw first halfThe Cape Town side took a second-minute lead when back-rower Roos raced away to score after the hosts had been turned over on their own 22, and Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu played him through a gaping hole in the Ulster defence.The visiting fly-half added the extras and soon after executed a drop goal from long range to increase the lead to 10-0.The South African side's superb start continued when Loader broke away to score after Dave McCann's pass in the tackle on halfway fell loose and was latched on to by the wing.",

        "article_text": "Mikaela Mayer (left) is a two-weight world champion having also held titles at super-featherweight\nWBO welterweight champion Mikaela Mayer faces Briton Sandy Ryan in a Las Vegas rematch on Saturday. \nIn her BBC Sport column, American Mayer talks about the events leading up to victory in last September's first fight in New York when Ryan was hit by a can of red paint before leaving for the venue.\nOn Friday, Ryan will address the controversy and rivalry between the pair.\nI was in my room and we were starting to walk to the elevator, waiting for the go-ahead from the team to say we could go down because we were at the same hotel as Sandy Ryan. \nSandy was out there first waiting for her car so we stood by the elevator and my nutritionist said to wait because she hasn't got in the car yet.\nMy nutritionist was looking at her phone and was like, 'oh my god, someone just threw paint on Sandy'. We were all taken aback but I didn't understand that I was apparently the culprit.\nI got in the car but didn't really understand the extent of it until I got to the arena and online there was a photo of Sandy, who was stripped down with red paint on her. ESPN came in to see me and apparently I'm being blamed for the attack.\nEveryone who knows me, knows that would be out of character for me - it's not my style. I expected her to try to blame me. I was her rival all week but there were also other things going on. \nSandy has already said flyers attacking her were put up around the hotel and city.\nYou can't just point a finger when there is no evidence leading back to me. I was upstairs waiting to walk down for the fight of my life. \nI didn't know what time she was going to be down there or that she was going first. The only people who knew were her team - maybe she should look inside her own circle.\nThe incident took me by surprise but I was in fight mode and it didn't happen to me, so I wasn't flustered.\nIf someone had thrown paint on me I would have slapped paint on the ass of my fight shorts and got on with it.\nI was concerned that she was going to pull out - her team were really getting her going about it.\nThere was a clip of her coach Kay Koroma in the locker room screaming at her to pull out of the fight which I thought was super suspicious. That was weird to me and out of character for him. \nI really don't think it was the paint that threw her off her game but her team, who made it a bigger deal than it had to be.\nObviously I don't want that to happen and I hope it doesn't happen going into this fight. It could have been called off and, after two years of busting my butt to get back in that position, that was the last thing I wanted.\nAs for 'paint-gate' being used to promote the rematch, I was surprised the Top Rank team used the paint on the promotion posters - but this is entertainment. \nI didn't have any say in it. If I had done anything like that, my manager would have had my neck as he tries to keep me professional.\nI didn't know about it until the poster came out and I said, 'do they have red paint on Sandy?'\nI was just as taken aback as anyone else, but it's kind of funny.\nMayer (right) beat Ryan (left) by majority decision with one judge scoring it a draw\nIt's important for women's boxing to have these rivalries and this is definitely up there as one of the top ones.\nI never counted out the rematch and just wanted to see what my other options were. Once I saw the views and how much the fans wanted it - and the excuses - I thought let's do it again and I'll do it even better.\nI didn't get my rematch with Alycia Baumgardner so I understand Sandy might have been frustrated, but I didn't have to give her this rematch. I could have just sat it out, waited for Lauren Price to unify and fought for undisputed or faced someone else. \nThat's not the fighter I am though.\nI pride myself on the fact a lot of the fights I have been in are competitive and people aren't sure who will win. \nMy feud with Alycia will stay number one for a lifetime, but Sandy can come second because of the coaching team situation and the paint situation.\nSandy and her team have tried to gaslight me in a sense where I'm supposed to be making all of this up or I'm being dramatic, but it happened.\nYou're going to see coach Koroma, my coach of eight or nine years since the Olympics, in her corner so they really can't say anything about it. They did what they did and they have to stand by that. \nI'm just protecting myself and I'm the one who had to go out and find a whole new team at this stage of my career which is not easy.

Luckily, that didn't come to be,\" he said.\nThree series later and having been Doctor Who's showrunner between 2017 and 2022, Chibnall has used an imagined Dorset as the backdrop for his debut novel, Death at the White Hart.\n\"A landlord is discovered murdered, tied to a chair in the middle of the A35 at 02:00 and he's got deer antlers strapped to his head. The question is who did it and why?\" Chibnall said.\nHe told BBC Radio Solent at West Bay that he still takes inspiration from his adopted county.\n\"The first few years I was living down here, doing that drive between Dorchester and Bridport or Dorchester and Lyme Regis, at that stretch of the A35, if you're doing it at 23:00 or midnight, it's so dark, it's so deserted,\" he said.\n\"It always took me back to Thomas Hardy novels when you think of the coach and horses that would drive along there and the mist and the fog that is along there.\n\"It's incredibly atmospheric, it's incredibly beautiful and terrifying at the same time. That's the sort of atmosphere that I wanted to harness for the novel.\"\nChibnall returned to Bridport Arts Centre on Monday to launch the novel, which ITV has already commissioned for a TV adaptation.\nThe BAFTA-award winning writer said it had always been \"an amazingly supportive community\".\nHe added: \"When Broadchurch was on, people would ask me whoever did it or could they be in it? Could I write a character like them? And I would have to say: 'you know that would be a murder suspect, don't you?'\"\nBut he said writing a book meant he could \"go into the characters' heads a lot more\" than he has been able to in his TV work.\n\"It's so different. Having done TV, you're part of a big operation, a big team,\" Chibnall added.\n\"So if I want to set something in a pub, a location manager has to find that pub and a designer has to dress that pub and I need a cinematographer and a director.\n\"Whereas with the novel, I describe the pub \u2013 we're there as you read it.

Everything changed in 1984.\nBefore the 1984-85 season, Sampdoria's only honour was the 1966-67 second division title.\nYet over the next decade, the club won the Coppa Italia four times - more than any other side during that period - were crowned Serie A champions, won the European Cup Winners' Cup and played in a European Cup final.\nAfter assuming the club presidency in 1979, Paolo Mantovani was the man who turned an unfashionable mid-table team into serial winners.\nHaving made his money in the oil business, Mantovani spent heavily but smartly to propel Sampdoria to unprecedented heights.\nBig names like Francis, Graeme Souness and Liam Brady were signed, but it was the recruitment of some of the best young Italian talents that really paid off.\nA 17-year-old Mancini arrived from Bologna in 1982, followed two years later by a 19-year-old Vialli from Cremonese.\nNicknamed the 'goal twins' because of their prolific attacking partnership, both scored in the second leg of the 1984-95 Coppa Italia final, the first major title in Sampdoria's history.\nMancini and Vialli first met at 16 playing for Italy's youth teams and formed a close friendship that characterised the unity in the Sampdoria squad.\n\"We have a relationship that goes way beyond friendship,\" Mancini said before Vialli's death from pancreatic cancer in 2023. \"He's almost like a brother to me.\"\nAlong with goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca, defender Pietro Vierchowod, attacking right-back Moreno Mannini, midfield anchor Fausto Pari and electric winger Attilio Lombardo, the duo formed the backbone of a team that won three more Coppa Italia titles - and the club's first and only Scudetto in 1990-91 under legendary manager Vujadin Boskov.\n\"Mantovani cultivated a remarkable camaraderie among a uniquely talented group,\" says Italian football writer Stephen Kasiewicz.\n\"Despite more lucrative offers the core of the team stayed together.\"\nBoskov's side won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1990, while only a Ronald Koeman free-kick saw them lose to Johan Cruyff's Barcelona 'dream team' in the European Cup final two years later.\nBut nothing lasts forever.\nSampdoria won six major titles between 1984 and 1994\nMantovani's death in 1993 was \"the beginning of the end at Sampdoria\", according to Italian football journalist David Ferrini.\nHe added: \"Mantovani's reign attracted talent and kept them happy in Genoa, but his passing - combined with the hangover of the Scudetto success - meant that Sampdoria's best players became prime transfer targets.\"\nIn 1992 they had lost Vialli to Juventus for a then-world record \u00a312m, while Inter Milan paid \u00a37m for Pagliuca in 1994, a record for a goalkeeper at the time. \nVierchowod joined Juventus 12 months later before Mancini followed Sven Goran Eriksson - who had replaced Boskov as manager in 1992 - to Lazio in 1997.\nExperienced stars like Gullit and Platt joined for brief spells, but Sampdoria no longer had the same appeal they once did.\nEnrico Mantovani took over as president but failed to replicate his father's success - and a steady decline followed the Coppa Italia triumph of 1993-94. In 1999 the club were relegated to Serie B.\nThings improved under the presidency of local entrepreneur Riccardo Garrone, who guided the club back to Serie A in 2003 and signed future cult heroes Fabio Quagliarella and Antonio Cassano.\nYet the highlights of the 21st Century have been losing the Coppa Italia final in 2008-09 and a fourth-place league finish the following year. \nOutspoken film producer Massimo Ferrero bought the club in 2014 - taking on its growing debts - but what followed was seven years of selling their best players, spending little on replacements and flirting with relegation on a regular basis.\n\"He seemed more concerned with bolstering his own image, as the bizarre star of his own one-man reality football show, than making sure Samp prospered,\" says Kasiewicz.\nIn December 2021 Ferrero was arrested and jailed as part of an investigation into corporate crimes and bankruptcy, unrelated to the club. He resigned as president.\n\"The club effectively ceased to function. It's been like a house of cards,\" says Nima Tavallaey, Italian football journalist and co-host of The Italian Football Podcast.\nWith no funds available and Ferrero refusing to relinquish control, Sampdoria narrowly avoided relegation from Serie A in 2022. But in 2023 they did go down, amid reports of unpaid player wages.\nWith the club staring down the barrel of bankruptcy and demotion to the fourth tier, a consortium led by former Leeds United owner Andrea Radrizzani and London-based financier Matteo Manfredi - and his company Gestio Capital - bought the club, though Radrizzani has since divested his shares.\nGestio Capital say they and their investors now own 99.96% of the club and deny reports in Genovese newspaper Il Secolo XIX, external that Singaporean businessman Joseph Tey Wei Jin - named in the 2015 Panama Papers - actually owns the majority of shares through his company Kickoff Ventures.\nMatteo Manfredi has invested significantly since becoming Sampdoria owner\nItalian World Cup winner Andrea Pirlo was hired as coach in 2023-24. \nAfter a dismal start to the campaign his side won seven of their final 11 games to secure a seventh-place finish in Serie B and a spot in the promotion play-offs, where they lost 2-0 to Palermo in the preliminary round.\nGestio invested about \u00a345m during their first season, but things have not gone according to plan this term.\nThe month before Sampdoria's play-off exit Manfredi had described Pirlo as \"a key part of the project\" - yet three games into the current campaign he was dismissed following two defeats and a draw.\nAndrea Sottil replaced him and, although he oversaw a Coppa Italia penalty shootout victory against Genoa in the first Derby della Lanterna in two years, he was jettisoned too after just four wins in 14 games. \nLeonardo Semplici arrived in December and remains in position despite overseeing just two wins in 14 league games, both coming at the start of February.\nSampdoria find themselves 16th in the table - the final relegation play-off spot - with eight games left to play, and just two points above automatic relegation.\nAs things stand, a two-legged play-off will decide if they sink to the third tier for the first time.\n\"Dropping down into Serie C is unthinkable after all the efforts to keep the club in business,\" says Ferrini.\n\"Manfredi won't want to go down in history as the owner who took them down into the third division.\"\nFor Tavallaey, just avoiding relegation won't be enough.\n\"They have to build a proper project with a proper sporting directorship and a proper manager to help them back to Serie A.

        "article_text": "Emma Raducanu will move back into the world's top 50 following her Miami Open run\nEmma Raducanu is starting to play like it is 2021.\nThe Briton, who won 10 matches in straight sets to clinch the US Open title, had not been able to win more than three in a row until this week\u2019s Miami Open.\nHer run was ended by world number four Jessica Pegula in the quarter-finals, but on Monday Raducanu will return to the world\u2019s top 50 for the first time since September 2022.\nSuccess has come despite a constantly changing sea of faces in the coaching box and a typically challenging start to the year.\nThe 22-year-old has not had a full-time coach since January, but played with great freedom in Miami.\nSo what kind of support might Raducanu need to be able to produce form like this on a more consistent basis?\nAfter the early promise of two Australian Open wins against higher-ranked opponents, Raducanu lost heavily to Iga Swiatek in January before coach Nick Cavaday informed her his health would prevent him from continuing.\nFebruary's spell in the Middle East ended in distressing fashion, as a man who had been following Raducanu around the circuit was evicted from her second-round match and given a restraining order.\nRaducanu appeared rudderless for much of that period, although she was rarely short of support. Her strength and conditioning coach Yutaka Nakamura has barely left her side since starting in early December.\nRoman Kelecic, a coach from her teenage days, helped out in Abu Dhabi. Jane O'Donoghue, a friend and former LTA coach, was in Doha and Dubai. Tom Welsh was drafted in from the Loughborough Academy as a short-term hire for Indian Wells, only for Vladimir Platenik to usurp him by arriving in California for a hastily arranged trial.\nAfter only two weeks that trial was ended by Raducanu on the eve of her first-round victory in Miami - and a seat offered once again to O\u2019Donoghue and the broadcaster and coach Mark Petchey.\nHow 'free spirit' Raducanu is thriving without coach\nSecond Serve: Your new weekly tennis briefing\nPetchey coached an 18-year-old Andy Murray for 10 months - during which he won his first ATP title - and trained with Raducanu during the pandemic summer of 2020.\nThose weeks at the National Tennis Centre in London appear to have left quite an impression on Raducanu. There is a mutual respect and rapport between the two.\nO'Donoghue has been a regular confidante for Raducanu, and was the LTA\u2019s national women\u2019s coach until 2019, when she left the sport for pastures new.\nRaducanu trusts them and is able to relax in their company, but they both have day jobs.\nPetchey is in broadcasting - most notably with the Tennis Channel - and O\u2019Donoghue in finance. She is currently on a sabbatical, but there is no suggestion she wants to return to the far less secure world of tennis coaching on a permanent basis.\nBoth could offer input but, as things stand, not the type of support Raducanu said she was seeking when speaking to the BBC at Indian Wells.\n\"Once I have a structure in place and I can fall back on the process again I will feel very set,\" she said this month.\n\"In the Middle East it was very difficult for me because I didn't really have any direction or structure or which tournaments to play and it was very difficult doing it all on my own.\n\"I'm that kind of person who needs a plan and needs preparation. That's what I'm building and that's making me feel more comfortable.\"\nJane O'Donoghue (left) was with Emma Raducanu in Miami\nRaducanu is part of the Great Britain team which will compete in the Billie Jean King Cup qualifying round in early April, and will be able to spend the next two weeks working with the LTA coaching team.\nBut she will need a more lasting plan swiftly.\nHer clay-court season could take in Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome before thre French Open, and there will be very little respite in the schedule before the end of October.\nThat plan does not need to revolve around one person.\nMany top players employ more than one coach, usually because it is very hard for any one individual to commit to more than 30 weeks on the road each year.\nJack Draper ended last summer\u2019s partnership with Wayne Ferreira as he preferred the \"one voice\" of James Trotman, but now travels to some events with Alex Ward.\nPerhaps things could have worked out differently with Cavaday if an additional coach had been brought into the team when his health problems first arose in the spring of 2024.\nExposure to different personalities and ways of thinking has always been appealing to Raducanu, but the period with Cavaday offered her stability and calmness.\nThey liked each other, having first established a coaching partnership when Raducanu was a girl. Cavaday was a good sounding board, and there was evidence from her play last spring and summer that the two could flourish in future.\nOther partnerships fizzled out much more quickly.\nPlatenik lasted only two weeks. His coaching acumen is widely admired, but his personality did not seem a good match for Raducanu.\nOne former player compared him to a \"freight train\", saying he was intense and opinionated. Platenik says Raducanu told him she was feeling \u201cstressed\u201d when ending the brief collaboration.\nTorben Beltz looked an excellent choice, given his Grand Slam success with Angelique Kerber, but Raducanu did not feel he had enough to offer.\nDmitry Tursunov ended their partnership because he thought Raducanu needed to listen to just \"one voice\". He referred to \"red flags\" and a feeling there may be further problems down the line.\nHer spell with Sebastian Sachs concluded after operations on both hands and left ankle, which kept her on the sidelines for the second half of 2023.\nThere did not seem much logic in dispensing of the services of Nigel Sears after Wimbledon 2021, but it is hard to argue with the choice of Andrew Richardson, who then steered her to that historic triumph at the US Open.\nHowever, that partnership ended there.\nWould Raducanu go back to a coach she has previously let go? Sears still looks a good bet and has a proven track record of success with Daniela Hantuchova, Ana Ivanovic and Anett Kontaveit.\nHe is no longer working with the Australian Olivia Gadecki, and is a regular at the National Tennis Centre in London, where he works with the LTA's women's team.\nFor all her progress in Miami, Raducanu may have a difficult spring and summer without the right personnel around her.\nDoes she ever throws a covetous glance at Draper's set-up?\nHis team looks a thoroughly professional outfit, and some hard decisions have recently been made.\nPhysio Will Herbert and strength and conditioning coach Steve Kotze are no longer involved. They have been replaced by Shane Annun and Matt Little, who were so integral to Andy Murray's team.\nAnd Trotman remains as head coach.

        "summary": "'Raducanu needs plan quickly to build on Miami progress'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Emma Raducanu will move back into the world's top 50 following her Miami Open runRussell FullerTennis correspondentPublished1 hour agoEmma Raducanu is starting to play like it is 2021.The Briton, who won 10 matches in straight sets to clinch the US Open title, had not been able to win more than three in a row until this week\u2019s Miami Open.Her run was ended by world number four Jessica Pegula in the quarter-finals, but on Monday Raducanu will return to the world\u2019s top 50 for the first time since September 2022.Success has come despite a constantly changing sea of faces in the coaching box and a typically challenging start to the year.The 22-year-old has not had a full-time coach since January, but played with great freedom in Miami.So what kind of support might Raducanu need to be able to produce form like this on a more consistent basis?After the early promise of two Australian Open wins against higher-ranked opponents, Raducanu lost heavily to Iga Swiatek in January before coach Nick Cavaday informed her his health would prevent him from continuing.February's spell in the Middle East ended in distressing fashion, as a man who had been following Raducanu around the circuit was evicted from her second-round match and given a restraining order.Raducanu appeared rudderless for much of that period, although she was rarely short of support. \"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jane O'Donoghue (left) was with Emma Raducanu in MiamiRaducanu is part of the Great Britain team which will compete in the Billie Jean King Cup qualifying round in early April, and will be able to spend the next two weeks working with the LTA coaching team.But she will need a more lasting plan swiftly.Her clay-court season could take in Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome before thre French Open, and there will be very little respite in the schedule before the end of October.That plan does not need to revolve around one person.Many top players employ more than one coach, usually because it is very hard for any one individual to commit to more than 30 weeks on the road each year.Jack Draper ended last summer\u2019s partnership with Wayne Ferreira as he preferred the \"one voice\" of James Trotman, but now travels to some events with Alex Ward.Perhaps things could have worked out differently with Cavaday if an additional coach had been brought into the team when his health problems first arose in the spring of 2024.Exposure to different personalities and ways of thinking has always been appealing to Raducanu, but the period with Cavaday offered her stability and calmness.They liked each other, having first established a coaching partnership when Raducanu was a girl. Tom Welsh was drafted in from the Loughborough Academy as a short-term hire for Indian Wells, only for Vladimir Platenik to usurp him by arriving in California for a hastily arranged trial.After only two weeks that trial was ended by Raducanu on the eve of her first-round victory in Miami - and a seat offered once again to O\u2019Donoghue and the broadcaster and coach Mark Petchey.How 'free spirit' Raducanu is thriving without coachPublished2 days agoSecond Serve: Your new weekly tennis briefingPublished3 days agoPetchey coached an 18-year-old Andy Murray for 10 months - during which he won his first ATP title - and trained with Raducanu during the pandemic summer of 2020.Those weeks at the National Tennis Centre in London appear to have left quite an impression on Raducanu. Sears still looks a good bet and has a proven track record of success with Daniela Hantuchova, Ana Ivanovic and Anett Kontaveit.He is no longer working with the Australian Olivia Gadecki, and is a regular at the National Tennis Centre in London, where he works with the LTA's women's team.For all her progress in Miami, Raducanu may have a difficult spring and summer without the right personnel around her.Does she ever throws a covetous glance at Draper's set-up?His team looks a thoroughly professional outfit, and some hard decisions have recently been made.Physio Will Herbert and strength and conditioning coach Steve Kotze are no longer involved. Platenik says Raducanu told him she was feeling \u201cstressed\u201d when ending the brief collaboration.Torben Beltz looked an excellent choice, given his Grand Slam success with Angelique Kerber, but Raducanu did not feel he had enough to offer.Dmitry Tursunov ended their partnership because he thought Raducanu needed to listen to just \"one voice\".",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nKildunne's hat-trick against Wales\n\"I haven't even scratched the surface of my potential.\"\nThose were the words of England full-back Ellie Kildunne in November when she was named World Rugby's women's player of the year.\nThe 25-year-old scored 14 tries in nine tests for the Red Roses last term, and it looked, on the outside, as though maintaining form before a home Rugby World Cup - which starts in August - was all she needed to do.\nBut Kildunne strived to become even better.\nAfter featuring late off the bench against Italy in York, a first start in this year's Women's Six Nations came in the 67-12 hammering of Wales at Principality Stadium in front of a record crowd of 21,186 for a Wales women's team event on home soil.\nThe Harlequin marked her 50th cap with a second-half hat-trick and a player-of-the-match performance to properly kick-start the biggest year of her rugby career to date.\n\"Pressure is definitely a privilege,\" Kildunne told BBC Two.\n\"Our potential is the unimaginable. We are going to keep getting better. I really think we are going to take it to levels that we've not been to before.\n\"We are just going to keep pushing until we get to a point that we just can't imagine what is next.\"\nTwo of Kildunne's tries were relatively straightforward dot downs, with the third an instinctive finish from a kick-through.\nWhen the whistle sounded for the start of the second half, Kildunne had no tries. By  the 56th minute, her hand was above her head for yet another signature lasso celebration after a third score.\nKildunne made the most carries (16) and metres (145m) in the game, but it was her kicking game which stood out.\nFrom tidy deft chip-kicks to cause havoc in the backfield to grubber-kicks to turn the Wales defence, Kildunne has widened her game to be more than just a lethal counter-attack runner.\n\"She is starting to serve the team in different ways and there are going to be times that teams take away the counter-attack from her,\" England head coach John Mitchell told BBC Two.\n\"She is world-class with that plan A [running it back], but she is going to have to adapt in 2025 as certain teams will not allow her to get ball.\n\"We have to use her in the right way.\"\nKildunne made her England debut in 2018 as an 18-year-old\nWomen's Six Nations: Wales 7-26 England - bonus point secured in 27 minutes\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast\nKildunne was one of 13 changes Mitchell made to his starting XV from England's opening round victory over Italy, with the majority of his front-line starters returning.\nLike last weekend, the Red Roses ran away with the contest, scoring their bonus-point try inside 27 minutes.\nNumber eight Maddie Feaunati was named player of the match in York and further pressed her case to continue in the back row with two powerful finishes.\nWales-born Meg Jones scored the pick of England's 11 tries when she slalomed her way through her native country, showing incredible balance and footwork.\nJones, who was playing her first Red Roses match since both her parents passed away, pointed to the sky and tapped her chest before diving over the line.\n\"I haven't played here since I was 12 years old,\" Jones, 28, told BBC Two.\n\"When I heard both the anthems it took me a little bit. I have just tried to enjoy it as much as I can, I know they will both be so proud of me.\n\"I said in the week that they will still be in the crowd.

        "article_text": "People will be far more open-minded than you realise if you adopt these simple conversational techniques.\n\"The growth of knowledge depends entirely upon disagreement,\" claimed the philosopher Karl Popper. He was writing about the dangers of dogma in science \u2013 but his words could equally apply to anyone's worldview. And if you want a disagreement to end by changing someone's mind, you have to do it in the right way.\nAs I found in my recent book on social connection, new psychological research can help us to have more constructive conversations about controversial issues.\u00a0\nSome of the strategies surprised me. While some social media users are keen to remind us that \"facts don't care about your feelings\", studies suggest that people are considerably more likely to listen to our arguments if we talk about our personal experiences of the issues under discussion.\nOne of the main drivers of serious disagreement was apparent in the recent Friendship Study, which comprised a questionnaire I devised with psychologist Ian MacRae, offered to BBC.com readers in July and August of last year.\nIn one section, participants were asked to imagine a discussion with someone who disagreed with them about certain political or social issues. Afterwards, each participant was asked about their intentions \u2013 whether they aimed to persuade the other person, learn from them, or argue with them \u2013 and also their impression of the other person's intentions. Overall, the 1,912 participants overestimated how much other people wanted to persuade them of their point of view, and how much they were looking for an argument. At the same time, they underestimated how much the other person wanted to learn and understand the different opinions.\nThis is worth remembering whenever we find ourselves in a conflict: the other person may be more open to a good-faith discussion than we think, and we should treat them with the respect that entails.\nGiven that our conversation partner might underestimate our curiosity about their views, we should also make more effort to express our interest in their views. By demonstrating our good intentions to learn and understand, we will encourage them to lower their defences so that they are more open to an honest exchange of ideas.\nOften it is as simple as asking the right question. In the late 2000s, Frances Chen and colleagues at Stanford University invited students to engage in an online debate about whether the university should introduce a new set of exams. Unsurprisingly, many students were dead set against the idea. Crucially, they thought they were chatting to their peers, but their debating partners were really the experimenters themselves \u2013 who followed very rigid scripts that varied depending on whether the participant was in the experimental group or the control group.\nIn half of the conversations, the experimenters asked the students to elaborate on their views. For example, they might listen to a student's argument and respond: \"I was interested in what you're saying. Can you tell me more about how come you think that?\" For the other trials, the conversation did not include any request for more information on the participants' beliefs.\nIt was a tiny change in the script, but the addition of the single question changed the whole tone of the debate by provoking a considerably more open-minded response from the participants. They were more willing to continue the conversation and to receive further information on the other person's arguments, for instance.\nWe might be a little sceptical of the results from a single experiment, but Guy Itzchakov at the University of Haifa in Israel and his colleagues came to very similar conclusions in a series of studies involving hundreds of participants. Actively asking questions about people's beliefs and the reasons they hold those views leads them to lower their defences, so that they are considerably more receptive to alternative opinions.\u00a0\nAfter these kinds of conversations, participants were considerably more likely to agree with statements such as \"I feel that I ought to re-evaluate the event now, after the conversation\" \u2013 suggesting that they had become more thoughtful about the issues that they had discussed.\nWhile exchanging opinions, you shouldn't be afraid of sharing your first-hand experience of the issue at hand; indeed, it may just strengthen your argument.\nThis fact does not seem to be widely recognised. When Emily Kubin at the University of North Carolina and colleagues asked 251 participants to describe the best ways to present their opinion on an issue such as same-sex marriage or abortion, 56% chose the presentation of facts and evidence, while just 21% selected the expression of personal experience.\u00a0 \u00a0\nWe saw similar patterns within our Friendship Study. When we asked people to rate seven persuasion strategies, \"civility\" was number one, followed by \"logic and reason\". \"Personal experience\" came in at number five.\nKubin's experiments, however, suggest that it can be a potent tool of persuasion. Her team asked 177 participants to read about three people's opinions on topics like taxation, coal mining or gun control, before rating their respect for each person, and that person's rationality. No matter what their initial stance, the participants gave considerably higher ratings if they knew that the person had personal experience of the issue at hand.\nReading short texts online may seem a far cry from real-life encounters, but Kubin has also tested the principle in face-to-face dialogues on gun control, using a further sample of 153 local people who lived near the university. Once again, someone using a personal experience to portray their views commanded more respect from their conversation partner and was perceived to be more rational in their views.\nThere are, of course, good reasons to be wary of purely subjective accounts if they are not accompanied by any statistics, and an overreliance on an emotional appeal could raise the other person's suspicions. But the two approaches do not have to be mutually exclusive, and your point of view may be better received if you combine the two.\nConsider a recent examination of the 2018 midterm elections demonstrated. The study measured the progress of 230 canvassers, conversing on a range of political issues with 6,869 voters across seven US locations. Some were asked to make their case using purely statistical arguments \u2013 concerning, for instance, the common fear that immigration increases crime \u2013 while others were asked to exchange personal stories, in addition to presenting factual evidence.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Friendship in divided times: People don't want to argue with you as much as you think\n\u2022\u00a0Why do I feel so lonely even though I'm surrounded by people?\n\u2022\u00a0Seven ways to improve your sleep according to science\nEach of the voters took opinion polls before and after they met the canvassers. The researchers found that the mutually respectful exchange of experiences was more likely to shift opinion than conversations that focused more on impersonal facts and statistics.\nWhile the overall effects were small \u2013 resulting in a five-percentage-point shift in views on immigration, for example \u2013 this should be taken in context. On average, the conversations lasted just 11 minutes in total, yet a significant number of people started to change strongly held views.\u00a0\nThroughout your conversations, you should make sure that you maintain a basic level of civility \u2013 not only to your discussion partner, but also when you are talking about anyone else who may be involved in the debate, including public figures.\u00a0\nResearch by Jeremy Frimer at the University of Winnipeg and Linda Skitka at the University of Illinois at Chicago has shown that rude behaviour is far more likely to alienate the person you wish to persuade than change their opinion, and it may even disaffect people who were already coming around to your point of view. They describe this as the Montagu Principle, named after the 18th-Century English aristocrat Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who declared that \"civility costs nothing and buys everything\".\nBy demonstrating genuine curiosity, sharing your personal experiences, and maintaining a civil attitude, you may be surprised by your potential to connect \u2013 and gain a wiser worldview in the process.\n* David Robson is an award-winning science writer and author.

While some social media users are keen to remind us that \"facts don't care about your feelings\", studies suggest that people are considerably more likely to listen to our arguments if we talk about our personal experiences of the issues under discussion.Be curiousOne of the main drivers of serious disagreement was apparent in the recent Friendship Study, which comprised a questionnaire I devised with psychologist Ian MacRae, offered to BBC.com readers in July and August of last year.In one section, participants were asked to imagine a discussion with someone who disagreed with them about certain political or social issues. No matter what their initial stance, the participants gave considerably higher ratings if they knew that the person had personal experience of the issue at hand.Reading short texts online may seem a far cry from real-life encounters, but Kubin has also tested the principle in face-to-face dialogues on gun control, using a further sample of 153 local people who lived near the university.

        "article_text": "The daring, radical Pompidou Centre was derided by many when its design was first unveiled \u2013 yet it has continued to influence the architecture of public buildings ever since. As the building approaches a major renovation, its co-creator Renzo Piano recalls the furore.\nThis summer, the Centre Pompidou will close for five years, as Paris's popular polychrome landmark undergoes changes necessitated by current requirements in terms of health, safety and energy efficiency. French studio Moreau Kusunoki Architects, Mexican practice Frida Escobedo Studio and French engineer AIA Life Designers will undertake a major overhaul of the six-storey arts centre, containing Europe's largest museum of modern art. Its renovation will add usable floor space, remove asbestos from all facades, improve fire safety and accessibility for people with reduced mobility, and optimise energy efficiency.\nAs far as possible, the original building will be conserved as it was before. To do otherwise might be considered cultural sacrilege \u2013 after all the Pompidou's identity is indivisible from its original architects, Renzo Piano, and the late Richard Rogers. The duo set up their practice, Rogers + Piano, in 1970, and submitted a design to a prestigious competition instigated in 1971 by Georges Pompidou, France\u2019s President from 1969 until 1974. Its jury was headed up by Jean Prouv\u00e9, a metalworker and self-taught architect, and included such stellar architects as Philip Johnson and Oscar Niemeyer. Piano and Rogers' design was chosen from 681 competition entries.\nThe result caught the duo, then unknowns in their 30s \"with Beatles haircuts\", as Piano puts it, by surprise: \"We didn't think we'd win, we entered the competition for pleasure,\" the Italian architect, now 87, tells the BBC. \"We never planned to create a revolutionary building. Our idea was a museum that would inspire curiosity, not intimidate people, and that would open up culture to all.\"\nIn fact, the duo's insouciance may help to explain the building's uninhibited boldness, flamboyance and ludic quality. Its structural elements and services were placed on its facades, allowing it to maximise its internal, open-plan spaces \u2013 and prompting the futuristic structure to be dubbed the world\u2019s first \"inside-out\" building. Its exoskeleton of tubes and periscope-like pipes were playfully colour-coded: blue for air-conditioning, yellow for electricity, green for water and red for pedestrian circulation. Visitors streamed up escalators \u2013 encased in transparent tubing affording panoramic views \u2013 that were designed to reinforce the museum's connection to the city.\n\"Our idea was for the building to take up only half the site, allowing for a welcoming outdoor place \u2013 a piazza \u2013 where people could meet,\" says Piano, whose other projects include the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco (rebuilt in 2008), the Shard (2012) in London, and the recently completed Paddington Square, also in the UK capital, a mixed-use building and public square. \"Our credo was a place for all people \u2013 for the poor and rich, the young and old.\"\nCulture Shifters\nCulture Shifters is an interview series in which high-profile creatives reflect on a work of theirs which made a big impact on the world. Read more articles from the series\u00a0here.\nThe Pompidou's transparency, accessibility and adjacent piazza chimed with new ideas about democratising culture. \"Street theatre and concerts in public spaces were rising in popularity at the time,\" says Piano.\nInside the building, visitors had access to the Biblioth\u00e8que Publique d'Information \u2013 Paris's first free public library \u2013 the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne and the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/ Musique (IRCAM), dedicated to research of music and sound.\u00a0\nPiano and Rogers' winning entry provoked consternation and fury when it was announced at a press conference: \"The room was packed,\" remembers Piano. \"Richard and I were standing in the middle of the room being heckled. We felt elated yet terrible at the same time,\" says the architect. \"Some people were shouting, 'Why have you designed something so horrible?' 'Why are you are destroying Paris's historic centre?'\"\nAlthough surprised to have won the contest, Genoa-born Piano grew up feeling architecture was his destiny \u2013 aged 18, he told his father he wanted to be an architect. However in conversation his manner is humble, not entitled. Born into a family of builders in Genoa, he loved watching his father's work take shape. Perhaps his childhood experience of seeing buildings materialise successfully made him feel that architecture is open to all possibilities. \"Building is a beautiful gesture,\" he once told The Financial Times. \"It's the opposite of destruction\u2026 especially when you are creating buildings for people because they are civically important.\"\u00a0In 1981, Piano founded the Renzo Piano Building Workshop (RPBW), with offices in Genoa and Paris, led today by 11 partners (in the spirit of a collective). In 1998, he won the Pritzker Architecture Prize. \u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The swinging 60s icon who revolutionised style\n\u2022 The star tidying guru who transformed our homes\n\u2022 How to transform your home with art\nThe Plateau Beaubourg in central Paris \u2013 a stretch of wasteland occupied by a car park \u2013 was the site chosen for the new Mus\u00e9e Nationale d'Art Moderne (formerly housed in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris's haut-bourgeois 16th arrondissement). \"It was a place waiting for something to happen,\" says Piano.\nFrance's social and political climate at the time, still rebellious following the tumultuous events of May 1968, was conducive to the creation of a building as disruptive as the Centre Pompidou, acknowledges Piano: \"In Britain, society was being revolutionised by [designer] Mary Quant and the Beatles. The same was happening in Paris.\" The Centre Pompidou was partly inspired by the ultra-pop architecture of experimental London-based architecture collective Archigram.\n\"The idea that France should have a 'Maison de la Culture', bringing together art, cinema, music and literature in cities was first invented by Andr\u00e9 Malraux [novelist, art theorist and France's first Minister of Cultural Affairs].\u00a0Pompidou was very supportive, too. I really believe that major shifts in architecture are only possible if you have a good client. George's wife, Claude, too, was an excellent lady.\"\nPompidou, like Claude, was passionate about contemporary art and design.\u00a0In 1972, they invited Pierre Paulin, a designer known for his space-age era furniture, to create new interiors for the private apartment of the Elys\u00e9e Palace, the French presidents' official residence. The results were radically modern \u2013\u00a0the walls of the living room, dining room and smoking room were lined to cocooning effect with wool and polyester panels that obscured the residence's neo-classical splendour. Walls were hung with paintings by Robert Delaunay and other modernist artists.\nOne impetus behind these efforts to provide Paris with a prestigious museum was that France had lost its reputation as the world's pre-eminent centre of avant-garde art. \"It is my passionate wish for Paris to have a cultural centre like the ones they've been creating in the US,\" Pompidou told Le Monde newspaper in 1972. \"It will be both a museum and centre of creation, where the visual arts take up residence with music, film, books and audiovisual research.\"\nInitially, reactions to the Centre Pompidou, frequently compared to an alien spaceship, were often extremely negative. \"Taxi drivers used to say to me: 'Regardez!' before launching into a tirade against the building. With so much hostility, I had to keep a low profile among strangers,\" says Piano. The building, derisively likened by many to an \"oil refinery\", was the target of countless lawsuits. \"We were sued so often \u2013 once on the grounds that Prouv\u00e9 wasn't a qualified architect,\" he recalls. The French press initially lambasted the building. \"Paris has its own monster, just like the one in Loch Ness,\" scoffed Le Figaro.\n\"One day Richard and I were outside the building, as yet unfinished. We saw a woman struggling with an umbrella that had turned inside out in the wind and Richard rushed over to help fix it. When he mentioned that he was one of the building's architects, she jokily mimicked hitting him with the umbrella as if to suggest he was a naughty scoundrel.\"\nYet after the building's opening in 1977, Parisians soon began to appreciate the museum \u2013 now one of Paris's most visited public institutions, that ranks behind only the Louvre and Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in terms of visitor numbers.\nIt also inspires architects today. \"The Centre Pompidou, radical on completion, has continued to influence the design of public buildings ever since,\" says Hugh Broughton, founder of London-based Hugh Broughton Architects, who finds qualities in it other than its famously high-tech idiom. \"It's an amazingly brave, generous building whose large public space promotes congregation, street theatre and the highest quality people-watching. Its core concept \u2013 open-plan floor plates supported by peripheral structure and services \u2013 draws upon medieval principles of castle structures, and combines this with an Arts and Crafts approach that makes a virtue of construction as an aesthetic medium. The result is a building which is dynamic, inviting, egalitarian, transparent and has awesome views \u2013 all the best attributes of great architecture. It changed the way a whole generation of architects think about buildings \u2013 placing their users at centre stage.\"\nPiano is also known for harnessing light in his projects to ethereal effect, as is the case with the Shard, which can seem to disappear in certain light conditions due to its glass skin. Architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff has said of his works as a whole: \"The serenity of Renzo Piano's best buildings can almost make you believe we live in a civilised world.\"\u00a0\nFor Piano, what is the main architectural legacy of the Pompidou Centre? \"The building is proof that culture doesn't suffer from being more public. It's a place where people gather primarily. It brings together art, life and culture \u2013 not culture with a big C but culture with a small c. When it opened, it brought culture to all, and made the city a better place for it.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The WSL season ends on 10 May\nWith just five games of the Women's Super League season remaining, Chelsea are in the driving seat for a sixth successive title.\nThe Blues, looking to win their first league title under Sonia Bompastor, find themselves eight points clear at the top.\nAt the other end of the table, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa are locked in an intense relegation fight.\nMeanwhile, Manchester City face an uphill battle to claim the final Champions League spot.\nHow are things shaping up for the remaining games? Who has the tougher run-in? What do the pundits and managers think?\nThere have been no signs of teething problems for Chelsea this season under new boss Bompastor, and the Blues' dominance of the league - established under predecessor Emma Hayes - has continued.\nUnbeaten in the WSL this season, Chelsea have won 47 points from a possible 51 and they are eight clear of closest challengers Arsenal and Manchester United.\nWith a maximum 15 points available from the remaining five games, the highest Arsenal and United could finish with is 54 points.\nThat means Chelsea could win the league, at the earliest, on 27 April when they take on United at Leigh Sports Village.\nThe Women's Champions League format is changing from 2025-26, with the number of teams earning direct qualification expanding from four teams to nine.\nThe winners of the WSL will directly qualify, along with the champions from the other five top-ranked national associations.\nThe runners-up of the two top-ranked associations will also be guaranteed direct qualification, along with the previous season's winners.\nThe WSL is currently ranked second, external, so as it stands the top two teams will automatically enter the 18-team league format, with the team in third going into the qualifying rounds.\nManchester City, who challenged Chelsea until the final day last season, are all-but out of the title race, while their chances of European football next season are hanging by a thread.\nThey sit seven points behind rivals United in third. Eight points from the remaining five games would be enough for United to pip their city rivals to European qualification.\nAfter winning the Championship last season, Crystal Palace have struggled to adapt during their first season in England's top division.\nThe club looked destined to go straight back down, but a 3-1 win over fellow strugglers Villa earlier this month has given Leif Smerud's side a fighting chance.\nVilla, billed to break into the top four just 18 months ago, have struggled since Carla Ward's departure and they sit one point above Palace in the danger zone.\n\"At the moment it's a concentration thing, it's mentality, it's fight. I don't even think it's about performance at the moment - it's about who wants to stay in the league the most,\" former Lionesses striker Ellen White said.\n\"You don't want to see anybody get relegated but this is just going to be phenomenal to watch these last five games.\"\nLeicester, meanwhile, will need to be cautious for the remainder of the season, but they will hope their six-point cushion is enough to see them through and need 10 points from their remaining five games to secure safety.\nMarc Skinner's Manchester United face three of the top four teams as they look to pile pressure on Chelsea and keep their Champions League place.\nThe Manchester derby on the penultimate day of the season could prove key in the race for Europe.\nThe fixture list has given City interim boss Nick Cushing cause for optimism.\n\"As the coach you have to analyse where we can potentially make up that ground,\" he said. \"It starts with us having to win. We have to be in distance with those [final] three games.\n\"We know the finish Manchester United have so there is an opportunity, in my opinion. Marc is doing an incredible job, but if we are in distance, we have to play them as well, there is an opportunity there.\"\nIt's a tough run-in for bottom-placed Crystal Palace, who will meet Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City before the season is over.\nVilla, meanwhile, only face one top-four side in their five remaining games, while they will have the added bonus of a home crowd for their last game at Villa Park.\nFormer Arsenal and Manchester City defender Jen Beattie said she is \"more worried\" for Palace than Villa.\n\"Based on who they're about to play, they're about to play the top teams higher up, whereas Aston Villa, I think they can get more out of their results,\" Beattie said.\nHowever, Palace manager Leif Smerud is confident his side can turn things around, despite a difficult fixture list.\n\"This is not a defeated group.

        "summary": "What do the pundits and managers think?How do things stand at the top?There have been no signs of teething problems for Chelsea this season under new boss Bompastor, and the Blues' dominance of the league - established under predecessor Emma Hayes - has continued.Unbeaten in the WSL this season, Chelsea have won 47 points from a possible 51 and they are eight clear of closest challengers Arsenal and Manchester United.With a maximum 15 points available from the remaining five games, the highest Arsenal and United could finish with is 54 points.That means Chelsea could win the league, at the earliest, on 27 April when they take on United at Leigh Sports Village.What about the race for Champions League?The Women's Champions League format is changing from 2025-26, with the number of teams earning direct qualification expanding from four teams to nine.The winners of the WSL will directly qualify, along with the champions from the other five top-ranked national associations.The runners-up of the two top-ranked associations will also be guaranteed direct qualification, along with the previous season's winners.The WSL is currently ranked second, external, so as it stands the top two teams will automatically enter the 18-team league format, with the team in third going into the qualifying rounds.Manchester City, who challenged Chelsea until the final day last season, are all-but out of the title race, while their chances of European football next season are hanging by a thread.They sit seven points behind rivals United in third. Relegation and the race for Europe - what's to play for in WSL?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The WSL season ends on 10 MayPublished6 hours agoWith just five games of the Women's Super League season remaining, Chelsea are in the driving seat for a sixth successive title.The Blues, looking to win their first league title under Sonia Bompastor, find themselves eight points clear at the top.At the other end of the table, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa are locked in an intense relegation fight.Meanwhile, Manchester City face an uphill battle to claim the final Champions League spot.How are things shaping up for the remaining games? \"Leicester, meanwhile, will need to be cautious for the remainder of the season, but they will hope their six-point cushion is enough to see them through and need 10 points from their remaining five games to secure safety.What are the remaining fixtures?Marc Skinner's Manchester United face three of the top four teams as they look to pile pressure on Chelsea and keep their Champions League place.The Manchester derby on the penultimate day of the season could prove key in the race for Europe.The fixture list has given City interim boss Nick Cushing cause for optimism. \"It's a tough run-in for bottom-placed Crystal Palace, who will meet Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City before the season is over.Villa, meanwhile, only face one top-four side in their five remaining games, while they will have the added bonus of a home crowd for their last game at Villa Park.Former Arsenal and Manchester City defender Jen Beattie said she is \"more worried\" for Palace than Villa. Eight points from the remaining five games would be enough for United to pip their city rivals to European qualification.Who is at risk of relegation?After winning the Championship last season, Crystal Palace have struggled to adapt during their first season in England's top division.The club looked destined to go straight back down, but a 3-1 win over fellow strugglers Villa earlier this month has given Leif Smerud's side a fighting chance.Villa, billed to break into the top four just 18 months ago, have struggled since Carla Ward's departure and they sit one point above Palace in the danger zone.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nKildunne's hat-trick against Wales\n\"I haven't even scratched the surface of my potential.\"\nThose were the words of England full-back Ellie Kildunne in November when she was named World Rugby's women's player of the year.\nThe 25-year-old scored 14 tries in nine tests for the Red Roses last term, and it looked, on the outside, as though maintaining form before a home Rugby World Cup - which starts in August - was all she needed to do.\nBut Kildunne strived to become even better.\nAfter featuring late off the bench against Italy in York, a first start in this year's Women's Six Nations came in the 67-12 hammering of Wales at Principality Stadium in front of a record crowd of 21,186 for a Wales women's team event on home soil.\nThe Harlequin marked her 50th cap with a second-half hat-trick and a player-of-the-match performance to properly kick-start the biggest year of her rugby career to date.\n\"Pressure is definitely a privilege,\" Kildunne told BBC Two.\n\"Our potential is the unimaginable. We are going to keep getting better. I really think we are going to take it to levels that we've not been to before.\n\"We are just going to keep pushing until we get to a point that we just can't imagine what is next.\"\nTwo of Kildunne's tries were relatively straightforward dot downs, with the third an instinctive finish from a kick-through.\nWhen the whistle sounded for the start of the second half, Kildunne had no tries. By  the 56th minute, her hand was above her head for yet another signature lasso celebration after a third score.\nKildunne made the most carries (16) and metres (145m) in the game, but it was her kicking game which stood out.\nFrom tidy deft chip-kicks to cause havoc in the backfield to grubber-kicks to turn the Wales defence, Kildunne has widened her game to be more than just a lethal counter-attack runner.\n\"She is starting to serve the team in different ways and there are going to be times that teams take away the counter-attack from her,\" England head coach John Mitchell told BBC Two.\n\"She is world-class with that plan A [running it back], but she is going to have to adapt in 2025 as certain teams will not allow her to get ball.\n\"We have to use her in the right way.\"\nWomen's Six Nations: England Thrash Wales\nWomen's Six Nations: Wales 7-26 England - bonus point secured in 27 minutes\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\nKildunne made her England debut in 2018 as an 18-year-old\nKildunne was one of 13 changes Mitchell made to his starting XV from England's opening round victory over Italy, with the majority of his front-line starters returning.\nLike last weekend, the Red Roses ran away with the contest, scoring their bonus-point try inside 27 minutes.\nNumber eight Maddie Feaunati was named player of the match in York and further pressed her case to continue in the back row with two powerful finishes.\nWales-born Meg Jones scored the pick of England's 11 tries when she slalomed her way through her native country, showing incredible balance and footwork.\nJones, who was playing her first Red Roses match since both her parents passed away, pointed to the sky and tapped her chest before diving over the line.\n\"I haven't played here since I was 12 years old,\" Jones, 28, told BBC Two.\n\"When I heard both the anthems it took me a little bit. I have just tried to enjoy it as much as I can, I know they will both be so proud of me.\n\"I said in the week that they will still be in the crowd.

Atletico then bought him back in 2021 for just \u00a316.5m.\nSpain midfielder Rodri, now a Ballon d'Or winner, was signed for \u00a316.5m in 2018 and sold to Manchester City the following year for \u00a362.5m, while Slovenian goalkeeper Oblak signed from Benfica in 2014 for just \u00a313m. He's now widely regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the world.\nMore recently, forward Julian Alvarez joined from Manchester City last summer for \u00a381.5m and he has scored 23 goals for Atletico this season.\n\"He brought in key players like Griezmann (twice), Luis Suarez, Kieran Trippier, Llorente, De Paul, and Julian Alvarez,\" added Balague. \n\"But he also had some flops, like Joao Felix, Kalinic, Arias, Torreira, but he always worked within the club's financial limits.\n\"In total, he made 52 signings since 2017, spending around 828 million euros (\u00a3692m), leaving a big mark on Atletico's squad. An end of an era for them.\"\nBBC Sport's Arsenal reporter Alex Howell\nThere are a few immediate issues he has to deal with.\nThe main and most obvious task is to ensure that Arsenal bring in a much-needed forward. The Gunners have suffered key injuries to key attackers this season and have not brought in a forward for two transfer windows in a row.\nKai Havertz has done excellently in filling that void but at times Arsenal's need for a natural goalscorer has been obvious.\nRB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has long been monitored, while Newcastle forward Alexander Isak is also being linked with a move to north London.\nHowever, Eddie Howe's Magpies are in the mix for the Champions League places, making a deal for Isak expensive and more difficult to do.\nThere is also an argument that Arteta's side could do with a player who has some flair and the ability to make something happen when they play against teams that sit in a low block against them in the Premier League.\nIt's not only incomings that Berta will need to address. It's a big summer for the club with key players Bukayo Saka, William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes entering the last two years of their contracts.\nBerta will need to make sure that those players are locked down so that Arteta can continue to build on the impressive work he has done with the team.\nThere are also players who need to be moved on. Oleksandr Zinchenko has dropped further down the pecking order after the emergence of Myles Lewis-Skelly and the Gunners were willing to let him go in January if they received the right offer.\nIt is an exciting project for any sporting director to come into but with the Gunners challenging for silverware in recent seasons, this summer is not something that they can afford to get wrong.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "One of London's most prestigious classical music venues has pulled out of England's cultural subsidy scheme because of \"crippling\" red tape and a controversial strategy that is seen as failing to prioritise artistic excellence.\nWigmore Hall currently receives \u00a3344,000 of public money a year from Arts Council England, but will stop taking the funding from 2026.\nDirector John Gilhooly said: \"The current policy is just too onerous, and they seem to have no interest in what's happening on the stage, [or] in the great artists of the world.\"\nThe Arts Council said recipients of funding should be \"prepared to show how they will offer the public excellent value\", and that it is \"absolutely committed to creative excellence\".\nMr Gilhooly said the venue does not \"fully believe in everything\" in the Arts Council's current strategy.\nTitled Let's Create, the plan is billed by the Arts Council as widening access to culture and cultural funding, but is seen by many as supporting grassroots and community work over artists who are at the top of their fields.\nMr Gilhooly said the musicians who perform at Wigmore Hall are the artistic equivalent of Olympic champions.\n\"We also work with a community choir. In my view, both are excellent, both are outstanding things,\" he told BBC News.\n\"But you can't judge a community choir on the same criteria that you judge the world's greatest artists, just like you can't judge the English football team against an amateur team.\n\"That is where we see the pressure and the tension.\"\n\nMr Gilhooly said the venue would not stop doing outreach work.\n\"And the bits we do best, we'll probably do more of. For instance, we work with people living with dementia. We work with some of the most marginalised people in society. Most of that will continue.

        "article_text": "What will it take for India's private companies to begin investing in building new factories and firms?\nIt's a question that's confounded policymakers for years. As a share of gross domestic product (GDP), private investment in India has been on the decline since the global financial crisis of 2007, even while the overall economy clocked world-beating growth rates.\nAfter a long hiatus, the investment rate picked up slightly in 2022 and 2023, but latest data from a leading ratings agency shows private sector expenditure as part of the overall investments in India's economy dipped again to a decadal low of 33% this financial year.\nAnalysis from Icra of 4,500 listed companies and 8,000 unlisted companies reveals that while the pace of investments made by listed players moderated, those by unlisted entities actually contracted.\nOver the years, several economists have raised similar concerns about a slowdown in private investments. \nBanking tycoon Uday Kotak is among many who've raised concerns recently about India's fading \"animal spirits\", urging young business owners who had inherited companies to build new businesses rather than sitting tight and managing their existing wealth.\nData from investment advisory firm Value Research shows Indian non-financial businesses were sitting on cash worth 11% of their total assets, corroborating the view that companies are not spending money in making fresh investments. \nSo why are Indian corporate houses choosing to do that?\nWeak domestic consumption in urban areas, muted export demand and an influx of cheap Chinese imports in some sectors were among the factors that \"restricted the capacity expansion plans of Indian corporate houses\", Icra's Chief Rating Officer K Ravichandran said in a note.\nBut beyond the more immediate reasons, private investment impulse has been low because of \"global uncertainties and overcapacity\", India's economic survey pointed out earlier this year.\nSlowing private investments have a direct bearing on India's growth prospects.\nInvestments by companies in assets such as factories, machinery or construction \u2013 also called gross fixed capital formation \u2013 make up around 30% of GDP and are its second largest contributor following private consumption.\nIndia's full-year GDP is expected to close at 6.5%, sharply lower compared to last year's 9.2%. Growth has flagged on account of slower consumption.\nWith all the key levers of growth, including exports, slowing down and US President Donald Trump's tariffs exacerbating global uncertainties, kick-starting private investment will be fundamental for India to hit its long-term growth targets, experts say.\nAccording to the World Bank's latest estimates, India will need to grow by 7.8% on average over the next 22 years to achieve its high-income status ambition by 2047.\nKey to this would be to increase private and public investment to at least 40% of GDP from 33% currently, the bank estimates.\nThe government on its part has significantly increased spending, especially on infrastructure. It also cut corporate tax rates from 30% to 22% and doled out billions of dollars in production-linked subsidies to manufacturers over the years. Availability of bank credit isn't a constraint any longer, and regulation has eased with regulatory restrictions halving between 2003 and 2020.\nBut none of this has prodded corporate India to boost spending.\nAccording to Sajjid Chinoy, JP Morgan India's Chief Economist, the big problem is the lack of demand in the economy to justify putting up additional capacities.\nIndia's post-pandemic recovery has been uneven, with the consumer class not expanding quickly enough. Demand for goods and services has thus been hit, with spending capacity further curtailed by a fall in wages, even though corporate profitability has soared to a 15-year high this year.\n\"Just because companies are financially strong doesn't mean they will automatically invest. Companies will only invest if they expect good returns,\" Chinoy said at an event in Mumbai earlier this year.\nRathin Roy, a former member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC), points to other deeper structural issues arresting investment appetite.\n\"Entrepreneurs have been lacking the energy to produce goods that might generate new demand. A classic example of this is construction - where there's unsold inventory in the urban areas, but an incapacity among builders to go into tier two and tier three towns and tap newer markets,\" Roy told the BBC.\nHe said he also agreed with Mr Kotak's views on the growing trend of business heirs turning wealth managers rather than building businesses ground up.\n\"Business houses discovered during Covid-19 that they don't need to do business to make money. They can just invest and multiply it without building anything new,\" said Roy. And these investments aren't just happening in the domestic stock market. \"A lot of money is just flowing out of India and chasing returns elsewhere,\" he added.\nBut things could be turning a corner, according to Icra.\nInterest rate cuts as well as a $12bn income tax relief provided to individuals in the federal budget \"augurs well for supporting domestic consumption demand\", according to the report.\nIndia's central bank also says more private companies have shown an intention to invest this year compared to last year, although how much of that intent results into actual money deployed remains to be seen. \nThe uncertainties related to global trade tariffs could delay any anticipated investment pick-up, according to Icra.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "We have all heard of carmaker Ford, but what about its one-time rivals Abbot-Detroit, Acme, Adams and Aerocar?\nNo? Well that is hardly surprising because unlike Ford they all went bust very early on. And they are just some of the failed car companies starting with the letter \"A\".\nWe only remember the winners who went on to dominate the world's motor industry, and the current high-tech sector is much the same.\nA great many investors backed the wrong horseless carriages around a century ago and lost their money. Only a few picked Ford or Chrysler, which is almost exactly what is happening now, only to the tech sector.\nTech shares have been hugely volatile over the past year, as has been widely reported, with share price graphs often looking like rollercoaster rides, even before President Trump's tariffs have caused wider stocks falls.\nA principle reason for this tech sector volatility, according to Elroy Dimson, professor of finance at the University of Cambridge, is that like the once nascent car industry we don't know which tech firms will win in the long run.\n\"If you go back to the beginning of the last century there were an awful lot of motor companies, and it was clear that automobiles were going to make a huge difference,\" says Prof Dimson. \"But almost every company went bankrupt, you didn't know which company you should be buying.\"\nThen, of course, not all high-tech businesses are making money. The measure of the return on an investment in shares uses two factors, the growth in profits or dividends, and the growth in the value of the shares.\nBoring companies might pay reliable dividends and see their shares gradually increase in value. But many high-tech companies are not paying out much if anything in dividends. Instead, they are investing in future growth, and so their share prices fluctuate based on hopes of future profits.\nAs Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at UK financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, puts it: \"Tech shares are more volatile, they have high valuations and their price-earnings ratios are very high, and growth stocks are more sensitive to interest rate movements.\"\nBut also, investors in such shares are, as Ms Streeter puts it, gambling on \"not jam today but jam tomorrow\". They are all trying to pick the next future big winner, not the one paying out profits now, but the one that will eventually pay huge dividends sometime in the future.\nSo, any news or even suggestion that future growth is not going to be as good as previously expected means share values can collapse.\nOn the other hand, any good news boosts share prices even if current profits, or even losses, don't change at all, as investors pile into what they think is the future winner. The shares are more volatile because they are not underwritten by current profits or dividends.\nThat means as Prof Dimson puts it, \"that small changes in growth expectation can lead to large changes in share value\", which can effect a large number of companies at the same time.\n\"You have companies that are reasonably similar, so when growth rates change it is effecting quite a few companies in a similar way,\" he says.\n\"This is not different from the dotcom boom at the beginning of the 2000s. There were companies with huge growth prospects. And when the growth prospects disappeared, these were the companies that disappeared.\"\nAlso, even today there are not that many really large high-tech companies. In America they are colloquially known as the \"magnificent seven\" - Nvidia, a chipmaker, Alphabet, which owns Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, the parent of Facebook, and Tesla.\nSo, it does not take much to spook the market, especially since several of these firms are really quite young, and are dominant in sectors where previous leaders have crashed and burned. Anyone remember Ericsson, Boo or Compaq?\nTechnology, unlike say steel production or food manufacturing, is changing at a very rapid rate, and there is obviously the chance that a new high-tech company will come along and destroy the business model of its most established rivals.\nThere is simply no guarantee that today's \"magnificent seven\" will remain magnificent or even stay as the same seven firms.\nTake Tesla for example, its sales have recently fallen in response to two widely-reported factors. Firstly, some potential customers are opposed to Tesla owner Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's government. And secondly, Chinese electric car firms such as BYD are increasingly strong competitors.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia saw its share price drop sharply at the start of this year following the release of Chinese artificial intelligence chatbot DeepSeek.  This app was reportedly created at a fraction of the cost of its rivals.\nThe instant popularity of DeepSeek has raised questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning. This concerns Nvidia because it is at the forefront of making microchips for AI processing.\nAI is now the biggest tech game in town, and it seems that absolutely everyone is claiming that AI is transforming their industry, their products and their profits. They can't all be right.\nOr as Prof Dimon puts it: \"At least in 1910 you knew what automobiles did, but today with AI companies you have to rely on the wisdom of the crowd, and for AI companies that isn't good enough.\"\nAnd not all AI firms can win, adds Robert Whaley, professor of finance at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. \"AI is certainly contributing to tech volatility. The race is on.\"\nThat means that AI shares are sensitive to predictions. And any sign that a particular firm is lagging in the AI race may mean that lots of investors, most of whom don't understand the subject, abandon it for another that seems to be further ahead.\nThen there are investors who seemingly don't seem to care which companies' shares they buy, so long as they are in the \"booming\" high-tech sector, as they are speculating and spreading their risks.\nIn short, share prices are not always a rational measure of a firm's value, especially in the high-tech sector, or even of its prospects. Instead, they can represent the optimism of investors. And optimism does not always last.\nIt is often short-lived, passing, and faddish. And sometimes optimism comes face to face with reality or just plain fades away. It is, in short, volatile.",

        "article_text": "F1 cars, such as Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari, use 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrid engines\nChristian Horner's phone rang. It was Bernie Ecclestone. Red Bull's team principal picked up, switched to speakerphone and placed it on the table in front of the assembled Formula 1 bosses.\nWe're in the F1 Commission, Horner told Ecclestone. Is there anything you want to say to the room?\nF1's former impresario, addressing the group that decides the sport's rules, said they should go back to V10 engines. Then he hung up.\nThat phone call - described to BBC Sport by several sources in the room at the time - took place in the morning of the day of F1's season launch at the O2 Arena in London in February, where both Horner and governing body the FIA were booed by the 15,000-strong crowd.\nTwo days later, FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem - a man whose three-year tenure has been beset by controversy - posted a message on Instagram.\nBen Sulayem said he \"looked forward\" to the new chassis and engine rules that are  to be introduced in 2026, but that the FIA \"must also lead the way on future technological motorsport trends.\n\"We should consider a range of directions, including the roaring sound of the V10 running on sustainable fuel.\"\nThese developments have kick-started a debate inside F1 about engines. The ground is shifting fast, so what's going on?\nNext year, F1 is going through the biggest regulation change in the sport's history, introducing new rules for both cars and engines.\nOn engines, F1 is sticking with 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids, the basic architecture that has been in place since 2014, but changing the balance between electric and combustion power.\nThe amount of total power provided by the hybrid is going up to about 50% from about 20% now. In addition, F1 is introducing sustainable fuels - abandoning fossil fuels in favour of synthetic fuel created from biomass and industrial processes.\nThis is all part of the sport's pledge to become net-zero carbon by 2030.\nThis video can not be played\nF1 in 10 Years: Lando Norris\nEver since hybrid engines were introduced in 2014, some have bemoaned the loss of the louder, more dramatic sound produced by the naturally aspirated engines that preceded them - especially the 3.0-litre V10s last raced in F1 in 2005.\nIn an unavoidable parallel with Ben Sulayem's actions now, Ecclestone was the first person to bring this up, even before the 2014 engines first raced.\nA certain romanticism about the V10 sound has sustained, as has the idea that those engines - with their ear-splitting shriek that could be heard some distance from the track - are more popular with the fanbase than the current hybrids.\nWithin F1, there is no question that some people agree. Lewis Hamilton said at the Chinese Grand Prix last weekend: \"It is no secret that the V6 has never sounded great.\n\"I remember the first time I came to an F1 race in 1996 in Spa and arriving and Michael (Schumacher) coming through Turn One and my rib cage just vibrated. I was so hooked. It was the most amazing thing I felt and heard.\n\"Over the years we've lost that. If we are able to move back to those amazing sounding engines and still able to see the sustainable goals, why not?\"\nFernando Alonso took his 2005 title-winning Renault R25 - with V10 engine - for a demonstration run on track before the 2020 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix\nIt's not that long since Ben Sulayem was trumpeting his involvement in the introduction of the 2026 engine rules.\nThese were fundamentally settled under the previous FIA president Jean Todt, but there was inevitable wrangling and it got over the line only after Ben Sulayem took office.\nTwo years ago, he said the new engines were \"at the forefront of technological innovation, making the future of F1 more sustainable while maintaining the spectacular racing\".\nSo why the U-turn?\nBen Sulayem has asked his F1 single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis to look into the matter.\nTombazis said that the advent of\u00a0sustainable fuels could allow F1 to make the engines simpler and cheaper.\n\"That's why the president made the comments about V10 engines in '28 - or '29 or whatever - and so on,\" Tombazis said. \"And that is something we are evaluating with the manufacturers.\"\nSenior figures within F1 and the car manufacturers involved in the sport see many problems with the FIA's position.\nOn a macro level, the climate crisis is very real, and the global road-car industry is heading in the direction of electrification - even if Donald Trump's election at the head of a government of climate deniers has given pause for thought in the US.\nManufacturers take part in F1 fundamentally for marketing reasons, and the sport has been made more appealing by the introduction of a budget cap for cars and engines.\nAudi, Ford and General Motors are all entering F1 in 2026 - and Honda are staying rather than withdrawing - specifically because of the new engine rules.\nAudi has already released a statement in response to the latest developments, saying that the new rules \"were a key factor in Audi's decision to enter Formula 1\".\nMercedes says it is open to discussions but would need a hybrid element to be part of any new engine formula for it to remain interested.\nThen there is the micro level.\nWhy a V10? No major road-car manufacturer uses them any more.\nMercedes says a V8 would make more sense if a change was to be made, as at least they are still being developed for road use.\nAnd why abandon turbochargers, when many performance road cars - from Audi RS6s or Mercedes AMG C63s to McLaren and Ferrari hypercars - use them for very good reasons?\nCost? Yes, a V10 might be cheaper than a hybrid. But the manufacturers have already spent an estimated collective $400m on the new engines. They are not about to throw that away.\nAnd a new V10 would require developing, to the tune of hundreds of millions more.\nWeight? Yes, the hybrid engines make the cars heavier, largely because of the batteries needed. But the majority of the weight increase from 550kg or so in 2005 to about 800kg now is accounted for by advances in safety, such as the halo head-protection device.\nOn top of that, in 2013, cars started races with about 160kg of fuel. Now, it's about 100kg and it's expected to be about the same next year. Returning to naturally aspirated engines would mean a huge increase in fuel capacity - and weight.\nSustainability? The new fuels being introduced next year are not net-zero carbon. According to scientific standards, sustainable fuels reduce carbon emissions by a little above 80%.\nThat's a lot. But doubling the amount of fuel used by abandoning hybrid engines would mean a doubling of the carbon emissions produced by fuel.\nThe emissions from the cars themselves are minuscule in the big picture - F1's transport around the world is much more significant. Still, the symbolism matters.\nRed Bull boss Christian Horner and FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem are both said to be interested in a return to V10 engines\nIn F1, politics are always involved.\nIt has escaped the attention of few that Ben Sulayem's intervention came after the crowd at the O2 booed when the FIA logo was shown.\nThis is an election year at the FIA, and some believe Ben Sulayem may have raised the idea of V10s because he thinks it will be popular with certain demographics who support him.\nSo far, no candidate has put themselves forwards to oppose him, but there are whispers that there is a credible opponent in the wings.\nAt the same time, word is creeping out in F1 about the progress the various manufacturers are making with their 2026 engines. And it seems that Mercedes are leading the way.\nPeople are already beginning to say that a team will only win in 2026 if it has a Mercedes engine.\nOf course, there is no proof of this, but the whispers are emerging in exactly the same way as similar ones did in 2013 - and they were proved exactly right when the hybrid engines made their debut the following year.\nThe V10 proposal is seen by rival teams as very much a Horner-Ben Sulayem agenda, even if it is said to have some support from Ferrari.\nEven Horner, while saying that \"the concept of a V10 would be very exciting for the sport\" acknowledges that abandoning the rules would be \"a massive departure from what is being worked on very hard for 2026\".\nA U-turn for 2026 now would need support from the teams and manufacturers - and there is not a chance that enough of them would support that to get it through.\nA leading team boss told BBC Sport on condition of anonymity that there have been \"zero discussions\" of this idea in the group of F1 stakeholders.\nIt takes time - years - to agree engine rules.\nIt would probably be two years before a full agreement could be reached. Then the manufacturers would need the same time again to develop and build the engines. Which would take F1 to the end of 2029. Which is only a year before the new rules are due to expire anyway.\nAs one team boss puts it: \"I think this will all peter out, and it will just end up becoming: 'What will 2031 look like?'\"\nThe FIA says: \"There needs to be a consultation between all stakeholders to agree on a way forward, before we fully explore different scenarios.\n\"Whichever direction is chosen, we must support the teams and manufacturers in ensuring cost control on R&D expenditure and take account of environmental and sustainability considerations.\"\nAnd the chances of the end result being a naturally aspirated V10, in the context of all the above?

        "article_text": "What will it take for India's private companies to begin investing in building new factories and firms?\nIt's a question that's confounded policymakers for years. As a share of gross domestic product (GDP), private investment in India has been on the decline since the global financial crisis of 2007, even while the overall economy clocked world-beating growth rates.\nAfter a long hiatus, the investment rate picked up slightly in 2022 and 2023, but latest data from a leading ratings agency shows private sector expenditure as part of the overall investments in India's economy dipped again to a decadal low of 33% this financial year.\nAnalysis from Icra of 4,500 listed companies and 8,000 unlisted companies reveals that while the pace of investments made by listed players moderated, those by unlisted entities actually contracted.\nOver the years, several economists have raised similar concerns about a slowdown in private investments. \nBanking tycoon Uday Kotak is among many who've raised concerns recently about India's fading \"animal spirits\", urging young business owners who had inherited companies to build new businesses rather than sitting tight and managing their existing wealth.\nData from investment advisory firm Value Research shows Indian non-financial businesses were sitting on cash worth 11% of their total assets, corroborating the view that companies are not spending money in making fresh investments. \nSo why are Indian corporate houses choosing to do that?\nWeak domestic consumption in urban areas, muted export demand and an influx of cheap Chinese imports in some sectors were among the factors that \"restricted the capacity expansion plans of Indian corporate houses\", Icra's Chief Rating Officer K Ravichandran said in a note.\nBut beyond the more immediate reasons, private investment impulse has been low because of \"global uncertainties and overcapacity\", India's economic survey pointed out earlier this year.\nSlowing private investments have a direct bearing on India's growth prospects.\nInvestments by companies in assets such as factories, machinery or construction \u2013 also called gross fixed capital formation \u2013 make up around 30% of GDP and are its second largest contributor following private consumption.\nIndia's full-year GDP is expected to close at 6.5%, sharply lower compared to last year's 9.2%. Growth has flagged on account of slower consumption.\nWith all the key levers of growth, including exports, slowing down and US President Donald Trump's tariffs exacerbating global uncertainties, kick-starting private investment will be fundamental for India to hit its long-term growth targets, experts say.\nAccording to the World Bank's latest estimates, India will need to grow by 7.8% on average over the next 22 years to achieve its high-income status ambition by 2047.\nKey to this would be to increase private and public investment to at least 40% of GDP from 33% currently, the bank estimates.\nThe government on its part has significantly increased spending, especially on infrastructure. It also cut corporate tax rates from 30% to 22% and doled out billions of dollars in production-linked subsidies to manufacturers over the years. Availability of bank credit isn't a constraint any longer, and regulation has eased with regulatory restrictions halving between 2003 and 2020.\nBut none of this has prodded corporate India to boost spending.\nAccording to Sajjid Chinoy, JP Morgan India's Chief Economist, the big problem is the lack of demand in the economy to justify putting up additional capacities.\nIndia's post-pandemic recovery has been uneven, with the consumer class not expanding quickly enough. Demand for goods and services has thus been hit, with spending capacity further curtailed by a fall in wages, even though corporate profitability has soared to a 15-year high this year.\n\"Just because companies are financially strong doesn't mean they will automatically invest. Companies will only invest if they expect good returns,\" Chinoy said at an event in Mumbai earlier this year.\nRathin Roy, a former member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC), points to other deeper structural issues arresting investment appetite.\n\"Entrepreneurs have been lacking the energy to produce goods that might generate new demand. A classic example of this is construction - where there's unsold inventory in the urban areas, but an incapacity among builders to go into tier two and tier three towns and tap newer markets,\" Roy told the BBC.\nHe said he also agreed with Mr Kotak's views on the growing trend of business heirs turning wealth managers rather than building businesses ground up.\n\"Business houses discovered during Covid-19 that they don't need to do business to make money. They can just invest and multiply it without building anything new,\" said Roy. And these investments aren't just happening in the domestic stock market. \"A lot of money is just flowing out of India and chasing returns elsewhere,\" he added.\nBut things could be turning a corner, according to Icra.\nInterest rate cuts as well as a $12bn income tax relief provided to individuals in the federal budget \"augurs well for supporting domestic consumption demand\", according to the report.\nIndia's central bank also says more private companies have shown an intention to invest this year compared to last year, although how much of that intent results into actual money deployed remains to be seen. \nThe uncertainties related to global trade tariffs could delay any anticipated investment pick-up, according to Icra.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

She was playing so well, she was pretty dominant in her performance, especially in and around breakdown stuff. \n\"So it was unfortunate to lose her for a week, but Jade does have that experience that we can call on.

        "article_text": "Water companies released raw sewage into England's rivers and seas for a record 3.61 million hours last year, a slight increase on 2023.\nThe data released by Environment Agency on Thursday showed that although the number of spills was down each spill lasted longer on average - resulting in a higher total number of hours.\nSome spilling can be legal, but concern has been mounting amongst scientists about the harm that regular sewage spilling is causing the country's aquatic life.\nWater UK, the industry body, said sewage spills are a \"disgrace\" but has committed to a programme of investment worth \u00a3104bn over the next five years.\n\"These figures are disgraceful and are a stark reminder of how years of underinvestment have led to water companies discharging unacceptable levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes, and seas,\" said Environment Secretary Steve Reed.\nHis views were echoed by Water UK Chief Executive David Henderson: \"Any sewage flowing into waterways is a disgrace. Unfortunately, it's a system fault that we have in our network which mixes rainwater and wastewater. Nobody wants to see any spill of sewage in our waterways.\"\nEngland, like much of the world, has a combined sewage system meaning that rainwater and sewage share the same pipes. In some instances, when there is too much rain, treatment works can be overwhelmed, and sewage is spilled via overflow points into the country's rivers, lakes and seas to prevent a back up to the system.\nThis practice is legal. But previous investigations by the BBC and Environment Agency have revealed that sewage has also been spilled by water companies under dry conditions in breach of their permits.\nWater companies collectively oversee more than 15,000 of these overflow sites and this was the first year where all sites were monitored, revealing for the first time the extent of spilling.\nSewage was spilt for 3.614 million hours in 2024 compared to 3.606 million hours in 2023. \nCEO of River Action, James Wallace, said: \"A year on from last year's catastrophic pollution figures, the true scale of the UK's water crisis is only now coming to light. The figures have barely budged, testament to the deepening sewage scandal.\"\nIn 2022, Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical office for the UK, outlined the serious health risks sewage spills can pose for those using the country's waterways. Chief amongst them is bacteria from human faeces which he said can \"increase the risk of significant infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria\".\nSewage also poses significant environmental risks \u2013 it increases nutrients in the water leading to algal blooms which then eventually denies other wildlife \u2013 like fish - oxygen. These spills also have been shown to introduce microplastics, drugs and sanitary products into rivers and seas.\nThe River Ver in St Albans is one such location - the banks are littered with condoms, tampon applicators and wet wipes likely from sewage releases from nearby Markyate sewage treatment works owned by Thames Water. This rare chalk stream \u2013 one of around 200 worldwide \u2013 which supports important wildlife like water voles, saw more than 3,300 hours of spills in 2024.\nOf the spills a Thames Water spokesperson said: \"The Markyate area experienced one of the wettest years on record in 2024 which has caused excessive amounts of groundwater which has infiltrated into the network. This has resulted in the system being overwhelmed which has led to discharges into the river.\"\nLiberal Democrats Leader Ed Davey said the scale of spilling showed that the sector regulator, Ofwat, was not up to the task.\n\"This has to be the final nail in the coffin for Ofwat, a regulator that has time and again proven it is completely inadequate to protect customers and our beautiful environment,\" he said.\nIn October, the government launched an Independent Water Commission, chaired by former deputy Bank of England governor Sir Jon Cunliffe, to look into the sector - including the effectiveness of Ofwat.\nAn Ofwat spokesperson said: \"Where companies miss their targets, they will be penalised and money will be returned to customers. In parallel, companies will be held to account for past failures through our ongoing enforcement work into the operation and maintenance of sewage works and networks.\"\nThe Markyate site is one of a number across the country that is due an upgrade as part of a five-year \u00a3104bn investment programme by water companies \u2013 with \u00a324bn going specifically to improving infrastructure.\nThese upgrades will be paid largely through bill rises \u2013 which are due to take effect from 1 April \u2013 and will see the average annual bill hit \u00a3603. This has angered consumer groups and environmental charities who argue that the burden of upgrades should be carried by shareholders not households.\nProf Ewan McGaughey, Professor of Law at Kings College London, said: \"The water companies have paid over \u00a385bn out to shareholders since privatisation and that means they haven't been able to put the money into infrastructure.\"\nOfwat and the industry have previously denied the figure\u2013 which comes from University of Greenwich research \u2013 is as high, but there is agreement that significant investment is required.\nPhillip Clisham, specialist adviser to the Institution of Civil Engineers on water and sanitation, has worked in the industry for more than three decades, and said the challenge of fixing the issue has been \"underestimated\".\nHe said the two main solutions are building bigger storm tanks \u2013 which produce a huge amount of planet warming emissions in their construction \u2013 or to reduce excess rainwater by increasing green areas and the use of sustainable urban drainage systems.\nIt is this second solution that is preferable for the environment, he said, but it requires coordination between government, planning officers and housing developers \u2013 and takes longer to implement.\n\"A lot of this work is not as easy as it might seem from the outside in reality.\n\"I think it would be preferable for me to go a bit slower, get it right. But politically there's an awful lot of pressure to fix things now, and I do worry about the next 5 years,\" he said.\nAdditional reporting by Becky Dale, Rob England and Erwan Rivault",

And is former Croatia defender Tudor the right man to turn things around?\nMotta, 42, a former midfielder with Barcelona, Inter Milan and Paris St-Germain, was appointed last year after a hugely impressive spell at Bologna.\nHis progressive style of football transformed the club from one battling against relegation to one that finished fifth in Serie A last season to secure a place in the Champions League.\nHowever, the style of football with which he so impressed at Bologna was rarely on show with Juventus.\n\"I felt for him, because I am a big fan and I love what he did at Bologna,\" Laurens added. \n\"This doesn't mean he is not a good coach and that later on in his career he is not going to achieve great things, but maybe this was a little bit too early and certainly it just never started.\"\nThis video can not be played\nEuro Leagues: Pet turtles and the two-metre Messi\nQuestion marks could also be raised over Juventus' dealings in the transfer market during Motta's time at the club.\nWeeks after arriving at Juventus, he oversaw the \u00a342.35m signing of midfielder Douglas Luiz from Aston Villa.\nSuch a significant outlay suggested he would be a key player for what Motta wanted to do, but Luiz started only three of the 17 league games in which he was included in the matchday squad.\nStriker Moise Kean was allowed to leave to join Fiorentina in a deal worth a reported \u00a310m., external He is currently the second-highest scorer in Serie A with 15 goals.\nMotta's focus was to make Juventus defensively solid and he achieved that as they did not concede a goal in their first six games.\nBut that appeared to limit them as an attacking force and while they did not lose much, they also drew far too many games.

Man City's poor season down to me - GuardiolaImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Pep Guardiola joined Manchester City from Bayern Munich in 2016Published46 minutes ago50 CommentsManchester City boss Pep Guardiola says his performance as manager this season has been \"really poor\". \"That would be a big success but the season has been poor and it's not going to change. That's not going to change for the fact we win one title or qualify for the Champions League. City, Premier League champions in each of the last four seasons, are fifth in the table and 22 points behind leaders Liverpool with nine matches remaining.Guardiola, who has guided City to six Premier League titles since joining in 2016, has never finished a season lower than third with any club during his managerial career.",

a military term which refers to a set of aircraft or weapons systems that will participate in an operation. \nOther messages refer to damage assessments taken after the strike, as well as CIA operations in Yemen and anticipated Israeli strikes on the Houthis. \nHegseth continued to defend himself on Wednesday.\n\"They know it's not war plans,\" he told reporters in Hawaii. \"There's no units, no locations, no routes, no flight paths, no sources, no methods, no classified information.\" \nHegseth added that his job is to \"provide updates in real time\". \n\"That's what I did,\" he added. \nBut several military experts and veterans of the intelligence community said that the information was highly sensitive and should never have been shared in a commercial messaging app.\n\"War plans are generally the plan to conduct an entire conflict,\" Mick Mulroy, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence (DASD) for the Middle East and a retired CIA paramilitary officer, told the BBC. \"Attack plans stem from that and go down to the individual unit level\".\n\"Both are classified and highly sensitive,\" he added. \"One could actually make the argument that attack plans are more sensitive because they are more detailed and specific on time, place and manner\".

        "article_text": "Chloe Kelly assisted Arsenal's first and third goals against Real Madrid\nArsenal needed something special to book their place in the Women's Champions League semi-finals - and how they produced it.\nThe 3-0 second-leg win over Real Madrid on Wednesday, which sealed a 3-2 victory on aggregate, was arguably the most significant result under manager Renee Slegers so far. \nSix months ago when she replaced Jonas Eidevall, then as interim boss, Arsenal's season looked set to be one of huge disappointment.\nNow they find themselves among the elite, preparing to face record eight-time European champions Lyon - coached by former Arsenal boss Joe Montemurro - for a place in the final.\n\"It's important for the club and the players,\" said Slegers. \"They are part of Arsenal because they want to go far in tournaments, win things and be on the biggest stage. \n\"So it's important for us. I'm very happy with the result and we're going into the semi-finals.\"\nAlessia Russo was the star on a magical night at Emirates Stadium as she scored twice and had a further two goals ruled out for offside.\nEngland team-mate Chloe Kelly grabbed two assists, with Spain forward Mariona Caldentey joining Russo on the scoresheet during a ruthless second-half display which saw the Gunners score three times in 13 minutes.\nIt was only the second time a club has overturned a two-goal first-leg deficit in the quarter-finals of the competition, with Arsenal having done so against Torres in 2004, losing 2-0 away before a 4-1 home success.\n\"Without a doubt, that Arsenal team ran all over Real Madrid,\" said former England captain Steph Houghton on BBC Radio 5 Live. \n\"In those 13 minutes, where they scored three goals, they were absolutely relentless and that's what you have to be at this level. They were outstanding.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page\nOnly Lyon have scored more goals in the Women's Champions League this season\nFans were on their feet at full-time, singing and waving scarves as the players walked around the pitch receiving their deserved plaudits.\nIt had been a complete performance from the Gunners - a total turnaround from their placid display in Spain a week before when they lost 2-0.\nThey pressed with intensity, tested Real Madrid's defence with Kelly's teasing balls and could rely on Russo's sharpness in front of goal. \n\"It was electric - a masterful gameplan from Renee Slegers and well executed by the Arsenal players,\" said ex-England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley on 5 Live. \"They had to go for it.\n\"They had so many opportunities in the first half and managed to capitalise in the second half and that's what counts. Real Madrid had nothing left.\"\nArsenal have had their fair share of success stories at Emirates Stadium. But in a rollercoaster campaign, this was a wonderful high, and a result that will stand out as they booked an eighth semi-final appearance in the competition. \nSlegers' first victory in charge as interim manager, a day after Eidevall resigned, was in this competition when Arsenal overcame Valerenga 4-1. \nIt felt a stretch then to consider them as European semi-finalists but now, having booked their spot in the last four, Slegers admitted this was \"probably the clearest\" example of their character to fight back.\n\"We have done really good things before, coming back from setbacks and good performances against top teams,\" she added. \n\"But this is definitely one of the clearest ones where you play an opponent away, the game looks like it does, the result is what it is, then you have to put this performance and result in.\"\nThis video can not be played\nI have massive belief in our team - Russo\nHaving come so close to a first Arsenal hat-trick, Russo could have been forgiven for feeling frustrated at full-time.\nTwo video assistant referee (VAR) interventions meant she had two goals chalked off for offside, either side of a wasted opportunity when one-on-one with visiting goalkeeper Misa Rodriguez.\nBut the England forward celebrated at the final whistle and said the thought of being in the last four had \"not sunk in yet\".\n\"It was just amazing - the result, the fans, playing at the Emirates... it just doesn't get old,\" Russo told BBC Sport.\n\"When we went to Madrid we were disappointed, but we knew we had the belief and we knew what we needed to do. There was disappointment and it turned into fire quite quickly.\"\nHer contribution, alongside that of team-mate Kelly, played a key role in Arsenal's courageous comeback and Houghton said it showed Russo's \"maturity\".\nShe is now the joint-top scorer in the Champions League with six goals and has 17 in all competitions for her best goalscoring season to date.\n\"She got a lot of criticism at the beginning of the season and was probably doing too much work for the team - not being selfish enough as a striker,\" added Houghton.\n\"She showed a real maturity about her display [against Real Madrid]. Almost everything she touched went in the back of the net. \n\"She's got the goals that have sent Arsenal into a semi-final of the Champions League.\"\nAlessia Russo is the joint-top goalscorer in the Women's Champions League this season with six goals - level with Pernille Harder",

Charlie Atkinson broke easily through a tackle and with Harris inside he scored next to the posts.\nNothing was going Bristol's way as Byrne's kick to restart into the swirling wind went straight out and from a Cherry and Whites scrum on halfway, the ball was passed out wide to Hathaway who raced downfield. \nHis long ball back inside was expertly picked out of the air one-handed by a jumping Tomos Williams, whose no-look pass then found Seb Atkinson to run under the posts for the crucial fourth score to make it 24-0.\nGloucester's win at Kingsholm followed another high-scoring win at Ashton Gate earlier this season\nBristol director of rugby Pat Lam said during the week that he thought the match-up between two of the most potent sides in the league could be \"one of the best\" and at times both defences could barely keep up.\nBristol got themselves on the board as Benhard Janse Van Rensburg bouldered through and Harry Randall picked the ball quickly, to find Fitz Harding to dive under the posts.\nRich Lane then came within a whisker of the line before Williams scored Bristol's second to close the gap to 24-14.\nYet Gloucester were soon back at the other end as Hathaway darted between two tacklers and found Atkinson in space to slide over. \nThe tries continued to trade back and forth as Max Lahiff  powered over for Bristol's third from close range.\nBut Gloucester were not done and with the clock in red on 42 minutes they created space for Wade to dive over for a sixth in the corner.\nGloucester's intensity did not relent as the second half began and Wales scrum-half Williams caught Bristol's line unawares, throwing a long ball from a penalty to Atkinson who bundled over for his hat-trick.\nWade then chased his own kick past two Bristol players to tap down his own third try, and Barton then got in on the act after coming on as a replacement with Gloucester's ninth.\nThe win was out of Bristol's reach but they scored a crucial fourth to ensure they took something from the trip up the M5 through Williams, who muscled over under a tackle.\nGloucester director of rugby George Skivington told BBC Sport: \n\"I do think we were brilliant in defence, I know we conceded four tries but our defence was brilliant. Set-piece was very clinical. \n\"Attack-wise, we've scored a lot of tries this year but there has been times we've scored four and then the game has sort of gone along, we've not deliberately been conservative but I think scoring those three tries straight after the break was as good as we have been.\n\"I think Lightsy [James Lightfoot-Brown, attack coach] is really paying off there and the boys are really enjoying it. It is hard work, Lightsy's very on his detail - it's not lucky. It's just rewards to James and to all the boys.\"\nBristol director of rugby Pat Lam told BBC Sport:\n\"Well done to Gloucester, they were superb tonight, definitely their night and great to see so many young Gloucester kids and supporters enjoyed the game. \n\"I think we worked our way back 29-21 just before half-time and then we conceded again.\n\"At half-time we talked about how we have got to start fast and we turned the ball over from the kick-off and got a chance to get into it, and if we scored there we're back in the game but we turned the ball over and Gloucester scored.\n\"Not a great night defensively but we'll take the one point, the season ebbs and flows. The journey towards the end of May, June is not always easy one but you learn along the way. Our main thing is we got one point out, we'll dust ourselves off, we've got five more [games] to get into those play-offs.\"\nGloucester: Carreras; Wade, Harris, S. Atkinson, Hathaway; C.

He followed the thread as top Trump administration officials discussed upcoming military strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.\nThe Atlantic then on Wednesday published the entire text thread that showed the detailed and potentially classified rundown for a March air raids.\nIn the wake of the controversy, Waltz said he took full responsibility for the group chat. \"I built the group,\" he told Fox News on Tuesday, adding it was \"embarrassing\".\nWaltz was unable to explain in his Fox News interview how Goldberg came to be on the chat but said another, unnamed contact of his was supposed to be there in Goldberg's place.\n\"I can tell you for 100% I don't know this guy,\" Waltz said.\nOn Sunday, Goldberg said on NBC's Meet the Press that Waltz is \"telling everyone that he's never met me or spoken to me - that's simply not true\".\nPresident Trump called the incident a \"glitch\" and said that it had \"no impact at all\" operationally, adding that the military strike against the Houthis was a success.\nBut former national security officials have raised concerns that allowing this to slide could pose major risks and encourage American adversaries.\nSue Gordon, a former Trump administration deputy director of national intelligence, told BBC's US partner CBS News that she was \"glad the operation was successful. Now we need to deal with the fact that this should not have happened\".\n\"I don't think we should rest on the fact that nothing bad happened this time,\" she said. \"We don't know whether that communications path has been penetrated. So we don't know whether the state actors that have lots of resources are just sitting and working now.\"\nThose concerns have led many Democrats to call for greater accountability, with Mark Warner, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, asserting that if a military officer or CIA agent treated classified information in a similar manner they \"would be fired - end of story\".\n\"I believe Secretary Hegseth should resign or be fired. I think Mike Waltz should resign or be fired,\" Warner told CBS News on Sunday. \"If no action is taken, what message does that send to the workforce?\" \nStill, in an interview with NBC News on Saturday, Trump said he would not fire anyone involved in the group chat, and that he still had confidence in Waltz.\n\"I don't fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,\" he said.\nAlong with Waltz and Hegseth, the chat also included Vice-President JD Vance, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA director John Ratcliffe White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and other senior leaders.

        "article_text": "Mikaela Mayer (left) is a two-weight world champion having also held titles at super-featherweight\nWBO welterweight champion Mikaela Mayer faces Briton Sandy Ryan in a Las Vegas rematch on Saturday. \nIn her BBC Sport column, American Mayer talks about the events leading up to victory in last September's first fight in New York when Ryan was hit by a can of red paint before leaving for the venue.\nOn Friday, Ryan will address the controversy and rivalry between the pair.\nI was in my room and we were starting to walk to the elevator, waiting for the go-ahead from the team to say we could go down because we were at the same hotel as Sandy Ryan. \nSandy was out there first waiting for her car so we stood by the elevator and my nutritionist said to wait because she hasn't got in the car yet.\nMy nutritionist was looking at her phone and was like, 'oh my god, someone just threw paint on Sandy'. We were all taken aback but I didn't understand that I was apparently the culprit.\nI got in the car but didn't really understand the extent of it until I got to the arena and online there was a photo of Sandy, who was stripped down with red paint on her. ESPN came in to see me and apparently I'm being blamed for the attack.\nEveryone who knows me, knows that would be out of character for me - it's not my style. I expected her to try to blame me. I was her rival all week but there were also other things going on. \nSandy has already said flyers attacking her were put up around the hotel and city.\nYou can't just point a finger when there is no evidence leading back to me. I was upstairs waiting to walk down for the fight of my life. \nI didn't know what time she was going to be down there or that she was going first. The only people who knew were her team - maybe she should look inside her own circle.\nThe incident took me by surprise but I was in fight mode and it didn't happen to me, so I wasn't flustered.\nIf someone had thrown paint on me I would have slapped paint on the ass of my fight shorts and got on with it.\nI was concerned that she was going to pull out - her team were really getting her going about it.\nThere was a clip of her coach Kay Koroma in the locker room screaming at her to pull out of the fight which I thought was super suspicious. That was weird to me and out of character for him. \nI really don't think it was the paint that threw her off her game but her team, who made it a bigger deal than it had to be.\nObviously I don't want that to happen and I hope it doesn't happen going into this fight. It could have been called off and, after two years of busting my butt to get back in that position, that was the last thing I wanted.\nAs for 'paint-gate' being used to promote the rematch, I was surprised the Top Rank team used the paint on the promotion posters - but this is entertainment. \nI didn't have any say in it. If I had done anything like that, my manager would have had my neck as he tries to keep me professional.\nI didn't know about it until the poster came out and I said, 'do they have red paint on Sandy?'\nI was just as taken aback as anyone else, but it's kind of funny.\nMayer (right) beat Ryan (left) by majority decision with one judge scoring it a draw\nIt's important for women's boxing to have these rivalries and this is definitely up there as one of the top ones.\nI never counted out the rematch and just wanted to see what my other options were. Once I saw the views and how much the fans wanted it - and the excuses - I thought let's do it again and I'll do it even better.\nI didn't get my rematch with Alycia Baumgardner so I understand Sandy might have been frustrated, but I didn't have to give her this rematch. I could have just sat it out, waited for Lauren Price to unify and fought for undisputed or faced someone else. \nThat's not the fighter I am though.\nI pride myself on the fact a lot of the fights I have been in are competitive and people aren't sure who will win. \nMy feud with Alycia will stay number one for a lifetime, but Sandy can come second because of the coaching team situation and the paint situation.\nSandy and her team have tried to gaslight me in a sense where I'm supposed to be making all of this up or I'm being dramatic, but it happened.\nYou're going to see coach Koroma, my coach of eight or nine years since the Olympics, in her corner so they really can't say anything about it. They did what they did and they have to stand by that. \nI'm just protecting myself and I'm the one who had to go out and find a whole new team at this stage of my career which is not easy. I have truth on my side.\nMikaela Mayer was speaking to BBC Sport's Bobbie Jackson.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "For Neha Bapna, nothing in the world is more important than her dog Muffin.\nEvery time she takes a train to travel across India, the four-year-old Shih Tzu is right by her side - in first class. He only eats hypoallergenic food, which is often double the price of normal dog food and treats. \n\"I have spent sleepless nights trying to figure out what food suits him. He is my child, I do not want him to have any trouble,\" says the 43-year-old Mumbai-based entrepreneur.\nPampering one's pet used to be a luxury exclusive to the ultra-rich. But now affluent and middle-class urban Indians like Ms Bapna are splurging more on their \"fur babies\", fuelling a boom in India's pet care industry that has almost doubled in value in recent years.\nThe pandemic has played a huge role, according to Ankur Bisen, senior partner at Technopak retail consultancy. \n\"Covid created a need for companionship when people were staying at home. So you could see young mothers, people in their first jobs, people who by choice decided not to have kids... All these people started going for pet ownership,\" he says.\nThe number of pets in Indian households has grown sharply from 26 million in 2019 to 32 million in 2024, according to a report by consulting firm Redseer.\nAnd as late marriages, smaller family sizes and evolving social norms reshape family structures in urban India, these pets are increasingly being given the care and attention typically reserved for children.\nNikhil Bhushan and Lakshna Gulati, who live in the capital, Delhi, say raising their pets allows them to experience parenthood without complexity.\nThe couple, who have no biological children, share their home with two rescued pets: a dog named Mowgli and a cat named Marmalade.\n\"When we got married five years ago, we weren't ready to have children, but soon after rescuing the pets, our house truly became a home \u2013 there was something missing which is now complete. They bring us joy and seeing them every day brightens our lives,\" says Mr Bhushan.\n\"We like to spoil them,\" adds Ms Gulati. \"Whenever we see [a toy] they might like, we immediately buy it, even knowing it will be destroyed in no time.\"\nIn 2024, Indians spent $3.6bn (\u00a32.78bn) on products and services for their pets, a substantial increase from $1.6bn in 2019, according to the Redseer report.\nThis rapid growth has been fuelled by emerging trends such as pet boarding, insurance and specialised veterinary care.\n\"Twenty years ago, pet care was limited to basic services like vaccination and veterinary care,\" says Pankaj Poddar, chief executive of pet care company Zigly.\n\"Now, people want the best for their pets - whether it's clothing, accessories, or even specialised services,\" he says. \"I have seen parents spend as much as 10% of their incomes on their pets - be it taking them to special parties or even regular checkups.\"\nMs Bapna, for instance, spends between 25,000 rupees ($290; \u00a3220) and 40,000 rupees on Muffin in a month, mostly on his travel and special diet.\nShe takes her dog on a trip every few weeks, whether it's a day outing to a nearby farmhouse or a longer stay at a resort, and stays in pet-friendly accommodation which are pricier than regular hotels.\nWhen she takes the train to Jodhpur every few months to visit her parents, Ms Bapna buys first-class tickets - which are more than double the price of general tickets - as dogs and cats in India are only allowed in first-class coaches. \nMs Bapna doesn't mind the huge bills. When it comes to spending on Muffin, she says, \"This is one area where I make no concessions.\"\nThis kind of spending has propelled sales for pet care companies like Zigly.\n\"In the last eight-to-nine months, we have grown between 7% and 10% month-on-month,\" says Mr Poddar, whose company has reached a monthly gross merchandise value of around 46m rupees per month and is expected to reach 1bn rupees by next year.\nMore companies which offer cheaper services, such as pet care chain The Pet Point, have also sprung up to cater to the increasingly middle-class clientele.\nFor most Indian pet parents these days, \"value for money takes precedence over premiumisation\", says The Pet Point's co-founder Akshay Mahendru. \"A customer is more likely to get grooming services for their pet every week for 600 rupees, rather than somewhere above 1,500 rupees.\"\nMr Mahendru says that sales for comparatively cheaper pet products like toys or snacks has also increased manifold with the emergence of quick commerce platforms like Zepto or Blinkit that do deliveries in 10-15 minutes.\nExperts are optimistic that India's pet care market has room to grow, given global trends. According to Bloomberg Intelligence's Pet Economy Report 2023, the global pet care sector, currently valued at $320bn, could exceed $500bn by the end of this decade.\nRedseer's report estimates India's pet care market to double in the next three years and potentially cross $7bn by 2028.\nBut challenges still remain.\nIndia continues to be dogged by unequal economic growth, slowing consumption and wage stagnation which can dampen the industry's growth. \nMost cities here also lack pet-friendly public spaces, hotels and transport options, presenting a multitude of inconveniences to pet parents.\nWhenever Mr Bhushan and Ms Gulati travel with Mowgli, they bring portable beds and disposable plates and bowls \"so we're always prepared during our stays\", says Mr Bhushan.\n\"However, problems arise when we go for meals during our trips. Many places do not accept pets, which limits our options,\" he adds.\nMs Bapna faces similar challenges when travelling with Muffin. But she is optimistic that things will change.\n\"When I first got him in 2021, there were very few pet-friendly places and activities. But now in Mumbai there are special events, resorts and cafes that welcome pets,\" she said.\nThese days Muffin gets to attend \"socialisation events\", where he gets to play with other dogs, or goes to pet festivals where he can play games and sample special pet food.\n\"It gives me hope,\" Ms Bapna says with a smile.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "British Steel is launching a consultation that could see the closure of its two blast furnaces at Scunthorpe, putting up to 2,700 jobs at risk out of a workforce of 3,500.\nThe company said the blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable\" due to tough market conditions, the imposition of tariffs and higher environmental costs.\nThe BBC understands British Steel was expecting a \u00a31bn injection of government money to keep the business going, but was offered \u00a3500m.\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesperson said the government had made a \"generous offer\" to British Steel and it would continue to work with the company and its Chinese owner Jingye to secure its future.\n\nBritish Steel chief executive Zengwei An said the consultations on the closure were  \"a necessary decision given the hugely challenging circumstances the business faces\".\nThe director general of trade group UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said British Steel's announcement was a \"pivotal moment\" for the sector and the steel industry was \"officially in a crisis\".\nCommunity union general secretary Roy Rickhuss called it \"a dark day\" and urged Jingye and the UK Government \"to resume negotiations before it is too late\".\nThe GMB union called it \"devastating news\", while Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said the potential job losses were \"a disgrace\".\n\"British Steel is guilty of trying to hold the government to ransom, while using its dedicated workforce as pawns,\" she said.\n\nBritish Steel has been owned by Jingye since 2020. The Chinese firm says it has invested more than \u00a31.2bn into British Steel to maintain operations and claims it suffered financial losses of around \u00a3700,000 a day.\nThe company has put forward a \u00a32bn business plan, which was set out on Wednesday by the company's chief commercial officer Allan Bell speaking to the Business & Trade Select Committee.\n''We have concluded that the only viable option for British Steel moving forward to decarbonise is to move to 100% electric arc furnace steelmaking,\" he said.\n\"This is a \u00a32bn project we estimate so it is not a project that the private sector is going to be able to implement without government support.''\nThe BBC understands that there had been an expectation the government would meet this investment on a 50/50 basis. \nBut the government offered \u00a3500m, and this was rejected by British Steel.\nAnswering an urgent question on the future of Scunthorpe steelworks, Business and Trade Minister Sarah Jones told the House of Commons the government had made a \"generous conditional offer of financial support\".\nShe said the offer followed \"months of intensive engagement with British Steel\".\nJones said the company had to \"provide the commitments we need and which tax payers would quite rightly expect in exchange for substantial public funding\".\n\"It is regrettable that they have not yet done so or accepted our offer.\"\nShe called on the company to reconsider its closure plans and accept the government's offer.\nBritish Steel said it would \"continue to work with the UK government to explore options for the future of the business\".\nThe company is starting a formal consultation with its workforce and unions over three options:\nBusiness and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: \"I know this will be a deeply worrying time for staff and, while this is British Steel's decision, we will continue working tirelessly to reach an agreement with the company's owners to secure its future and protect taxpayers' money.\n\"We've been clear there's a bright future for steelmaking in the UK.

But the government offered \u00a3500m, and this was rejected by British Steel.Answering an urgent question on the future of Scunthorpe steelworks, Business and Trade Minister Sarah Jones told the House of Commons the government had made a \"generous conditional offer of financial support\".She said the offer followed \"months of intensive engagement with British Steel\".Jones said the company had to \"provide the commitments we need and which tax payers would quite rightly expect in exchange for substantial public funding\". \"British Steel is guilty of trying to hold the government to ransom, while using its dedicated workforce as pawns,\" she said.Tata Steel \u00a31.25bn electric furnace approved by plannersWhat are tariffs and why is Trump using them?British Steel has been owned by Jingye since 2020.",

        "article_text": "In Murmansk, the largest city north of the Arctic circle, President Vladimir Putin vowed to \"strengthen Russia's global leadership in the Arctic\", while warning that \"geopolitical competition in the region\" was intensifying.\nThe first example he gave was Donald Trump's idea to acquire Greenland.\nBut from the Kremlin leader there was no criticism of his US counterpart.\nAnd that's telling, as the White House and the Kremlin try to rebuild relations.\n\"In short, America's plans in relation to Greenland are serious,\" President Putin said in an address to Russia's Arctic Forum in Murmansk.\n\"These plans have deep historical roots. And it's clear that the US will continue to systematically pursue its geo-strategic, military-political and economic interests in the \u0410rctic. \n\"As for Greenland this is a matter for two specific countries. It has nothing to do with us.\"\nSo said the president who had launched a full-scale invasion of a sovereign neighbouring country and claims to have annexed whole swathes of Ukraine.\nWhen Joe Biden was in the White House, Moscow and Washington were vocal in their criticism of one another.\nHow things have changed.\nToday Russia is promoting the idea of economic cooperation with the United States in an Arctic region packed with natural resources.\n\"We are open to considering different investment opportunities that we can do jointly with the US, in certain sectors approved by the Russian government,\" says Kirill Dmitriev, President Putin's envoy for foreign investment and economic cooperation.\nMr Dmitriev, who is also chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, has already been in talks with US officials.\n\"We are open for investment cooperation in the Arctic. That could be in logistics, or other areas beneficial to Russia and to the US,\" Mr Dmitriev adds.\n\"But before deals can be done the war in Ukraine needs to end,\" I suggest. \n\"Many people in the West accuse Russia of dragging its feet, showing no compromise or concessions, and just laying down conditions.\"\n\"I am focused on economics and investments, so I don't comment on political issues,\" Mr Dmitriev responds. \n\"The only thing I can say is we have a very good dialogue, and I think it's very important that the US is trying to understand Russia's position.\"\nMoscow seems confident that it can woo Washington with promises of lucrative deals in the Arctic and across Russia.\nThat confidence is understandable considering how senior US officials have been repeating Kremlin talking points about the war in Ukraine and about Europe.\nIn a recent interview with former Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson, Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff appeared to accept the results of Moscow-organised referenda that were held in Ukrainian territories seized and occupied by Russia. \nThese votes that have not been recognised by the international community.\nIn the words of one recent Russian newspaper headline: \"US and Russian officials are now talking the same language.\"\nAre the Russian authorities at all surprised by the sea change in America's Russia policy?\n\"[In America] there are two parties that compete with one another,\" says Nikolai Patrushev, former head of Russia's FSB domestic security service. \nMr Patrushev, who is now an aide to President Putin, is one of the most powerful figures in Russia. \nWhile on the side lines of the Arctic Forum he tells me: \"When the Democrats were in power, they took one view. The Republicans have another. \n\"It doesn't mean that they agree with Russia's standpoint. Only that they have their own, which they promote, and we can cooperate with them.\"\nI ask Mr Patrushev: \"Do you have a sense that a new world order is being forged?\".\n\"We used to have a system where two powers dominated in the world. Then it was just one. Now we're building a multi-polar world. But with its own peculiarities,\" says Mr Patrushev.\nIn the centre of Murmansk, a giant inflatable whale has taken over one of the city's squares. \nAttached to wires, it's bobbing over a sea of silver balloons designed to look like waves. The balloons are dancing in the wind beneath the blow-up beast.\nIt's a giant installation. But then Russia has enormous ambitions, both for the Arctic and for the country's relations with America.\nThe whale is attracting a great deal of interest with lots of families posing for photos. \nIt's an opportunity to ask Russians whether they support the idea of economic cooperation with America in the Arctic and whether they're surprised when Washington appears to take Moscow's side?\nElina isn't.\n\"Russia is strong,\" she says. \"You should always back the strong ones and go along with them.\"\n\"We need to develop the Arctic,\" Olga tells me. \"Cooperation with 'friendly countries' is a good thing.\"\n\"And do you see America as a 'friendly country'?\" I ask.\n\"You know what? I can't decide.\" replies Olga.\nMeanwhile presidential envoy Mr Dmitriev is singing the praises of one particular American - Elon Musk \u2013 and counting on cooperation.\n\"We believe Elon Musk is a great visionary, a great leader and a very successful person,\" Mr Dmitriev tells me. \"Russia has a lot to offer for a mission to Mars because we have some nuclear technologies which can be applicable.\n\"There are some video conferences we believe will be upcoming with, let's say, the Musk team.\"",

        "article_text": "Richard Chamberlain, who has died today at the age of 90, shot to fame as TV heartthrob Dr Kildare in the 1960s.\nHis dashing good looks won him legions of female fans, and guaranteed him work in a plethora of rather forgettable television movies.\nBut, in middle age, his career spiked again.\nChamberlain became king of the 1980's TV mini-series: playing a western prisoner in Shogun and a catholic priest tempted by love in The Thorn Birds.\nHe denied being gay when confronted by a French magazine in 1989, and did not speak publicly about his homosexuality until he turned 70.\nIn interviews promoting his 2003 memoir, he advised other handsome leading actors to keep their sexuality to themselves.\n\"There's still a tremendous amount of homophobia in our culture,\" he said. \"Please, don't pretend that we're suddenly all wonderfully, blissfully accepted.\"\nGeorge Richard Chamberlain was born on 31 March 1934, in Beverly Hills, California. He died one day before his 91st birthday.\nHis salesman father had a problem with drink, which affected young Richard's childhood. He described himself as a \"shy, serious, lugubrious kid, painfully thin, with a long, sad face\".\nHe admitted to being the most \"uncooperative kid in school\" but discovered a taste and a talent for athletics. \nAt Pomona College, he was bitten by the acting bug - and a role in Bernard Shaw's Arms and the Man convinced him he had found his calling.\nParamount Studios was interested in him, but thoughts of an acting career were put on hold after he was called up, serving 16 months with the US Army, rising to the rank of sergeant while stationed in Korea.\nOn his discharge, he made a number of cameos in TV shows, including an episode of the popular Western, Gunsmoke.\nNot everyone had Chamberlain picked as a future star.\nHe was handsome enough: with profiles at the time gushing over his \"fine-lined aristocratic face, suggesting a young Florentine noble - straight out of the Renaissance\".\nBut, he was naturally diffident - which worked in his favour when he auditioned to play Dr James Kildare, a medical intern struggling to learn his profession, in NBC's new primetime medical drama. \n\"Perhaps it was inevitable,\" said one friend-and-rival. \"Who else could look so anti-sceptic as Dick?\"\nThe series ran for nearly 200 programmes across five seasons.\nIt broke new ground, by raising matters such as drug addiction - which had not previously been shown on US TV.\nThere was a huge reaction from female fans.\nChamberlain got 12,000 letters a week. In Pittsburgh, 450,000 people turned out to see him at a parade, and in New York, he nearly caused a riot when a child spotted him and called his name. \nThe studio made the most of this attention, releasing novels, comics and games featuring Chamberlain's image.\nFans would even write in asking \"Dr Kildare\" to solve their various medical problems. \nAnd Chamberlain had an unlikely hit single: Three Stars Will Shine Tonight, where romantic words were added to the show's distinctive opening theme tune.\nHe won a Golden Globe Award for best TV actor in 1963. But, three years later audiences began to wane, and NBC pulled the plug.\nNow an international star, Chamberlain struggled to leave Kildare behind. \nIn 1966, he hoped to break into films, but reviews slated his performance in the light romantic comedy, Joy in the Morning.\nAudiences, they said, laughed in \"all the wrong places\". So, he resolved to ignore Hollywood and make a living on the stage. \nHe got off to a rocky start when a musical version of Breakfast at Tiffany's - in which he starred opposite Mary Tyler Moore - closed after just four shows.\nThe production is still seen as one of Broadway's biggest ever turkeys. But a move to England gave him a chance of reinventing himself as a 'serious actor.' \nIn 1967, there were starring roles in Henry James' Portrait of a Lady and opposite Katherine Hepburn in a satirical comedy called The Madwoman of Chaillot.\nAnd, two years later, he became the first American to play Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre since the great John Barrymore in 1925.\nThis time, the reviews were excellent and he revisited the role of Denmark's most tortured prince for a television version for Hallmark. \nBut Chamberlain was cast as Tchaikovsky in Ken Russell's overblown biopic, The Music Lovers, in which he starred opposite Glenda Jackson. \nThe critics rubbished the film, in which great play was made of the relationship between a composer with repressed homosexual tendencies and his nymphomaniac wife, although it later became something of a cult success.\nChamberlain went on to play Lord Byron opposite Sarah Miles in Lady Caroline Lamb and the swashbuckling French swordsman Aramis in Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers.\nHe also appeared - along with half of Hollywood - in the Towering Inferno, as a crooked electrical engineer whose corner-cutting leads to the spectacular destruction of a 138 floor building. \nIn 1977, the TV series Roots - set in the era of American slavery - drew huge audiences and was nominated for nearly 40 Emmy awards.\nIt sparked a revival of the mini-series which drew Chamberlain back to television.\nHe beat Roger Moore and Albert Finney to be cast as John Blackthorn - a captive English navigator in 17th Century Japan - in Shogun.\nThe series was shown on NBC over five nights in 1980, with audiences reaching nearly 30 million.  \nHaving won a Golden Globe, Chamberlain then picked up another as Father Ralph de Bricassart in The Thorn Birds, a priest torn between God and his sexual longing afor the actress, Rachel Ward.\nIt was even more successful than Shogun, winning an audience of 60% of television viewers and 16 Emmy nominations.\nIn the 1990s, Chamberlain's career began to wane.\nThere were a succession of solid, rather than outstanding, performances in made-for-TV films and endless guest appearances in other people's shows.\nThese included a sequel to The Thorn Birds called The Missing Years, with Amanda Donohoe replacing Rachel Ward.\nIn 2003, long after he had stopped playing romantic leading men, Chamberlain published his biography Shattered Love, in which, for the first time, he confirmed he was gay.\nDespite a relationship of more than 30 years with the actor and director Martin Rabbett, with whom he'd once starred in the film Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, they had kept their private life private.\n\"I thought there was something very, very deeply wrong with me,\" he said, \"and I wanted to cover it up. I remember making a pact with myself that I would never, ever reveal this secret, ever.\"\nChamberlain and Rabbett went their separate ways in 2010.\nIn later years, Chamberlain was happy to play a gay man, notably in Desperate Housewives and Will & Grace. \nHe continued to perform in musical theatre, including touring productions of Spamalot, My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music.\nBut he never regretted hiding his sexuality to protect his career.\n\"I would have been a happier person being out of the closet and being free,\" he told El Pais in 2024. \"But I had other motives that made me happy. I was a working actor and for me, that was most important.\"\nHe will be remembered as the king of the TV mini-series: the dashing leading man in everything from Dr Kildare to The Thorn Birds.\nDespite attempts to reinvent himself as a serious stage actor, he was at his best on the small screen, entertaining millions watching at home on the sofa.\nFor, although there were always better actors than Richard Chamberlain, few rivalled his ability to hold a television audience.",

So, did they really win and does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?\nHayley Walsh's heart was racing as she sat in the audience at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 27 January this year. \nThe 42 year-old lecturer and mother of three tried to calm her breathing. Hollywood star Sigourney Weaver was onstage in her West End debut production of Shakespeare's The Tempest. \nBut Hayley, a Just Stop Oil activist, had her own drama planned.\nAs Weaver's Prospero declaimed \"Come forth, I say,\" Hayley sprang from her seat and rushed the stage with Richard Weir, a 60-year-old mechanical engineer from Tyneside. \nThey launched a confetti cannon and unfurled a banner that read \"Over 1.5 Degrees is a Global Shipwreck\" - a reference to the news that 2024 was the first year to pass the symbolic 1.5C threshold in global average temperature rise, and a nod to the shipwreck theme in the play. \nIt was a classic Just Stop Oil (JSO) action. The target was high profile and would guarantee publicity. The message was simple and presented in the group's signature fluorescent orange.\nThe reaction of those affected was also a classic response to JSO.  Amid the boos and whistles you can hear a shout of \"idiots\".  \n\"Drag them off the stage\", one audience member can be heard shouting, \"I hope you [expletive] get arrested,\" another says.\nJSO is a UK-based environmental activist group that aims to end fossil fuel extraction and uses direct action to draw attention to its cause. It has been called a \"criminal cult\" and its activists branded \"eco-loons\" by the Sun. The Daily Mail has described it as \"deranged\" and says its members have \"unleashed misery on thousands of ordinary people though their selfish antics\".\nThe group has thrown soup at a Van Gogh in the National Gallery, exploded a chalk dust bomb during the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, smashed a cabinet containing a copy of the Magna Carta at the British Library, sprayed temporary paint on the stones of Stonehenge and even defaced Charles Darwin's grave.\nBut it is the group's road protests that have probably caused the most disruption \u2013 and public anger. In November 2022, 45 JSO members climbed gantries around the M25 severely disrupting traffic for over four days. People missed flights, medical appointments and exams as thousands of drivers were delayed for hours. The cost to the Metropolitan Police was put at \u00a31.1 million.\nJust Stop Oil was born out of Extinction Rebellion (XR).  XR \u2013 founded in 2018 - brought thousands of people onto the streets in what were dubbed \"festivals of resistance\".  They came to a peak in April 2019, when protestors brought parts of the capital to a halt for more than a week and plonked a large pink boat in the middle of Oxford Circus.\nThe spectacle and disruption XR caused generated massive media attention, but the police were furious.  Hundreds of officers were diverted from frontline duties and by the end of 2019 the bill for policing the protests had reached \u00a337m.\nAnd behind the scenes XR was riven by furious debates about tactics.  Many inside the movement said it should be less confrontational and disruptive but a hard core of activists argued it would be more effective to double down on direct action.\nIt became clear that there was room for what Sarah Lunnon, one of the co-founders of Just Stop Oil, calls \"a more radical flank\".  They decided a new, more focused operation was needed, modelled on earlier civil disobedience movements like the Suffragettes, Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns and the civil rights movement in the US.\nThe group was formally launched on Valentine's Day, 2022. It was a very different animal to XR. Instead of thousands of people taking part in street carnivals, JSO's actions involved a few committed activists. A small strategy group oversaw the campaign and meticulously planned its activities. A mobilisation team worked to recruit new members, and another team focused on supporting activists after they were arrested.\nThe dozens of actions the group has carried out generated lots of publicity, but also massive public opposition. There were confrontations between members of the public and protestors and an outcry from politicians across all the main political parties.\nThe police said they needed more powers to deal with this new form of protest and they got them. New offences were created including interfering with national infrastructure, \"locking on\" \u2013 chaining or gluing yourself to something \u2013 and tunnelling underground. Causing a public nuisance also became a potential crime \u2013 providing the police with a powerful new tool to use against protestors who block roads.\nIn the four years since it was formed dozens of the group's supporters have been jailed. Five activists were handed multi-year sentences for their role in the M25 actions in 2022. Those were reduced on appeal earlier this month but are still the longest jail terms for non-violent civil disobedience ever issued.\nSenior JSO members deny the crackdown had anything to do with the group's decision to \"hang up the hi-vis\" \u2013 as its statement this week announcing the end of campaign put it.\nJSO's public position is that it has won its battle. \"Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history,\" the group claimed.\nThe government has said it does not plan to issue any new licences for oil and gas production but strongly denies its policies have a link to JSO. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson told journalists: \"We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.\"\nAnd the group's wider goal \u2013 to end the production of oil and gas \u2013 has manifestly not been achieved. The members of the group I spoke to for this article all agree the climate crisis has deepened.\nIn the face of stiffer sentences, some climate campaigners have said they will turn to more clandestine activities. One new group says it plans a campaign of sabotage against key infrastructure. In a manifesto published online it says it plans to \"kickstart a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors of the fossil fuel economy.\"\nThat's not a direction the JSO members I spoke to said they wanted to go. Sarah Lunnon said a key principle of JSO and the civil disobedience movement generally was that activists would take responsibility for their actions. One of the first questions new joiners were asked is whether they would be willing to be locked up.\n\"As corporations and billionaires corrupt political systems across the world, we need a different approach. \n\"We are creating a new strategy, to face this reality and to carry our responsibilities at this time,\" the group says, suggesting they may be planning to form a new movement.\nJSO's most high-profile figure, Roger Hallam, is one of the five activists convicted for their role in the M25 protests. In a message from his prison cell he acknowledged that JSO has only had a \"marginal impact\".  \nThat is \"not due to lack of trying,\" he said. The failure lay with the UK's \"elites and our leaders\" who had walked away from their responsibility to tackle the climate crisis, Hallam claimed. A hint perhaps that the group's new focus might be on the political system itself.\nJSO has said its last protest \u2013 to be held at the end of April \u2013 will mark \"the end of soup on Van Goghs, cornstarch on Stonehenge and slow marching in the streets\". But don't believe it. When pressed, the JSO members I spoke to said they may well turn back to disruptive tactics but under a new name and with a new and as yet unspecified objective.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "The detention of South Sudan's First Vice-President Riek Machar has effectively collapsed the 2018 peace deal that ended the country's five-year civil war, his party has said. \nAn armed convoy led by top security officials, including the defence minister, entered Machar's residence in the capital, Juba, and disarmed his bodyguards late on Wednesday, said the Sudan People's Liberation Movement In Opposition (SPLM/IO). \nMachar was detained alongside his wife Angelina Teny, who is also the country's interior minister, the party added. \nThe US has urged the authorities to free Machar, while the UN, African Union and neighbouring countries have all expressed their concern.\n\nThe UN Mission in South Sudan, Unmiss, warned that the world's newest nation risked losing the \"hard-won gains of the past seven years\" if it returned to \"a state of war\". \n\"Tonight, the country's leaders stand on the brink of relapsing into widespread conflict,\" the mission said in a statement on Wednesday. \nThe government is yet to comment on Machar's reported house-arrest.\nBut addressing religious leaders on Wednesday, President Salva Kiir said \"he will never return the country to war\". \nTensions have been building between Machar and the president for several weeks. \nThe two leaders agreed in August 2018 to end the civil war between their forces that killed nearly 400,000 people. But over the last seven years their relationship has become increasingly strained amid ethnic tensions and sporadic violence.\nEarlier this week, the UN said that barrel bombs believed to contain a highly flammable liquid had been used in airstrikes during fighting between the army and a rebel group previously linked to Machar.\n\"The arrest and detention of H.E. Dr Riek Machar effectively brings the [peace] agreement to a collapse,\" SPLM/IO deputy leader Oyet Nathaniel Pierino told journalists on Thursday.\n\"The prospect for peace and stability in South Sudan has now been put into serious jeopardy,\" he added.\nA similar warning was issued by the UN mission in the country, which said the country's leaders \"stand on the brink of relapsing into widespread conflict\". \nThe situation has been exacerbated by the deployment of Ugandan troops and their battle tanks into South Sudan, following a request by the country's president, according to the UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan chair Yasmin Sooka.\nShe says this raises serious concerns over potential violations of the UN arms embargo and the growing partisan role of foreign forces, which further endangers civilians and risks regional escalation.\nTension remains high in Juba with a heavy military presence reported around Machar's home.\n\"The public are in a panic,\" civil society leader Edmund Yakani told the AFP news agency.\n\"There is a high chance of full-scale war but it will be more deadly and more violent because of [the need] for revenge,\" he added.\nPierino called on SPLM/IO members and the public to remain calm as diplomatic efforts continue to resolve the situation.\nThe BBC understands that the African Union and the regional body, Igad, are expected to send high-level delegations to Juba on Friday, to help curb the escalating crisis.\nReath Muoch Tang, chairman of the party's foreign relations committee, said Machar was under house-arrest, but that security officials initially tried to take him away.\n\"An arrest warrant was delivered to him under unclear charges,\" Tang said in a statement, calling the action a \"blatant violation of the constitution and the Revitalized Peace Agreement\".\nThe UN mission warned that violations of the 2018 peace deal \"will not only devastate South Sudan but also affect the entire region\". \nThe British and US embassies have scaled down their diplomatic staff and urged their citizens to leave the country while the Norwegian and German embassies have closed their operations in Juba. \nThe US has called on President Kiir to free his rival from the reported house-arrest, urging the two leaders to show commitment to peace.\n\"We urge President Kiir to reverse this action & prevent further escalation of the situation,\" the US Bureau of African Affairs wrote on X. \nThe escalating tensions come amid renewed clashes between forces loyal to the two rivals in the northern town of Nasir in the oil-rich Upper Nile State.\nAdditional reporting by Nichola Mandil in Juba\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Jay Springett, a tech strategist and podcast host, joined the social media app Butterflies AI out of curiosity, and ended up staying for more than six months.\nThe idea of Butterflies is to allow human and AI personas to interact.\nMr Springett's online persona developed over time, interacting with other artificial characters, and even went as far as to start its own Beanie Babies [a line of soft toys] collection.\nHe said it was like AIs were writing their own soap operas inside a simulation.\n\"I didn't engage with Butterflies in the same way I do with other platforms,\" Mr Springett told BBC.\n\"It felt more like observing than participating. I wouldn't pay for it, but it was interesting enough to keep watching.\"\nA host of social media services, like Butterflies, are trying to expand at a time when there is dissatisfaction with the social media giants.\nAccording to data from Similarweb, a digital market intelligence company, X's daily active users in the UK have dropped by nearly 25% since January 2024.\nAnd it's not just X that has been suffering, mobile and desktop traffic to Facebook has declined over the last few years according to Similarweb.\nA report by the Pew Research Centre found that a third of teens use Facebook and X, compared with three quarters a decade ago.\nBluesky is one of the social media firms gaining ground.\nOver the past year, Bluesky has gained tens of millions of new users, often at the expense of X.\nApart from just timing, though, BlueSky's success can be largely attributed to its novel architecture, which pairs an X-like experience with a high degree of customization.\nUnlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community.\nDon't like the broader discourse on Bluesky? Jump on the \"popular with friends\" feed to see what the people you follow specifically are talking about.\nIt will not be simple for Bluesky to scale up to the size of X and Facebook, says Andy Tattersall, an information specialist at the University of Sheffield.\nHe ways it will have to strike a balance between \"generating revenue, keeping users safe, and moderating content, which is much easier said than done\".\nCelebrity-backed foundation, Free Our Feeds, hopes to do that.\nIt's backed some notable names, including musician Brian Eno and actor Mark Ruffalo, and plans to raise $30m (\u00a323m) over the next three years to support an open social media ecosystem powered by the AT Protocol, the decentralized network powering Bluesky.\n\"Bluesky has created a strong foundation for shared social media infrastructure,\" says Robin Berjonone, one of Free Our Feeds' nine custodians, \"but so long as they are the primary operator of this infrastructure the risk remains that it will stop operating in the public interest\".\nA bigger worry for these emerging platforms, though, is the network barrier. This can be summed up with Metcalfe's Law, explains Evan Prodromou, co-author and current editor of ActivityPub, another open social media architecture, which is behind popular platforms like Meta's Threads.\nThe law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services.\nNon-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe's Law.\nThey hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services. \nInstead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them.\nThreads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance.\nUsing this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms.\nIt's not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol.\nBut there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech.\n\"One thing we've learnt from the past decades is that the last thing the world needs is a one-size-fits all solution for eight billion people,\" says Robin Berjon, one of Free Our Feeds' custodians.\nAt the other end of the spectrum are those that want to carve a niche out for themselves, rather than replace the incumbents.\nIn the last couple of years, a cottage industry of unique, new social apps has cropped.\nOne of those is Mozi, created by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. Mozi doesn't want you to socialise online at all.\nInstead it informs you when you're going to be in the same place (city or event) as someone you know and encourages you to connect with people more often in person.\n\"Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,\" says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson.\nMike McCue, the CEO of Flipboard, is convinced such innovation will result in a new era of social networking, where numerous new, more interesting types of social networks will emerge and offer people more choices.\nHe hopes that Flipboard's app, Surf will help people manage a messy social media ecosystem. It allows users to browse from a centralized feed that can draw posts and content from a variety of platforms, including Threads, Bluesky, and YouTube.\n\"In the end,\" says Mr McCue, \"it's unlikely one service will replace the Facebook or Twitter we once knew, but instead several services will start to take our time away from these old-style single feed experiences, our behaviours will shift with these new choices and new generations will expect more.\"",

        "article_text": "Living with some of the world's most remote tribal communities has changed filmmaker and indigenous right activist Bruce Parry.\n\"I started out as an adventurer,\" he says. \"It was all ego \u2013 I wanted to climb the biggest mountain, go and find the tribe that no one's visited to show the world how tough I was.\"\nAcross three series of the BAFTA-winning Tribe, viewers have seen Parry taking the psychedelic drug ayahuasca, having his nose pierced with a thorn and taking part in numerous rituals. Now, the series is returning to screens for the first time since 2007.\nHe was in his mid-30s in the first series of Tribe - and he has just turned 56. \n\"Initially on the show, my whole remit was to not say anything and to experience,\" he says.\n\"Now, I am much more knowledgeable, and that made it harder to be that wide-eyed character. \n\"I'm not the same guy any more.\"\nWarning: This story contains descriptions of animal cruelty some readers may find distressing.\nWhile trying to understand the communities he visits, Parry sometimes encounters difficult situations. \nAmong Angola's Mucubal community, for example, custom demands that as a guest, he must sacrifice a goat in a way expected within the group \u2013 that is, by suffocating it.\n\"They do it because they see it as respectful,\" says Parry. In the episode, he says this is the \"most gruesome thing\" he has ever been a part of.\n\"I knew how that was going to feel to some members of the audience,\" he says, adding that some might see it as \"barbaric\".\nDespite finding it upsetting, he says he was able to get through it by thinking on a global scale.\n\"If you take these people as a whole, they are not a problem on this planet,\" he says, arguing, in his view, that by doing things like eating meat \"you are contributing to so much more that is potentially negative and impactful on the planet\".\nIn his new three-part BBC series, he lives among three remote communities. He conducts a sacred ritual with Colombia's Waimaha people, lives among Angola's Mucubal community and visits Indonesia's Marapu.\nBehind the scenes, Parry's team works hard to make sure their visits are not just what he calls \"coming to take away their images [by filming them] and take them home\".\nInstead, he refers to his time with the remote communities as an \"exchange\", with his team often trading gifts with the people he visits.\nIn the past, he has given equipment, from boats to a machine used to grind sorghum - a staple grain in Africa and Asia. And in the show, we see him receive items in return in the form of livestock or other items culturally important to each community.\n\"Sometimes they just want guns,\" Parry says, \"but as the BBC, we can't quite do that.\"\nHe adds: \"We haven't ever really approached anyone that isn't really excited for us to come. I've never really had a sense that people didn't want me there.\"\nThere may, however, be some wariness based on negative experience with outsiders. \nThe Waimaha, whose culture was nearly decimated by rubber tappers and missionaries, for example, make Parry sleep away from them until he has gained their trust.\nEach episode reveals some of the other outside factors facing each community. \nThe region of Angola that Parry visits was inaccessible for decades because of landmines left during that country's civil war. And the Mucubal group feel the effects of climate change as the desert they live in gets hotter and drier.\nParry says he brings these issues to our attention after identifying what he saw as a problem with the original series.\n\"You could be forgiven for watching those first episodes and thinking that these people were living in pristine environments in the middle of nowhere, untouched by the outside world,\" he says.\n\"We used to get people saying it was questionable to go to these places and change them by our presence.\n\"To some degree, we are doing that, but our impact on those people was a drop in the ocean compared to all the other forces of change, the globalisation, the miners, the loggers and the missionaries.\"\nWhile travelling, Parry says he often finds unexpected similarities in how people live their lives.\nThe Mucubal, for example, knock out some of their bottom teeth and file down their front two. In the show, Parry says: \"The things we do for beauty\" - hinting at dental and cosmetic procedures common around the world. \nOther communities have very different practices - but Parry thinks we can learn from them. The Marapu live among the graves of their dead ancestors, giving them a unique bond.\n\"I'm not here to put any group on a pedestal,\" he says, \"we're all human, but there is definitely always something that we can learn from each other. \n\"And actually, the more different you are, probably the more there is for us to learn.\"\nNow, he says his guiding principle is \"the more you can try and see the world through another person's eyes, the more you can reflect on your own life and your own culture. \n\"And that's where wisdom comes.\"",

        "article_text": "A professor has published details of a rare \"inside-out, legless, headless wonder\" fossil from 444 million years ago, which belonged to a previously undiscovered species.\nProf Sarah Gabbott has been studying the arthropod fossil for 25 years after she found it in a small quarry in South Africa. \nHer findings, published on Thursday, reveal the discovery is very rare, as most fossils are of an animal's external features, whereas the internal organs are preserved in this case. \nProf Gabbott uncovered the fossil, which she has named Sue after her mother, at the start of her career. She had hoped to find another example in the years which followed, but had no joy. \nThe University of Leicester academic said she had decided to finally make her findings public after her mum said if she intended to name the fossil after her, she ought to \"get on and do it before she becomes a fossil herself\".\nSue was found in the Soom Shale, a band of silt and clay at a location 250 miles north of Cape Town, which was laid on the seafloor more than 440 million years ago after a devastating glaciation had wiped out about 85% of Earth's species.\nIt is believed the marine basin where the arthropod swam was somehow protected from the worst of the freezing conditions. \nThe sediments where Sue came to rest were also toxic, with no oxygen and hydrogen sulphide dissolved in the water, which the researchers suspect might have led to her unusual inside-out preservation.\nIt is, however, difficult to compare her to other fossils from the same era due to the unique way Sue was preserved. \nProf Gabbott, who is based at the university's school of geography, geology and the environment, added: \"Sue is an inside-out, legless, headless wonder. \n\"Remarkably her insides are a mineralised time-capsule: muscles, sinews, tendons and even guts all preserved in unimaginable detail. \n\"And yet her durable carapace, legs and head are missing \u2013 lost to decay over 440 million years ago.\n\"We are now sure she was a primitive marine arthropod but her precise evolutionary relationships remain frustratingly elusive.\"\nThe small quarry where the fossil was found has now virtually disappeared, which means another example is unlikely to be discovered. \nProf Gabbott said: \"This has been an ultramarathon of a research effort. In a large part because this fossil is just so beautifully preserved, there's so much anatomy there that needs interpreting. Layer upon layer of exquisite detail and complexity. \n\"I'd always hoped to find new specimens but it seems after 25 years of searching, this fossil is vanishingly rare \u2013 so I can hang on no longer. \n\"Recently my mum said to me, 'Sarah, if you are going to name this fossil after me, you'd better get on and do it before I am in the ground and fossilised myself'.\n\"I tell my mum in jest that I named the fossil Sue after her because she is a well-preserved specimen.\n\"But, in truth, I named her Sue because my mum always said I should follow a career that makes me happy \u2013 whatever that may be. \n\"For me, that is digging rocks, finding fossils and then trying to figure out how they lived and what they tell us about ancient life and evolution on Earth.\"\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

Usher's moves are so effortless that they look unrehearsed, but such ease comes at a cost: Last year, he had to postpone the start of the tour after injuring his neck in practice.\nAt the O2, that pain seemed a distant memory, as he careened around the U-shaped stage on roller skates, pulling off a flawless moonwalk, and even freeze-framing in a handstand.\nHe might have fumbled a hat at one point, but it was one of his dancers who came closest to calamity - losing his balance during an elaborate chair routine, sending the chair spinning across the stage.\nThe band also suffered a mishap, missing Usher's cue to extend the intro to Superstar, and coming in four bars early. Not disastrous, but still unusual for a show on this level.\nThe hits were punctuated by numerous interludes, narrated by Celeste, a glitch-prone \"computer driven by AI technology to help Mr Raymond tell his story\",  from teen wannabe to global superstar, against a backdrop of infidelity, tabloid infamy, redemption and survival.\nThe problem was his songs couldn't support the weight of that story. With a few exceptions, Usher mostly sings about lusting after women in the club, and carnal pleasures in the bedroom.\nThe result was a weirdly disconnected show, where Usher followed a moving video about his absent father with a song about his ex, which he sung while straddling a motorbike.\nPriapism was a running theme. Women in the audience were fed with cocktail cherries (\"oh, it's your first time?\" Usher mugged into the camera)  and part of the stage was turned into a strip club, complete with pole dancers, during Bad Girl.\nThat sort of tongue-in-cheek raunch has been a hallmark of Usher's career, but it felt dated and shallow in a concert that promised an intimate look into his personality. \nPerhaps he just wanted us to know that, deep down, he really, really likes sex.\n\nLuckily, the songs still hold up. A trio of quiet storm ballads - Climax, Burn and Confessions Part II - had couples serenading each other, while a trio of women near me took the opportunity to slow dance a security guard who was mopping the floor.\nTo his credit, Usher sang everything live, with an airy falsetto that's undiminished after 30 years on tour. During U Got It Bad, he held one sustained note for over 10 seconds.\nAt times, he struggled to hold the audience's attention during the slow jams. The UK has always preferred him in club mode - and it was his three biggest-sellers, Yeah, OMG and DJ Got Us Falling In Love that really set the O2 alight.\nStrangely it was one of those empty club anthems, I Am The Party, that ultimately carried the most meaning.\n\"Hopefully my [music] has been something to you,\" Usher said over the introduction.\n\"Maybe we fell in love together, maybe we had a good time together, but something brought you here. And I just want you to know, I appreciate the connection.\"\n\"If I didn't have you to cheer me on, I wouldn't continue to do this.\"\nPop stars say this sort of thing all the time. But as he stood at the O2, drenched in sweat, remembering the father who abandoned him and soaking up the audience's affection, Usher didn't seem to be putting on an act.\nBy the encore, he'd given up all pretence of being a high-rolling playboy. \nInstead, he bounded around the stage, giddily filming the audience on his phone, as they hollered out the chorus to Without You.\nIf only that performer had shown up earlier.",

        "article_text": "President Volodymyr Zelensky was in a buoyant mood when I met him in Paris with a panel of three other European journalists. He had interrupted a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace and went back there for what he called a \"t\u00eate \u00e0 t\u00eate dinner\" after the interview. \nMacron had not just rolled out the red carpet for him. The Eiffel Tower, behind Zelensky in a picture window as we talked in one of Paris's great museums, was lit up in yellow and blue, the colours of the Ukrainian national flag.\nThe French wanted him to feel as if he was among friends. Zelensky had come to Paris to meet leaders and diplomats from 30 other countries who are working out what they can contribute to the \"coalition of the willing\", the group that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron are trying to organise to offer Ukraine security guarantees if there is a long-term ceasefire.\nZelensky's welcome in Paris was a clear contrast to the dressing down he was given by US President Donald Trump and his vice president JD Vance when he visited the White House last month. \nAfter their verbal attack, Zelensky was unceremoniously turfed out of the White House and not long afterwards Trump ordered the suspension of American military aid and intelligence to Ukraine.\nIt was restored after Zelensky, advised by the British, the French and other European allies, went out of his way to mend his fences with Trump and his administration. \nHe switched to the kind of flattering language Trump demands and agreed to an American plan for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.  He dropped his insistence on US security guarantees first, to underpin any ceasefire.\nBut even though US military and intelligence assistance is flowing, Trump's ruthless suspension of it, which cost Ukrainian lives, has left a deep sense of unease in Ukraine and among its European allies. \nThe evidence is piling up that Trump's United States is not a reliable ally. It is getting easier to sketch out scenarios in which it might not be an ally at all. \nMost European leaders still try to act publicly as if the 80-year-old alliance with the US is healthy. But the gathering of 30 countries in Paris shows they realise they can no longer rely on the benevolence of the United States. \nAmerican presidents going back to Dwight D. Eisenhower in the late 1950s have complained, with good reason, about Europeans getting a free ride from the US security blanket over Europe. Trump has finally pulled it away.\nDuring the interview, Zelensky praised the array of plans that are being formulated in western Europe \u2013 led by the UK, France and Germany \u2013 to spend more on defence. \nHe suggested that in three to five years, \"if everything goes as it is now\", Europe might even catch up with the United States. \nAt best, that is a highly optimistic estimate, less an accurate forecast and more a gesture of appreciation for European allies who unlike the Americans attach very few conditions and strings to support for Ukraine.\nEurope, Zelensky said, \"has discipline and no chaos\". That might be seen as an oblique and unflattering comparison with the twists and turns coming out of the Trump White House.\n\nI asked him about the conditions Russia's President Vladimir Putin has attached to the latest small step in the Trump peace initiative, which is a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea. \nAfter Ukraine and Russia held separate meetings with the Americans in Saudi Arabia, the Kremlin issued a statement that required concessions as Russia's price for a ceasefire. \nThe most significant demand was for a state-owned Russian bank to be readmitted to the Swift system for international payments. That would open a door back into mainstream global commerce for Russia. \nThat decision does not depend on Trump, as Swift is based in Belgium. \nThe European Union foreign affairs spokeswoman responded with a statement saying one of the \"main preconditions\" for lifting or amending sanctions on Russia was \"the end of the Russian unprovoked and unjustified aggression in Ukraine and the unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces from the entire territory of Ukraine\".\nEven Trump, reluctant to criticise Putin, suggested that Russia might be \"dragging its feet\" in the negotiations with the US. It reminded him of his own business career. \nHe told the US cable channel Newsmax that \"I've done it over the years\u2026 I don't want to sign a contract. I want to sort of stay in the game.\"\n\nI asked Zelensky where the push for a ceasefire stood, given Russia's demands. He called for a resolute response from the Americans.\n\"If America is going to stand strong and not bend to the conditions of the Russians - we stand on our land. \n\"We are defending it; we have shown our resilience to everyone\u2026 And now it's very important that our partners would be resilient and strong, at least at the minimum, as we are.\"\nI asked whether he believed the Americans would, as he put it, stay strong.\n\"I hope so. I hope so. God bless they will. But we'll see.\"\nZelensky has no choice about stating his faith in Trump's America, even though he must have grave doubts. \nTrump's decision to punish Ukraine by cutting off military intelligence about Russia missile launches had an immediate and deadly impact, and Zelensky had to work hard to get Trump to relent. He does not want it to happen again.\nHe was open about why he had to try to stay close to Trump, even as the US president seemed to be prioritising the restoration of relations with Moscow as he repeated Russian propaganda points, not least the lie that Ukraine started the war.\n\"We needed to unblock the aid from the US. For us, the exchange of intelligence is very important.\"\n\nThat did not stop Zelensky rebuking comments made by Steve Witkoff, Trump's super envoy, a real estate billionaire turned diplomat who deals with the Middle East as well as the Russian-Ukraine war. \nIn an interview last week with Tucker Carlson, a right-wing podcaster in the United States, Witkoff disparaged the drive by the UK's Starmer and France's Macron to create the \"coalition of the willing\" to support Ukraine. \nThe American said it was a posture and pose, \"a simplistic desire\" to sound like Winston Churchill. His words fit squarely into what seems now to be a settled view in the Trump Administration that their erstwhile allies in Europe are a parasitical burden on the United States. \nWhat if Witkoff was right? Strip away the insults and recognise that Europe's richest nations have chosen, for decades, to spend most of their considerable wealth on matters they consider more pressing than their militaries.\nZelensky said Witkoff and others in the Trump administration, had fallen for Russian propaganda.\n\"I think that Witkoff often quotes the Kremlin narratives\u2026 I can't be ungrateful to the Americans for everything they did, but they are often, unfortunately, under the influence of Russian narratives. And we cannot agree with these narratives.\"\nZelensky suggested that Witkoff was better at his old job, developing real estate in Manhattan.\n\"He doesn't look like a military man. He doesn't look like a general, and he doesn't have such experience. As far as I know, he is very good at selling and buying real estate. And this is a little different.\"\n\nPresident Zelensky, for a man who has lived with immense pressure since Russia's full scale invasion more than three years ago, was remarkably buoyant, clearly pleased by the reception he had in Paris and the efforts that President Macron and Prime Minister Starmer are making to rally European support and to persuade, even cajole,  Trump not to cut intelligence and military support to Ukraine. \nZelensky seemed happy with his new strategy of agreeing to temporary ceasefires to force Putin to show his reluctance to pause the war.\nI asked Zelensky how he was dealing with the pressure. His goal, he said, was for his children to be able \"to walk down the street and not have to hide.\" And how did he think he'd be remembered; as the man who saved Ukraine, or tried to and failed? Zelensky grimaced slightly. Better, he said, than Putin, who was getting old and feared his own people.\n\"He will die soon. It is a fact. His reign could end before he finishes his historically insignificant and unsuccessful life. This is what he fears.\"\nZelensky laughed.\n\"And I will do everything I can to defend Ukraine as much as I can. And I am definitely younger than Putin.\"\nTrump might be hoping for a deal by Easter. Zelensky is still looking to the long haul.",

In China last weekend, he qualified last for both the sprint and the grand prix, and finished 14th and 12th.\nWorld champion Verstappen was second in Melbourne and fourth in Shanghai. The next race is the Japanese Grand Prix, from 4-6 April.\nLawson, 23, admitted he found his demotion \"tough\" but said he is excited to work with his former team Racing Bulls.\n\"Being a Red Bull Racing driver has been my dream since I was a kid, it's what I've worked towards my whole life,\" he wrote on Instagram.\n\"I'm grateful for everything that's brought me to this point. To every one of you who's stood by me, thank you for all the support. It means the world.\"\nMarko said that Tsunoda, 24, would be given \"to the end of the season\" at Red Bull to prove himself \"because we believe he can do the job\".\nAsked why the Japanese was the right driver now, when they had decided at the end of last season that Lawson was a better bet, Marko said: \"Tsunoda made a big step. It's strange after four years, now in his fifth year, he is a much stronger personality, he has more confidence and he did two very good races, it's just his strategy didn't work at Racing Bulls.\n\"In this case, a very difficult car experience is something that will help. That was our thoughts.\"\nMarko said that Red Bull decided not to give Lawson another chance at the Japanese Grand Prix, which is the first race this season to be held on a circuit Lawson has experienced before, because \"we were worried that his self-confidence is so damaged that he couldn't bring his normal performance\".\nHe added: \"And on the other hand we have two drivers for the constructors' championship but also to support Max strategy-wise, if you have two drivers top five or eight it is easier to max a strategy that favours the number-one driver.\"\nMarko insisted that the swap with Tsunoda was \"not a demotion\" for Lawson.\n\"He's not kicked out of F1 and Racing Bulls will give him the chance to recover and his career will start again,\" Marko said.\nHe pointed to the experience of drivers Red Bull had previously dropped as evidence that Lawson could rebuild his career.\nMarko said: \"For the benefit for him, he goes back to Racing Bulls, which has a car capable to be top 10 in qualifying and the race.\n\"Just look in the past, it was [Pierre] Gasly, it happened the same, also to [Alex] Albon and they recovered and they are now competitive F1 drivers.\n\"On top of it, the RB21 is a car which is not the fastest car but nevertheless very difficult to drive and Max can handle but not at this stage Liam.\"\nRed Bull confirm Tsunoda to replace Lawson\nAndrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions\nRed Bull's driver errors go back to last spring, when they decided to re-sign Sergio Perez on a new contract to the end of 2026 rather than take Carlos Sainz, who was a free agent following Ferrari's decision to sign Lewis Hamilton for 2025.\nPerez's performances slumped and at the end of last season Red Bull paid him off and took Lawson instead.\nMarko said: \"In hindsight it is always easy to say but when he was available it was a different situation with Red Bull Racing. \n\"In the beginning of the year, Sergio Perez finished second twice and was performing and it just came later that Sergio had problems with the car and his performance dropped.\"\nMarko said he believed Red Bull could fix the problems with their car and deliver a fifth title for Verstappen.\nBut he admitted the Dutchman could consider leaving if the car's pace did not improve.\n\"We have this huge motivation to achieve this fifth title,\" Marko said. \"We also know that if we don't deliver for Max, all the top drivers have performance clauses in their contract.\n\"So we have to make sure he gets a car where he can win and there was a very constructive meeting last Thursday, Max with the engineers, and they discussed how to go forward to improve the car and make it more drivable and to have a wider range of drivability, and all that went very positive.\n\"So it's just two races, we are eight points behind. And the whole team is focused to achieve this fifth title which we didn't make with [Sebastian] Vettel but this time there is a possibility.\n\"And if you look at the lap times from Max on the hard tyre [in the Chinese Grand Prix], we were competitive but not everywhere like on the McLaren but we are not so much off as it looks sometimes.\"\nMeanwhile, Verstappen appeared to offer his opinion on Lawson's demotion by 'liking' an Instagram, external post from former F1 driver Giedo van der Garde that described it as a \"panic move\".\nWhat's the future for F1 engines and why is it up for debate?\nWere Ferrari at fault or unlucky with disqualifications?",

I don't think so,\" Hardy told MMA Fighting, external. \"Even old guys in MMA could still handle business, I think, with Jake Paul. That's the main purpose he's serving right now.",

Then he hung up.\nThat phone call - described to BBC Sport by several sources in the room at the time - took place in the morning of the day of F1's season launch at the O2 Arena in London in February, where both Horner and governing body the FIA were booed by the 15,000-strong crowd.\nTwo days later, FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem - a man whose three-year tenure has been beset by controversy - posted a message on Instagram.\nBen Sulayem said he \"looked forward\" to the new chassis and engine rules that are  to be introduced in 2026, but that the FIA \"must also lead the way on future technological motorsport trends.\n\"We should consider a range of directions, including the roaring sound of the V10 running on sustainable fuel.\"\nThese developments have kick-started a debate inside F1 about engines. The ground is shifting fast, so what's going on?\nNext year, F1 is going through the biggest regulation change in the sport's history, introducing new rules for both cars and engines.\nOn engines, F1 is sticking with 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids, the basic architecture that has been in place since 2014, but changing the balance between electric and combustion power.\nThe amount of total power provided by the hybrid is going up to about 50% from about 20% now. In addition, F1 is introducing sustainable fuels - abandoning fossil fuels in favour of synthetic fuel created from biomass and industrial processes.\nThis is all part of the sport's pledge to become net-zero carbon by 2030.\nThis video can not be played\nF1 in 10 Years: Lando Norris\nEver since hybrid engines were introduced in 2014, some have bemoaned the loss of the louder, more dramatic sound produced by the naturally aspirated engines that preceded them - especially the 3.0-litre V10s last raced in F1 in 2005.\nIn an unavoidable parallel with Ben Sulayem's actions now, Ecclestone was the first person to bring this up, even before the 2014 engines first raced.\nA certain romanticism about the V10 sound has sustained, as has the idea that those engines - with their ear-splitting shriek that could be heard some distance from the track - are more popular with the fanbase than the current hybrids.\nWithin F1, there is no question that some people agree. Lewis Hamilton said at the Chinese Grand Prix last weekend: \"It is no secret that the V6 has never sounded great.\n\"I remember the first time I came to an F1 race in 1996 in Spa and arriving and Michael (Schumacher) coming through Turn One and my rib cage just vibrated. I was so hooked. It was the most amazing thing I felt and heard.\n\"Over the years we've lost that. If we are able to move back to those amazing sounding engines and still able to see the sustainable goals, why not?\"\nFernando Alonso took his 2005 title-winning Renault R25 - with V10 engine - for a demonstration run on track before the 2020 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix\nIt's not that long since Ben Sulayem was trumpeting his involvement in the introduction of the 2026 engine rules.\nThese were fundamentally settled under the previous FIA president Jean Todt, but there was inevitable wrangling and it got over the line only after Ben Sulayem took office.\nTwo years ago, he said the new engines were \"at the forefront of technological innovation, making the future of F1 more sustainable while maintaining the spectacular racing\".\nSo why the U-turn?\nBen Sulayem has asked his F1 single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis to look into the matter.\nTombazis said that the advent of\u00a0sustainable fuels could allow F1 to make the engines simpler and cheaper.\n\"That's why the president made the comments about V10 engines in '28 - or '29 or whatever - and so on,\" Tombazis said. \"And that is something we are evaluating with the manufacturers.\"\nSenior figures within F1 and the car manufacturers involved in the sport see many problems with the FIA's position.\nOn a macro level, the climate crisis is very real, and the global road-car industry is heading in the direction of electrification - even if Donald Trump's election at the head of a government of climate deniers has given pause for thought in the US.\nManufacturers take part in F1 fundamentally for marketing reasons, and the sport has been made more appealing by the introduction of a budget cap for cars and engines.\nAudi, Ford and General Motors are all entering F1 in 2026 - and Honda are staying rather than withdrawing - specifically because of the new engine rules.\nAudi has already released a statement in response to the latest developments, saying that the new rules \"were a key factor in Audi's decision to enter Formula 1\".\nMercedes says it is open to discussions but would need a hybrid element to be part of any new engine formula for it to remain interested.\nThen there is the micro level.\nWhy a V10? No major road-car manufacturer uses them any more.\nMercedes says a V8 would make more sense if a change was to be made, as at least they are still being developed for road use.\nAnd why abandon turbochargers, when many performance road cars - from Audi RS6s or Mercedes AMG C63s to McLaren and Ferrari hypercars - use them for very good reasons?\nCost? Yes, a V10 might be cheaper than a hybrid. But the manufacturers have already spent an estimated collective $400m on the new engines. They are not about to throw that away.\nAnd a new V10 would require developing, to the tune of hundreds of millions more.\nWeight? Yes, the hybrid engines make the cars heavier, largely because of the batteries needed. But the majority of the weight increase from 550kg or so in 2005 to about 800kg now is accounted for by advances in safety, such as the halo head-protection device.\nOn top of that, in 2013, cars started races with about 160kg of fuel. Now, it's about 100kg and it's expected to be about the same next year. Returning to naturally aspirated engines would mean a huge increase in fuel capacity - and weight.\nSustainability? The new fuels being introduced next year are not net-zero carbon. According to scientific standards, sustainable fuels reduce carbon emissions by a little above 80%.\nThat's a lot. But doubling the amount of fuel used by abandoning hybrid engines would mean a doubling of the carbon emissions produced by fuel.\nThe emissions from the cars themselves are minuscule in the big picture - F1's transport around the world is much more significant. Still, the symbolism matters.\nRed Bull boss Christian Horner and FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem are both said to be interested in a return to V10 engines\nIn F1, politics are always involved.\nIt has escaped the attention of few that Ben Sulayem's intervention came after the crowd at the O2 booed when the FIA logo was shown.\nThis is an election year at the FIA, and some believe Ben Sulayem may have raised the idea of V10s because he thinks it will be popular with certain demographics who support him.\nSo far, no candidate has put themselves forwards to oppose him, but there are whispers that there is a credible opponent in the wings.\nAt the same time, word is creeping out in F1 about the progress the various manufacturers are making with their 2026 engines. And it seems that Mercedes are leading the way.\nPeople are already beginning to say that a team will only win in 2026 if it has a Mercedes engine.\nOf course, there is no proof of this, but the whispers are emerging in exactly the same way as similar ones did in 2013 - and they were proved exactly right when the hybrid engines made their debut the following year.\nThe V10 proposal is seen by rival teams as very much a Horner-Ben Sulayem agenda, even if it is said to have some support from Ferrari.\nEven Horner, while saying that \"the concept of a V10 would be very exciting for the sport\" acknowledges that abandoning the rules would be \"a massive departure from what is being worked on very hard for 2026\".\nA U-turn for 2026 now would need support from the teams and manufacturers - and there is not a chance that enough of them would support that to get it through.\nA leading team boss told BBC Sport on condition of anonymity that there have been \"zero discussions\" of this idea in the group of F1 stakeholders.\nIt takes time - years - to agree engine rules.\nIt would probably be two years before a full agreement could be reached. Then the manufacturers would need the same time again to develop and build the engines. Which would take F1 to the end of 2029. Which is only a year before the new rules are due to expire anyway.\nAs one team boss puts it: \"I think this will all peter out, and it will just end up becoming: 'What will 2031 look like?'\"\nThe FIA says: \"There needs to be a consultation between all stakeholders to agree on a way forward, before we fully explore different scenarios.\n\"Whichever direction is chosen, we must support the teams and manufacturers in ensuring cost control on R&D expenditure and take account of environmental and sustainability considerations.\"\nAnd the chances of the end result being a naturally aspirated V10, in the context of all the above?

        "article_text": "South Africa's former ambassador to the US has told the BBC it was \"self-evident\" that there was racism within the Trump administration.\nEbrahim Rasool, 62, was ordered to leave the US last week after Secretary of State Marco Rubio called him a \"race-baiting politician who hates America\". \nThis came after Rasool accused US President Donald Trump of trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\".\nAsked by the BBC's Newshour whether he believed the Trump administration was racist, Rasool said: \"I think it is self-evident rather than anyone needing to be called out.\"\nThe BBC has approached the White House for comment.\nIn one of his first interviews since being expelled from the US, Rasool added: \"I'm saying when a piece of wood has a hinge, you begin to suspect it's a door.\" \nThe diplomat cited the administration's emphasis on deporting migrants as well as the targeting of foreign students who had supported pro-Palestinian protests. He also accused Trump's team of mobilising \"certain far-right communities\".\nThe Trump administration has denied accusations of racism. The president says he has a mandate to deport thousands of migrants who entered the US illegally after it formed a central part of his election campaign last year. Rubio has defended revoking visas for students who \"cause chaos\" on college campuses.\nUS-South Africa relations have deteriorated sharply since Trump returned to power in mid-January. \nSince taking office, Trump and his ally, South-Africa born Elon Musk, have singled out South Africa, in particular criticising it over its land reform policies.\nTrump has cut all aid to the country and, despite his hard-line stance on most refugees and asylum seekers, says that members of South Africa's white, Afrikaner community would be granted refugee status in the US because of the persecution he says they face at home. \nSouth Africa's government says it is trying to correct the country's racial and economic imbalances following decades of white-minority rule by passing measures to help the country's black majority.\nRasool denied that the Afrikaner population was facing discrimination.\n\"It is an unadulterated lie because it tries to besmirch the very DNA of a new South Africa that was born under the leadership of someone like Nelson Mandela,\" he told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme.\nWhen questioned whether his language was undiplomatic, Rasool said: \"It's not as if being a good boy warded off any punishment. It was that at some point South Africa's dignity is also at stake - you can't smile through too many untruths being told about your country.\"\nAfter returning home to a hero's welcome on Sunday, Rasool said that he had no regrets about his remarks. \nAsked whether he was surprised by the reaction to his remarks, Rasool said he was surprised by the \"thinness of the skin\" of the US administration and its \"ability to dish out and not to accept an intellectual dissecting of what is [said]\".\nHe added: \"We've smiled through a lie about white genocide, we've smiled through the punishment of cutting all aid... we've smiled through all of that. \n\"We've tried all the conventional ways to get [to] them, until you hit a brick wall and you begin to say: This is not the normal phenomenon of diplomacy.\"\nWhile he accepted that his role as a diplomat was to try and \"maintain a line of communication\", Rasool said: \"Diplomacy is not to flatter your host into into liking you. Diplomacy is not lying along and making as if lies are truth. \n\"I think what I did was to the best of my intellectual capacity to describe a phenomenon back home in order for me to alert them that it cannot be business as usual.\"\nRelations between the US and South Africa, characterised by ups and downs over the years, hit rock bottom earlier this year, with Trump's cutting of aid to the country, citing the new Expropriation Law, which allows the government to confiscate land without compensation in certain circumstances.\nAnother bone of contention for the US has been the case lodged by South Africa against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in December 2023.\nSouth Africa has accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians living in Gaza, an allegation Israel denies.\nRasool returned to the US last year, having previously served as US ambassador from 2010 to 2015, when Barack Obama was president.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Brazil were beaten 4-1 by Argentina in their most recent World Cup qualifier\nIn any previous World Cup, there would be genuine fear about Brazil failing to qualify. Not this time.\nIn an expanded competition, with six South American teams making it through automatically, Brazil have a six-point cushion over a Venezuela team who have just registered their first victory in 10 games.\nWith four rounds to go, it is impossible to see Brazil not making the cut. But that is hardly the point.\nFor Brazil, World Cup qualification now serves one purpose - it provides a sequence of competitive matches during which they hope to build a side capable of winning the trophy. And with just over a year to go until 2026, that looks a long way off.\nIt is easy to forget how good Brazil were in the last World Cup, where they lost in the quarter-finals on penalties to a Croatia team whose only shot on goal in the match took a cruel deflection.\nThe Qatar 2022 Brazil side were solid - goalkeeper Alisson could have taken a deckchair out for most of the games - with flashes of brilliance. They could have won that competition. \nSo why have they fallen back so much? How can a team packed with so many good players form such a dismal unit?\nThe team that were thrashed 4-1 by Argentina on Tuesday appeared to have no midfield, and were unable either to attack or defend.\nDorival Junior is under pressure following the heavy defeat by Argentina\nTuesday's prolonged humiliation did not come out of the blue. \nIn game after game the team have looked disjointed, without clear strategies for progressing the ball down the field, and suffering from the possibility of being both outplayed and outnumbered in central midfield. \nIndividual talent has papered over the cracks - like on Thursday, when a stoppage-time Vinicius Jr special gave them a victory over Colombia their play had not really deserved. \nBut it can't happen all the time.\nAnd if the film is bad, especially if the cast is impressive, the director must be to blame. \nThere is a crisis in Brazilian coaching. It is hard to produce coaches when there is no time to train and no job security. That is the reality of domestic Brazilian football, and helps explain why almost all of the successful coaches in the country are now foreign - either Argentine or, especially, Portuguese.\nThe national boss - for now anyway - Dorival Jr is a product of the domestic game, with more than four decades' experience as player and coach. \nBut on the international stage he comes across as a decent man thoroughly out of his depth.\nDid he really think he could travel to Argentina and play two men in central midfield? Why not drop deep and create space for the counter-attack, as he did a year ago against England at Wembley? And when cool heads were required, his team came across as a bag of nerves, all too willing to get involved in cheap spats.\nOf the three duties of the coach - pick the team, determine the strategy and set the emotional tone - Dorival failed dismally, and it is very hard to see how he can keep his job.\nIf he is to be replaced, there would seem to be two options. One is to go foreign - the Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus would be a strong candidate. The other would be to fast-track former Chelsea left-back Filipe Luis - a man of great intelligence who has made an impressive start to his coaching career with Rio giants Flamengo.\nWhoever comes in - or Dorival if he manages to hang on - will have to deal with a simple observation - central midfield is not an optional extra.\nIt is an area where Brazil have had a problem for a while - a consequence of the 1990s trend of splitting the middle of the park into a pair of midfielders who only defend and a duo who mostly attack. It was at this point Brazilian play lost much of its former fluency, instead investing in rapid breaks down the flanks.\nIt is in this context that the problems of Lucas Paqueta are so significant. \nThe West Ham midfielder was on the verge of becoming a big-money Manchester City signing when scandal struck, and his career - now threatened - has not recovered.\nThe evidence of Dorival's first games in charge - a year ago away to England and Spain - was Paqueta had become the most important player in the team, the man capable of filling space in midfield, dictating the rhythm of the game and unleashing the pace of the likes of Vinicius Jr.\nRonaldo quits Brazil federation presidency race\nAlisson returns to Liverpool after 'suspected concussion'\nThe absence of Paqueta almost certainly led to Dorival building his hopes for these international dates around the return of Neymar - which, predictably, turned out to be ludicrously premature.\nAfter so long out injured, it was only to be expected that Neymar would run into muscular problems, and he will need much more time on the field to ease his way back to a level where he can tip the balance.\nAt 33, he is an unknown quantity. But there is a gaping hole in the team for the type of deep-lying playmaker role he could fill. \nRomantics might recall 2002, when Ronaldo looked all washed up only to make a triumphant return from injury and carry a Brazil side that almost failed to qualify all the way to World Cup title number five. \nThey are still waiting for number six. \nIf they can do it next year then, in the wake of Tuesday's humiliation, it will be a candidate for one of football's great comebacks.\nNeymar's absence from the Brazil team was prolonged by a muscular injury",

        "article_text": "Countries around the world are braced for Donald Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day in America!!!\" next week.\nThe US president's deadline to impose reciprocal tariffs on trading partners will come just days after he hit foreign carmakers with 25% import taxes.\nVietnam could be particularly vulnerable to Trump's latest salvo of levies. It has a large trade deficit with the US and has been a beneficiary of firms moving factories out of China to avoid measures announced during his first term in office.\nWhile some countries have hit back at Washington, Vietnam's Prime Minister, Pham Minh Chinh, has suggested that he may take a more diplomatic approach.\nSpeaking in January, he said he was willing to visit Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and \"golf all day long\" if it benefits his country, drawing laughter in the room.\nAnd that idea may not be too far-fetched. The Trump Organization is planning to invest billions of dollars in golf courses, hotels and real estate in Vietnam, according to the Reuters news agency.\nThe first project will reportedly be a residential complex with three 18-hole golf courses, which will break ground in May. \nThe BBC has contacted the company and its Vietnamese partner for comment.\nBut could golf diplomacy really work?\nTrump has previously said Vietnam was \"worse than China\" and \"almost the single worst abuser of anybody\". \nBut he has not yet specifically targeted Vietnam with tariffs, even though it has the third largest trade deficit with the US, after China and Mexico. \nAnalysts say Vietnam is doing well at engaging with Washington - but its efforts may still not be enough to avoid most of Trump's tariff plans.\n\"The Vietnam PM seems to be taking a page from the book of [former Japanese PM] Shinzo Abe, who built a close personal relationship with Trump over their shared love of golf,\" said Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator.\n\"I would not however expect any special treatment of Vietnam from a policy point of view. Personal relationships are important to Trump, but in this case, I believe his desire to appear tough on trade will win out.\"\nVietnam has said it doesn't plan to \"restrict trade\" with the US, although it currently taxes some imports from there.\nThe government said this week that it will allow SpaceX, which is owned by close Trump ally Elon Musk, to operate its Starlink satellite internet service in the country on a trial basis.\nSome analysts see this as one of the measures Vietnam has taken to avoid being hit with US tariffs.\nHanoi also said it will lower tariffs on several US imports, including energy and cars, a move aimed at \"improving trade balances\".\nIt came less than two weeks after Vietnamese and US companies signed more than $4bn (\u00a35.4bn) in deals, in areas including oil and gas exploration.\nSteve Norris from the consultancy Control Risks said \"Vietnam is being careful to avoid any moves which would signal any non-cooperation on trade issues\".\nThis strategy is in line with its foreign policy approach - known as \"bamboo diplomacy\". Like shoots of plants that sway with the wind, Vietnam hopes to be adaptable to foreign pressures.\n\"If the US were to increase pressure on Vietnam, the government might respond with offers to facilitate investments in the hospitality and casino industries, undertake advanced machinery purchases, and \u2013 capturing the moment \u2013 consider access to Vietnam's rare earth minerals,\" Mr Norris said.\nOne big factor working against Vietnam is concerns about China's influence.\nVietnam was one of the biggest beneficiaries of US-China tensions during Trump's first term.\nIn 2018, he hit China with tariffs, causing some businesses to rethink where they made their products. Some chose to shift manufacturing to Vietnam. \nThis has led to an increase of exports from Vietnam to the US, with Chinese companies that have moved production there contributing to that figure.\nFormer US trade negotiator Wendy Cutler said Vietnam has emerged as a \"destination for major Chinese investment\".\nWhile the US remains Vietnam's biggest export market, China is its largest supplier of goods, accounting for more than a third of imports, according to the latest official data. \nChinese firms were also behind nearly one in every three new investments in Vietnam last year.\n\"These are huge red flags for Trump. My expectation is that Vietnam will at some point be hit hard by tariffs,\" Mr Olson said.\nHowever, tariffs on Vietnam could impact US businesses such as tech firms Apple and Intel, and sportswear giant Nike, which have moved production lines from China to Vietnam.\nA recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam found that most US manufacturers there expect to lay off staff if tariffs are imposed.\nThe US president believes the levies will boost his country's economy by encouraging more businesses to make goods in the US and bring in billions of dollars of taxes. \nBut many economists have warned that it could force up prices for American consumers and negatively impact global trade.\nWashington is also concerned about so-called \"trans-shipments\" - Chinese goods passing through Vietnam on their way to other countries. \nUS officials have been \"quietly stressing to Vietnam that it must reduce its trade surplus over time and combat the trans-shipment of Chinese goods through the country,\" Mr Norris said.\nVietnam's prime minister has said he is confident that his administration can \"handle the relationship with the US\".\nNow that the South East Asian nation has cut some tariffs on US goods they may be more attractive to Vietnamese consumers, increasing America's share of trade with the country.\nAnd then there is golf - playing a game with Trump had worked for the late Japanese leader Shinzo Abe.\nAbe and Trump established a friendship, which included many golf games over several years. The friendship arguably helped Abe secure tariff exemptions for Japan's critical car industry at the time.\nFor now, it is unclear if Vietnam would really give golf diplomacy a swing.\nThe real test will come next week, when a new slate of Trump's taxes are set to take effect.

He also accused Trump's team of mobilising \"certain far-right communities\".\nThe Trump administration has denied accusations of racism. The president says he has a mandate to deport thousands of migrants who entered the US illegally after it formed a central part of his election campaign last year. Secretary of State Rubio has defended revoking student visas for those who \"cause chaos\" on college campuses.\nUS-South Africa relations have deteriorated sharply since Trump returned to power in mid-January. \nSince taking office, Trump and his ally, South-Africa born Elon Musk, have singled out South Africa for special criticism, in particular over its land reform policies.\nTrump has cut all aid to the country, and despite his hard-line stance on most refugees and asylum seekers he says that members of South Africa's white, Afrikaner community would be granted refugee status in the US, because of the persecution he said they faced at home. \nSouth Africa's government says it is trying to correct the country's racial and economic imbalances following decades of white-minority rule, by passing measures to help the country's black majority.\nRasool denied that the Afrikaner population was facing discrimination.\n\"It is an unadulterated lie because it tries to besmirch the very DNA of a new South Africa that was born under the leadership of someone like Nelson Mandela,\" he told the BBC World Service in one of his first interviews since arriving back in South Africa.\nWhen questioned whether his language was undiplomatic, Mr Rasool said: \"It's not as if being a good boy warded off any punishment. It was that at some point South Africa's dignity is also at stake \u2013 you can't smile through too many untruths being told about your country.\"\nAfter returning home to a hero's welcome on Sunday, Rasool said he had no regrets about his remarks. \nAsked by the BBC on Friday whether he was surprised by the reaction to his utterances, Rasool said the surprise for him was the \"thinness of the skin\" of the US administration and its \"ability to dish out and not to accept an intellectual dissecting of what is [said]\".\n\"We've smiled through a lie about white genocide, we've smiled through the punishment of cutting all aid... we've smiled through all of that. \n\"We've tried all the conventional ways to get [to] them until you hit a brick wall and you begin to say: This is not the normal phenomenon of diplomacy.\"\nWhile he accepted that his role as a diplomat was to try and \"maintain a line of communication\" and integrity, Rasool said: \"Diplomacy is not to flatter your host into into liking you. Diplomacy is not lying along and making as if lies are truth. \n\"I think what I did was to the best of my intellectual capacity to describe a phenomenon back home in order for me to alert them that it cannot be business as usual.\"\nRelations between the US and South African, characterised by ups and downs over the years, hit rock bottom earlier this year when Trump cut aid to the country citing the new Expropriation Law, which allows the government to confiscate land without compensation in certain circumstances.\nAnother bone of contention for the US has been the case lodged by South Africa against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in December 2023.\nSouth Africa has accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians living in Gaza, an allegation Israel denies.\nRasool returned to the US last year after having previously served as US ambassador from 2010 to 2015, when Barack Obama was president.\n\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "For the past 48 hours, top White House officials have faced questions from lawmakers and the press about how a journalist came to join a sensitive group chat for an upcoming military operation - and why President Donald Trump's national security team was sharing sensitive information in an unsecure manner.\nThe Atlantic first reported details of the group chat on the platform Signal after its editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was added to it. He followed the thread as top Trump administration officials discussed upcoming military strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.\nA National Security Council spokesman later confirmed that the portions of the chat that Mr Goldberg initially shared \"appears to be authentic\".\nThe Atlantic then on Wednesday published the entire text thread that showed the detailed and potentially classified rundown for a March strike on Yemen after Mr Goldberg and the publication faced pushback from the Trump administration. \nWhile the thread appears to have contained sensitive information, there is still much that remains unknown. Here are six lingering questions regarding so-called \"Signal-gate\".\nThe Trump administration maintains the information shared in the chat was not classified.\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told lawmakers during a congressional hearing that the Signal chat was \"candid and sensitive\" but \"no classified information was shared\".\nBut under questioning, she and CIA Director John Ratcliffe appeared uncertain about the classification of the attack plan. They later emphasised that Hegseth had the power to classify and declassify the type of details that were shared. \nHegseth has denied sharing classified material, but experts are sceptical that this type of sensitive information would not carry that kind of designation.\n\"The idea this wasn't classified information at the time is inconceivable,\" Glenn Gerstell, former general counsel of the National Security Agency, told the BBC. \"I don't know if they declassified it afterwards but any imminent military action involving American troops would have been classified at the time.\"\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that \"no war plans\" were discussed on the chat. Instead, she characterised the information shared as  \"sensitive policy discussions\".\nJamil Jaffer, executive director of the National Security Institute at George Mason University, said that Hegseth did not send \"an operational plan for World War Three, or for the Pacific region\".\n\"But at the same time,\" Mr Jaffer said, \"these are operational details that could, if released publicly, put American lives at risk or jeopardise the success of the operation.\"\nIn his original article, Mr Goldberg reports that on 11 March he initially \"received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz\", Trump's national security adviser.\nTwo days later, he writes that he received a notice that he was to be included in a Signal group titled the \"Houthi PC small group.\"\nMr Goldberg reports that the group received a message from Waltz, which also noted one of his deputies was \"pulling together\" a team of top staffers relevant to the discussion. \nOn Tuesday, Trump suggested that a \"lower level\" staffer for Waltz added Mr Goldberg to the chat.\nHowever, Waltz himself told Fox News' Laura Ingraham: \"I take full responsibility. I built the - I built the group.\"\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who was also in the group, said on Wednesday that someone had made a \"mistake\" in adding Mr Goldberg.\nIt remains to be seen whether Congress will launch oversight investigations, which it has the power to pursue.\nTrump is a Republican, and both chambers of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate - are controlled by his party.\nThat means committees who have oversight of the executive branch, military, and intelligence community are run by Republicans.\nRepublican lawmakers have emphatically supported the Trump administration's agenda to this point, so it seems improbable that they would support investigations into the Signal chat.\nDemocrats in the House are reportedly trying to force a vote on a \"Resolution of Inquiry\" that would require the Trump administration to hand over records related to the incident, according to Reuters, but they do not have a majority. \nWhile some Republicans have raised concerns over the leak, few have appeared eager to cross the president. \nDemocratic lawmakers are calling for resignations, but at the moment, none of the officials involved in the Signal chat have stepped down.\nHegseth and Waltz have faced the most calls to resign, and some cabinet officials have said that their process will go under review. \n\"I think there'll be reforms and changes made,\" Rubio told reporters on Wednesday.\nStill, it is unclear if the president will ask any members of his team to step down. So far, the White House has launched a full-court defence of the Signal chat and the officials who participated.\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office that Waltz \"took responsibility\", but has previously maintained that he has not lost confidence in his national security adviser.\nHegseth also appears safe from Trump's ire for now.\n\"Hegseth is doing a great job. He had nothing to do with this,\" the president said. \nThe use of Signal to discuss the Houthi strikes posed broader questions about how Trump's top staffers are sharing and discussing sensitive information.\nGabbard testified on Wednesday that Signal came \"pre-installed on government devices\".\nShe cited guidance from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which mentioned Signal as an example of a messaging service with end-to-end encryption.\nRatcliffe earlier testified to Congress that Signal had been installed on his devices when he took over the CIA.\nBut it remains uncertain if security officials had provided guidance about using Signal for discussing military operations like the strikes against the Houthis.\n\"Whether these circumstances were approved or not is still not clear,\" Mr Jaffer said.\nCBS News, the BBC's US partner, has reported, however, that the US National Security Agency had warned employees against using Signal due to \"a vulnerability\" that they had identified.\n\"The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" warned the NSA bulletin that was shared a month before the Houthi Strike chat. \nThe group chat appears to suggest that the officials' discussion was one that had continued from the White House Situation Room, one of the most secure venues in the US government. \nThis is unusual. Oftentimes further discussion or the inclusion of team members who cannot attend in person is done via secure rooms called sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIFs. \nTop-ranking national security officials have these SCIFs installed in their offices and homes to ensure the protection of sensitive information and discussions. \nThat can add a layer of complexity to planning and coordination, however, which may have led to lax security system standards. \n\"Whatever they have might not be effective enough,\" Mr Jaffer said. \"Or there's so many restrictions on it, that it forces senior officials into workarounds that themselves might create vulnerabilities.\"",

        "article_text": "The daring, radical Pompidou Centre was derided by many when its design was first unveiled \u2013 yet it has continued to influence the architecture of public buildings ever since. As the building approaches a major renovation, its co-creator Renzo Piano recalls the furore.\nThis summer, the Centre Pompidou will close for five years, as Paris's popular polychrome landmark undergoes changes necessitated by current requirements in terms of health, safety and energy efficiency. French studio Moreau Kusunoki Architects, Mexican practice Frida Escobedo Studio and French engineer AIA Life Designers will undertake a major overhaul of the six-storey arts centre, containing Europe's largest museum of modern art. Its renovation will add usable floor space, remove asbestos from all facades, improve fire safety and accessibility for people with reduced mobility, and optimise energy efficiency.\nAs far as possible, the original building will be conserved as it was before. To do otherwise might be considered cultural sacrilege \u2013 after all the Pompidou's identity is indivisible from its original architects, Renzo Piano, and the late Richard Rogers. The duo set up their practice, Rogers + Piano, in 1970, and submitted a design to a prestigious competition instigated in 1971 by Georges Pompidou, France\u2019s President from 1969 until 1974. Its jury was headed up by Jean Prouv\u00e9, a metalworker and self-taught architect, and included such stellar architects as Philip Johnson and Oscar Niemeyer. Piano and Rogers' design was chosen from 681 competition entries.\nThe result caught the duo, then unknowns in their 30s \"with Beatles haircuts\", as Piano puts it, by surprise: \"We didn't think we'd win, we entered the competition for pleasure,\" the Italian architect, now 87, tells the BBC. \"We never planned to create a revolutionary building. Our idea was a museum that would inspire curiosity, not intimidate people, and that would open up culture to all.\"\nIn fact, the duo's insouciance may help to explain the building's uninhibited boldness, flamboyance and ludic quality. Its structural elements and services were placed on its facades, allowing it to maximise its internal, open-plan spaces \u2013 and prompting the futuristic structure to be dubbed the world\u2019s first \"inside-out\" building. Its exoskeleton of tubes and periscope-like pipes were playfully colour-coded: blue for air-conditioning, yellow for electricity, green for water and red for pedestrian circulation. Visitors streamed up escalators \u2013 encased in transparent tubing affording panoramic views \u2013 that were designed to reinforce the museum's connection to the city.\n\"Our idea was for the building to take up only half the site, allowing for a welcoming outdoor place \u2013 a piazza \u2013 where people could meet,\" says Piano, whose other projects include the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco (rebuilt in 2008), the Shard (2012) in London, and the recently completed Paddington Square, also in the UK capital, a mixed-use building and public square. \"Our credo was a place for all people \u2013 for the poor and rich, the young and old.\"\nCulture Shifters\nCulture Shifters is an interview series in which high-profile creatives reflect on a work of theirs which made a big impact on the world. Read more articles from the series\u00a0here.\nThe Pompidou's transparency, accessibility and adjacent piazza chimed with new ideas about democratising culture. \"Street theatre and concerts in public spaces were rising in popularity at the time,\" says Piano.\nInside the building, visitors had access to the Biblioth\u00e8que Publique d'Information \u2013 Paris's first free public library \u2013 the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne and the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/ Musique (IRCAM), dedicated to research of music and sound.\u00a0\nPiano and Rogers' winning entry provoked consternation and fury when it was announced at a press conference: \"The room was packed,\" remembers Piano. \"Richard and I were standing in the middle of the room being heckled. We felt elated yet terrible at the same time,\" says the architect. \"Some people were shouting, 'Why have you designed something so horrible?' 'Why are you are destroying Paris's historic centre?'\"\nAlthough surprised to have won the contest, Genoa-born Piano grew up feeling architecture was his destiny \u2013 aged 18, he told his father he wanted to be an architect. However in conversation his manner is humble, not entitled. Born into a family of builders in Genoa, he loved watching his father's work take shape. Perhaps his childhood experience of seeing buildings materialise successfully made him feel that architecture is open to all possibilities. \"Building is a beautiful gesture,\" he once told The Financial Times. \"It's the opposite of destruction\u2026 especially when you are creating buildings for people because they are civically important.\"\u00a0In 1981, Piano founded the Renzo Piano Building Workshop (RPBW), with offices in Genoa and Paris, led today by 11 partners (in the spirit of a collective). In 1998, he won the Pritzker Architecture Prize. \u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The swinging 60s icon who revolutionised style\n\u2022 The star tidying guru who transformed our homes\n\u2022 How to transform your home with art\nThe Plateau Beaubourg in central Paris \u2013 a stretch of wasteland occupied by a car park \u2013 was the site chosen for the new Mus\u00e9e Nationale d'Art Moderne (formerly housed in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris's haut-bourgeois 16th arrondissement). \"It was a place waiting for something to happen,\" says Piano.\nFrance's social and political climate at the time, still rebellious following the tumultuous events of May 1968, was conducive to the creation of a building as disruptive as the Centre Pompidou, acknowledges Piano: \"In Britain, society was being revolutionised by [designer] Mary Quant and the Beatles. The same was happening in Paris.\" The Centre Pompidou was partly inspired by the ultra-pop architecture of experimental London-based architecture collective Archigram.\n\"The idea that France should have a 'Maison de la Culture', bringing together art, cinema, music and literature in cities was first invented by Andr\u00e9 Malraux [novelist, art theorist and France's first Minister of Cultural Affairs].\u00a0Pompidou was very supportive, too. I really believe that major shifts in architecture are only possible if you have a good client. George's wife, Claude, too, was an excellent lady.\"\nPompidou, like Claude, was passionate about contemporary art and design.\u00a0In 1972, they invited Pierre Paulin, a designer known for his space-age era furniture, to create new interiors for the private apartment of the Elys\u00e9e Palace, the French presidents' official residence. The results were radically modern \u2013\u00a0the walls of the living room, dining room and smoking room were lined to cocooning effect with wool and polyester panels that obscured the residence's neo-classical splendour. Walls were hung with paintings by Robert Delaunay and other modernist artists.\nOne impetus behind these efforts to provide Paris with a prestigious museum was that France had lost its reputation as the world's pre-eminent centre of avant-garde art. \"It is my passionate wish for Paris to have a cultural centre like the ones they've been creating in the US,\" Pompidou told Le Monde newspaper in 1972. \"It will be both a museum and centre of creation, where the visual arts take up residence with music, film, books and audiovisual research.\"\nRENZO PIANO'S FIVE CULTURE SHIFTERS\nJorge Luis Borges \u2013 The Aleph and Other Stories (1949)\n In particular the short story called Story of the Warrior and the Captive.\nFilippo Brunelleschi \u2013 The dome of Florence Cathedral (1420-1436)\nItalo Calvino \u2013 The Baron in the Trees\u00a0 (1957)\n I love this novel for its lightness of being.\nHal Ashby \u2013 Being There (1979) \n This film is extraordinary for the irony with which it explores such an important topic as politics, and the gardener's metaphors, which are interpreted as wise practical guidance.\nPontus Hult\u00e9n \u2013 The\u00a0Paris-Moscow exhibition at the Pompidou Centre (1979)\n Because it was an exhibition about two worlds that did not know each other, but shared the same artistic and expressive urgencies.\nInitially, reactions to the Centre Pompidou, frequently compared to an alien spaceship, were often extremely negative. \"Taxi drivers used to say to me: 'Regardez!' before launching into a tirade against the building. With so much hostility, I had to keep a low profile among strangers,\" says Piano. The building, derisively likened by many to an \"oil refinery\", was the target of countless lawsuits. \"We were sued so often \u2013 once on the grounds that Prouv\u00e9 wasn't a qualified architect,\" he recalls. The French press initially lambasted the building. \"Paris has its own monster, just like the one in Loch Ness,\" scoffed Le Figaro.\n\"One day Richard and I were outside the building, as yet unfinished. We saw a woman struggling with an umbrella that had turned inside out in the wind and Richard rushed over to help fix it. When he mentioned that he was one of the building's architects, she jokily mimicked hitting him with the umbrella as if to suggest he was a naughty scoundrel.\"\nYet after the building's opening in 1977, Parisians soon began to appreciate the museum \u2013 now one of Paris's most visited public institutions, that ranks behind only the Louvre and Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in terms of visitor numbers.\nIt also inspires architects today. \"The Centre Pompidou, radical on completion, has continued to influence the design of public buildings ever since,\" says Hugh Broughton, founder of London-based Hugh Broughton Architects, who finds qualities in it other than its famously high-tech idiom. \"It's an amazingly brave, generous building whose large public space promotes congregation, street theatre and the highest quality people-watching. Its core concept \u2013 open-plan floor plates supported by peripheral structure and services \u2013 draws upon medieval principles of castle structures, and combines this with an Arts and Crafts approach that makes a virtue of construction as an aesthetic medium. The result is a building which is dynamic, inviting, egalitarian, transparent and has awesome views \u2013 all the best attributes of great architecture. It changed the way a whole generation of architects think about buildings \u2013 placing their users at centre stage.\"\nPiano is also known for harnessing light in his projects to ethereal effect, as is the case with the Shard, which can seem to disappear in certain light conditions due to its glass skin. Architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff has said of his works as a whole: \"The serenity of Renzo Piano's best buildings can almost make you believe we live in a civilised world.\"\u00a0\nFor Piano, what is the main architectural legacy of the Pompidou Centre? \"The building is proof that culture doesn't suffer from being more public. It's a place where people gather primarily. It brings together art, life and culture \u2013 not culture with a big C but culture with a small c. When it opened, it brought culture to all, and made the city a better place for it.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "F1 cars, such as Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari, use 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrid engines\nChristian Horner's phone rang. It was Bernie Ecclestone. Red Bull's team principal picked up, switched to speakerphone and placed it on the table in front of the assembled Formula 1 bosses.\nWe're in the F1 Commission, Horner told Ecclestone. Is there anything you want to say to the room?\nF1's former impresario, addressing the group that decides the sport's rules, said they should go back to V10 engines. Then he hung up.\nThat phone call - described to BBC Sport by several sources in the room at the time - took place in the morning of the day of F1's season launch at the O2 Arena in London in February, where both Horner and governing body the FIA were booed by the 15,000-strong crowd.\nTwo days later, FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem - a man whose three-year tenure has been beset by controversy - posted a message on Instagram.\nBen Sulayem said he \"looked forward\" to the new chassis and engine rules that are  to be introduced in 2026, but that the FIA \"must also lead the way on future technological motorsport trends.\n\"We should consider a range of directions, including the roaring sound of the V10 running on sustainable fuel.\"\nThese developments have kick-started a debate inside F1 about engines. The ground is shifting fast, so what's going on?\nNext year, F1 is going through the biggest regulation change in the sport's history, introducing new rules for both cars and engines.\nOn engines, F1 is sticking with 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids, the basic architecture that has been in place since 2014, but changing the balance between electric and combustion power.\nThe amount of total power provided by the hybrid is going up to about 50% from about 20% now. In addition, F1 is introducing sustainable fuels - abandoning fossil fuels in favour of synthetic fuel created from biomass and industrial processes.\nThis is all part of the sport's pledge to become net-zero carbon by 2030.\nThis video can not be played\nF1 in 10 Years: Lando Norris\nEver since hybrid engines were introduced in 2014, some have bemoaned the loss of the louder, more dramatic sound produced by the naturally aspirated engines that preceded them - especially the 3.0-litre V10s last raced in F1 in 2005.\nIn an unavoidable parallel with Ben Sulayem's actions now, Ecclestone was the first person to bring this up, even before the 2014 engines first raced.\nA certain romanticism about the V10 sound has sustained, as has the idea that those engines - with their ear-splitting shriek that could be heard some distance from the track - are more popular with the fanbase than the current hybrids.\nWithin F1, there is no question that some people agree. Lewis Hamilton said at the Chinese Grand Prix last weekend: \"It is no secret that the V6 has never sounded great.\n\"I remember the first time I came to an F1 race in 1996 in Spa and arriving and Michael (Schumacher) coming through Turn One and my rib cage just vibrated. I was so hooked. It was the most amazing thing I felt and heard.\n\"Over the years we've lost that. If we are able to move back to those amazing sounding engines and still able to see the sustainable goals, why not?\"\nFernando Alonso took his 2005 title-winning Renault R25 - with V10 engine - for a demonstration run on track before the 2020 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix\nIt's not that long since Ben Sulayem was trumpeting his involvement in the introduction of the 2026 engine rules.\nThese were fundamentally settled under the previous FIA president Jean Todt, but there was inevitable wrangling and it got over the line only after Ben Sulayem took office.\nTwo years ago, he said the new engines were \"at the forefront of technological innovation, making the future of F1 more sustainable while maintaining the spectacular racing\".\nSo why the U-turn?\nBen Sulayem has asked his F1 single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis to look into the matter.\nTombazis said that the advent of\u00a0sustainable fuels could allow F1 to make the engines simpler and cheaper.\n\"That's why the president made the comments about V10 engines in '28 - or '29 or whatever - and so on,\" Tombazis said. \"And that is something we are evaluating with the manufacturers.\"\nSenior figures within F1 and the car manufacturers involved in the sport see many problems with the FIA's position.\nOn a macro level, the climate crisis is very real, and the global road-car industry is heading in the direction of electrification - even if Donald Trump's election at the head of a government of climate deniers has given pause for thought in the US.\nManufacturers take part in F1 fundamentally for marketing reasons, and the sport has been made more appealing by the introduction of a budget cap for cars and engines.\nAudi, Ford and General Motors are all entering F1 in 2026 - and Honda are staying rather than withdrawing - specifically because of the new engine rules.\nAudi has already released a statement in response to the latest developments, saying that the new rules \"were a key factor in Audi's decision to enter Formula 1\".\nMercedes says it is open to discussions but would need a hybrid element to be part of any new engine formula for it to remain interested.\nThen there is the micro level.\nWhy a V10? No major road-car manufacturer uses them any more.\nMercedes says a V8 would make more sense if a change was to be made, as at least they are still being developed for road use.\nAnd why abandon turbochargers, when many performance road cars - from Audi RS6s or Mercedes AMG C63s to McLaren and Ferrari hypercars - use them for very good reasons?\nCost? Yes, a V10 might be cheaper than a hybrid. But the manufacturers have already spent an estimated collective $400m on the new engines. They are not about to throw that away.\nAnd a new V10 would require developing, to the tune of hundreds of millions more.\nWeight? Yes, the hybrid engines make the cars heavier, largely because of the batteries needed. But the majority of the weight increase from 550kg or so in 2005 to about 800kg now is accounted for by advances in safety, such as the halo head-protection device.\nOn top of that, in 2013, cars started races with about 160kg of fuel. Now, it's about 100kg and it's expected to be about the same next year. Returning to naturally aspirated engines would mean a huge increase in fuel capacity - and weight.\nSustainability? The new fuels being introduced next year are not net-zero carbon. According to scientific standards, sustainable fuels reduce carbon emissions by a little above 80%.\nThat's a lot. But doubling the amount of fuel used by abandoning hybrid engines would mean a doubling of the carbon emissions produced by fuel.\nThe emissions from the cars themselves are minuscule in the big picture - F1's transport around the world is much more significant. Still, the symbolism matters.\nRed Bull boss Christian Horner and FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem are both said to be interested in a return to V10 engines\nIn F1, politics are always involved.\nIt has escaped the attention of few that Ben Sulayem's intervention came after the crowd at the O2 booed when the FIA logo was shown.\nThis is an election year at the FIA, and some believe Ben Sulayem may have raised the idea of V10s because he thinks it will be popular with certain demographics who support him.\nSo far, no candidate has put themselves forwards to oppose him, but there are whispers that there is a credible opponent in the wings.\nAt the same time, word is creeping out in F1 about the progress the various manufacturers are making with their 2026 engines. And it seems that Mercedes are leading the way.\nPeople are already beginning to say that a team will only win in 2026 if it has a Mercedes engine.\nOf course, there is no proof of this, but the whispers are emerging in exactly the same way as similar ones did in 2013 - and they were proved exactly right when the hybrid engines made their debut the following year.\nThe V10 proposal is seen by rival teams as very much a Horner-Ben Sulayem agenda, even if it is said to have some support from Ferrari.\nEven Horner, while saying that \"the concept of a V10 would be very exciting for the sport\" acknowledges that abandoning the rules would be \"a massive departure from what is being worked on very hard for 2026\".\nA U-turn for 2026 now would need support from the teams and manufacturers - and there is not a chance that enough of them would support that to get it through.\nA leading team boss told BBC Sport on condition of anonymity that there have been \"zero discussions\" of this idea in the group of F1 stakeholders.\nIt takes time - years - to agree engine rules.\nIt would probably be two years before a full agreement could be reached. Then the manufacturers would need the same time again to develop and build the engines. Which would take F1 to the end of 2029. Which is only a year before the new rules are due to expire anyway.\nAs one team boss puts it: \"I think this will all peter out, and it will just end up becoming: 'What will 2031 look like?'\"\nThe FIA says: \"There needs to be a consultation between all stakeholders to agree on a way forward, before we fully explore different scenarios.\n\"Whichever direction is chosen, we must support the teams and manufacturers in ensuring cost control on R&D expenditure and take account of environmental and sustainability considerations.\"\nAnd the chances of the end result being a naturally aspirated V10, in the context of all the above?

        "summary": "In addition, F1 is introducing sustainable fuels - abandoning fossil fuels in favour of synthetic fuel created from biomass and industrial processes.This is all part of the sport's pledge to become net-zero carbon by 2030.So where has the V10 chat come from?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, F1 in 10 Years: Lando NorrisEver since hybrid engines were introduced in 2014, some have bemoaned the loss of the louder, more dramatic sound produced by the naturally aspirated engines that preceded them - especially the 3.0-litre V10s last raced in F1 in 2005.In an unavoidable parallel with Ben Sulayem's actions now, Ecclestone was the first person to bring this up, even before the 2014 engines first raced.A certain romanticism about the V10 sound has sustained, as has the idea that those engines - with their ear-splitting shriek that could be heard some distance from the track - are more popular with the fanbase than the current hybrids.Within F1, there is no question that some people agree. And it seems that Mercedes are leading the way.People are already beginning to say that a team will only win in 2026 if it has a Mercedes engine.Of course, there is no proof of this, but the whispers are emerging in exactly the same way as similar ones did in 2013 - and they were proved exactly right when the hybrid engines made their debut the following year.The V10 proposal is seen by rival teams as very much a Horner-Ben Sulayem agenda, even if it is said to have some support from Ferrari.Could the 2026 rules be abandoned?Even Horner, while saying that \"the concept of a V10 would be very exciting for the sport\" acknowledges that abandoning the rules would be \"a massive departure from what is being worked on very hard for 2026\".A U-turn for 2026 now would need support from the teams and manufacturers - and there is not a chance that enough of them would support that to get it through.A leading team boss told BBC Sport on condition of anonymity that there have been \"zero discussions\" of this idea in the group of F1 stakeholders.It takes time - years - to agree engine rules.It would probably be two years before a full agreement could be reached. \"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Fernando Alonso took his 2005 title-winning Renault R25 - with V10 engine - for a demonstration run on track before the 2020 Abu Dhabi Grand PrixWhy has this come up now?It's not that long since Ben Sulayem was trumpeting his involvement in the introduction of the 2026 engine rules.These were fundamentally settled under the previous FIA president Jean Todt, but there was inevitable wrangling and it got over the line only after Ben Sulayem took office.Two years ago, he said the new engines were \"at the forefront of technological innovation, making the future of F1 more sustainable while maintaining the spectacular racing\".So why the U-turn?Ben Sulayem has asked his F1 single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis to look into the matter.Tombazis said that the advent of\u00a0sustainable fuels could allow F1 to make the engines simpler and cheaper. Still, the symbolism matters.Is there a political angle?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Red Bull boss Christian Horner and FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem are both said to be interested in a return to V10 enginesIn F1, politics are always involved.It has escaped the attention of few that Ben Sulayem's intervention came after the crowd at the O2 booed when the FIA logo was shown.This is an election year at the FIA, and some believe Ben Sulayem may have raised the idea of V10s because he thinks it will be popular with certain demographics who support him.So far, no candidate has put themselves forwards to oppose him, but there are whispers that there is a credible opponent in the wings.At the same time, word is creeping out in F1 about the progress the various manufacturers are making with their 2026 engines. \"What's the counter-argument?Senior figures within F1 and the car manufacturers involved in the sport see many problems with the FIA's position.On a macro level, the climate crisis is very real, and the global road-car industry is heading in the direction of electrification - even if Donald Trump's election at the head of a government of climate deniers has given pause for thought in the US.Manufacturers take part in F1 fundamentally for marketing reasons, and the sport has been made more appealing by the introduction of a budget cap for cars and engines.Audi, Ford and General Motors are all entering F1 in 2026 - and Honda are staying rather than withdrawing - specifically because of the new engine rules.Audi has already released a statement in response to the latest developments, saying that the new rules \"were a key factor in Audi's decision to enter Formula 1\".Mercedes says it is open to discussions but would need a hybrid element to be part of any new engine formula for it to remain interested.Then there is the micro level.Why a V10?",

        "article_text": "Mikaela Mayer (left) is a two-weight world champion having also held titles at super-featherweight\nWBO welterweight champion Mikaela Mayer faces Briton Sandy Ryan in a Las Vegas rematch on Saturday. \nIn her BBC Sport column, American Mayer talks about the events leading up to victory in last September's first fight in New York when Ryan was hit by a can of red paint before leaving for the venue.\nOn Friday, Ryan will address the controversy and rivalry between the pair.\nI was in my room and we were starting to walk to the elevator, waiting for the go-ahead from the team to say we could go down because we were at the same hotel as Sandy Ryan. \nSandy was out there first waiting for her car so we stood by the elevator and my nutritionist said to wait because she hasn't got in the car yet.\nMy nutritionist was looking at her phone and was like, 'oh my god, someone just threw paint on Sandy'. We were all taken aback but I didn't understand that I was apparently the culprit.\nI got in the car but didn't really understand the extent of it until I got to the arena and online there was a photo of Sandy, who was stripped down with red paint on her. ESPN came in to see me and apparently I'm being blamed for the attack.\nEveryone who knows me, knows that would be out of character for me - it's not my style. I expected her to try to blame me. I was her rival all week but there were also other things going on. \nSandy has already said flyers attacking her were put up around the hotel and city.\nYou can't just point a finger when there is no evidence leading back to me. I was upstairs waiting to walk down for the fight of my life. \nI didn't know what time she was going to be down there or that she was going first. The only people who knew were her team - maybe she should look inside her own circle.\nThe incident took me by surprise but I was in fight mode and it didn't happen to me, so I wasn't flustered.\nIf someone had thrown paint on me I would have slapped paint on the ass of my fight shorts and got on with it.\nI was concerned that she was going to pull out - her team were really getting her going about it.\nThere was a clip of her coach Kay Koroma in the locker room screaming at her to pull out of the fight which I thought was super suspicious. That was weird to me and out of character for him. \nI really don't think it was the paint that threw her off her game but her team, who made it a bigger deal than it had to be.\nObviously I don't want that to happen and I hope it doesn't happen going into this fight. It could have been called off and, after two years of busting my butt to get back in that position, that was the last thing I wanted.\nAs for 'paint-gate' being used to promote the rematch, I was surprised the Top Rank team used the paint on the promotion posters - but this is entertainment. \nI didn't have any say in it. If I had done anything like that, my manager would have had my neck as he tries to keep me professional.\nI didn't know about it until the poster came out and I said, 'do they have red paint on Sandy?'\nI was just as taken aback as anyone else, but it's kind of funny.\nMayer (right) beat Ryan (left) by majority decision with one judge scoring it a draw\nIt's important for women's boxing to have these rivalries and this is definitely up there as one of the top ones.\nI never counted out the rematch and just wanted to see what my other options were. Once I saw the views and how much the fans wanted it - and the excuses - I thought let's do it again and I'll do it even better.\nI didn't get my rematch with Alycia Baumgardner so I understand Sandy might have been frustrated, but I didn't have to give her this rematch. I could have just sat it out, waited for Lauren Price to unify and fought for undisputed or faced someone else. \nThat's not the fighter I am though.\nI pride myself on the fact a lot of the fights I have been in are competitive and people aren't sure who will win. \nMy feud with Alycia will stay number one for a lifetime, but Sandy can come second because of the coaching team situation and the paint situation.\nSandy and her team have tried to gaslight me in a sense where I'm supposed to be making all of this up or I'm being dramatic, but it happened.\nYou're going to see coach Koroma, my coach of eight or nine years since the Olympics, in her corner so they really can't say anything about it. They did what they did and they have to stand by that. \nI'm just protecting myself and I'm the one who had to go out and find a whole new team at this stage of my career which is not easy. I have truth on my side.\nMikaela Mayer was speaking to BBC Sport's Bobbie Jackson.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "The musician, producer and Real Housewives: Atlanta breakout star loves her hometown. Here are her top local picks, from brunch at Toast to people watching at the Beltline.\nAtlanta \u2013 the state capital of Georgia and the unofficial capital of the American South \u2013 started its life as a railroad terminus in 1837 and has served as a hub for American culture ever since.\nThe SpeciaList\nKandi Burruss is an Atlanta born-and-based musician, producer, actor, business owner and reality TV star. She has worked with celebrities like Ariana Grande and Ed Sheeran, and her work on the single No Scrubs earned her a Grammy Award in 1999. She is the owner of Bedroom\u00a0Kandi, a line of sex toys; Kandi Koated cosmetics; and hosts a podcast called The Business of Pleasure. In addition to appearing on The Real Housewives of Atlanta for 14 seasons, Burruss recently starred in Showtime's The Chi and Hulu's Reasonable Doubt. In 2021, the Atlanta suburb South Fulton declared 18 December Kandi Burruss Tucker Day.\nRanking among the top cities for US tourism, Atlanta consistently draws visitors with its dynamic contemporary art scene and iconic soul food, as well as its abundance of greenery and sprawling historic estates. One of the main epicentres of the hip hop industry, it has also secured its place in music history, nurturing a long line of homegrown talent \u2013 like Kandi Burruss, the Atlanta-born singer, songwriter, producer and star of The Real Housewives of Atlanta.\nThe future songstress was raised in the Atlanta suburb of East Point, where she attended Tri-Cities High School of Visual and Performing Arts and met the other members of R&B girl group Xscape; later going on to co-write the 1993 hit No Scrubs for TLC. Burruss joined the Real Housewives of Atlanta cast for its sophomore season in 2010, becoming a fan favourite and one of the longest-tenured housewives before leaving the show in 2024. Her latest venture takes her to New York City as she and her husband, Todd Tucker, co-produce the new Broadway production of Othello at the Barrymore Theatre, starring Academy Award winners Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal.\nBut Burruss is an Atlanta girl through and through.\u00a0\"I was born and raised in Atlanta, so I am Atlanta,\" she says. \"This is home base for me.\"\nHer time on Real Housewives allowed her to celebrate her Atlanta roots, and chronicled meeting her husband and the birth of her son, Ace. \"It's been kind of cool to say I can go back and watch 14 years of my life,\" she says. \"It was a great experience.\"\nCameras followed Burruss and her co-stars as they crisscrossed the city to attend fashion shows; local restaurants, like 80-year-old Mary Mac's Tea Room; and major landmarks like the Georgia Aquarium, which set the scene for one of the show's beloved end-of-season reunions.\nBurruss owns various enterprises in town, including two restaurants and her business camp The Kandi Factory HQ (\"You have to have an invite,\" she says), which put her at the heart of Atlanta's often over-the-top social scene.\u00a0\n\"Atlanta is a vibe,\" she declares. \"It\u2019s a great place for work, fun, and the weather hits all four seasons; it\u2019s such a place to be.\"\nHere are Burruss's favourite ways to experience her hometown of Atlanta.\nIf visitors are looking to drop some major coin, Burruss isn't against hitting up some of the most recognisable spots in Atlanta.\n\"People always go to Lenox [Square] or Phipps [Plaza] if they want to shop,\" she says.\nBoth malls are in the city's upscale Buckhead neighbourhood and include the designer labels that Burruss and her co-stars wear on the show, like Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Dior. The Waldorf Astoria Atlanta Buckhead and the InterContinental Buckhead Altanta hotels, both located nearby, played host to the Real Housewives of Atlanta for various events, like Nene Leakes's wedding in 2013.\nWebsite: https://www.simon.com/mall/lenox-square/\nAddress: 3393 Peachtree Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30326\nPhone: +14042336767\nInstagram: @lenoxsqmall\nWebsite: https://www.simon.com/mall/phipps-plaza\nAddress: 3500 Peachtree Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30326\nPhone: +14042620992\nInstagram: @shopphippsplaza\nAtlanta has 53 restaurants listed in the Michelin Guide (and eateries like Fishmonger and Staplehouse have taken top spots on Bon App\u00e9tit's Best New Restaurants listings in recent years), but diners can also enjoy the city's iconic Southern dishes like fried chicken at The Busy Bee Cafe and peach cobbler at Ms Ruby's Peach Cobbler Caf\u00e9 in Buckhead.\nAnyone looking to refuel after a late night or keep the party going after a big celebration can opt for brunch; another reality TV standby. While Burruss famously doesn't imbibe, she's happy to recommend her favourite spot.\n\"If I wanted to get up and go to brunch, it's a place called Toast. They have a great brunch,\" Burruss says of the trendy eatery, found just outside of Atlanta's Buckhead neighbourhood. \"The food is really good.\"\nVisitors can feast on \"New American Brunch\" dishes like strawberry-shortcake French toast or fried catfish and grits, while fans of Real Housewives will recognise the restaurant as the spot where Burruss feuded with her co-star Marlo Hampton at Shere\u00e9 Whitfield's Keepin' it Gucci brunch in 2023.\nWebsite: https://www.toastonlenoxatl.com/\nAddress: 2770 Lenox Rd Suite B-1, Atlanta, GA 30324\nPhone: +14047484594\nInstagram: @toastonlenox\nAs Burruss knows, getting a group of girlfriends together is no easy feat. So she looks for venues with good vibes and good music to accompany any tea that might get spilled (gossip) when she and her girls get together.\n\"My friend Rasheeda owns a place called Frost Bistro. We might hang out there, because they play good music,\" Burruss says. Fans of reality TV may also remember the restaurant from VH1's Love & Hip Hop Atlanta. Rasheeda and Kirk Frost, who have headlined the show since 2012, opened the casual Southern-style bistro back in 2020, offering a breakfast and brunch menu full of inventive cocktails and modern, stick-to-your-ribs Georgia-style dishes.\u00a0\n\"I like the oxtail and grits, the snapper and the French toast,\" says Burruss.\nWebsite: https://frostbistro.com/\nAddress: 281 Peters St SW, Atlanta, GA 30313\nPhone: +14049635495\nInstagram: @frostbistro\n\nAtlantic Station is a favourite for locals and tourists, thanks to its views, restaurants and family-friendly attractions.\nWhen to come\n\"The summer is fun,\" says Burruss. \"It\u2019s never just one event; it\u2019s a ton of events. People are out all summer long. It's consistent. That's what I love about Atlanta \u2013 there\u2019s always multiple things happening.\"\nThe building was once a steel mill and has since been transformed into a collection of boutiques, eateries and apartments. Its location between Atlanta's West Side, Home Park and South Buckhead makes it easy for visitors to get to no matter where they're coming from.\n\"You want to go to Atlantic Station. They always have a lot of kids hanging out and playing,\" Burruss says. \"I just took my son and his friends to Skyline Park at Ponce City Market. [They] have great restaurants in that building and on the rooftop is where Skyline Park is. So, you get an amazing view of the city.\"\nJust 15 minutes from Atlantic Station,\u00a0Skyline Park includes a miniature golf course, a three-storey slide, and Heege Tower, which gives riders a 360-degree view of Bucktown, Midtown and downtown Atlanta.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://atlanticstation.com/\nAddress: 1380\u00a0Atlantic Dr NW,\u00a0Atlanta,\u00a0GA\u00a030363\nPhone: +14049007900\nInstagram: @atlanticstation \nIn a past life, Atlanta's Beltline was a rail corridor that circled the city. Now, it's a pedestrian-friendly path where Burruss goes to soak up the sun. The star notes that it attracts people from all over the city, making it prime for people-watching. Its trails extend more than 11 miles and notable stops include the Atlanta Beltline Arboretum, The Beacon and Krog Street Market.

        "article_text": "Brazil were beaten 4-1 by Argentina in their most recent World Cup qualifier\nIn any previous World Cup, there would be genuine fear about Brazil failing to qualify. Not this time.\nIn an expanded competition, with six South American teams making it through automatically, Brazil have a six-point cushion over a Venezuela team who have just registered their first victory in 10 games.\nWith four rounds to go, it is impossible to see Brazil not making the cut. But that is hardly the point.\nFor Brazil, World Cup qualification now serves one purpose - it provides a sequence of competitive matches during which they hope to build a side capable of winning the trophy. And with just over a year to go until 2026, that looks a long way off.\nIt is easy to forget how good Brazil were in the last World Cup, where they lost in the quarter-finals on penalties to a Croatia team whose only shot on goal in the match took a cruel deflection.\nThe Qatar 2022 Brazil side were solid - goalkeeper Alisson could have taken a deckchair out for most of the games - with flashes of brilliance. They could have won that competition. \nSo why have they fallen back so much? How can a team packed with so many good players form such a dismal unit?\nThe team that were thrashed 4-1 by Argentina on Tuesday appeared to have no midfield, and were unable either to attack or defend.\nDorival Junior is under pressure following the heavy defeat by Argentina\nTuesday's prolonged humiliation did not come out of the blue. \nIn game after game the team have looked disjointed, without clear strategies for progressing the ball down the field, and suffering from the possibility of being both outplayed and outnumbered in central midfield. \nIndividual talent has papered over the cracks - like on Thursday, when a stoppage-time Vinicius Jr special gave them a victory over Colombia their play had not really deserved. \nBut it can't happen all the time.\nAnd if the film is bad, especially if the cast is impressive, the director must be to blame. \nThere is a crisis in Brazilian coaching. It is hard to produce coaches when there is no time to train and no job security. That is the reality of domestic Brazilian football, and helps explain why almost all of the successful coaches in the country are now foreign - either Argentine or, especially, Portuguese.\nThe national boss - for now anyway - Dorival Jr is a product of the domestic game, with more than four decades' experience as player and coach. \nBut on the international stage he comes across as a decent man thoroughly out of his depth.\nDid he really think he could travel to Argentina and play two men in central midfield? Why not drop deep and create space for the counter-attack, as he did a year ago against England at Wembley? And when cool heads were required, his team came across as a bag of nerves, all too willing to get involved in cheap spats.\nOf the three duties of the coach - pick the team, determine the strategy and set the emotional tone - Dorival failed dismally, and it is very hard to see how he can keep his job.\nIf he is to be replaced, there would seem to be two options. One is to go foreign - the Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus would be a strong candidate. The other would be to fast-track former Chelsea left-back Filipe Luis - a man of great intelligence who has made an impressive start to his coaching career with Rio giants Flamengo.\nWhoever comes in - or Dorival if he manages to hang on - will have to deal with a simple observation - central midfield is not an optional extra.\nIt is an area where Brazil have had a problem for a while - a consequence of the 1990s trend of splitting the middle of the park into a pair of midfielders who only defend and a duo who mostly attack. It was at this point Brazilian play lost much of its former fluency, instead investing in rapid breaks down the flanks.\nIt is in this context that the problems of Lucas Paqueta are so significant. \nThe West Ham midfielder was on the verge of becoming a big-money Manchester City signing when scandal struck, and his career - now threatened - has not recovered.\nThe evidence of Dorival's first games in charge - a year ago away to England and Spain - was Paqueta had become the most important player in the team, the man capable of filling space in midfield, dictating the rhythm of the game and unleashing the pace of the likes of Vinicius Jr.\nRonaldo quits Brazil federation presidency race\nAlisson returns to Liverpool after 'suspected concussion'\nThe absence of Paqueta almost certainly led to Dorival building his hopes for these international dates around the return of Neymar - which, predictably, turned out to be ludicrously premature.\nAfter so long out injured, it was only to be expected that Neymar would run into muscular problems, and he will need much more time on the field to ease his way back to a level where he can tip the balance.\nAt 33, he is an unknown quantity. But there is a gaping hole in the team for the type of deep-lying playmaker role he could fill. \nRomantics might recall 2002, when Ronaldo looked all washed up only to make a triumphant return from injury and carry a Brazil side that almost failed to qualify all the way to World Cup title number five. \nThey are still waiting for number six. \nIf they can do it next year then, in the wake of Tuesday's humiliation, it will be a candidate for one of football's great comebacks.\nNeymar's absence from the Brazil team was prolonged by a muscular injury",

after losing in two of the past six Super Bowls - the 49ers' championship window could now have closed.The New York Jets were billed as potential Super Bowl contenders last season having rebuilt their roster around Aaron Rodgers, the NFL's four-time Most Valuable Player, but the gamble did not pay off.The Jets have replaced the 41-year-old with former Chicago and Pittsburgh quarterback Justin Fields and released receiver Davante Adams, who was snapped up by the Rams to replace Kupp.Russell Wilson has left Pittsburgh to join the New York Giants, while a decision is still due from Rodgers, who has spoken to the Giants, Steelers and Vikings.The Indianapolis Colts have given Daniel Jones a chance to compete with Anthony Richardson for the starting role.In other big-name moves, New England signed receiver Stefon Diggs, Buffalo picked up ex-Chargers pass rusher Joey Bosa and the Baltimore Ravens have given Lamar Jackson another weapon by signing receiver DeAndre Hopkins.Related topicsAmerican FootballMore on this storyJets 'failed as a team' during Rodgers stint -

        "article_text": "Callum Hudson-Odoi made the last of his three England appearances in 2019 but is returning to the form that could see him win more\nCallum Hudson-Odoi feels he is almost back at the beginning of his career.\nThe winger's mindset now, as then, is going into every game feeling he can score or assist, being part of the conversation around the England senior team, and once again trying to impress Thomas Tuchel.\nNow 24, the three-cap England international has been a key part of a Nottingham Forest side that has maintained their Premier League form to close in on Champions League qualification. Forest also face a trip to Brighton in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup on Saturday.\nSix years ago, Hudson-Odoi was one of the most exciting prospects in English football. He had been the Chelsea academy golden boy, with the club knocking back bids to sign him in the January 2019 transfer window from Bayern Munich. \nHe made his England debut under Gareth Southgate in March, coming on as a substitute in a 5-0 win over the Czech Republic in a Euro 2020 qualifier. He was 18 and became the youngest to play for England in a competitive international match, breaking Duncan Edwards' 64-year-old record. \nBut in April 2019, he ruptured his Achilles tendon in a match against Burnley. The tendon completely detached from the bone and his seven months out of the game was followed by further setbacks.\n\"I had been playing games week in, week out, got my first call up for England and I step off and boom, everything collapses,\" he told BBC Sport. \"It was tough, it was very tough.\n\"At the time, I was just thinking am I going to be the same player I was? Will I be able to sprint or kick a ball again?\"\nMaurizio Sarri was Chelsea's manager at the time of the injury, followed by Frank Lampard. But it was Tuchel who gave Hudson-Odoi his most minutes on the pitch while at Stamford Bridge. \nHowever, it was not all straightforward. Tuchel, now the England manager, gave him a dose of \"tough love\".\nIn a 1-1 draw with Southampton in February 2021, Hudson-Odoi came on at half-time but was then substituted off 31 minutes later, with the German coach telling journalists he was \"not happy with his attitude, energy and counter-pressing\".\n\"Maybe it is even unfair, but it was my feeling,\" Tuchel said.\n\"I took him off. We demand 100%. I feel he is not in the right shape to help us.\n\"He knows what I demand from him and when he doesn't reach this level, it's a hard decision.\"\nFast forward to this season and Hudson-Odoi's form for Forest - he has five goals and two assists - led to speculation about him making Tuchel's first England squad and a return to the national set-up after making his third and, so far, last appearance in November 2019 in a 4-0 win over Kosovo.\nHe missed out on the 26-man squad but speaking before the international break about playing under Tuchel, he said: \"We had our differences at times and that is normal. Every player and coach has their differences.\n\"Like [when Tuchel had me] playing wing-back and I am like why am I here? \n\"But it was to benefit the team and it benefits myself, helping me work on my defensive game. \n\"It's good that we had that moment and we have talked about it. He is an amazing manager and he knows how to get the best out of players. \n\"If the possibility and chance [for England] comes \u2013 I will have to go there and prove myself all over again.\n\"I just control what I can control. It's about enjoying my football once again, smiling and being positive.\"\nHudson-Odoi says he is \"more mature\" having lived through so much since making his professional debut at the age of 17.\nHe insists, though, his motivation about returning to the level which made him the most coveted youngster in the country, comes from within.\n\"I don't want to prove anything to anybody,\" he said. \"It is about proving to myself that I can still be that player I was \u2013 to go back to a level where I knew I was going to score or assist \u2013 and be that confident where I know I am going to impact in every game.\"\nHudson-Odoi is also dreaming of success under Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo. \n\"This season everything has just changed \u2013 from mentality to determination,\" he said.\n\"It's just a big drive from us and we are trying to push each other every day.

        "article_text": "F1 cars, such as Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari, use 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrid engines\nChristian Horner's phone rang. It was Bernie Ecclestone. Red Bull's team principal picked up, switched to speakerphone and placed it on the table in front of the assembled Formula 1 bosses.\nWe're in the F1 Commission, Horner told Ecclestone. Is there anything you want to say to the room?\nF1's former impresario, addressing the group that decides the sport's rules, said they should go back to V10 engines. Then he hung up.\nThat phone call - described to BBC Sport by several sources in the room at the time - took place in the morning of the day of F1's season launch at the O2 Arena in London in February, where both Horner and governing body the FIA were booed by the 15,000-strong crowd.\nTwo days later, FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem - a man whose three-year tenure has been beset by controversy - posted a message on Instagram.\nBen Sulayem said he \"looked forward\" to the new chassis and engine rules that are  to be introduced in 2026, but that the FIA \"must also lead the way on future technological motorsport trends.\n\"We should consider a range of directions, including the roaring sound of the V10 running on sustainable fuel.\"\nThese developments have kick-started a debate inside F1 about engines. The ground is shifting fast, so what's going on?\nNext year, F1 is going through the biggest regulation change in the sport's history, introducing new rules for both cars and engines.\nOn engines, F1 is sticking with 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids, the basic architecture that has been in place since 2014, but changing the balance between electric and combustion power.\nThe amount of total power provided by the hybrid is going up to about 50% from about 20% now. In addition, F1 is introducing sustainable fuels - abandoning fossil fuels in favour of synthetic fuel created from biomass and industrial processes.\nThis is all part of the sport's pledge to become net-zero carbon by 2030.\nThis video can not be played\nF1 in 10 Years: Lando Norris\nEver since hybrid engines were introduced in 2014, some have bemoaned the loss of the louder, more dramatic sound produced by the naturally aspirated engines that preceded them - especially the 3.0-litre V10s last raced in F1 in 2005.\nIn an unavoidable parallel with Ben Sulayem's actions now, Ecclestone was the first person to bring this up, even before the 2014 engines first raced.\nA certain romanticism about the V10 sound has sustained, as has the idea that those engines - with their ear-splitting shriek that could be heard some distance from the track - are more popular with the fanbase than the current hybrids.\nWithin F1, there is no question that some people agree. Lewis Hamilton said at the Chinese Grand Prix last weekend: \"It is no secret that the V6 has never sounded great.\n\"I remember the first time I came to an F1 race in 1996 in Spa and arriving and Michael (Schumacher) coming through Turn One and my rib cage just vibrated. I was so hooked. It was the most amazing thing I felt and heard.\n\"Over the years we've lost that. If we are able to move back to those amazing sounding engines and still able to see the sustainable goals, why not?\"\nFernando Alonso took his 2005 title-winning Renault R25 - with V10 engine - for a demonstration run on track before the 2020 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix\nIt's not that long since Ben Sulayem was trumpeting his involvement in the introduction of the 2026 engine rules.\nThese were fundamentally settled under the previous FIA president Jean Todt, but there was inevitable wrangling and it got over the line only after Ben Sulayem took office.\nTwo years ago, he said the new engines were \"at the forefront of technological innovation, making the future of F1 more sustainable while maintaining the spectacular racing\".\nSo why the U-turn?\nBen Sulayem has asked his F1 single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis to look into the matter.\nTombazis said that the advent of\u00a0sustainable fuels could allow F1 to make the engines simpler and cheaper.\n\"That's why the president made the comments about V10 engines in '28 - or '29 or whatever - and so on,\" Tombazis said. \"And that is something we are evaluating with the manufacturers.\"\nSenior figures within F1 and the car manufacturers involved in the sport see many problems with the FIA's position.\nOn a macro level, the climate crisis is very real, and the global road-car industry is heading in the direction of electrification - even if Donald Trump's election at the head of a government of climate deniers has given pause for thought in the US.\nManufacturers take part in F1 fundamentally for marketing reasons, and the sport has been made more appealing by the introduction of a budget cap for cars and engines.\nAudi, Ford and General Motors are all entering F1 in 2026 - and Honda are staying rather than withdrawing - specifically because of the new engine rules.\nAudi has already released a statement in response to the latest developments, saying that the new rules \"were a key factor in Audi's decision to enter Formula 1\".\nMercedes says it is open to discussions but would need a hybrid element to be part of any new engine formula for it to remain interested.\nThen there is the micro level.\nWhy a V10? No major road-car manufacturer uses them any more.\nMercedes says a V8 would make more sense if a change was to be made, as at least they are still being developed for road use.\nAnd why abandon turbochargers, when many performance road cars - from Audi RS6s or Mercedes AMG C63s to McLaren and Ferrari hypercars - use them for very good reasons?\nCost? Yes, a V10 might be cheaper than a hybrid. But the manufacturers have already spent an estimated collective $400m on the new engines. They are not about to throw that away.\nAnd a new V10 would require developing, to the tune of hundreds of millions more.\nWeight? Yes, the hybrid engines make the cars heavier, largely because of the batteries needed. But the majority of the weight increase from 550kg or so in 2005 to about 800kg now is accounted for by advances in safety, such as the halo head-protection device.\nOn top of that, in 2013, cars started races with about 160kg of fuel. Now, it's about 100kg and it's expected to be about the same next year. Returning to naturally aspirated engines would mean a huge increase in fuel capacity - and weight.\nSustainability? The new fuels being introduced next year are not net-zero carbon. According to scientific standards, sustainable fuels reduce carbon emissions by a little above 80%.\nThat's a lot. But doubling the amount of fuel used by abandoning hybrid engines would mean a doubling of the carbon emissions produced by fuel.\nThe emissions from the cars themselves are minuscule in the big picture - F1's transport around the world is much more significant. Still, the symbolism matters.\nRed Bull boss Christian Horner and FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem are both said to be interested in a return to V10 engines\nIn F1, politics are always involved.\nIt has escaped the attention of few that Ben Sulayem's intervention came after the crowd at the O2 booed when the FIA logo was shown.\nThis is an election year at the FIA, and some believe Ben Sulayem may have raised the idea of V10s because he thinks it will be popular with certain demographics who support him.\nSo far, no candidate has put themselves forwards to oppose him, but there are whispers that there is a credible opponent in the wings.\nAt the same time, word is creeping out in F1 about the progress the various manufacturers are making with their 2026 engines. And it seems that Mercedes are leading the way.\nPeople are already beginning to say that a team will only win in 2026 if it has a Mercedes engine.\nOf course, there is no proof of this, but the whispers are emerging in exactly the same way as similar ones did in 2013 - and they were proved exactly right when the hybrid engines made their debut the following year.\nThe V10 proposal is seen by rival teams as very much a Horner-Ben Sulayem agenda, even if it is said to have some support from Ferrari.\nEven Horner, while saying that \"the concept of a V10 would be very exciting for the sport\" acknowledges that abandoning the rules would be \"a massive departure from what is being worked on very hard for 2026\".\nA U-turn for 2026 now would need support from the teams and manufacturers - and there is not a chance that enough of them would support that to get it through.\nA leading team boss told BBC Sport on condition of anonymity that there have been \"zero discussions\" of this idea in the group of F1 stakeholders.\nIt takes time - years - to agree engine rules.\nIt would probably be two years before a full agreement could be reached. Then the manufacturers would need the same time again to develop and build the engines. Which would take F1 to the end of 2029. Which is only a year before the new rules are due to expire anyway.\nAs one team boss puts it: \"I think this will all peter out, and it will just end up becoming: 'What will 2031 look like?'\"\nThe FIA says: \"There needs to be a consultation between all stakeholders to agree on a way forward, before we fully explore different scenarios.\n\"Whichever direction is chosen, we must support the teams and manufacturers in ensuring cost control on R&D expenditure and take account of environmental and sustainability considerations.\"\nAnd the chances of the end result being a naturally aspirated V10, in the context of all the above? Not high.\nF1 in 10 Years - the box set\nAndrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions\nWere Ferrari at fault or unlucky with disqualifications?\nRed Bull confirm Tsunoda to replace Lawson",

        "article_text": "More than 1,600 people have died following the devastating earthquake in Myanmar, with locals in some areas telling the BBC they had been left to dig through rubble for survivors with their bare hands.\nThe quake has flattened much of Mandalay - the ancient capital and second-largest city which is home to about 1.5 million people.\nAn acute lack of equipment, patchy communication networks and wrecked roads and bridges have hampered the search.\nMyanmar's military government or junta, which seized power in 2021, is also no longer in control of much of the country after a four-year civil war against rebel groups and an anti-coup resistance.  \n\nAlthough rescue efforts have been under way since Friday and international aid has begun to enter the country, help is yet to reach the worst-hit areas and ordinary people have been trying to dig survivors out by \nWidely shared footage shows two men moving rubble to pry out a young woman trapped between two concrete slabs. \nThe BBC has spoken to locals who said that people were screaming for help from under the debris. \nRescuers also pulled a woman alive from the wreckage of a 12-storey apartment block in Mandalay some 30 hours after it collapsed, but the Red Cross says more than 90 people may still be trapped there.\nIn a nearby township, authorities found the bodies of 12 preschool children and a teacher under a building housing a kindergarten.\nCracks and surface distortions to the main highway between the biggest city Yangon, the capital Nay Pyi Taw and Mandalay had caused severe transport disruptions, UN humanitarian agency OCHA said.\nThere were also shortages of medical supplies including trauma kits, blood bags, anaesthetics, essential medicines and tents for health workers, it said.\nElsewhere, other rescue workers have been listening out for signs of life. ''We can only rescue people when we hear them,'' one said.\nEarlier on Saturday, a rescue team in the Sintkai township in Mandalay's Kyaukse district pulled out a number of people trapped in the debris of a private school. Six of them \u2013 five females and one male \u2013 had died by the time the rescue teams arrived. Among the victims were students, teachers and school staff.\nA lack of equipment is greatly slowing down the rescues, a worker told BBC Burmese: \"We are making do with the equipment we have. We have been trying for hours to pull out a girl trapped under the collapsed school.\"\nAnother worker in Mandalay told a BBC reporter in Yangon that communication had been near impossible.\n\"The main thing is that we don't have internet lines, we don't have phone lines, so it's very difficult to connect with each other. The rescue team has arrived. But we don't know where it will go, because the phone lines are down.\"\nA Mandalay resident said people were doing their best in the chaotic circumstances.\n\"There is no coordination in the rescue efforts, no one to lead them, or tell them what to do. Locals have had to fend for themselves. If they find dead bodies in the debris, they don't even know where to send the bodies; hospitals are overwhelmed and unable to cope,\" the resident said.\nThe junta has put the number of damaged buildings in the Mandalay region, the epicentre of the earthquake, at more than 1,500. Power outages have exacerbated the situation, and according to officials restoring power could take days.\nMandalay airport is not functional as the runways were damaged during the earthquake. The military council said that it had been working to resume operations and a temporary hospital, medical relief camp and shelter have been set up there.\nLess than 25km (15 miles) from Mandalay in Sagaing, the older of two bridges connecting the regions has completely collapsed and the newer one has developed cracks, cutting off access for rescue teams. \n\"Right now, there are not enough people even for emergency rescue. We can't pick up bodies, there are so many people trapped. We can't cross either bridge, so we are all trapped in the rubble. Please help emergency rescuers come and rescue us,\" a local resident told BBC Burmese.\nThe recently constructed capital Nay Pyi Taw, where the military junta is headquartered, has been hit by aftershocks and small tremors. The city has seen extensive damage with high numbers of casualties, collapsed buildings and buckled roads.\nEven as the junta has made a rare international appeal for aid, it has continued air strikes and drone attacks against the armed groups it has been fighting.\nBBC Burmese confirmed that seven people were killed in an air strike in Naungcho in northern Shan state. This strike took place around 15:30 local time, less than three hours after the quake struck.\nPro-democracy rebel groups fighting to remove the military from power have reported aerial bombings in Chang-U township in the central Sagaing region, the epicentre of the quake. There are also reports of airstrikes in regions near the Thai border.\nThe UN's special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, urged the junta to cease bombing raids.\n\"The problem is that you still have military operations going on right now... Military strikes by the military junta,\" he told the BBC.\n\"I'm calling upon the junta to just stop, stop any of its military operations. This is completely outrageous and unacceptable.\"",

Atletico then bought him back in 2021 for just \u00a316.5m.\nSpain midfielder Rodri, now a Ballon d'Or winner, was signed for \u00a316.5m in 2018 and sold to Manchester City the following year for \u00a362.5m, while Slovenian goalkeeper Oblak signed from Benfica in 2014 for just \u00a313m.

But not in that way.\"\nOn Thursday, Rangers' interim boss Barry Ferguson said Cerny had got a \"wee bit over-excited\", adding: \"I have no issues with that\".\nBut Rodgers was clear he would not stand for similar actions.\nHe continued: \"It's respect, isn't it? I think it's a lack of respect if somehow a player runs up a touchline and he's squirting a water bottle in a supporter's face.

It's been 13 points clear, 16 points clear. Whether that does have a deep effect on how you enter into the game\u2026 It shouldn't, because our mantra is always to start very quick.\n\"But we didn't and credit to Rangers because they did.

It's as simple as that.\n\"The analysis is pretty easy, but that's my responsibility to make us better the next time.\"\nRodgers added: \"We were obviously disappointed with the result. However, I can't forget what this team has done over the course of the season.\n\"We've been tremendous through large parts of the season and now we sit 13 points clear.

Amongst charity workers, donors and friends, he spoke of the love and happiness he had found with Meghan, of honouring his mother's legacy, and described his \"sadness\" at leaving the UK.\n\"Together, you have given me an education about living, and this role has taught me more about what is right and just than I could ever have imagined,\" he told dinner guests.\n\"We are taking a leap of faith, so thank you for giving me the courage to take this next step.\"\nSentebale had been part of Prince Harry's world for his entire adult life. It had ridden the storm of family fallout and leaving royal life behind.\nHe first visited Lesotho, the landlocked mountain kingdom in southern Africa, when he was 19, in 2004. He'd just left Eton and was on a gap year before his military training at Sandhurst.\nIt was a formative time for Harry.\nWhat he saw during his gap year prompted him to set up the charity two years later.\nIt would support children who had lost parents to HIV and Aids.\nAnd then there is the Diana factor. Sentebale means \"forget-me-not\" in Sesotho, the language of Lesotho.\nBack at that Sentebale dinner in 2020, he told guests: \"When I lost my mum\u2026 you took me under your wing. You looked out for me for so long.\"\nThe connection to Diana, Princess of Wales, is an important personal part of the Sentebale story.\nHis joint founder, Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, had also lost his mother.

But his team in California say he remains a strong supporter of them all and plays an active part in what they do.\nHe last visited Lesotho in 2024 and, with Prince Seeiso, saw the latest work the charity was doing. His commitment to the charity would \"never falter\", he said.\nBut, for now, Prince Harry has walked away in what has clearly been a catastrophic breakdown in the trustees' relationship with the chair of the board.\nThere has been a personal fallout, a wrangle over the charity's future direction, and broken relationships with damaging accusations being made.\nPrince Harry has been here before.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has imposed a range of tariffs - or import taxes - on billions of dollars worth of goods coming into the US from some of its top trading partners.\nThe tariffs apply to steel and aluminium imported to the US, as well as to some other products from Mexico, Canada and China - prompting announcements of counter-measures from the latter two countries and the European Union. \nTrump has also announced tariffs on cars coming into the US which are due to come into effect on 3 April. Tariffs on certain car parts are set to start in May or later.\nEconomists have warned these tariffs - and those introduced in response by other countries - could put prices up for American consumers. \nThat's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, which may choose to pass the cost on to customers, or to reduce imports, meaning fewer products are available.\nSo which things could become more expensive?\nThe US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade.\nMany US car companies also have operations in Mexico and Canada, set up under the terms of the longstanding free trade agreement between them.\nComponent parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.\nThe new tariffs on car parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt for now while US customs and border patrol set up a system to assess the duties.\nAnderson Economic Group has estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by roughly $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle.\nThe cost of the higher taxes is likely to be passed on to customers.\nAndrew Foran from TD Economics has said that disrupting trade flows through tariffs \"would come with significant costs\".\nHe argues that the \"uninterrupted free trade\" which has \"existed for decades\" in the car-making sector has lowered prices for consumers.\nPopular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.\nHowever, it's also possible that firms could decide to bring in less foreign beer.\nModelo became the number one beer brand in the US in 2023, and remains in the top spot, for now. \nThe picture is more complicated when it comes to spirits, which have been largely free of tariffs since the 1990s. \nIndustry bodies from the US, Canada and Mexico issued a joint statement in advance of the tariffs being announced saying they were \"deeply concerned\". \nThey argue that certain brands, such as Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila and Canadian whisky are \"recognized as distinctive products and can only be produced in their designated countries\".\nSo given the production of these drinks cannot simply be moved, supplies might be impacted, leading to price rises. \nThe bodies also highlighted that many companies own different spirit brands in the US, Canada and Mexico.\nThe US imports about a third of its softwood lumber from Canada each year, and that key building material could be hit by Trump's tariffs. \nTrump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".\nHowever, the National Association of Home Builders urged the president to exempt building materials \"because of their harmful effect on housing affordability\".\nThe industry group has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.\n\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.\nImports from the rest of the world could also be affected. \nOn 1 March, Trump ordered an investigation into whether the US should place additional tariffs on most lumber and timber imports, regardless of their country of origin, or create incentives to boost domestic production. \nFindings are due towards the end of 2025.\nThe \"most obvious\" household impact of a trade war with Canada would be on the price of Canadian maple syrup, according to Thomas Sampson from the London School of Economics.\nCanada's billion-dollar industry accounts for 75% of the world's entire maple syrup production.\nThe majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.\n\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" Mr Sampson said.\n\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but [which use] inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.\nCanada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil. \nAccording to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November 2024 came from Canada.\nWhile the US has introduced a 25% tariff on most goods imported from Canada, Canadian energy faces a lower rate of 10%. \nThe US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but its refineries are designed to process so-called \"heavier\" - or thicker - crude oil, which mostly comes from Canada, with some from Mexico.\n\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.\nThat means if Canada decided to reduce crude oil exports in retaliation against US tariffs, it could push up fuel prices. \nAvocados thrive in in the Mexican climate. \nNearly 90% of the avocados consumed in the US come from Mexico.\nThe US Agriculture Department has warned that tariffs on Mexican fruit and vegetables could increase the cost of avocados.\nRelated dishes like guacamole could also become more expensive. \nAdditional reporting by Lucy Acheson",

        "article_text": "Brazil were beaten 4-1 by Argentina in their most recent World Cup qualifier\nIn any previous World Cup, there would be genuine fear about Brazil failing to qualify. Not this time.\nIn an expanded competition, with six South American teams making it through automatically, Brazil have a six-point cushion over a Venezuela team who have just registered their first victory in 10 games.\nWith four rounds to go, it is impossible to see Brazil not making the cut. But that is hardly the point.\nFor Brazil, World Cup qualification now serves one purpose - it provides a sequence of competitive matches during which they hope to build a side capable of winning the trophy. And with just over a year to go until 2026, that looks a long way off.\nIt is easy to forget how good Brazil were in the last World Cup, where they lost in the quarter-finals on penalties to a Croatia team whose only shot on goal in the match took a cruel deflection.\nThe Qatar 2022 Brazil side were solid - goalkeeper Alisson could have taken a deckchair out for most of the games - with flashes of brilliance. They could have won that competition. \nSo why have they fallen back so much? How can a team packed with so many good players form such a dismal unit?\nThe team that were thrashed 4-1 by Argentina on Tuesday appeared to have no midfield, and were unable either to attack or defend.\nDorival Junior is under pressure following the heavy defeat by Argentina\nTuesday's prolonged humiliation did not come out of the blue. \nIn game after game the team have looked disjointed, without clear strategies for progressing the ball down the field, and suffering from the possibility of being both outplayed and outnumbered in central midfield. \nIndividual talent has papered over the cracks - like on Thursday, when a stoppage-time Vinicius Jr special gave them a victory over Colombia their play had not really deserved. \nBut it can't happen all the time.\nAnd if the film is bad, especially if the cast is impressive, the director must be to blame. \nThere is a crisis in Brazilian coaching. It is hard to produce coaches when there is no time to train and no job security. That is the reality of domestic Brazilian football, and helps explain why almost all of the successful coaches in the country are now foreign - either Argentine or, especially, Portuguese.\nThe national boss - for now anyway - Dorival Jr is a product of the domestic game, with more than four decades' experience as player and coach. \nBut on the international stage he comes across as a decent man thoroughly out of his depth.\nDid he really think he could travel to Argentina and play two men in central midfield? Why not drop deep and create space for the counter-attack, as he did a year ago against England at Wembley? And when cool heads were required, his team came across as a bag of nerves, all too willing to get involved in cheap spats.\nOf the three duties of the coach - pick the team, determine the strategy and set the emotional tone - Dorival failed dismally, and it is very hard to see how he can keep his job.\nIf he is to be replaced, there would seem to be two options. One is to go foreign - the Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus would be a strong candidate. The other would be to fast-track former Chelsea left-back Filipe Luis - a man of great intelligence who has made an impressive start to his coaching career with Rio giants Flamengo.\nWhoever comes in - or Dorival if he manages to hang on - will have to deal with a simple observation - central midfield is not an optional extra.\nIt is an area where Brazil have had a problem for a while - a consequence of the 1990s trend of splitting the middle of the park into a pair of midfielders who only defend and a duo who mostly attack. It was at this point Brazilian play lost much of its former fluency, instead investing in rapid breaks down the flanks.\nIt is in this context that the problems of Lucas Paqueta are so significant. \nThe West Ham midfielder was on the verge of becoming a big-money Manchester City signing when scandal struck, and his career - now threatened - has not recovered.\nThe evidence of Dorival's first games in charge - a year ago away to England and Spain - was Paqueta had become the most important player in the team, the man capable of filling space in midfield, dictating the rhythm of the game and unleashing the pace of the likes of Vinicius Jr.\nRonaldo quits Brazil federation presidency race\nAlisson returns to Liverpool after 'suspected concussion'\nThe absence of Paqueta almost certainly led to Dorival building his hopes for these international dates around the return of Neymar - which, predictably, turned out to be ludicrously premature.\nAfter so long out injured, it was only to be expected that Neymar would run into muscular problems, and he will need much more time on the field to ease his way back to a level where he can tip the balance.\nAt 33, he is an unknown quantity. But there is a gaping hole in the team for the type of deep-lying playmaker role he could fill. \nRomantics might recall 2002, when Ronaldo looked all washed up only to make a triumphant return from injury and carry a Brazil side that almost failed to qualify all the way to World Cup title number five. \nThey are still waiting for number six. \nIf they can do it next year then, in the wake of Tuesday's humiliation, it will be a candidate for one of football's great comebacks.\nNeymar's absence from the Brazil team was prolonged by a muscular injury",

China's opposition to the imposition of additional tariffs has always been consistent and clear\".Trump made the comments after announcing new import taxes of 25% on all cars and car parts coming into the US in a move that threatens to widen the global trade war.The BBC has contacted TikTok for comment.The biggest sticking point to finalising a deal to sell the TikTok business, which is worth tens of billions of dollars, has always been securing Beijing's agreement.Trump has previously tried to use tariffs as leverage in the negotiations.On his first day back in the White House, on 20 January, the president threatened more import duties on China if it did not approve a TikTok deal.The hugely popular app is used by around 170 million Americans.Trump, who called for TikTok to be banned in his first term as president, now has an account on the platform. He has more than 15 million followers and has said he received billions of views on the app during his presidential election campaign.Separately, the US increased levies on all imports from China to 20% this month.That doubled the tariffs Trump imposed on the world's second largest economy on 4 February.On 10 February, China responded with its own tariffs, including a 10-15% tax on some US agricultural goods.Beijing has also targeted various US aviation, defence and tech firms by adding them to an \"unreliable entity list\" and imposing export controls.The 10% levy doubled to 20% on 4 March.China has urged the US to return to dialogue with Beijing as soon as possible.When and why could TikTok be banned in the US?Instagram may launch separate Reels app to take on TikTok - report'Chubby filter' pulled from TikTok after user backlashTikTokInternational BusinessTrump tariffs",

        "article_text": "F1 cars, such as Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari, use 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrid engines\nChristian Horner's phone rang. It was Bernie Ecclestone. Red Bull's team principal picked up, switched to speakerphone and placed it on the table in front of the assembled Formula 1 bosses.\nWe're in the F1 Commission, Horner told Ecclestone. Is there anything you want to say to the room?\nF1's former impresario, addressing the group that decides the sport's rules, said they should go back to V10 engines. Then he hung up.\nThat phone call - described to BBC Sport by several sources in the room at the time - took place in the morning of the day of F1's season launch at the O2 Arena in London in February, where both Horner and governing body the FIA were booed by the 15,000-strong crowd.\nTwo days later, FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem - a man whose three-year tenure has been beset by controversy - posted a message on Instagram.\nBen Sulayem said he \"looked forward\" to the new chassis and engine rules that are  to be introduced in 2026, but that the FIA \"must also lead the way on future technological motorsport trends.\n\"We should consider a range of directions, including the roaring sound of the V10 running on sustainable fuel.\"\nThese developments have kick-started a debate inside F1 about engines. The ground is shifting fast, so what's going on?\nNext year, F1 is going through the biggest regulation change in the sport's history, introducing new rules for both cars and engines.\nOn engines, F1 is sticking with 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids, the basic architecture that has been in place since 2014, but changing the balance between electric and combustion power.\nThe amount of total power provided by the hybrid is going up to about 50% from about 20% now. In addition, F1 is introducing sustainable fuels - abandoning fossil fuels in favour of synthetic fuel created from biomass and industrial processes.\nThis is all part of the sport's pledge to become net-zero carbon by 2030.\nThis video can not be played\nF1 in 10 Years: Lando Norris\nEver since hybrid engines were introduced in 2014, some have bemoaned the loss of the louder, more dramatic sound produced by the naturally aspirated engines that preceded them - especially the 3.0-litre V10s last raced in F1 in 2005.\nIn an unavoidable parallel with Ben Sulayem's actions now, Ecclestone was the first person to bring this up, even before the 2014 engines first raced.\nA certain romanticism about the V10 sound has sustained, as has the idea that those engines - with their ear-splitting shriek that could be heard some distance from the track - are more popular with the fanbase than the current hybrids.\nWithin F1, there is no question that some people agree. Lewis Hamilton said at the Chinese Grand Prix last weekend: \"It is no secret that the V6 has never sounded great.\n\"I remember the first time I came to an F1 race in 1996 in Spa and arriving and Michael (Schumacher) coming through Turn One and my rib cage just vibrated. I was so hooked. It was the most amazing thing I felt and heard.\n\"Over the years we've lost that. If we are able to move back to those amazing sounding engines and still able to see the sustainable goals, why not?\"\nFernando Alonso took his 2005 title-winning Renault R25 - with V10 engine - for a demonstration run on track before the 2020 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix\nIt's not that long since Ben Sulayem was trumpeting his involvement in the introduction of the 2026 engine rules.\nThese were fundamentally settled under the previous FIA president Jean Todt, but there was inevitable wrangling and it got over the line only after Ben Sulayem took office.\nTwo years ago, he said the new engines were \"at the forefront of technological innovation, making the future of F1 more sustainable while maintaining the spectacular racing\".\nSo why the U-turn?\nBen Sulayem has asked his F1 single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis to look into the matter.\nTombazis said that the advent of\u00a0sustainable fuels could allow F1 to make the engines simpler and cheaper.\n\"That's why the president made the comments about V10 engines in '28 - or '29 or whatever - and so on,\" Tombazis said. \"And that is something we are evaluating with the manufacturers.\"\nSenior figures within F1 and the car manufacturers involved in the sport see many problems with the FIA's position.\nOn a macro level, the climate crisis is very real, and the global road-car industry is heading in the direction of electrification - even if Donald Trump's election at the head of a government of climate deniers has given pause for thought in the US.\nManufacturers take part in F1 fundamentally for marketing reasons, and the sport has been made more appealing by the introduction of a budget cap for cars and engines.\nAudi, Ford and General Motors are all entering F1 in 2026 - and Honda are staying rather than withdrawing - specifically because of the new engine rules.\nAudi has already released a statement in response to the latest developments, saying that the new rules \"were a key factor in Audi's decision to enter Formula 1\".\nMercedes says it is open to discussions but would need a hybrid element to be part of any new engine formula for it to remain interested.\nThen there is the micro level.\nWhy a V10? No major road-car manufacturer uses them any more.\nMercedes says a V8 would make more sense if a change was to be made, as at least they are still being developed for road use.\nAnd why abandon turbochargers, when many performance road cars - from Audi RS6s or Mercedes AMG C63s to McLaren and Ferrari hypercars - use them for very good reasons?\nCost? Yes, a V10 might be cheaper than a hybrid. But the manufacturers have already spent an estimated collective $400m on the new engines. They are not about to throw that away.\nAnd a new V10 would require developing, to the tune of hundreds of millions more.\nWeight? Yes, the hybrid engines make the cars heavier, largely because of the batteries needed. But the majority of the weight increase from 550kg or so in 2005 to about 800kg now is accounted for by advances in safety, such as the halo head-protection device.\nOn top of that, in 2013, cars started races with about 160kg of fuel. Now, it's about 100kg and it's expected to be about the same next year. Returning to naturally aspirated engines would mean a huge increase in fuel capacity - and weight.\nSustainability? The new fuels being introduced next year are not net-zero carbon. According to scientific standards, sustainable fuels reduce carbon emissions by a little above 80%.\nThat's a lot. But doubling the amount of fuel used by abandoning hybrid engines would mean a doubling of the carbon emissions produced by fuel.\nThe emissions from the cars themselves are minuscule in the big picture - F1's transport around the world is much more significant. Still, the symbolism matters.\nRed Bull boss Christian Horner and FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem are both said to be interested in a return to V10 engines\nIn F1, politics are always involved.\nIt has escaped the attention of few that Ben Sulayem's intervention came after the crowd at the O2 booed when the FIA logo was shown.\nThis is an election year at the FIA, and some believe Ben Sulayem may have raised the idea of V10s because he thinks it will be popular with certain demographics who support him.\nSo far, no candidate has put themselves forwards to oppose him, but there are whispers that there is a credible opponent in the wings.\nAt the same time, word is creeping out in F1 about the progress the various manufacturers are making with their 2026 engines. And it seems that Mercedes are leading the way.\nPeople are already beginning to say that a team will only win in 2026 if it has a Mercedes engine.\nOf course, there is no proof of this, but the whispers are emerging in exactly the same way as similar ones did in 2013 - and they were proved exactly right when the hybrid engines made their debut the following year.\nThe V10 proposal is seen by rival teams as very much a Horner-Ben Sulayem agenda, even if it is said to have some support from Ferrari.\nEven Horner, while saying that \"the concept of a V10 would be very exciting for the sport\" acknowledges that abandoning the rules would be \"a massive departure from what is being worked on very hard for 2026\".\nA U-turn for 2026 now would need support from the teams and manufacturers - and there is not a chance that enough of them would support that to get it through.\nA leading team boss told BBC Sport on condition of anonymity that there have been \"zero discussions\" of this idea in the group of F1 stakeholders.\nIt takes time - years - to agree engine rules.\nIt would probably be two years before a full agreement could be reached. Then the manufacturers would need the same time again to develop and build the engines. Which would take F1 to the end of 2029. Which is only a year before the new rules are due to expire anyway.\nAs one team boss puts it: \"I think this will all peter out, and it will just end up becoming: 'What will 2031 look like?'\"\nThe FIA says: \"There needs to be a consultation between all stakeholders to agree on a way forward, before we fully explore different scenarios.\n\"Whichever direction is chosen, we must support the teams and manufacturers in ensuring cost control on R&D expenditure and take account of environmental and sustainability considerations.\"\nAnd the chances of the end result being a naturally aspirated V10, in the context of all the above?

        "article_text": "A carpet of flowers has been growing outside Wigan Athletic's stadium in tribute to Darren Orme\nDarren Orme was a familiar figure cycling through the streets to work, the supporter known as 'Mr Wigan Athletic' because of a devotion to his beloved Latics stretching back more than 40 years.\nHe was nearly always first on the supporters' coach travelling to away games, happy to wait in the early hours for the ticket office to open for big occasions such as the club's greatest day - the 2013 FA Cup final win over Manchester City at Wembley.\nWhen he was reported missing on 5 March, supporters, the town and its respective football and rugby league clubs rallied in the search for the 54-year-old amid a huge public response.\nSadly, his body was discovered a fortnight later in the shadow of the Brick Community Stadium where he always took his seat in the East Stand.\nIt is a story both heartbreaking and heartwarming, as it enabled the people of Wigan to prove that the powerful concept of football as an extension of family still exists.\nThe life of this much-loved supporter will be commemorated and celebrated at Wigan Athletic's home game against Barnsley on Saturday (15:00 GMT), when a minute's applause will be held, while a shirt emblazoned with 'Darren 1 Of Our Own' and a scarf will be placed on his seat.\nSince the news of Darren's death a carpet of flowers has grown around the stadium's statue of former Wigan chairman and owner Dave Whelan, while a book of condolence has been opened.\nAmid the sadness, the response from Wigan supporters, and the town as a whole, has shone a light on the pivotal role a football club can play in its community - and how regarding your club as an extension of family is not an emotional exaggeration.\nMick Wimsey, chairman of the club's Travel and Supporters Club, organised a search for Darren in the days following his disappearance, also driving around in the early hours while taking time off work in an attempt to find the friend who had followed Wigan Athletic with him for more than four decades.\n\"We live in a bad world,\" he told BBC Sport. \"But the amount of goodness that's come out of this is amazing. When there was no word on Darren after a few days, we organised a search on the Sunday after he went missing.\n\"I was only expecting a few people to turn up but we had more than 100. All those people searched for Darren from 10am to 4.30pm - then some went back out afterwards after they had a break.\n\"On that Sunday morning, there were people who don't even watch football, but had seen him going to work on his bike and felt compelled to come and look for him. It was heartbreaking, but there was good in it as well.\"\nHe added: \"Football clubs are like your family. He was part of our family at Latics. Once you saw him you'd never forget him. His smile was infectious. If you could bottle what Darren had, Armani would make millions out of it.\n\"Sometimes you saw more of him than you did members of your own family. He was one of my best friends. I've been watching Wigan for 46 seasons and running the supporters' club for 44. I've known Darren for so long. I met him at a game against Walsall when we were both kids about 14 years of age.\n\"I was asked to write a tribute to him in the local paper. It just poured out of me and I found myself with tears streaming down my face. Everyone loved Darren - although he was definitely the worst raffle-ticket seller I ever knew.\"\nThe official Wigan Athletic Supporters Club paid an emotional tribute to \"a recognisable and loved character\" who \"lived and breathed blue and white\". It will pay posthumous tribute with a fan of the month award - a framed certificate passed to Darren's family before Saturday's game.\nIt added: \"He had numerous nominations for our fan of the month, including 'for being the loudest singer in any stadium' and for bringing back programmes from away matches for fans who couldn't attend themselves. Darren was kind-hearted and caring.\"\nThe body of popular Wigan Athletic supporter Darren Orme was found on Monday\nWhen he was reported missing, posters were placed in shop windows around Wigan, while new manager Ryan Lowe made a public appeal. There was also a banner on display at Wigan's training headquarters.\nJamie Allen, head of media marketing and communications at Wigan, said: \"Latics has had its issues on and off the pitch over the last few years. It's been a rollercoaster ride at Wigan Athletic, but this showed what this club and town has at its heart.\n\"This was not the outcome anyone wanted and is devastating, but it united a town and a sporting family across two clubs - Wigan Athletic and Wigan Warriors. The community and clubs come together in times of need and, like families, this is what happened here.\n\"This is a very sad outcome but there is a heartwarming side to this in what it says about our town and the people in it, and how much a football club and its supporters - and of course the rugby league club - can mean.\"\nSaturday will be an emotional day in Wigan when they face Barnsley, but Wimsey says: \"Football supporters are a community regardless of who you support. Bolton Wanderers fans, our big rivals, were sending love and their thoughts.\n\"It will change next Tuesday when we play each other, but for this period of time we were all like one big family. This is what football is -  it is grassroots, working class and the word 'family' is right.\"\nWigan, of course, are not the first club or community to have proved amid tragedy that football has a life and impact stretching beyond 90 minutes.\nWhen six-year-old Bradley Lowery died after a long illness - he was only 18 months when diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a rare type of cancer - he had become known to the whole football community. \nThe Sunderland fan became \"best mates\" with his hero, striker Jermain Defoe, as well as gaining worldwide recognition following an appeal in which he received 250,000 Christmas cards from around the globe.\nHe met then England manager Gareth Southgate and former striker Gary Lineker at BBC Sports Personality of the Year, and won Match of the Day's goal of the month award after he took a penalty before a Sunderland game against Chelsea.\nMeanwhile, earlier this month, Rangers captain James Tavernier, goalkeeper Jack Butland and former Scotland international Robert Snodgrass all contributed to a fundraiser for a fan killed in Turkey after being hit by two cars while crossing a road in Istanbul before the Glasgow side's Europa League match with Fenerbahce.\nOxford United are another club touched by tragedy, when former winger Joey Beauchamp, regarded by many as their greatest player, took his own life aged 50 in February 2022.\nHis younger brother Luke has set up a foundation in his name to help those battling mental health and depression to support their families.\nPaul Peros, chairman of OXVOX, the Independent Supporters Trust for Oxford United, said: \"Fundamentally, as much as everyone wants wins and promotions, we want to feel connected to the club we love, along with the fans who share the experience.\n\"In a slightly different way, when Joey passed away it did feel almost like a member of a family, because in a broader sense football is absolutely a family, especially at your own club.\n\"You spend as much time with those you regularly go to the match with as you do a lot of your family. You build those bonds. The story of the Wigan supporter is so sad but has also shown how football does go beyond the pitch and into the community.\n\"There are people that you may not know, but have just seen around at away games or whatever. You have shared experiences, like members of a family. The minute you sit down, they will bring up things like the non-league days, the experiences, good and bad.\n\"There have been a couple of instances where we have spoken directly to people we are aware of that may be struggling in some way, but it is more a case of us helping to facilitate things like the Joey Beauchamp Foundation, who are doing great work, and the club taking it on.\"",

        "article_text": "Thiago Motta was appointed at Juventus in June last year\nThiago Motta lasted just nine months at Juventus before the Italian giants sacked him last week and swiftly appointed Igor Tudor.\nMotta's departure came after heavy back-to-back defeats in Serie A - losing 4-0 at home to Atalanta before being beaten 3-0 at Fiorentina.\nThat appeared to be the final straw, with Motta having also overseen Juventus' exit from the Champions League and the Coppa Italia, which they won last season.\n\"It was inevitable,\" journalist Julien Laurens said on BBC Radio 5 Live's Euro Leagues podcast.\n\"You can't lose 4-0 and 3-0 in back-to-back games, on the back of being knocked out in the Champions League.\"\nBut will his departure solve Juventus' issues? And is former Croatia defender Tudor the right man to turn things around?\nMotta, 42, a former midfielder with Barcelona, Inter Milan and Paris St-Germain, was appointed last year after a hugely impressive spell at Bologna.\nHis progressive style of football transformed the club from one battling against relegation to one that finished fifth in Serie A last season to secure a place in the Champions League.\nHowever, the style of football with which he so impressed at Bologna was rarely on show with Juventus.\n\"I felt for him, because I am a big fan and I love what he did at Bologna,\" Laurens added. \n\"This doesn't mean he is not a good coach and that later on in his career he is not going to achieve great things, but maybe this was a little bit too early and certainly it just never started.\"\nThis video can not be played\nEuro Leagues: Pet turtles and the two-metre Messi\nQuestion marks could also be raised over Juventus' dealings in the transfer market during Motta's time at the club.\nWeeks after arriving at Juventus, he oversaw the \u00a342.35m signing of midfielder Douglas Luiz from Aston Villa.\nSuch a significant outlay suggested he would be a key player for what Motta wanted to do, but Luiz started only three of the 17 league games in which he was included in the matchday squad.\nStriker Moise Kean was allowed to leave to join Fiorentina in a deal worth a reported \u00a310m., external He is currently the second-highest scorer in Serie A with 15 goals.\nMotta's focus was to make Juventus defensively solid and he achieved that as they did not concede a goal in their first six games.\nBut that appeared to limit them as an attacking force and while they did not lose much, they also drew far too many games. From 1 September they went 19 league games unbeaten, but 13 of those ended in draws.\nItalian journalist Mina Rzouki said: \"We can't blame Thiago Motta for some of the choices of which players were brought in, but it was almost like he continued to double down on his tactics, regardless of the fact it seemed like he lost the dressing room when it came to absorbing those instructions of how he wants to play. \n\"He refused to be pragmatic in any way shape or form and I think when you have the second youngest team, that were now losing confidence, and yet you still double down on your philosophy.\n\"I think he made some huge mistakes, despite the fact he had a brilliant time at Bologna.\"\nNot all of the blame for Juventus' problems this season can be placed at the feet of Motta, with issues off the pitch as well as on it.\n\"Juventus is a mess on every level,\" Rzouki added. \n\"They don't have a sponsor, that goes to show you everything you need to know. Jeep ran out, the long-term sponsor they had, and they couldn't find another one. \n\"So this is a management that's not doing well from every level up above.\"\nAccording to reports,, external Juventus' sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli is under pressure for perceived mistakes made with player and manager recruitment.\nLaurens said: \"Motta struggled to get his project going, it's not just on him, obviously the players and Giuntoli the sporting director are partly to blame too.\n\"But as a manager you pay the price and I think it was inevitable they were going to sack him.\"\n'A house of cards' - Sampdoria face 'unthinkable' relegation\nTudor's last managerial stint before returning to Juventus was at Lazio\nGiven how the Motta appointment worked out, the pressure is on Giuntoli to ensure Tudor is the right man to turn the club's fortunes around.\nThe former midfielder, who played for Juventus between 1998 and 2007, is currently only on a contract until the end of the season, but that will reportedly be automatically renewed, external if he secures Champions League qualification.\nHe has been seen as something of a fixer - a coach able to come in during a season and oversee swift improvements.\nThe 46-year-old has a reputation for being a fixer, coming into clubs during the season and turning things around, something he did successfully in previous roles at Udinese, Hellas Verona and Lazio.\nHis most recent role was a three-month spell at Lazio at the end of last season.\n\"Am I someone who resolves problems? I consider myself a coach,\" Tudor said. \n\"I started coaching young and I've been doing it for 10-15 years, I have gone around a lot, I can also be a bit particular because I make choices with my heart. I live in the present. \n\"I want to be here for 10 years, but I will do my work in the same way. We can't control what happens in the future.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

What went wrong for Motta and why are Juventus in a 'mess'?Image source, ReutersImage caption, Thiago Motta was appointed at Juventus in June last yearPublished7 hours agoThiago Motta lasted just nine months at Juventus before the Italian giants sacked him last week and swiftly appointed Igor Tudor.Motta's departure came after heavy back-to-back defeats in Serie A - losing 4-0 at home to Atalanta before being beaten 3-0 at Fiorentina.That appeared to be the final straw, with Motta having also overseen Juventus' exit from the Champions League and the Coppa Italia, which they won last season. \"'A house of cards' - Sampdoria face 'unthinkable' relegationPublished1 day agoIs Tudor the right man to turn things around?Image source, ReutersImage caption, Tudor's last managerial stint before returning to Juventus was at LazioGiven how the Motta appointment worked out, the pressure is on Giuntoli to ensure Tudor is the right man to turn the club's fortunes around.The former midfielder, who played for Juventus between 1998 and 2007, is currently only on a contract until the end of the season, but that will reportedly be automatically renewed, external if he secures Champions League qualification.He has been seen as something of a fixer - a coach able to come in during a season and oversee swift improvements.The 46-year-old has a reputation for being a fixer, coming into clubs during the season and turning things around, something he did successfully in previous roles at Udinese, Hellas Verona and Lazio.His most recent role was a three-month spell at Lazio at the end of last season. \"Player recruitment an issue?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Euro Leagues: Pet turtles and the two-metre MessiQuestion marks could also be raised over Juventus' dealings in the transfer market during Motta's time at the club.Weeks after arriving at Juventus, he oversaw the \u00a342.35m signing of midfielder Douglas Luiz from Aston Villa.Such a significant outlay suggested he would be a key player for what Motta wanted to do, but Luiz started only three of the 17 league games in which he was included in the matchday squad.Striker Moise Kean was allowed to leave to join Fiorentina in a deal worth a reported \u00a310m., external He is currently the second-highest scorer in Serie A with 15 goals.Motta's focus was to make Juventus defensively solid and he achieved that as they did not concede a goal in their first six games.But that appeared to limit them as an attacking force and while they did not lose much, they also drew far too many games.",

He has vast knowledge of the game, a great track record, a strong network and an insatiable desire to build winning teams.\n\"We undertook a thorough recruitment process and we were hugely impressed with the level of all the other candidates, but it was Andrea's experience and the success he has enjoyed that stood out.\"\nKieran Trippier helped Atletico win La Liga in the 2020-21 season\nSpanish football expert Guillem Balague told BBC Sport: \"He's quite unique compared to other sporting directors.\n\"He had no playing career, started in banking, and only got into football later, first at Carpenedolo, an amateur club, then at Parma and Genoa, where he built key connections with Peter Kenyon and Jorge Mendes.\n\"Under his watch, Atletico won two La Liga titles (2013-14, 2020-21), a Copa del Rey (2013), a Europa League (2017-18), and a Uefa Super Cup (2018). \n\"He's seen as the architect of the squad rebuild after the 2014 title-winning team faded.\"\nWorking with manager Diego Simeone, Berta helped Atletico make some astute acquisitions during that rebuild.\nFrance striker Griezmann was signed from Real Sociedad for \u00a324.8m in 2014 and five years later was sold to Barcelona for \u00a3103m. Atletico then bought him back in 2021 for just \u00a316.5m.\nSpain midfielder Rodri, now a Ballon d'Or winner, was signed for \u00a316.5m in 2018 and sold to Manchester City the following year for \u00a362.5m, while Slovenian goalkeeper Oblak signed from Benfica in 2014 for just \u00a313m. He's now widely regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the world.\nMore recently, forward Julian Alvarez joined from Manchester City last summer for \u00a381.5m and he has scored 23 goals for Atletico this season.\n\"He brought in key players like Griezmann (twice), Luis Suarez, Kieran Trippier, Llorente, De Paul, and Julian Alvarez,\" added Balague. \n\"But he also had some flops, like Joao Felix, Kalinic, Arias, Torreira, but he always worked within the club's financial limits.\n\"In total, he made 52 signings since 2017, spending around 828 million euros (\u00a3692m), leaving a big mark on Atletico's squad. An end of an era for them.\"\nBBC Sport's Arsenal reporter Alex Howell\nThere are a few immediate issues he has to deal with.\nThe main and most obvious task is to ensure that Arsenal bring in a much-needed forward. The Gunners have suffered key injuries to key attackers this season and have not brought in a forward for two transfer windows in a row.\nKai Havertz has done excellently in filling that void but at times Arsenal's need for a natural goalscorer has been obvious.\nRB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has long been monitored, while Newcastle forward Alexander Isak is also being linked with a move to north London.\nHowever, Eddie Howe's Magpies are in the mix for the Champions League places, making a deal for Isak expensive and more difficult to do.\nThere is also an argument that Arteta's side could do with a player who has some flair and the ability to make something happen when they play against teams that sit in a low block against them in the Premier League.\nIt's not only incomings that Berta will need to address. It's a big summer for the club with key players Bukayo Saka, William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes entering the last two years of their contracts.\nBerta will need to make sure that those players are locked down so that Arteta can continue to build on the impressive work he has done with the team.\nThere are also players who need to be moved on. Oleksandr Zinchenko has dropped further down the pecking order after the emergence of Myles Lewis-Skelly and the Gunners were willing to let him go in January if they received the right offer.\nIt is an exciting project for any sporting director to come into but with the Gunners challenging for silverware in recent seasons, this summer is not something that they can afford to get wrong.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

They also share significant resources.\n\"The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge,\" Musk wrote.\nXAI has used data from social media posts on X to train its models, and its chatbot Grok is a prominent feature on the platform.\n\"The move appears sensible, considering the current trend of increased investments in AI, data centres, and computing,\" said analyst Paolo Pescatore, founder of PP Foresight. \nMr Musk has been locked in a legal battle with OpenAI, the company he-founded in 2015 with CEO Sam Altman.\nLast year, Mr Musk sued OpenAI and Mr. Altman for straying from the company's original mission and pushing to transition the startup to a for-profit model.\nOn Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that OpenAI was finalizing a $40 billion funding round with the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. The outlet also reported the funds are contingent on the company completing its restructuring to a for-profit entity.\nOpenAI did not respond to a BBC inquiry about the arrangement.\nCritics say Mr Musk is suing the ChatGPT makers because he wanted to control it.\nEarlier this year, a consortium led by Mr Musk made an unsolicited $97.4 billion takeover bid for OpenAI, which Mr Altman rejected, saying the company is not for sale.\nThe business manoeuvring is happening as Mr Musk has taken more of an interest in politics, now serving as President Donald Trump's right-hand. \nHe has spearheaded the administration's push to slash federal spending and is spending the weekend in Wisconsin where he has contributed millions to a state Supreme Court race.\nWisconsin's attorney general asked a court Friday to block Mr Musk from distributing $1 million checks to voters there ahead of the election.

The outlet also reported the funds are contingent on the company completing its restructuring to a for-profit entity.OpenAI did not respond to a BBC inquiry about the arrangement.Critics say Mr Musk is suing the ChatGPT makers because he wanted to control it.Earlier this year, a consortium led by Mr Musk made an unsolicited $97.4 billion takeover bid for OpenAI, which Mr Altman rejected, saying the company is not for sale.The business manoeuvring is happening as Mr Musk has taken more of an interest in politics, now serving as President Donald Trump's right-hand. Mr Musk has been locked in a legal battle with OpenAI, the company he-founded in 2015 with CEO Sam Altman.Last year, Mr Musk sued OpenAI and Mr. Altman for straying from the company's original mission and pushing to transition the startup to a for-profit model.On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that OpenAI was finalizing a $40 billion funding round with the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. \"xAI and X's futures are intertwined,\" Musk wrote on X Friday. \"The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge,\" Musk wrote.XAI has used data from social media posts on X to train its models, and its chatbot Grok is a prominent feature on the platform.",

        "article_text": "Brazil were beaten 4-1 by Argentina in their most recent World Cup qualifier\nIn any previous World Cup, there would be genuine fear about Brazil failing to qualify. Not this time.\nIn an expanded competition, with six South American teams making it through automatically, Brazil have a six-point cushion over a Venezuela team who have just registered their first victory in 10 games.\nWith four rounds to go, it is impossible to see Brazil not making the cut. But that is hardly the point.\nFor Brazil, World Cup qualification now serves one purpose - it provides a sequence of competitive matches during which they hope to build a side capable of winning the trophy. And with just over a year to go until 2026, that looks a long way off.\nIt is easy to forget how good Brazil were in the last World Cup, where they lost in the quarter-finals on penalties to a Croatia team whose only shot on goal in the match took a cruel deflection.\nThe Qatar 2022 Brazil side were solid - goalkeeper Alisson could have taken a deckchair out for most of the games - with flashes of brilliance. They could have won that competition. \nSo why have they fallen back so much? How can a team packed with so many good players form such a dismal unit?\nThe team that were thrashed 4-1 by Argentina on Tuesday appeared to have no midfield, and were unable either to attack or defend.\nDorival Junior is under pressure following the heavy defeat by Argentina\nTuesday's prolonged humiliation did not come out of the blue. \nIn game after game the team have looked disjointed, without clear strategies for progressing the ball down the field, and suffering from the possibility of being both outplayed and outnumbered in central midfield. \nIndividual talent has papered over the cracks - like on Thursday, when a stoppage-time Vinicius Jr special gave them a victory over Colombia their play had not really deserved. \nBut it can't happen all the time.\nAnd if the film is bad, especially if the cast is impressive, the director must be to blame. \nThere is a crisis in Brazilian coaching. It is hard to produce coaches when there is no time to train and no job security. That is the reality of domestic Brazilian football, and helps explain why almost all of the successful coaches in the country are now foreign - either Argentine or, especially, Portuguese.\nThe national boss - for now anyway - Dorival Jr is a product of the domestic game, with more than four decades' experience as player and coach. \nBut on the international stage he comes across as a decent man thoroughly out of his depth.\nDid he really think he could travel to Argentina and play two men in central midfield? Why not drop deep and create space for the counter-attack, as he did a year ago against England at Wembley? And when cool heads were required, his team came across as a bag of nerves, all too willing to get involved in cheap spats.\nOf the three duties of the coach - pick the team, determine the strategy and set the emotional tone - Dorival failed dismally, and it is very hard to see how he can keep his job.\nIf he is to be replaced, there would seem to be two options. One is to go foreign - the Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus would be a strong candidate. The other would be to fast-track former Chelsea left-back Filipe Luis - a man of great intelligence who has made an impressive start to his coaching career with Rio giants Flamengo.\nWhoever comes in - or Dorival if he manages to hang on - will have to deal with a simple observation - central midfield is not an optional extra.\nIt is an area where Brazil have had a problem for a while - a consequence of the 1990s trend of splitting the middle of the park into a pair of midfielders who only defend and a duo who mostly attack. It was at this point Brazilian play lost much of its former fluency, instead investing in rapid breaks down the flanks.\nIt is in this context that the problems of Lucas Paqueta are so significant. \nThe West Ham midfielder was on the verge of becoming a big-money Manchester City signing when scandal struck, and his career - now threatened - has not recovered.\nThe evidence of Dorival's first games in charge - a year ago away to England and Spain - was Paqueta had become the most important player in the team, the man capable of filling space in midfield, dictating the rhythm of the game and unleashing the pace of the likes of Vinicius Jr.\nRonaldo quits Brazil federation presidency race\nAlisson returns to Liverpool after 'suspected concussion'\nThe absence of Paqueta almost certainly led to Dorival building his hopes for these international dates around the return of Neymar - which, predictably, turned out to be ludicrously premature.\nAfter so long out injured, it was only to be expected that Neymar would run into muscular problems, and he will need much more time on the field to ease his way back to a level where he can tip the balance.\nAt 33, he is an unknown quantity. But there is a gaping hole in the team for the type of deep-lying playmaker role he could fill. \nRomantics might recall 2002, when Ronaldo looked all washed up only to make a triumphant return from injury and carry a Brazil side that almost failed to qualify all the way to World Cup title number five. \nThey are still waiting for number six. \nIf they can do it next year then, in the wake of Tuesday's humiliation, it will be a candidate for one of football's great comebacks.\nNeymar's absence from the Brazil team was prolonged by a muscular injury",

However, some operators fear the Meadow Way location is \"not safe\" and is too far to walk to the village centre.\nGloucestershire County Council insists the walk is \"short\", saying feedback will be \"welcome\" during the trial as it will be able to \"make changes\".\nThe six-month trial is set to begin around Easter and will allow coaches to stop at Meadow Way for 10 minutes to drop off and pick up passengers. Parking will then be available at the Pulhams Coaches site between 09:00 and 16:00 each day.\nA long-term plan is in the works, which would involve coaches parking in Cotswold School, although it has yet to be confirmed.\nArea director at Pulhams, Alex Chutter, said he is optimistic about the trial.\n\"It's welcome relief really,\" he said.\n\"I think there was a level of uncertainty in previous seasons and at least operators now know what the plans are and what options they have available. \n\"Hopefully that can entice them back to the area.\"\nThe council has shared Mr Chutter's hopes the scheme will encourage coach companies who stopped offering trips to Bourton-on-the-Water to return.\nHowever, multiple firms told the BBC they are not convinced by the plans.\nJason Edwards is the deputy chair of the Coach Tourism Association, a trade body representing coach tour operators. \nHe said: \"In a sort of way, it's a positive step because they have realised how important tourism is. But do we think they have got it right, no we don't.\"\nHe said the biggest sticking point is the 0.7 mile (1.1km) distance between the proposed drop-off point and the village's shops and attractions, particularly for older customers.\n\"We've got a higher-end age demographic, certainly when it comes to UK domestic coach passengers,\" he said.\n\"And for them to have a 15 to 20-minute walk, laden with shopping bags, with the British weather as unpredictable as it is, it just wouldn't work.\"\n\"They vote with their feet,\" he added. \"If there is any problems with walking distance or not having weatherproof facilities, they won't book that trip.\"\nMr Edwards, from South Wales, also runs his own coach tour business which offers tours to the Cotswolds. \n\"We dropped Bourton-on-the-Water completely,\" he said. \"We went to Stow-on-the-Wold and other areas around the Cotswolds.\n\"We wouldn't want to expose our customers to areas that aren't coach-friendly or welcoming. It has a detrimental effect to our business.\"\nHe said many operators represented by the Coach Travel Association also made the decision to avoid Bourton-on-the-Water or reduce the frequency of trips there.\nAmong the operators who continued to visit the village regularly last year was Middleton Tours. \nBut the firm said it had been forced to rethink its plans due to concerns over the trial and a recent incident where a resident shouted at one of its tour guides and passengers.\nTour manager Richard Smith said: \"The site that they have chosen is right at the junction so it's not safe. \n\"There is no shelter and no signage. There is apparently the provision for three coaches. Anybody that knows Bourton-on-the-Water, particularly during the main season, knows how busy it can get.\n\"It's ill-thought-through and could be prone to operational disasters. Until there is a  solution that works for the customer and coach operators, we have made the decision not to return to Bourton-on-the-Water.\"\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Gloucestershire County Council said the trial will give coaches a \"dedicated area\" to drop off and pick up customers which is a \"short walk\" from the centre of the village.\n\"The parish council would welcome feedback on the scheme from residents, visitors and coach operators,\" they added.\n\"The county council will be able to make changes to the scheme during the trial to ensure the best possible results.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "Mikaela Mayer (left) is a two-weight world champion having also held titles at super-featherweight\nWBO welterweight champion Mikaela Mayer faces Briton Sandy Ryan in a Las Vegas rematch on Saturday. \nIn her BBC Sport column, American Mayer talks about the events leading up to victory in last September's first fight in New York when Ryan was hit by a can of red paint before leaving for the venue.\nOn Friday, Ryan will address the controversy and rivalry between the pair.\nI was in my room and we were starting to walk to the elevator, waiting for the go-ahead from the team to say we could go down because we were at the same hotel as Sandy Ryan. \nSandy was out there first waiting for her car so we stood by the elevator and my nutritionist said to wait because she hasn't got in the car yet.\nMy nutritionist was looking at her phone and was like, 'oh my god, someone just threw paint on Sandy'. We were all taken aback but I didn't understand that I was apparently the culprit.\nI got in the car but didn't really understand the extent of it until I got to the arena and online there was a photo of Sandy, who was stripped down with red paint on her. ESPN came in to see me and apparently I'm being blamed for the attack.\nEveryone who knows me, knows that would be out of character for me - it's not my style. I expected her to try to blame me. I was her rival all week but there were also other things going on. \nSandy has already said flyers attacking her were put up around the hotel and city.\nYou can't just point a finger when there is no evidence leading back to me. I was upstairs waiting to walk down for the fight of my life. \nI didn't know what time she was going to be down there or that she was going first. The only people who knew were her team - maybe she should look inside her own circle.\nThe incident took me by surprise but I was in fight mode and it didn't happen to me, so I wasn't flustered.\nIf someone had thrown paint on me I would have slapped paint on the ass of my fight shorts and got on with it.\nI was concerned that she was going to pull out - her team were really getting her going about it.\nThere was a clip of her coach Kay Koroma in the locker room screaming at her to pull out of the fight which I thought was super suspicious. That was weird to me and out of character for him. \nI really don't think it was the paint that threw her off her game but her team, who made it a bigger deal than it had to be.\nObviously I don't want that to happen and I hope it doesn't happen going into this fight. It could have been called off and, after two years of busting my butt to get back in that position, that was the last thing I wanted.\nAs for 'paint-gate' being used to promote the rematch, I was surprised the Top Rank team used the paint on the promotion posters - but this is entertainment. \nI didn't have any say in it. If I had done anything like that, my manager would have had my neck as he tries to keep me professional.\nI didn't know about it until the poster came out and I said, 'do they have red paint on Sandy?'\nI was just as taken aback as anyone else, but it's kind of funny.\nMayer (right) beat Ryan (left) by majority decision with one judge scoring it a draw\nIt's important for women's boxing to have these rivalries and this is definitely up there as one of the top ones.\nI never counted out the rematch and just wanted to see what my other options were. Once I saw the views and how much the fans wanted it - and the excuses - I thought let's do it again and I'll do it even better.\nI didn't get my rematch with Alycia Baumgardner so I understand Sandy might have been frustrated, but I didn't have to give her this rematch. I could have just sat it out, waited for Lauren Price to unify and fought for undisputed or faced someone else. \nThat's not the fighter I am though.\nI pride myself on the fact a lot of the fights I have been in are competitive and people aren't sure who will win. \nMy feud with Alycia will stay number one for a lifetime, but Sandy can come second because of the coaching team situation and the paint situation.\nSandy and her team have tried to gaslight me in a sense where I'm supposed to be making all of this up or I'm being dramatic, but it happened.\nYou're going to see coach Koroma, my coach of eight or nine years since the Olympics, in her corner so they really can't say anything about it. They did what they did and they have to stand by that. \nI'm just protecting myself and I'm the one who had to go out and find a whole new team at this stage of my career which is not easy. I have truth on my side.\nMikaela Mayer was speaking to BBC Sport's Bobbie Jackson.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "On 3 May Australians will head to the polls to vote in their first federal election since 2022. \nThe results will determine who the next prime minister will be, as well as the make-up of the nation's parliament.\nAustralia famously has a unique electoral system - and some quirky polling day traditions. Voting is mandatory for all citizens over 18, the country uses preferential voting, and picking up a \"democracy sausage\" is a polling day custom.\nAlmost 18 million people are registered to vote in this election - roughly 98% of those who are eligible. \nUnlike the First Past the Post system - used in the UK and most US states - which elects candidates based on who has received the greatest number of votes in a single count, regardless of whether they've secured an absolute majority - voters in Australia rank candidates in order of preference. \nIf no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote in the first tally, the votes from the least popular candidates are then redistributed, and that process repeated until someone secures a majority.\nIn races for the House of Representatives, voters are required to mark a preference down for every single candidate listed on the ballot. \nHowever, in Senate races, voters only need to mark down a designated number of preferences. \nIt is the leader of the party that receives the most seats in the House who then becomes prime minister. There is no separate leadership ballot. \nAll of the seats in Australia's House of Representatives - that's 150 in this election -will be up for grabs, as will 40 of the 76 seats in the Senate. \nAustralia has two major parties: the left-leaning Australian Labor Party and the conservative Liberal-National coalition. \nOne party needs to win at least 76 seats in the House to form a majority government.\nIf it cannot do that, it must try to win support from minor parties or independent MPs. \nIn both state and federal elections, the vote share for minor parties and independents has been steadily increasing in Australia for decades. \nThat reached record levels in the 2022 federal election, with one in three Australians casting votes for candidates outside the two major parties.\nLabor formed a majority government after winning the 2022 election, which delivered the biggest loss for the Liberal Party since its inception. \nAs it stands, Labor has 78 seats in the House of Representatives, while the coalition has 57, with minor parties and independents splitting the remainder.\nBut with one House seat abolished, if Labor loses just two seats at this election it will be stripped of its majority in parliament.\nIn order to form a government in its own right, the coalition needs to win 19 seats, likely including many of those it lost to independent candidates during the 2022 vote. \nAnthony Albanese has been the prime minister since the last election, and a stalwart of parliament for almost 30 years.\nWhile he enjoyed a period of broad popularity after coming to power in 2022, he has in recent times come under pressure over his handling of divisive topics like housing, Indigenous affairs and both antisemitism and Islamophobia.\nAlbanese is being challenged by Peter Dutton, who became head of the Liberal-National coalition after their 2022 defeat. He is contesting his first election as opposition leader. \nKnown as a staunch conservative, Dutton has years of experience in important ministerial portfolios - like defence and home affairs - but has been a controversial figure at times, particularly on social issues.\nBoth the polling and the political messaging around this year's election indicate that cost of living is the biggest concern for many voters. \nSince the 2022 election, inflation - which is now slowing - has pushed up the prices of everyday essentials such as food and utilities, leaving many households feeling stretched. \nThe Albanese government has implemented a string of policies that it says are aimed at providing relief, such as keeping the cost of medications down, and offering tax cuts, energy rebates and rental assistance to those eligible.  \nHowever, Australia has raised interest rates 12 times since Albanese was elected in May 2022 - something that is done independently of government but seen to reflect their economic management - and that has put additional pressure on borrowers and those with mortgages across the country.\nHousing affordability will also be a key issue this election cycle, with several Australian cities among the most expensive in the world for homebuyers.\nHistorically, Australians are used to getting a result and knowing who will form government on election night. \nHowever, it is usually not the Australian Election Commission - the official body tasked with manually counting the votes - that declares this. \nInstead, the AEC provides what's known as an \"indicative count\" throughout the day, which media commentators, election experts and sometimes even the parties and candidates themselves then base their calls on.\nThe AEC does not formally declare a seat until it is confident the result will not change based on the number of uncounted votes, which can sometimes take days.

However, the decision can still be appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\"Alves is very happy. He is innocent, that is demonstrated. Justice has spoken,\" his lawyer Ines Guardiola told RAC1 radio.\nAlves had trophy-laden spells with Sevilla, Barcelona, Juventus and Paris St-Germain and also helped Brazil win two Copa Americas and an Olympic gold medal at the age of 38.\nHe was playing for Pumas UNAM when he was arrested, which led to the Mexican club terminating his contract immediately.",

Ex-Barca defender Alves has rape conviction quashedImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Former right-back Dani Alves won three Champions Leagues with Barcelona Published28 March 2025Former Barcelona and Brazil defender Dani Alves has had a rape conviction overturned on appeal by a Spanish court.The appeals division of Catalonia's High Court of Justice unanimously upheld the appeal by the 41-year-old and acquitted him, saying the case against him had \"inconsistencies and contradictions\".Alves was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in February 2024 after being found guilty of sexually assaulting a woman in a Barcelona nightclub in 2022.The former full-back, who earned 126 international caps, was released on bail in March 2024 while his appeal was heard by a higher court.The appeal court said that the ruling in the original court case \"contains, throughout the reasoning, a series of gaps, inaccuracies, inconsistencies and contradictions regarding the facts, the legal assessment and their consequences. He is innocent, that is demonstrated. \"Alves is very happy. Justice has spoken,\" his lawyer Ines Guardiola told RAC1 radio.Alves had trophy-laden spells with Sevilla, Barcelona, Juventus and Paris St-Germain and also helped Brazil win two Copa Americas and an Olympic gold medal at the age of 38.He was playing for Pumas UNAM when he was arrested, which led to the Mexican club terminating his contract immediately.Related topicsBarcelonaBrazilFootball",

        "article_text": "We are down to the last eight teams in this season's FA Cup, but which of them will lift the famous old trophy at Wembley in May?\nApart from defending Premier League champions Manchester City, none of the quarter-finalists have won any major silverware since the turn of the millennium, and four of them have never won the FA Cup at all.\n\"We all saw how much winning the Carabao Cup meant to Newcastle fans after their long wait for a trophy,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\"Liverpool and Arsenal are out, and City are clearly not the force they were, so this feels like a big chance for the other teams left in it to get some glory - I just hope they try to take it.\"\nSutton has made his predictions for all four sixth-round ties and for this weekend's matches he is up against Brit-nominated DJ and producer Nathan Dawe, who is an Aston Villa fan.\nDawe's new single featuring vocalist Abi Flynn, Here In Your Arms, is out now.\nDo you agree with their predictions? You can choose who you think will win each tie, below.\nDawe has had three UK top-10 singles and another four have reached the top 40. He made a surprise appearance on last month's Love Island All Stars final, playing Here In Your Arms at a pool party for the remaining couples\nVilla have not won a major trophy since the 1996 League Cup but are chasing silverware on two fronts this season and are into the last eight of the Champions League [where they play Paris St-Germain] as well as the FA Cup.\n\"I'm still in dreamland,\" Nathan told BBC Sport. \"I still can't believe I am going to Paris in a couple of weeks to watch us in a Champions League quarter-final.\n\"Honestly, it has not sunk in. I only ever used to hear about these glory days from my dad, but now we are actually able to experience it together. It's just unbelievable.\n\"What Unai Emery has done since taking charge in 2022 is just astronomical, and the players and fans are fully on board with what he is doing.\n\"Even when things are not going so well, it is clear that the team still has full confidence in the manager to have a Plan B or C to turn games around, and we have seen that happen on multiple occasions this season.\"\nAllow TikTok content?\nThis article contains content provided by TikTok.

It means so much to Villa fans because hardly any of us are alive who have seen us win it.\n\"Even my dad wasn't born the last time we won it [in 1957] and winning at Wembley would be very special. \n\"I've been lucky enough to go there a few times with Villa but other than our play-off win when we got promoted in 2019,  it has always ended up in misery.\"\nChris Sutton and Nathan Dawe were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\nGap = league places between the two teams\nCraven Cottage, 12:15 GMT\n8th in Premier League v 12th in Premier League\nGap = 4\nLast major trophy? Fulham: Never. Palace: Never\nBest FA Cup run? Fulham: runners-up in 1975. Palace: runners-up in 1990 & 2016\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.\nCrystal Palace won at Craven Cottage at the end of February and it is a ground where they have a decent record - they haven't lost there in their past six visits, since 2005.\nIt's a boost for Palace that Jean-Philippe Mateta is available to lead their attack - he can play wearing a special mask to protect his ear after his injury against Millwall in the fifth round - but we will have to see how much he has been affected by such a horrific challenge.\nThis video can not be played\nMillwall's Roberts sent off for 'dangerous' tackle on Mateta\nThe Eagles are a well-balanced team who seem to be improving all the time under Oliver Glasner - they have lost only two of their past 14 games in all competitions.\nI've found Fulham hard to predict this season because they've been less reliable than usual at home, but they are still having a strong campaign - they are in the mix for the Champions League places, and are only three points behind fifth-placed City.\nPalace are very strong on the road but they have not played for the past three weeks - their game against Newcastle before the international break was postponed because of the Carabao Cup final.\nWe often talk about teams needing a rest, but my concern is how that break has affected their momentum.\nThis is going to be a close game, but I actually fancy Fulham to edge it. Marco Silva's side have got goals in them, and my gut feeling is that they will get through in 90 minutes.\nI just hope both managers go for it properly, and don't prioritise next week's midweek Premier League games [Fulham are at Arsenal on Tuesday and Palace travel to Southampton on Wednesday] instead of this tie.\nFulham and Palace have shown this season they have got enough quality in their strongest starting XIs to go all the way in the FA Cup, especially this year when the competition appears so open. \nThey are both in a great position to finally win a major trophy, so why not try to make history and give their fans something to celebrate?\nPalace's only previous cup success was winning the Zenith Data Systems Cup in 1991. \nI can imagine their fans enjoyed that day a lot, but lifting the FA Cup would be on a different planet, and the same goes for Fulham, who have not even been in an FA Cup semi-final since 2002.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nNathan's prediction: It feels like Palace always turn into world-beaters in the last couple of months of the season, and I can see them winning this. 1-2\nAmex Stadium, 17:15 GMT\n7th in Premier League v 3rd in Premier League\nGap = 4\nLast major trophy?

Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.\nBrighton will see this as the chance to get revenge for their 7-0 defeat at the City Ground at the start of February.\nI am sure some people felt the wheels had come off for Seagulls boss Fabian Hurzeler after that result, but instead his side have bounced back and gone on a great run of six wins and one draw in all competitions.\nSometimes getting thrashed like that can have a positive effect on a team, and clear the air. \nI remember losing 7-1 at Blackburn Rovers in October 1992, when I was a centre-half for Norwich City, but we had a crate of beer on the coach home to put things right and we were still top of the  Premier League table at Christmas. I did get moved up front after that though.\nAs for Nottingham Forest, they are the only team left in the FA Cup where I could understand it if they rested players this weekend, because of their league position.\nThey play Manchester United on Tuesday and the finish line is in sight for my boyhood team to finish third and secure Champions League football.\nThat's why it's disappointing to hear about Chris Wood getting injured while playing for New Zealand this week.\nHopefully it is not serious, but it is a blow for Forest if they are without their main number nine for any length of time.\nTheir game plan won't change without Wood - they will sit deep and attack on the break, it is just a question on whether it is their A team who face Brighton or not, and my hunch is that Nuno Espirito Santo will make a few changes.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nNathan's prediction: Forest are in such a good position in the league, I have a feeling they are going to be super-focused on that. For that reason, I am going with Brighton. 2-0\nDeepdale, 13:30 BST\n14th in Championship v 9th in Premier League\nGap = 25\nLast major trophy? Preston: 1938 FA Cup. Villa: 1996 League Cup\nBest FA Cup run? Preston: winners 1889 & 1938. Villa: winners x7 between 1887 & 1957\nWatch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.\nPreston are hard to beat at home and have not lost at Deepdale since 2 November, a run of 15 games.\nI've seen quite a bit of Paul Heckingbottom's team this season and they will defend deep, set up in a 3-5-2 shape and make themselves hard to break down.\nIt's an old football cliche, but in this case it is very true that the first goal will be extremely important.\nAston Villa have got some brilliant attacking players, but I also always feel like teams can score against them.\nIf they go behind, they could have problems but I do feel their quality should see them through - depending on Unai Emery's team selection of course, with a big league game coming up at Brighton on Wednesday.\nVilla have got their eyes on numerous prizes and there probably hasn't been excitement levels like this at the club since Martin O'Neill signed me in 2006.\nI'm still backing them here, but it is going to be a cagey game, and they might have to wait to make the breakthrough before a couple of late goals get the job done.\nI'm going for Emi Martinez to keep a clean sheet, too. His keepie-uppie antics, external to wind up Brazil while playing for Argentina this week were another reminder of why he is the best goalkeeper in the world. Anyone who can produce moments like that in a game of that magnitude deserves all the accolades you can get.\nSutton's prediction: 0-2\nNathan's prediction: The FA Cup has opened up for us this season, and it feels like we are the favourites now. I just really hope our schedule doesn't take too much toll on the players and we fall short because of that, but I am looking forward to the rest of the season for sure. \nBrighton will be tough on Wednesday so what do we prioritise, even with a quality squad like ours? That part is down to Emery, and he will probably rest a couple of first-choice players on Sunday, but I would love us to go to Preston, put out a strong team and win comfortably.

Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.Preston are hard to beat at home and have not lost at Deepdale since 2 November, a run of 15 games.I've seen quite a bit of Paul Heckingbottom's team this season and they will defend deep, set up in a 3-5-2 shape and make themselves hard to break down.It's an old football cliche, but in this case it is very true that the first goal will be extremely important.Aston Villa have got some brilliant attacking players, but I also always feel like teams can score against them.If they go behind, they could have problems but I do feel their quality should see them through - depending on Unai Emery's team selection of course, with a big league game coming up at Brighton on Wednesday.Villa have got their eyes on numerous prizes and there probably hasn't been excitement levels like this at the club since Martin O'Neill signed me in 2006.I'm still backing them here, but it is going to be a cagey game, and they might have to wait to make the breakthrough before a couple of late goals get the job done.I'm going for Emi Martinez to keep a clean sheet, too.",

        "article_text": "Billy Horschel made a birdie putt on the penultimate hole as Atlanta Drive GC beat New York GC to claim the inaugural TGL title in Florida\nAs Billy Horschel's golf ball disappeared into the hole, the American celebrated by sprinting, leaping, swearing and chucking his club. \nIt was an electrifying and animated move that became the signature moment of TGL's debut season.\nThat downhill, snaking and ultimately successful putt helped land Horschel and his Atlanta Drive team-mates Patrick Cantlay and Justin Thomas victory against the franchise known as New York Golf Club.\nThis was in the second of the best of three final series. The victors came from 3-0 down (a point is awarded for each hole won) to triumph 4-3 to take an unassailable 2-0 position.\nSuch a dramatic finish was exactly what the Tech-infused Golf League needed - the sort of climax envisaged by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy when they bought into the idea of a raucous indoor simulator version of the game.\nThe decisive putt, which involved a number of dramatic breaks, could be seen as a metaphor for an opening season that was far from straightforward.\nThere were technical glitches, blowout matches, necessary rule changes and a mixture of reactions from golf fans. But somehow the TGL eventually hit its target.\nIt yielded respectable television audiences, helped reveal players' personalities and engaged a somewhat younger audience. The median age for ESPN's viewership was 51 years old compared with the usual 63 for PGA Tour and LIV events.\nAtlanta Drive fight back to win inaugural TGL title\nAtlanta beat New York in opening match of TGL Final\nPlayed largely on Monday and Tuesday evenings, this was all about attracting viewers. It began promisingly with more than 900,000 in the US tuning in for the initial match in January, but audiences tapered off to eventually average around the half-million mark.\nThe early contests lacked a competitive edge. The players seemed to struggle with the concept - there was an awkwardness between a competition worth $21m in prize money and an environment that made it seem a hit-and-giggle event.\nIn one match Woods misunderstood a distance instruction by 100 yards and laughed it off. Imagine that in a tour event. It wouldn't happen. TGL's competitive credibility undoubtedly took a hit with that moment.\nThe tactic of playing the 'hammer' to make a hole worth double points did not work initially but became a more effective tool once the rules were adjusted to allow for three 'hammers'.\nThis dimension ultimately became a crucial factor in deciding the title and brought a welcome edge to proceedings.\nTGL created the sort of buzz that has been the target of the breakaway LIV tour.  The Saudi-based circuit, now in its fourth season, has only enjoyed limited success in that regard - most notably with their Adelaide tournament.\nHorschel's histrionics were straight out of the LIV playbook but did not seem out of place once TGL reached its play-off stage. The unalterably dead-pan Cantlay was a constant reminder that there was underlying serious business afoot.\nIt was Cantlay's chip against Cameron Young one hole after Horschel's dramatic putt that sealed Atlanta Drive's victory.\n\"It would be great for golf if this were to succeed,\" LIV's Phil Mickelson observed on social media. \n\"The golf fan is the most loyal fan in sports - buy a ticket, walk miles and see a fraction of the action. But this could allow the golf fan to buy a ticket, sit down and watch all of the action just like other sports. \n\"It could really be good for the game if it's compelling.\"\nLIV players are not currently eligible for TGL because it is backed by the PGA Tour.  That could change if a deal is done between the two rival tours and LIV's Brooks Koepka attended the match between Jupiter and The Bay on 25 February.\nThe start of the first of the two deciding matches on Monday was delayed by an overrunning Women's NCAA basketball game on ESPN2, which tells us of TGL's standing in the bigger sporting picture.\nNevertheless, it will return. Investment is deep for a project that boasts 11 of the world's top 15 golfers. The 1500 seat 250,000 square feet Sofi Centre venue on the Palm Beach State College campus cost $50m to build.\nAnd there are already thoughts of adding a second venue on America's west coast, although that would likely be years down the line.\n\"We're in the middle of an expansion process now,\" said Mike McCarley, the TMRW executive who co-founded the project with Woods and McIlroy.\n\"When exactly we make that decision - there's no timeline on it necessarily,\" McCarley added to the Palm Beach Post.\n\"We've had potential expansion team owners at every single match this season coming to visit us. Some of them, multiple times. Some of them have a lot of questions, a lot of feedback.\"\nTGL already has the backing of leading American sports investors, who are behind the six teams that competed.\nThey include the Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank (Atlanta Drive), John Henry and the Fenway Sports Group (Boston Common), New York Mets owner Steve Cohen (New York Golf Club), former Milwaukee Bucks owner Marc Lasry (The Bay Golf Club) and David Blitzer, who joined Woods' group that owns Jupiter Links.\n\"We really like those team owners that are operators of other sports teams and other professional leagues in their communities,\" McCarley said.\n\"But we got a lot of really interesting diverse people domestically and internationally. They can kind of take a look and see what it looks like going forward.\"\nFormer tennis great Serena Williams is co-owner of the Los Angeles team and her involvement prompts consideration over whether TGL missed a trick by not including some of the LPGA's top stars, such as Nelly Korda and Lydia Ko.\nLike LIV, TGL may struggle to win over traditional die-hard golf fans with its raucous environment, which is in stark contrast to the more genteel way golf is usually played.\nBut the new league was not brought in for the benefit of that constituency. It is there to broaden golf's base.\nSignificantly, the players seem to have enjoyed it and deem it worth incorporating into their early season schedules.\n\"Obviously it is a little bit of a challenge with everything we've got going through the year with our own schedules, but I don't think anyone has ever walked away and said 'this felt like a burden',\" Horschel stated after collecting his share of the $9m winners' spoils.\n\"I could never imagine what this was going to be,\" the reigning BMW PGA champion added. \"I remember coming into the arena in November and walking out and I was just in awe. I couldn't imagine what I was seeing.\n\"I described it like a football player walking into Mercedes-Benz Stadium right about to play, a basketball player walking out - Steph Curry walking out at Oracle Arena, stuff like that.\n\"Never imagined we'd be playing golf in an arena with a big simulator and people and music and chanting. It has been really cool and has sort of exceeded all of our expectations.\"",

A beloved husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather.\n\"An enormous thank you to everyone that has been caring and considerate in supporting Peter through these difficult recent times.\"\nBBC chief cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew\n\nWhen I was aged 11, my dad took me to a Gillette Cup final at Lord's between Lancashire and Kent, and I saw a fast bowler running in from the Nursery End. I'd never seen anything like it. I turned to my dad and said: \"That's who I want to be.\" It was Peter Lever.\nThere was something about the way he bowled. The energy, the run-up. It lit a spark under me and, from that moment on, I was Peter Lever. My dad wanted me to be an off-spinner, like him, but there was no chance after I'd seen Peter bowl. I copied his action and he was everywhere in my life as I grew up.\nWhen I was about 15 I went to stay with my grandmother in Cheshire and paid to have some coaching in the Lancashire nets at Old Trafford. Because I was reasonably quick, I got promoted to bowl to the first team. I was so nervous. Peter was in the net next door. It was like a dream come true.\nI followed him religiously. For a fast bowler, he was an incredibly gentle character.\nIn 1965, when South Africa visited England and played against Lancashire in a tour match, Peter refused to play against them because of apartheid.\nThen, in the first Test against New Zealand in Auckland in 1975, he had the horrendous experience of hitting the home number 11 Ewen Chatfield with a bouncer. Chatfield almost died. It nearly destroyed Peter.\nA few years later, in a famous game between Derbyshire and Lancashire at Buxton, it snowed and left the pitch as something of a lottery. Peter refused to bowl because he thought it was too dangerous.\nThe bond forged between his former England captain Raymond Illingworth and Peter continued after their playing days. When Raymond was in charge of the England team as the supremo head coach and selector, he made Peter the bowling coach.\nPeter moved with his wife Ros to Devon, immersing himself in the local community. He coached at Lewdown Cricket Club and planted wild flowers around the village.\nIn 2017, Andrew Strauss arranged a 'Club England' dinner at Lord's for everyone, men and women, who had ever played for England. I was asked to host the evening and accepted only on the condition I could sit next to Peter. We were all given special caps to recognise our time playing for England. I presented Peter's to him and he presented mine to me. It was a lovely moment.\nHe had a massive influence on my cricketing life. They say you should never meet your heroes. I'm so lucky that I got to know mine.\nJonathan Agnew and Peter Lever in 2016\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

It carries out reconnaissance missions, and can also destroy targets both on the frontline and deep inside Russia.\nAmong their targets are oil refineries and fuel depots.\nBut after Russia and Ukraine reached separate agreements with the US on a partial ceasefire, missions like these should stop.\nAs well as agreeing to a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea following talks this week in Saudi Arabia, the two countries committed to stop attacking each other's energy infrastructure \u2013 something that had theoretically already been agreed.\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine would implement these agreements immediately.\nHowever, Oleksiy from Skyeton, the company that develops the Raybird, doubts that Moscow would adhere to the ceasefire.\n\"[Russians punch you in the face, then the next day they make an agreement but ask to tie up your hands. So the possibility that they will continue fighting remains,\" explains Oleksiy.\nYet, this deal will also bring relief to Russia.\nIt's estimated that this year alone, Ukraine carried out more than 30 attacks on Russia's oil infrastructure using drones and other weapons. \nThey've recently hit some of the country's largest oil facilities, like the Ufa oil refinery about 1,500km (932 miles) from the front line and Tuapse plant in Krasnodar region.\nRussia's oil refining capacity has dropped by about 10% as a result of drone attacks, according to Reuters.\nAnd Moscow's recent decision to extend the ban on petroleum exports shows that they're feeling the pain.\nUkraine's arsenal to carry out deep strikes is only growing. President Zelensky recently announced that Ukrainian engineers have designed a drone that has a range of 3,000 km (1,860 miles). That means it could reach not only Moscow, but even locations in Siberia.\nKyiv also claims that it has developed turbojet powered \"missile-drones\". They fly at a much higher speed and so are harder to intercept.\nZelensky said Ukraine has successfully tested its first domestically made ballistic weapon and upgraded its cruise missile Neptune to hit ground as well as naval targets. This missile was reportedly used to attack the Russian air base in the southern city of Engels last week, although Ukrainian officials neither confirm nor deny these reports.\nThe energy ceasefire deal is certainly good news for Ukraine too. Russia has been relentlessly targeting its power plants and stations across the country. At one point last year, Ukraine's energy generation capacity dropped to a third of its pre-war level.\nLast month, when temperatures dropped below zero, Russian drones hit a thermal power plant in Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine. A few days later, another massive aerial attack left more than 250,000 residents of Odesa without power and heating.\nAnd lately, there has been a growing number of attacks on Ukraine's gas infrastructure. Among regular targets are underground gas storage facilities in western Ukraine and production facilities in the central and eastern parts of the country.\nMoscow's aim is to reduce gas production in Ukraine, which is key to the country's energy security, says Artem Petrenko, executive director of the Association of Gas Producers of Ukraine.\nAt the end of March, Gas storage facilities in Ukraine were only around 4% full, according to one monitoring group.\nAnd if Russia continues its strikes, filling up those storage facilities will be extremely challenging, potentially leading to massive problems next winter.\nBack at the testing ground, after several laps, the Raybird opens its parachutes and successfully lands in the field. \nOleksiy is satisfied with the results. He says that although it's good to have a ceasefire, they still cannot afford to pause their work and the development of new weapons.\n\"Our enemy just wants to have a break, gather its strength and attack again,\" he says. \"We must be ready for that.\"",

But fewer are aware of the Windscale fire.\nIt was one of the world's first - and remains the UK's worst - nuclear accident.\nA nuclear reactor at the site in Cumbria caught fire on 10 October 1957 and burned for three days, releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere.\nMany details of the event were kept quiet for decades, and it is far less famous than some of the more recent examples.\nBut a new video game has brought the disaster, and the area where it happened, back into the spotlight.\nAtomfall is the latest release from Oxford-based Rebellion, best known for its long-running Sniper Elite series.\nCEO Jason Kingsley tells BBC Newsbeat he was walking in the Lake District when the idea of using the real-life Windscale story \"as a trigger point for a fictionalised version of the disaster\" began to take shape.\nAtomfall is a survival action game set in the rolling green landscapes of the beauty spot, but on an alternative sci-fi inspired timeline where the area surrounding the plant has become a quarantine zone.\n\"It went pretty wrong in real life, but it was controlled,\" says Jason. \n\"It was a proper disaster, but it didn't cause strange glowing plants or mutants or dangerous cults to emerge.\"\nAlthough the Windscale fire was \"very serious\", Jason says it's not something that is especially well-remembered, even among locals.\nIt was previously estimated about 240 cases of thyroid cancer were caused by the radioactive leak, but more recent research has suggested this was unlikely.\nScientists suggested a decision to destroy all milk produced within 310 square miles (800 square km) of the site for a month after the fire helped to prevent exposure.\nWindscale was eventually renamed Sellafield and produced nuclear power until 2003. It still employs about 10,000 people in the local area.\nWhen Newsbeat visits Cumbria, most young people we speak to say they haven't heard of the disaster.\nAnd indie game developers Hannah Roberts and Harry Howson say that they became more aware of it once the game was announced.\nFor two people like them, who hope to break into the games industry, they're excited to see a game set in the place where they live.\nHannah, 26, says it's evident Atomfall's makers have done their research. \n\"The actual environments are spot on, they've got fantastic Morris dancing stuff going on - it really tickled me when I saw that,\" she says. \nHannah says other small details - like black and white Cumbrian signposts - were also pleasing to see.\nAtomfall's setting and its inspiration have made it an anticipated title since it was first revealed last year, and Harry, 23, says that's been encouraging for him. \n\"Seeing that such a small space like Cumbria can be taken by the games industry and built upon and people are receptive to that, it's exciting for the future and I look forward to seeing what's next for me,\" he says.\nIt's fairly unusual for high-profile games set in the UK to be set outside London. \nWhile indie games - such as the Shropshire-set Everybody's Gone to the Rapture and last year's Barnsley-based laughfest Thank Goodness You're Here! - have ventured further north, bigger games haven't tended to stray beyond the M25.\nJason says the US is about 40% of the video games market, so it's important to appeal to players there, and there's a \"natural tendency\" to follow the norms.\nBeing an independent company, he feels, allows Rebellion to do things differently, and Britain offers lots of inspiration for new settings - if you're prepared to look for them.\n\"The UK, I think, to understand certain aspects of our culture, you've got to dig into it a little bit because we tend to understate things quite a lot.\"\nRebellion's Head of Design Ben Fisher says the goal was to create a \"slightly theme parkish\" version of the Lake District with accurate details.\n\"There are things that, as locals, it's easy for us to forget are unique to Britain, that are unusual,\" he says.\nThe team that worked on the game has members from various countries, Ben says, which helped to highlight things the UK natives might have missed.\n\"The lead artist on the project is from Seattle and was mystified by dry stone walls,\"  says Ben.\nHe adds the team spent time recreating the structures - which are constructed without the use of mortar - to \"capture those local details\".\nFeaturing a local area in a film or TV show can expose a new audience to that place.\n\"Ultimately, what's incredibly rewarding about this industry is you can put your ideas down and they can be played by people across the globe,\" Jason says.\n\"And you know, how wonderful is it to sort of talk about the Lake District to people that live in Africa or Southeast Asia or Canada or wherever it might be. \n\"That's a kind of form of soft power that very few types of media have.\"\nOliver Hodgson, 21, can see Sellafield from his bedroom window.\nHe hopes that the local area will benefit from some of the soft power Jason describes.\n\"I think it's just an incredibly powerful thing for young people in west Cumbria,\" he says. \n\"I think it's really positive to see such a big gaming developer set a story in Cumbria, which is normally just known for its lakes and mountains,\" he says.\nOliver who runs his own PR firm, is working with the creators of a project to create a \u00a34m gaming hub in Whitehaven aimed at boosting digital skills in the area.\nOliver says he's glad the game has taken its inspiration from Windscale and is drawing attention to the area, as well as switching locals on to their history.\n\"I think we should own it,\u201d he says. \n\u201cThe story of the Windscale disaster obviously isn't a positive one but we can't rewrite history. \n\"So acknowledging what happened and teaching and letting young people learn about that history, if this is what brings it into the classroom or on to young people's phones or their social media, then so be it.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "article_text": "Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro will stand trial for allegedly attempting to stage a coup against current president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, after a ruling from the country's top court.\nThe Supreme Court's five-member panel voted unanimously in favour of the trial going ahead.\nIt could start as early as this year, and if found guilty Bolsonaro, 70, could face years in prison. \nSpeaking after the court's decision, Bolsonaro told a press conference the charges against him were \"grave and baseless\". He has always denied trying to block Lula's inauguration.\n\"It seems they have something personal against me,\" he added in a post on X, referring to the judges. \nBolsonaro says he is the victim of \"political persecution\" aimed at preventing him from running again for president in 2026.\nThe panel was tasked with determining whether there was enough evidence to put Bolsonaro on trial.\nThe first to cast his vote on Wednesday was the judge heading the panel, Alexandre de Moraes.\nHe recommended that Bolsonaro, as well as seven other former government officials described by the attorney-general as \"co-conspirators\", stand trial over the events which led up to the storming of government buildings by his supporters on 8 January 2023, a week after Lula's inauguration.\nThe seven men accused of being co-conspirators are:\nBolsonaro, a former army captain and admirer of US President Donald Trump, governed Brazil from January 2019 to December 2022.\nHe narrowly lost a presidential election run-off in October 2022 to his left-wing rival, Lula.\nBolsonaro never publicly acknowledged his defeat.

Bolsonaro says he is the victim of \"political persecution\" aimed at preventing him from running again for president in 2026.The panel was tasked with determining whether there was enough evidence to put Bolsonaro on trial.The first to cast his vote on Wednesday was the judge heading the panel, Alexandre de Moraes.He recommended that Bolsonaro, as well as seven other former government officials described by the attorney-general as \"co-conspirators\", stand trial over the events which led up to the storming of government buildings by his supporters on 8 January 2023, a week after Lula's inauguration.The seven men accused of being co-conspirators are:Alexandre Ramagem, former spy chiefAdm Almir Garnier Santos, former navy commander Anderson Torres, former security minister Gen Augusto Heleno, former minister for institutional securityMauro Cid, Bolsonaro's former assistantGen Walter Braga Netto, former defence minister Gen Paulo S\u00e9rgio Nogueira de Oliveira former defence minister Video shows Brazil Supreme Court mass break-inBrazil's Congress stormingHow did we get here?Bolsonaro, a former army captain and admirer of US President Donald Trump, governed Brazil from January 2019 to December 2022.He narrowly lost a presidential election run-off in October 2022 to his left-wing rival, Lula.Bolsonaro never publicly acknowledged his defeat. \"It seems they have something personal against me,\" he added in a post on X, referring to the judges.

There was applause when rescuers pulled a woman alive from the wreckage of a 12-storey apartment block some 30 hours after it collapsed, but the Red Cross says more than 90 people may still be trapped there.\nIn a nearby township, rescue workers found the bodies of 12 preschool children and a teacher under a building housing a kindergarten.\nCracks and surface distortions to the main highway between the biggest city Yangon, the capital Nay Pyi Taw and Mandalay had caused severe transport disruptions, UN humanitarian agency OCHA said.\nThere were also shortages of medical supplies including trauma kits, blood bags, anaesthetics, essential medicines and tents for health workers, it said.\nAlthough rescue teams have been at work since yesterday and international aid has begun to enter the country, help is yet to reach the worst-hit areas and ordinary people have been trying to dig survivors out by hand. \nWidely shared footage shows two men moving rubble to pry out a young woman trapped between two concrete slabs. \nThe BBC has spoken to locals who said that people were screaming for help from under the debris. \nElsewhere, other rescue workers have been listening out for signs of life. ''We can only rescue people when we hear them,'' one said.\nEarlier on Saturday, a rescue team in the Sintkai township in Mandalay's Kyaukse district pulled out a number of people trapped in the debris of a private school. Six of them \u2013 five females and one male \u2013 had died by the time the rescue teams arrived. Among the victims were students, teachers and school staff.\nA lack of equipment is greatly slowing down the rescues, a worker told BBC Burmese: \"We are making do with the equipment we have. We have been trying for hours to pull out a girl trapped under the collapsed school.\"\nAnother worker in Mandalay told a BBC reporter in Yangon that communication had been near impossible.\n\"The main thing is that we don't have internet lines, we don't have phone lines, so it's very difficult to connect with each other. The rescue team has arrived. But we don't know where it will go, because the phone lines are down.\"\nA Mandalay resident said people were doing their best in the chaotic circumstances.\n\"There is no coordination in the rescue efforts, no one to lead them, or tell them what to do. Locals have had to fend for themselves. If they find dead bodies in the debris, they don't even know where to send the bodies; hospitals are overwhelmed and unable to cope,\" the resident said.\nThe junta has put the number of damaged buildings in the Mandalay region, the epicentre of the earthquake, at more than 1,500. Power outages have exacerbated the situation, and according to officials restoring power could take days.\nMandalay airport is not functional as the runways were damaged during the earthquake. The military council said that it had been working to resume operations and a temporary hospital, medical relief camp and shelter have been set up there.\nLess than 25km (15 miles) from Mandalay in Sagaing, the older of two bridges connecting the regions has completely collapsed and the newer one has developed cracks, cutting off access for rescue teams. \n\"Right now, there are not enough people even for emergency rescue. We can't pick up bodies, there are so many people trapped. We can't cross either bridge, so we are all trapped in the rubble. Please help emergency rescuers come and rescue us,\" a local resident told BBC Burmese.\nThe recently constructed capital Nay Pyi Daw, where the military junta is headquartered, has been hit by aftershocks and small tremors. The city has seen extensive damage with high numbers of casualties, collapsed buildings and buckled roads.\nMeanwhile, even while the junta has made a rare international appeal for aid, it has continued air strikes and drone attacks against the ethnic armies and armed groups it has been fighting in the country's four-year civil war. \nBBC Burmese confirmed that seven people were killed in an air strike in Naungcho in northern Shan state. This strike took place around 15:30 local time, less than three hours after the quake struck.\nPro-democracy rebel groups fighting to remove the military from power have reported aerial bombings in Chang-U township in the central Sagaing region, the epicentre of the quake. There are also reports of airstrikes in regions near the Thai border.\nThe UN's special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, urged the junta to cease bombing raids.\n\"The problem is that you still have military operations going on right now... Military strikes by the military junta,\" he told the BBC.\n\"I'm calling upon the junta to just stop, stop any of its military operations. This is completely outrageous and unacceptable.\"",

        "article_text": "What will it take for India's private companies to begin investing in building new factories and firms?\nIt's a question that's confounded policymakers for years. As a share of gross domestic product (GDP), private investment in India has been on the decline since the global financial crisis of 2007, even while the overall economy clocked world-beating growth rates.\nAfter a long hiatus, the investment rate picked up slightly in 2022 and 2023, but latest data from a leading ratings agency shows private sector expenditure as part of the overall investments in India's economy dipped again to a decadal low of 33% this financial year.\nAnalysis from Icra of 4,500 listed companies and 8,000 unlisted companies reveals that while the pace of investments made by listed players moderated, those by unlisted entities actually contracted.\nOver the years, several economists have raised similar concerns about a slowdown in private investments. \nBanking tycoon Uday Kotak is among many who've raised concerns recently about India's fading \"animal spirits\", urging young business owners who had inherited companies to build new businesses rather than sitting tight and managing their existing wealth.\nData from investment advisory firm Value Research shows Indian non-financial businesses were sitting on cash worth 11% of their total assets, corroborating the view that companies are not spending money in making fresh investments. \nSo why are Indian corporate houses choosing to do that?\nWeak domestic consumption in urban areas, muted export demand and an influx of cheap Chinese imports in some sectors were among the factors that \"restricted the capacity expansion plans of Indian corporate houses\", Icra's Chief Rating Officer K Ravichandran said in a note.\nBut beyond the more immediate reasons, private investment impulse has been low because of \"global uncertainties and overcapacity\", India's economic survey pointed out earlier this year.\nSlowing private investments have a direct bearing on India's growth prospects.\nInvestments by companies in assets such as factories, machinery or construction \u2013 also called gross fixed capital formation \u2013 make up around 30% of GDP and are its second largest contributor following private consumption.\nIndia's full-year GDP is expected to close at 6.5%, sharply lower compared to last year's 9.2%. Growth has flagged on account of slower consumption.\nWith all the key levers of growth, including exports, slowing down and US President Donald Trump's tariffs exacerbating global uncertainties, kick-starting private investment will be fundamental for India to hit its long-term growth targets, experts say.\nAccording to the World Bank's latest estimates, India will need to grow by 7.8% on average over the next 22 years to achieve its high-income status ambition by 2047.\nKey to this would be to increase private and public investment to at least 40% of GDP from 33% currently, the bank estimates.\nThe government on its part has significantly increased spending, especially on infrastructure. It also cut corporate tax rates from 30% to 22% and doled out billions of dollars in production-linked subsidies to manufacturers over the years. Availability of bank credit isn't a constraint any longer, and regulation has eased with regulatory restrictions halving between 2003 and 2020.\nBut none of this has prodded corporate India to boost spending.\nAccording to Sajjid Chinoy, JP Morgan India's Chief Economist, the big problem is the lack of demand in the economy to justify putting up additional capacities.\nIndia's post-pandemic recovery has been uneven, with the consumer class not expanding quickly enough. Demand for goods and services has thus been hit, with spending capacity further curtailed by a fall in wages, even though corporate profitability has soared to a 15-year high this year.\n\"Just because companies are financially strong doesn't mean they will automatically invest. Companies will only invest if they expect good returns,\" Chinoy said at an event in Mumbai earlier this year.\nRathin Roy, a former member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC), points to other deeper structural issues arresting investment appetite.\n\"Entrepreneurs have been lacking the energy to produce goods that might generate new demand. A classic example of this is construction - where there's unsold inventory in the urban areas, but an incapacity among builders to go into tier two and tier three towns and tap newer markets,\" Roy told the BBC.\nHe said he also agreed with Mr Kotak's views on the growing trend of business heirs turning wealth managers rather than building businesses ground up.\n\"Business houses discovered during Covid-19 that they don't need to do business to make money. They can just invest and multiply it without building anything new,\" said Roy. And these investments aren't just happening in the domestic stock market. \"A lot of money is just flowing out of India and chasing returns elsewhere,\" he added.\nBut things could be turning a corner, according to Icra.\nInterest rate cuts as well as a $12bn income tax relief provided to individuals in the federal budget \"augurs well for supporting domestic consumption demand\", according to the report.\nIndia's central bank also says more private companies have shown an intention to invest this year compared to last year, although how much of that intent results into actual money deployed remains to be seen. \nThe uncertainties related to global trade tariffs could delay any anticipated investment pick-up, according to Icra.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "For the past 48 hours, top White House officials have faced questions from lawmakers and the press about how a journalist came to join a sensitive group chat for an upcoming military operation - and why President Donald Trump's national security team was sharing sensitive information in an unsecure manner.\nThe Atlantic first reported details of the group chat on the platform Signal after its editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was added to it. He followed the thread as top Trump administration officials discussed upcoming military strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.\nThe Atlantic then on Wednesday published the entire text thread that showed the detailed and potentially classified rundown for a March air raids. \nWhile the thread appears to have contained sensitive information, there is still much that remains unknown. Here are four lingering questions regarding so-called \"Signal-gate\".\nThe Trump administration maintains the information shared in the chat was not classified.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that \"no war plans\" were discussed on the chat. Instead, she characterised the information shared as  \"sensitive policy discussions\".\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told lawmakers during a congressional hearing that the Signal chat was \"candid and sensitive\", though \"no classified information was shared\".\nBut under questioning, she and CIA Director John Ratcliffe appeared uncertain about the classification of the attack plan. They later emphasised that Hegseth had the power to classify and declassify the type of details that were shared. \nHegseth has denied sharing classified material, but experts are sceptical that this type of sensitive information would not carry that kind of designation.\nJamil Jaffer, executive director of the National Security Institute at George Mason University, said that Hegseth did not send \"an operational plan for World War Three, or for the Pacific region\".\n\"But at the same time,\" Mr Jaffer said, \"these are operational details that could, if released publicly, put American lives at risk or jeopardise the success of the operation.\"\nIn his original article, Mr Goldberg reports that on 11 March he initially \"received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz\", Trump's national security adviser.\nTwo days later, he writes that he received a notice that he was to be included in a Signal group titled the \"Houthi PC small group.\"\nMr Goldberg reports that the group received a message from Waltz, which also noted one of his deputies was \"pulling together\" a team of top staffers relevant to the discussion. \nOn Tuesday, Trump suggested that a \"lower level\" staffer for Waltz added Mr Goldberg to the chat.\nHowever, Waltz himself told Fox News' Laura Ingraham: \"I take full responsibility. I built the - I built the group.\"\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who was also in the group, said on Wednesday that someone had made a \"mistake\" in adding Mr Goldberg.\nIt remains to be seen whether the Republican-controlled Congress will launch oversight investigations.\nRepublican lawmakers have emphatically supported the Trump administration's agenda to this point, so it seems improbable that they would support investigations into the Signal chat.\nDemocrats in the House are reportedly trying to force a vote on a \"Resolution of Inquiry\" that would require the Trump administration to hand over records related to the incident, according to Reuters, but they do not have a majority. \nWhile some Republicans have raised concerns over the leak, few have appeared eager to cross the president. \nThe use of Signal to discuss the Houthi strikes posed broader questions about how Trump's top staffers are sharing and discussing sensitive information.\nGabbard testified on Wednesday that Signal came \"pre-installed on government devices\".\nShe cited guidance from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which mentioned Signal as an example of a messaging service with end-to-end encryption.\nRatcliffe earlier testified to Congress that Signal had been installed on his devices when he took over the CIA.\nBut it remains uncertain if security officials had provided guidance about using Signal for discussing military operations like the strikes against the Houthis.\n\"Whether these circumstances were approved or not is still not clear,\" Mr Jaffer said.\nCBS News, the BBC's US partner, has reported that the US National Security Agency had warned employees against using Signal due to \"a vulnerability\" that they had identified.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

I'm here for a life experience.\"\nA trip to Everest base camp - used by climbers during their ascent and descent of the world's tallest mountain - will hopefully provide Grayson with at least one lasting memory.\nBut the 55-year-old - who has 20 years of managerial experience including promotions with Leeds, Huddersfield Town, Blackpool and Preston - has made it clear he is in the spectacular Himalayan region to work. \nDespite the men's national football team being down in 175th place in Fifa's world rankings, football is popular in Nepal. \nThe seven-team Nepal Super League - the country's first professional franchise-based football league - is about to start its third season, with Grayson's club Lalitpur City the defending champions.\nCrowds of up to 15,000 are expected to watch, starting with Saturday's derby between Grayson's side and Kathmandu Rayzrs.\nGrayson (centre) has explored Kathmandu and surrounding areas on a mountain bike\nRipon-born Grayson's squad includes players from Martinique, Haiti, Bhutan and Senegal, while Jonathan Cantillana is a midfielder who plays for Palestine.\n\"They'll have to adapt to my Yorkshire accent,\" says Grayson, who has been bowled over by the charm and kindness of locals in Kathmandu - as well as the breathtaking Himalayan views, golden temples and charming hill villages.\nThree days after arriving in Nepal's capital, Grayson experienced Holi - the ancient Hindu festival of colours that celebrates spring, love, and new life which is traditionally celebrated by throwing bright coloured powder over family and friends.\nNepal is home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountains - including Everest - but, while Grayson is hoping to hit new heights with Lalitpur, he is happy to give the thrill-seeking a miss.\n\"I travelled in a cable car to meet the owners of my new club in a hotel in the mountains,\" he adds.\n\"I wasn't looking forward to getting in a cable car and I didn't particularly enjoy it.\" \nGrayson experienced the Hindu festival of colours, Holi, in Kathmandu earlier in March\nThe Nepal Super League season lasts just four weeks, with the play-off final to decide the champions on 26 April - FA Cup semi-final weekend.\nWill it be Preston, 14th in the Championship table, or Aston Villa - who face Paris St-Germain in a mouth-watering Champions League quarter-final next month - at Wembley on the final weekend of April?\n\"I loved my time at Preston,\" adds Grayson, who was in charge at Deepdale between 2013 and 2017. \"I had nothing but good times there and won promotion in front of around 50,000 fans at Wembley by beating Swindon 4-0 in the play-off final.\n\"I had no aspirations to leave but then Sunderland came knocking and it felt like one of those clubs you could help get back into the Premier League.\"\nGrayson knows Villa fans are desperate for success. \nHe joined them from Leicester City in June 1997, 15 months after Villa won the League Cup by beating Leeds in the 1996 final.\nVilla have not won a major trophy since but Grayson believes that could be about to change under Unai Emery.\n\"I have been so impressed with what he has done,\" he adds.\n\"No disrespect to Preston, but winning the FA Cup could be a big opportunity for Villa this season.\n\"Villa are a huge club and they will look at this game as an opportunity towards getting to the final and winning silverware.\n\"I'm intrigued as to how this tie is going to go.\"\nWill Grayson be watching the action at Deepdale on television in Nepal?\n\"I'm still getting used to the time difference over here. We're five hours and 45 minutes ahead. But the early kick-off means I can watch it. \n\"Had it been later I'd have missed it - we've got training the next morning!\".\nThen Preston manager Grayson (left) and his former Aston Villa team-mate Steve Staunton lay wreaths on Villa Park in memory of ex-Villa boss Graham Taylor, before the Championship game between the two clubs in 2017\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "We are down to the last eight teams in this season's FA Cup, but which of them will lift the famous old trophy at Wembley in May?\nApart from defending Premier League champions Manchester City, none of the quarter-finalists have won any major silverware since the turn of the millennium, and four of them have never won the FA Cup at all.\n\"We all saw how much winning the Carabao Cup meant to Newcastle fans after their long wait for a trophy,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\"Liverpool and Arsenal are out, and City are clearly not the force they were, so this feels like a big chance for the other teams left in it to get some glory - I just hope they try to take it.\"\nSutton has made his predictions for all four sixth-round ties and for this weekend's matches he is up against Brit-nominated DJ and producer Nathan Dawe, who is an Aston Villa fan.\nDawe's new single featuring vocalist Abi Flynn, Here In Your Arms, is out now.\nDo you agree with their predictions? You can choose who you think will win each tie, below.\nDawe has had three UK top-10 singles and another four have reached the top 40. He made a surprise appearance on last month's Love Island All Stars final, playing Here In Your Arms at a pool party for the remaining couples\nVilla have not won a major trophy since the 1996 League Cup but are chasing silverware on two fronts this season and are into the last eight of the Champions League [where they play Paris St-Germain] as well as the FA Cup.\n\"I'm still in dreamland,\" Nathan told BBC Sport. \"I still can't believe I am going to Paris in a couple of weeks to watch us in a Champions League quarter-final.\n\"Honestly, it has not sunk in. I only ever used to hear about these glory days from my dad, but now we are actually able to experience it together. It's just unbelievable.\n\"What Unai Emery has done since taking charge in 2022 is just astronomical, and the players and fans are fully on board with what he is doing.\n\"Even when things are not going so well, it is clear that the team still has full confidence in the manager to have a Plan B or C to turn games around, and we have seen that happen on multiple occasions this season.\"\nAllow TikTok content?\nThis article contains content provided by TikTok.

It means so much to Villa fans because hardly any of us are alive who have seen us win it.\n\"Even my dad wasn't born the last time we won it [in 1957] and winning at Wembley would be very special. \n\"I've been lucky enough to go there a few times with Villa but other than our play-off win when we got promoted in 2019,  it has always ended up in misery.\"\nChris Sutton and Nathan Dawe were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\nGap = league places between the two teams\nCraven Cottage, 12:15 GMT\n8th in Premier League v 12th in Premier League\nGap = 4\nLast major trophy? Fulham: Never. Palace: Never\nBest FA Cup run? Fulham: runners-up in 1975. Palace: runners-up in 1990 & 2016\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.\nCrystal Palace won at Craven Cottage at the end of February and it is a ground where they have a decent record - they haven't lost there in their past six visits, since 2005.\nIt's a boost for Palace that Jean-Philippe Mateta is available to lead their attack - he can play wearing a special mask to protect his ear after his injury against Millwall in the fifth round - but we will have to see how much he has been affected by such a horrific challenge.\nThis video can not be played\nMillwall's Roberts sent off for 'dangerous' tackle on Mateta\nThe Eagles are a well-balanced team who seem to be improving all the time under Oliver Glasner - they have lost only two of their past 14 games in all competitions.\nI've found Fulham hard to predict this season because they've been less reliable than usual at home, but they are still having a strong campaign - they are in the mix for the Champions League places, and are only three points behind fifth-placed City.\nPalace are very strong on the road but they have not played for the past three weeks - their game against Newcastle before the international break was postponed because of the Carabao Cup final.\nWe often talk about teams needing a rest, but my concern is how that break has affected their momentum.\nThis is going to be a close game, but I actually fancy Fulham to edge it. Marco Silva's side have got goals in them, and my gut feeling is that they will get through in 90 minutes.\nI just hope both managers go for it properly, and don't prioritise next week's midweek Premier League games [Fulham are at Arsenal on Tuesday and Palace travel to Southampton on Wednesday] instead of this tie.\nFulham and Palace have shown this season they have got enough quality in their strongest starting XIs to go all the way in the FA Cup, especially this year when the competition appears so open. \nThey are both in a great position to finally win a major trophy, so why not try to make history and give their fans something to celebrate?\nPalace's only previous cup success was winning the Zenith Data Systems Cup in 1991. \nI can imagine their fans enjoyed that day a lot, but lifting the FA Cup would be on a different planet, and the same goes for Fulham, who have not even been in an FA Cup semi-final since 2002.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nNathan's prediction: It feels like Palace always turn into world-beaters in the last couple of months of the season, and I can see them winning this. 1-2\nAmex Stadium, 17:15 GMT\n7th in Premier League v 3rd in Premier League\nGap = 4\nLast major trophy? Brighton: Never. Forest: 1990 League Cup\nBest FA Cup run? Brighton: runners-up in 1983. Forest: winners in 1898 & 1959\nWatch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.\nBrighton will see this as the chance to get revenge for their 7-0 defeat at the City Ground at the start of February.\nI am sure some people felt the wheels had come off for Seagulls boss Fabian Hurzeler after that result, but instead his side have bounced back and gone on a great run of six wins and one draw in all competitions.\nSometimes getting thrashed like that can have a positive effect on a team, and clear the air. \nI remember losing 7-1 at Blackburn Rovers in October 1992, when I was a centre-half for Norwich City, but we had a crate of beer on the coach home to put things right and we were still top of the  Premier League table at Christmas. I did get moved up front after that though.\nAs for Nottingham Forest, they are the only team left in the FA Cup where I could understand it if they rested players this weekend, because of their league position.\nThey play Manchester United on Tuesday and the finish line is in sight for my boyhood team to finish third and secure Champions League football.\nThat's why it's disappointing to hear about Chris Wood getting injured while playing for New Zealand this week.\nHopefully it is not serious, but it is a blow for Forest if they are without their main number nine for any length of time.\nTheir game plan won't change without Wood - they will sit deep and attack on the break, it is just a question on whether it is their A team who face Brighton or not, and my hunch is that Nuno Espirito Santo will make a few changes.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nNathan's prediction: Forest are in such a good position in the league, I have a feeling they are going to be super-focused on that. For that reason, I am going with Brighton. 2-0\nDeepdale, 13:30 BST\n14th in Championship v 9th in Premier League\nGap = 25\nLast major trophy? Preston: 1938 FA Cup. Villa: 1996 League Cup\nBest FA Cup run? Preston: winners 1889 & 1938. Villa: winners x7 between 1887 & 1957\nWatch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.\nPreston are hard to beat at home and have not lost at Deepdale since 2 November, a run of 15 games.\nI've seen quite a bit of Paul Heckingbottom's team this season and they will defend deep, set up in a 3-5-2 shape and make themselves hard to break down.\nIt's an old football cliche, but in this case it is very true that the first goal will be extremely important.\nAston Villa have got some brilliant attacking players, but I also always feel like teams can score against them.\nIf they go behind, they could have problems but I do feel their quality should see them through - depending on Unai Emery's team selection of course, with a big league game coming up at Brighton on Wednesday.\nVilla have got their eyes on numerous prizes and there probably hasn't been excitement levels like this at the club since Martin O'Neill signed me in 2006.\nI'm still backing them here, but it is going to be a cagey game, and they might have to wait to make the breakthrough before a couple of late goals get the job done.\nI'm going for Emi Martinez to keep a clean sheet, too. His keepie-uppie antics, external to wind up Brazil while playing for Argentina this week were another reminder of why he is the best goalkeeper in the world. Anyone who can produce moments like that in a game of that magnitude deserves all the accolades you can get.\nSutton's prediction: 0-2\nNathan's prediction: The FA Cup has opened up for us this season, and it feels like we are the favourites now. I just really hope our schedule doesn't take too much toll on the players and we fall short because of that, but I am looking forward to the rest of the season for sure. \nBrighton will be tough on Wednesday so what do we prioritise, even with a quality squad like ours? That part is down to Emery, and he will probably rest a couple of first-choice players on Sunday, but I would love us to go to Preston, put out a strong team and win comfortably. I am not super-convinced that is going to happen anyway though, even if we don't make lots of changes, because Preston will throw everything at us. \nIt won't be as easy as people might think, but I do expect us to go through.  0-1\nVitality Stadium, 16:30 BST\n10th in Premier League v 5th in Premier League\nGap = 5\nLast major trophy? Bournemouth: never. City: 2024 Premier League\nBest FA Cup run? Bournemouth: quarter-finals 1957 & 2021. City: winners x7 between 1904 & 2023\nThis is such a difficult tie to call.\nBournemouth were the team who started the rot for Manchester City when they deservedly beat them in November, for what was the defending champions' first league defeat of the season.\nBack then, they were still 'mighty City', the team who were dominating English football, who hardly ever slipped up. \nWho would have imagined that, five months on, they would have lost eight of their next 19 league games and be in the position they are now, with just the FA Cup left as the only thing they can win?\nThis competition is huge for City now, because it feels so crucial for boss Pep Guardiola to finish such a difficult season with a piece of silverware.\nSo, it helps him that the Cherries are not in great form, with only one point from their past four league games, and also that they are without two key defenders here; Milos Kerkez and Dean Huijsen, who are both suspended.\nCity are still far from convincing at the moment, however, and it is hard to know what their strongest line-up is.\nPhil Foden's struggles for England last week were a reminder of how last season's PFA and FWA Player of the Year has been a shadow of his usual self all campaign, but he is not the only City player to have been well below his best.\nStill, there is no chance of Pep saving anyone for Wednesday's league game against Leicester, even though City have got a real fight on their hands to finish in the top five.\nPep always takes the FA Cup seriously anyway, and he has shown that by reaching the semi-finals for each of the past six seasons - something no other team had done before.\nWill City make it to the last four again? Yes... but only just.\nBournemouth are so good with their press that they won't allow City to easily play out from the back - there are going to be plenty of goals, and I can see it being settled in extra-time.\nSutton's prediction: 2-3 after extra-time\nNathan's prediction: Bournemouth are having a good season but I am still backing City to get through. 1-3\nThere were eight Premier League games played in week 29, the last set of fixtures before the international break.\nSo far, Chris and his guest, Divorce singer Felix, have both got four correct results, with one exact score, giving them both 70 points.\nFor now, it goes down as a win for the BBC readers - using the most popular scoreline from your predictions for each game, you got five correct results, with one exact score, leaving you on 80 points.\nThe remaining two games were rearranged because of the Carabao Cup final. \nNo-one picked up any points from Liverpool's draw with Aston Villa, which was moved forward to 19 February, so the weekly winner will be decided when Newcastle host Crystal Palace on 16 April - Felix has gone for a 2-1 Palace win.\nChris and Felix also made a prediction for the Carabao Cup final, and they both wrongly picked Liverpool to win it. \nThey were not alone, because the majority BBC readers also went for a Reds victory - out of almost 38,000 predictions, 73% of you thought Arne Slot's side would prevail.",

        "article_text": "At least 15 people are thought to still be alive and trapped under the rubble of a Bangkok skyscraper that collapsed after a massive earthquake hit Myanmar and Thailand.\nRescuers say they have detected signs of life and communicated with some survivors under the 10-storey tall mountain of debris.\nScores of construction workers remain missing at the site, as the rescue effort heads into its second day.\nThe 7.7-magnitude quake occurred on Friday afternoon local time, killing hundreds at the epicentre near Mandalay, Myanmar. Its powerful effects could be felt hundreds of miles away in the Thai capital, as well as in China and India.\nThere have been reports of widespread devastation in the Saigaing region and Mandalay, including flattened buildings and temple spires toppled. Officials in Myanmar say over 1,000 have died so far while another 2,376 are injured.\nIn Bangkok, thousands experienced the quake's effects as buildings swayed and water sloshed out of swimming pools. Officials said they received 2,000 reports of cracks appearing in buildings.\nBut the capital has emerged largely unscathed \u2013 except for the unfinished headquarters for the auditor-general's office, which remains the focal point of the damage in Thailand.\nSituated just across from the tourist landmark Chatuchak market, the 30-storey skyscraper once featured a gleaming tower of blue glass and steel.\nThe earthquake has reduced it to a mountain of twisted rebar and shattered concrete, dwarfing the hundreds of rescue workers scurrying around it.\nOut of the more than 400 workers who were at the site, at least 96 are missing, while eight have died and another eight found injured, according to the latest official figures. \nSome are believed to be Burmese. Many Burmese migrants work in Thailand's construction industry.\nThroughout Friday night and into Saturday morning, drones, sniffer dogs, cranes and excavators were brought in to help with the rescue effort.\nBy lunchtime, officials said they had detected at least 15 people alive beneath the rubble, located some 5m to 10m from the top of the pile.\nBurmese construction worker Ko Myint Kyaw was on the scaffolding on the third floor of the building at the time the earthquake struck.\n\"When [the earthquake] got stronger, I just jumped and I escaped. When I hit the ground, I heard a loud bang and the building collapsed,\" he told BBC Burmese.\nThe worker said he was part of a group of Burmese people working on the construction project, and the authorities had already discovered the bodies of two people with whom he had worked with.\nAs the \"building collapsed like a pancake\" \u2013 and is continuing to collapse \u2013 rescue work has been difficult, forcing officials to refrain from using heavy machinery, one official said.\nThey said they were able to make contact with some of the survivors who \"shouted and made noise\". Others were detected by their movements and body heat.\n\"We want to save them as soon as possible,\" said one official. \"Some signs of life we received last night have since gone silent. I want all Thais to pray for them, to be strong.\"\nOfficials have yet to find out why the building collapsed, and have given investigators a week to probe.\nIn a dusty corner of the construction site, tents and desks were set up to register the details of relatives of the missing.\nSolemn-faced groups of people, mostly women, gathered in the tent in the sweltering heat, their faces clouded with worry.

Officials said they received 2,000 reports of cracks appearing in buildings.But the capital has emerged largely unscathed \u2013 except for the unfinished headquarters for the auditor-general's office, which remains the focal point of the damage in Thailand.Situated just across from the tourist landmark Chatuchak market, the 30-storey skyscraper once featured a gleaming tower of blue glass and steel.EPAAt least 15 people are thought to still be alive and trapped under the rubbleFollow live: Death toll rises to more than 1,000 as hundreds trapped under rubbleWatch: Moment Bangkok high-rise under construction collapsesMyanmar earthquake: What we knowMajor earthquake adds to war-torn Myanmar's troubles'People are screaming help me': Earthquake survivors describe horrorThe earthquake has reduced it to a mountain of twisted rebar and shattered concrete, dwarfing the hundreds of rescue workers scurrying around it.Out of the more than 400 workers who were at the site, at least 96 are missing, while eight have died and another eight found injured, according to the latest official figures. When I hit the ground, I heard a loud bang and the building collapsed,\" he told BBC Burmese.The worker said he was part of a group of Burmese people working on the construction project, and the authorities had already discovered the bodies of two people with whom he had worked with.Naruemol (left) woman waits with a friend for news of her husbandAs the \"building collapsed like a pancake\" \u2013 and is continuing to collapse \u2013 rescue work has been difficult, forcing officials to refrain from using heavy machinery, one official said.They said they were able to make contact with some of the survivors who \"shouted and made noise\". Many Burmese migrants work in Thailand's construction industry.Throughout Friday night and into Saturday morning, drones, sniffer dogs, cranes and excavators were brought in to help with the rescue effort.By lunchtime, officials said they had detected at least 15 people alive beneath the rubble, located some 5m to 10m from the top of the pile.Burmese construction worker Ko Myint Kyaw was on the scaffolding on the third floor of the building at the time the earthquake struck. \"We want to save them as soon as possible,\" said one official.",

        "article_text": "A professor has published details of a rare \"inside-out, legless, headless wonder\" fossil from 444 million years ago, which belonged to a previously undiscovered species.\nProf Sarah Gabbott has been studying the arthropod fossil for 25 years after she found it in a small quarry in South Africa. \nHer findings, published on Thursday, reveal the discovery is very rare, as most fossils are of an animal's external features, whereas the internal organs are preserved in this case. \nProf Gabbott uncovered the fossil, which she has named Sue after her mother, at the start of her career. She had hoped to find another example in the years which followed, but had no joy. \nThe University of Leicester academic said she had decided to finally make her findings public after her mum said if she intended to name the fossil after her, she ought to \"get on and do it before she becomes a fossil herself\".\nSue was found in the Soom Shale, a band of silt and clay at a location 250 miles north of Cape Town, which was laid on the seafloor more than 440 million years ago after a devastating glaciation had wiped out about 85% of Earth's species.\nIt is believed the marine basin where the arthropod swam was somehow protected from the worst of the freezing conditions. \nThe sediments where Sue came to rest were also toxic, with no oxygen and hydrogen sulphide dissolved in the water, which the researchers suspect might have led to her unusual inside-out preservation.\nIt is, however, difficult to compare her to other fossils from the same era due to the unique way Sue was preserved. \nProf Gabbott, who is based at the university's school of geography, geology and the environment, added: \"Sue is an inside-out, legless, headless wonder. \n\"Remarkably her insides are a mineralised time-capsule: muscles, sinews, tendons and even guts all preserved in unimaginable detail. \n\"And yet her durable carapace, legs and head are missing \u2013 lost to decay over 440 million years ago.\n\"We are now sure she was a primitive marine arthropod but her precise evolutionary relationships remain frustratingly elusive.\"\nThe small quarry where the fossil was found has now virtually disappeared, which means another example is unlikely to be discovered. \nProf Gabbott said: \"This has been an ultramarathon of a research effort. In a large part because this fossil is just so beautifully preserved, there's so much anatomy there that needs interpreting. Layer upon layer of exquisite detail and complexity. \n\"I'd always hoped to find new specimens but it seems after 25 years of searching, this fossil is vanishingly rare \u2013 so I can hang on no longer. \n\"Recently my mum said to me, 'Sarah, if you are going to name this fossil after me, you'd better get on and do it before I am in the ground and fossilised myself'.\n\"I tell my mum in jest that I named the fossil Sue after her because she is a well-preserved specimen.\n\"But, in truth, I named her Sue because my mum always said I should follow a career that makes me happy \u2013 whatever that may be. \n\"For me, that is digging rocks, finding fossils and then trying to figure out how they lived and what they tell us about ancient life and evolution on Earth.\"\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

        "article_text": "A discussion by high-ranking US security officials about US air strikes on Yemen has been published in full by the Atlantic magazine.\nThe group chat on the Signal app mistakenly included the Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg.\nAfter holding back some excerpts of the chat in an earlier article, he decided on Wednesday to publish almost the entire exchange after senior officials insisted there was no classified information shared in the group. \nThose statements \"have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions\", Goldberg wrote. \nThe messages, however, need some unpicking. Here are three of them with some analysis.\nThese messages provide details of the US military's plan for the Yemen strikes - described as a \"package\", a military term which refers to a set of aircraft, weapons systems and intelligence gathering devices that will participate in an operation. \n\"The idea this wasn't classified information at the time is inconceivable,\" Glenn Gerstell, the former general counsel of the National Security Agency (NSA), told the BBC. \nHe added that it may have been declassified afterwards but any imminent military action involving American troops would have been classified at the time it was shared.\n\nThe messages from Hegseth note what time F-18 fighter aircraft are scheduled to launch, as well as when strikes will take place and in what timeframe \"trigger-based\" attacks could occur. \nIn this context, \"trigger\" refers to a set of parameters that have to be acknowledged before weapons are deployed. It could be a visual reference point, like a mobile phone lighting up. \nThis information is considered highly sensitive. \nPhilip Ingram, a former military intelligence officer with the British Army, told the BBC that similar information \"falls firmly into the bracket of what would have been classified top secret\".\n\"You can practically plot where the aircraft are going to come from,\" he added. \nIn the wake of the chat's revelations, the White House and other US officials have argued that this information does not constitute a \"war plan\". \nIn a post on X, Hegseth said: \"The Atlantic released the so-called 'war plans' and those 'plans' include: No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods.\"\nIn this part of the group chat, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz provides an update on the strike - which in military parlance is called a battle damage assessment, or BDA. \nWaltz notes that the target building has collapsed, and that the US military had earlier had positive identification of the target - a Houthi \"missile guy\" - walking into the building, which was believed to be his girlfriend's residence. \n\nIn his message, Waltz congratulates Pete - referring to Hegseth, as well as the IC, shorthand for \"intelligence community\" and Kurilla, a reference to Michael Kurilla, a US Army General who oversees Central Command, a regional combatant command with responsibility over the Middle East and parts of Central and South Asia. \nThe messages do not reveal how the target's whereabouts or movements were tracked. \nA military expert contacted by the BBC - but who wished to remain nameless - suggested that a combination of aerial platforms, technological tracking capabilities or human intelligence on the ground could have been used, or a combination of various sources. \nAt least 53 people were killed in the initial wave of US airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, which struck more than 30 targets  including training facilities, drone infrastructure, as well as weapons manufacturing and storage sites and command and control centres, including one in which the Pentagon said several unmanned aerial vehicle experts were located. \nIt is unclear which of the targets Waltz was referring to in the group chat. \nAnother potentially sensitive message comes from Joe Kent, a former special operations soldier and failed congressional candidate who was nominated by Trump to be the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center. \nIn his message, Kent refers to Israel carrying out their own strikes. \nThe Israeli military has repeatedly struck Houthi targets in Yemen since the beginning of the war in Gaza, in retaliation for Houthi missile and drone attacks on Israeli targets conducted in support of Hamas. \nThe most recent attacks took place on 19 and 26 December of last year. \nAccording to Kent, the Israeli government would seek to \"replenish\" any weapons stocks used in further raids, although he believes that to be a \"minor factor\". \nA slightly more sensitive message follows from CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who notes that the US is  \"mobilising assets\" to help a strike, but that a delay would \"not negatively impact\" the agency's work in Yemen. \n\"Additional time would be used to identify better starting points for coverage on Houthi leadership,\" he wrote.\nAssets, in this context, could refer to CIA-run spies on the ground in Yemen, or technological means such as surveillance drone flights. \nMick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence and ex-CIA paramilitary officer, said that Ratcliffe's message was very sensitive. \n\"Essentially, we don't want to share where the CIA is focused,\" he added. \nRatcliffe told a House hearing on Wednesday that he did not transmit classified information.\n(With additional reporting from Nomia Iqbal and Ruth Comerford)",
