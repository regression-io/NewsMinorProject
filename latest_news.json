An outage caused by a faulty software or server update, or even user error, can often be resolved in a matter of hours.\nBut trying to find and stop malware sweeping through systems and causing havoc on the scale of those operated by a large nationwide retailer like M&S, is not a quick job says Professor Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert from Surrey University.\n\"Everything from knowing what has been sold, hence what needs replenishing, to taking card payments is very dependent on complex systems\u2026 it will take significant time and expertise to analyse and ensure they have expelled the hacker,\" he said.\nLisa Forte, partner at cyber security firm Red Goat, agrees.\n\"They are handling the disruption in a mature way but to expect any company to get anything back online in a week is never going to happen,\" she says.\n \"I don't know one organisation that could do it.\"\nA lot is also riding on the nature of the threat. The longer a cyber incident goes on, the more likely it is to be ransomware, say multiple cybersecurity experts.\n\"I would suggest there is a high level of confidence this is a ransomware style event,\" says Dan Card, cyber expert at BCS, the chartered institute for IT.\n\"I describe these as like a digital bomb has gone off. So recovering from them is often both technically and logistically challenging\u2026 the victim organisation is likely going to be working around the clock to respond and recover.\"\nRansomware is a particularly nasty strain of malware, in which the owner of a computer or network of computers is locked out, their data scrambled, and the attackers demand a fee, usually in cryptocurrency, to restore it.\nOfficial advice is not to pay. You are, after all, putting your trust in criminals to be true to their word. \nBut it is often impossible to restore compromised services without the hackers' key \u2013 meaning the only way around it is to either use back-ups or install new systems and start again.\nM&S will not comment, and no attacker has yet gone public with any demands \u2013 although this doesn't always happen, it is often a way for cyber criminals to pile more pressure onto their victims.\nDragonForce, the cyber criminal gang we were told on Tuesday was likely to be behind the attack, allow other hackers to use their malicious software for attacks providing they get a cut.\nAs to who those hackers might be: fingers are pointing at a rather fluid network of individuals called Scattered Spider (it also has other aliases).\nIt was behind the attack on the MGM Las Vegas hotels in 2023.\nThe website Bleeping Computer cites \"multiple sources\" suggesting they are responsible and says some of them are teenagers.\nRik Ferguson, special advisor to Europol's European Cyber Crime Centre, says the sources of speculation about the group's involvement seem credible but adds that he has seen no conclusive evidence so far.\nI asked him whether M&S customers should be concerned about their personal information: the firm itself currently says no action is required.\n\"Only M&S are able to tell us whether customers should be worried about their personal data,\" he said.\n\"In the absence of certainty, it would certainly be advisable for M&S customers, particularly those who may have reused their M&S account credentials on other web services, to begin changing those passwords elsewhere.\"",

But if he is not able to start the match it will give Arsenal - and their supporters - a huge lift.PSG still have an array of attacking talent, though, and have the excellent Barcola, striker Ramos - who hit the crossbar late in the match - Lee Kang-In and youngster Warren Zaire-Emery to call on if Dembele is unable to start the game.Why Arsenal's away form could helpAlthough Arsenal dropped away in the race for the Premier League title in recent weeks, with only one win in their past four matches, their form throughout the season has largely been good.When playing away from home in the league they have won eight games, drawn seven and lost two.Those two losses came in back-to-back away games against Bournemouth and Newcastle in October and November respectively.The Gunners have lost only once away from home in the Champions League this season too, losing 1-0 to fellow semi-finalists Inter Milan.The main criticism thrown at Arteta is that he is unable to get Arsenal over the line to win a trophy.And the fact that Arsenal have failed to win any of their past seven semi-final matches in all competitions (L5 D2) and have failed to score in those matches will also dampen spirits heading into the match next week.Merino, however, hopes not. \"The team is full of confidence, full of energy for the second leg, and we have the motivation to win this for our fans and for ourselves.",

We are currently researching the next steps for the treatment of the painting\", the museum spokesperson told the BBC. \n\"We expect that the work will be able to be shown again in the future,\" they added.\nSophie McAloone, the conservation manager at the Fine Art Restoration Company, said that \"modern unvarnished\" paintings like Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 are \"particularly susceptible to damage\".\nThis is \"owing to a combination of their complex modern materials, lack of a traditional coating layer, and intensity of flat colour fields, which make even the smallest areas of damage instantly perceptible,\" she said.\n\"In this case, scratching of the upper paint layers can have a significant impact on the viewing experience of the piece,\" Ms McAloone said.\nThe Rothko painting was hanging in the museum's Depot \u2013 a publicly accessible storage facility beside the main museum \u2013 as part of an exhibition displaying a selection of \"public favourites\" from the gallery's collection.\nJonny Helm, a marketing manager at the art restoration service Plowden & Smith, said the incident had implications for UK institutions such as V&A East and the British Museum, which are considering \"opening up the display of things that would otherwise be obscured in archives.\"\n\"How will this event affect other UK institutions who are opening up their archives in the same way?\" Mr Helm said. \nRestoring a Rothko painting is a difficult task because \"Rothko's mixture of pigments and resins and glues were quite complex\", Mr Helm said.\nHe said the fact the painting is unvarnished \u2013 meaning it is \"open to the environment\" \u2013 will pose an additional challenge to conservators.\nConservators working to restore the painting will now likely be in the process of documenting the extent of the damage and researching \"historic successful treatments\" of Rothko paintings.\n\"Rothko works seem to have terrible luck \u2013 this isn't the first damaged Rothko we've heard about,\" Mr Helm said.\nRothko's 1958 work, Black on Maroon, was deliberately vandalised by Wlodzimierz Umaniec at London's Tate Modern gallery in October 2012.\nUmaniec was sent to prison for two years and subsequently apologised for his actions.\nDuring his trial, prosecuting barrister Gregor McKinley said the cost of repairing the work would be about \u00a3200,000. It took conservators 18 months to repair the painting.\nRachel Myrtle, Head of Specie and Fine Arts at Aon, a company that offers insurance broking to its clients, said fine art insurance policies typically cover \"all risks associated with physical loss and damage to artwork\".\nThis includes \"accidental damage caused by children or visitors, albeit with certain exclusions\", she said.\nShe said that when an artwork is damaged, a gallery's insurer will appoint a specialist fine art loss adjuster to visit the museum. \nThe loss adjustor typically \"reviews the damage to the artwork, examines any CCTV footage to determine the exact cause of the loss, and assesses conservation options\", Ms Myrtle said.\nThe museum did not comment on who will be held liable for the damage to the 1960 painting, which the gallery reportedly bought in the 1970s.\nThe Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen has previously billed visitors who have caused damage to artworks on display.\nIn 2011, the museum asked an unsuspecting tourist who stepped on Wim T. Schippers' peanut butter floor artwork, called Pindakaasvloer, to pay for repairs to the work.\nSharon Cohen, a spokesperson for the museum at the time, was quoted by AD as saying: \"It is normal procedure for people to pay if they damage art.\"\nThe Rothko painting is described by the museum as an example of colour field painting, a term used to describe art characterised by large blocks of flat, solid colour spread across a canvas.\nRothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 painting is one of several works of modern art that have been damaged in the Netherlands in recent years.\nIn November 2024, multiple screen prints by the US pop artist Andy Warhol were damaged by thieves during an attempted robbery of the MPV art gallery in the town of Oisterwijk.\nIn another incident, a Dutch town hall admitted it \"most likely\" disposed of 46 artworks by accident \u2013 including an Andy Warhol print of the former Dutch queen \u2013 during renovation works last year.\nMuseums have different policies when responding to damage caused by children.\nIn August last year, a four-year-old boy accidentally smashed a 3,500-year-old jar into pieces at the Hecht Museum in Israel.\nAt the time, Hecht Museum worker Lihi Laszlo told the BBC the museum would not treat the incident \"with severity\" because \"the jar was accidentally damaged by a young child\".\nThe family were invited back to the exhibition with his family for an organised tour shortly after the incident occurred.",

        "article_text": "Liverpool FC's victory at the weekend has clinched them their second Premier League title but it also resulted in something curious \u2013 producing a strange series of numbers in the league's record books.\nSomething remarkable has just happened in English football. Liverpool FC have been crowned Premier League champions for a second time. When added to their 18 pre-Premier League titles, it means they now equal Manchester United's record of being English champions 20 times. But while fans of the club will no doubt be celebrating this moment of triumph, another astounding facet of their achievement has caught the attention of mathematicians.\nLiverpool's title win has completed the opening of an exceptional set of numbers that has been 33 years in the making. The sequence emerges when we rank Liverpool alongside the other clubs that have won the Premier League since it was first formed in 1992, listing them by the number of titles won, starting with the lowest. As you can see in the table below, the number of Premier League titles goes as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.\nTo the untrained eye, this sequence might not seem significant. But it will be enough to get many maths aficionados excited. They will recognise this as\u00a0the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number (after the first two) is the sum of the previous two in the sequence.\nThe sequence can be found in an astonishing array of places \u2013 from the spirals of seeds on\u00a0sunflower heads\u00a0and the bracts of\u00a0pinecones\u00a0to\u00a0family tree patterns in some species of animals.\nFibonacci sequences (sequences in the plural because starting with a different pair of initial numbers and following the rule of adding consecutive numbers to generate the next gives you a different, but related sequence) were first\u00a0introduced to European science in 1202 by Leonardo of Pisa, also known by his nickname Fibonacci (meaning son of\u00a0Bonaccio).\nLong before Fibonacci popularised the sequences in his book Liber Abaci, however, the sequences had been known to Indian Mathematicians. They had drawn upon the sequences to help them enumerate the number of possible poems of a given length, using short syllables of one-unit duration and long syllables of two-unit duration. The Indian poet/mathematicians knew that you could make a poem of length n by taking a poem of length n-1 and adding a short syllable or a poem of length n-2 and adding a long syllable. Consequently, they figured out that to work out the number of poems of a given length you just had to add the number of poems that were one syllable shorter to the number that were two syllables shorter \u2013 the exact rule we use today to define a Fibonacci sequence.\nHidden in the sequences is another important and related mathematical mainstay \u2013 the golden ratio. As the terms in a Fibonacci sequence get larger, the ratio of each term to the one preceding it gets closer and closer to the golden ratio \u2013 approximated to 1.61803 by the first few places in its decimal expansion. The golden ratio is hypothesised to govern the arrangement of leaves on the stem of some plant species and supposedly leads to aesthetically pleasing results when applied in art, architecture and music.\nFibonacci sequences are often held up by mathematicians as exemplars of the beauty of mathematics. They can provide vivid visual examples of maths written into the patterns of the real world, without which many non-mathematicians can struggle to understand the elegance we see in our subject. In our over-enthusiasm to proselytise, however, there is a temptation to cast Fibonacci sequences or the golden ratio as some sort of all-encompassing natural law governing phenomena across orders of magnitude, from the spiral shapes of nautilus shells to vortices of hurricanes to the curved arms of galaxies.\nIn reality, although these natural features are aesthetically pleasing, very few of them conform to the rules of the Fibonacci sequence or exhibit the golden ratio. We must be careful that we don't try to shoehorn every beautiful pattern into the delicate Fibonacci glass slipper \u2013 to suggest causation and impose meaning where there is none.\nIt's extraordinary, then, to find the Fibonacci sequence cropping up in a place as unexpected as the Premier League. When, as scientists, we spot a well-known sequence like this appearing seemingly out of the blue, we should start to ask ourselves whether it tells us anything important about the process that generated the sequence. Is there some surprising unseen process underlying Premier League title battles or is it nothing more than a cute coincidence? Just because we can see a Fibonacci sequence in something doesn't mean it is there for a reason.\nNonetheless, spotting these sorts of seeming coincidences can be extremely useful for the process of scientific discovery. In 1912, for example, Alfred Wegener noticed the apparently strange coincidence that the coastline of West Africa and the eastern coastline of South America seemed to fit together like the pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. Despite the prevailing opinion at the time, that the enormous land masses of the continents were just too big to move, Wegener proposed the only theory that reconciled his observations. Continental drift suggested that the land masses weren't rooted in place but could, ever-so-slowly, change their relative positions on the surface of the Earth.\nMore like this:\u00a0\nWhen Wegener published his theory in 1915, he became a laughing stock. Geologists rejected his outlandish idea, citing a lack of mechanism for moving such enormous chunks of the Earth's surface, dismissing the seemingly snug tessellation of the continents as pure coincidence. By the 1960s, however, the theory of plate tectonics \u2013 the movement of the solid mantle and crust over the Earth's surface \u2013 gave credence to Wegener's now widely accepted theories.\nAlthough coincidences can point the way to new scientific discoveries, they can also prove an obstacle to scientific progress when they appear to confirm an incorrect theory. In the early 1800s German anatomist Johann Friedrich Meckel made just such a blunder. He was a believer in scala naturae (the ladder of nature) in which humans sit above all other animals in an ordered but static hierarchy. The simplest, most primitive life forms were supposed to sit on the lowest rungs of the ladder, while the most complex and advanced beings resided on the highest. His views were hardly surprising given that this \"great chain of being\" was the predominant theory of the day. The now generally accepted theory of \"common descent\" \u2013 that multiple species descend from a single ancestral population \u2013 was only in its infancy as an idea at the time.\nMeckel employed scala naturae to come up with a conjecture about his area of speciality \u2013 embryonic development. Known as recapitulation theory, he posited that, as they developed, the embryos of higher order animals (like mammals) progressed successively through forms which strongly resembled the \"less perfect\" animals, like fish, amphibians and reptiles, on lower rungs of the ladder. One startling, but seemingly unlikely prediction of this theory was that, as humans progressed through the \"fish stage\", their embryos would have gill slits.\nAs it happens, it was discovered in 1827 that human embryos really do have slits that resemble gills at an early stage of development. This extraordinary finding seemed to bear out Meckel's prediction and corroborate his recapitulation theory. So strong was the perceived evidence that the theory became widely accepted, and it wasn't until almost 50 years later in the 1870s that the recapitulation theory of development was finally put to bed for good as the idea of common descent started to take hold. Common descent underpins what we now know as modern evolutionary theory. It made clear that, far from undergoing a \"fish stage\" in the womb, the gill slits were a consequence of the fact that, sharing a common ancestor with fish, we also share much of their DNA and early developmental processes.\nSometimes coincidences can lead scientists astray, seeming to point to one conclusion when, in fact, there is an alternative explanation for the observations that is better supported by the facts.\nSo what does the fact that the beautiful, almost mystical Fibonacci sequence has cropped up in the data on the number of Premier League title wins mean for the beautiful game? With no plausible mechanism which could have given rise to the sequence, the answer is almost certainly nothing.\nIt's wonderful to have spotted this mathematical sequence in such an unlikely place, giving us a chance to reflect upon the importance of Fibonacci numbers. But a pattern doesn't always mean causality \u2013 a coincidence is sometimes just a coincidence.\nAnd, just like Meckel's gill slits, its appearance in the Premier League records is just that \u2013 nothing more than a spectacular but ultimately misleading coincidence.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Few technology careers offer the chance to demonstrate your skills in exclusive venues worldwide, from luxury hotels to Las Vegas e-sports arenas, peers cheering you on as your name moves up the leaderboard and your earnings rack up.\nBut that's what Brandyn Murtagh experienced within his first year as a bug bounty hunter.\nMr Murtagh got into gaming and building computers at 10 or 11-years-old and always knew \"I wanted to be a hacker or work in security\".\nHe began working in a security operations centre at 16, and moved into penetration testing at 20, a job that also involved testing the security of clients' physical and computer security: \"I had to forge false identities and break into places and then hack. Quite fun.\"\nBut in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back.\nInternet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash \"bounty\" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s.\nEventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities.\nAs Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a \"morally agnostic skill set\", bug hunters do have to operate within the law.\nPlatforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the \"scope\" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate \"hammering\" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money.\nThe payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. \"We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes.\"\nPlatforms like Bugcrowd mean \"you can use hackers as a force for good,\" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered \u2013 and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one \"we deem very severe\". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.\nSo, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.\nBut while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.\nMr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"\nYet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.\nMr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.\n\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".\nDr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.\nAnd it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.\nBut modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.\nHe says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".\nMr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"\nBut these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"\nBut the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.\n\"If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws.\"\nDr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but \"I think it's just a matter of time\".\nIn the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. \"The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe.\"\nThat is unlikely to put off the bug hunters in the meantime.

        "article_text": "Within hours of taking his second oath of office, Donald Trump signed a flurry of executive orders and declarations, and fired the starting gun on what has been a rapid and radical programme of change in his first 100 days.\nSo far, he has shown no sign of taking his foot off the pedal.\nThe sheer quantity of his news-generating actions over the past few months could be seen as a carefully considered strategy. It is one that Steve Bannon, the right-wing podcast host who advised Trump during his first term, first floated as long ago as 2018.\n\"The Democrats don't matter,\" Bannon told the writer Michael Lewis at the time. \"The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone.\"\nSo seven years on, with Trump back in the Oval Office and the zone not just flooded but virtually submerged, does Bannon think the strategy has worked?\n\"Flooding the Zone' is an overwhelming success,\" he tells me via text. \"The biggest victory is a broken globalist media that finds itself too frayed to cover our assault on the institutions of America's oppression.\"\nIt is a typically bombastic response. A wide variety of opinion polls, however, suggest the public is less enthusiastic. Trump's overall approval rating at this stage of his presidency, for example, is the lowest of any president in the past 80 years, according to a joint ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll released on the weekend.\nIn his usual fashion, Trump hit out at \"fake polls from fake news organisations\".\nBut do they suggest ailing support that could pose a problem for him down the line?\nIt is still early, of course, and Trump's base remains fully committed. Even so, the best laid plans of even the most cautious politicians can go awry. So after 100 days of action, is there anything that could derail Trump's promised agenda in the coming months?\nHere are three potential scenarios.\nTrump has spent many years talking about the good that tariffs could do for America's economy \u2013 and now he is trying to make it a reality.\nBut staking your presidency on a policy of global economic disruption comes with significant risks.\nTrump has already reacted to tanking global markets by announcing tariff pauses, and he has signalled he is ready to make a deal with China by recently making warmer comments than the earlier angry barbs aimed at Beijing.\nBut in July, steep tariffs on imports from any countries that do not have a trade deal with the US are set to come into force.\nCan the administration really agree 90 trade deals in 90 days as Trump has promised? If not, the president may find that his tariff regime and the potential for more market chaos begins to further shake his standing with voters.\nVoters who backed the president in November, at least many I have spoken to, appreciate the White House message that he is standing up to countries that have for decades taken advantage of the US and seeking to inject fresh life into American manufacturing.\nBut there is a tension between this message and what plays out on the ground -  not in diplomatic talks between leaders, but on main streets and in supermarkets as Americans go about their daily lives.\nTrump's tariff plans have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. And a poll by CBS News on Monday indicated there is a growing belief among voters that the administration is focused too much on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices.\nThis feels key to the success of the Trump administration in coming months. Ambitions to reset the global trading order are one thing - and a popular one among the president's supporters at that - but handing the cost of this to the average American consumer by increasing taxes on virtually all imports is dangerous politically, even more so if the country were to tip into recession.\nImmigration has always been Trump's signature issue. He enjoys higher approval ratings on it than any other policy area, with polls suggesting a significant number of voters support his swift actions to deport thousands of undocumented migrants.\nAs the administration pursues this immigration crackdown, it may not be the views of voters that hamper Trump, but rulings from the nation's courts. Judges are repeatedly telling the White House that its actions may be in breach of the law.\nThe case of one man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, has already made it to the Supreme Court. The administration has admitted it made a mistake when deporting him to a notorious prison in El Salvador, but appears unwilling to follow a Supreme Court order to \"facilitate\" his return to the US.\nSo far, the White House has avoided the kind of clash with judges that could prompt a full-blown constitutional crisis, even as it has maneuvered around court rulings aimed at limiting some of its most radical policy moves. But a showdown may happen soon.\nThe ultimate confrontation, of course, would come if Trump chose to ignore an order from the Supreme Court.\nUntil now the administration has been happy to argue about deportations in the court of public opinion, convinced that voters are much more concerned about removing illegal immigrants from the country than they are about due process.\nMike Madrid, a Republican political consultant, agrees. He told me that, in his view, many people do not believe undocumented migrants deserve legal rights. \n\"If you frame it between giving them due process and getting terrorist gang members... Republicans are going to side with getting MS-13 members off the streets,\" he said.\nStill, public support for Trump's immigration moves could be slipping. A poll published late last week indicated his approval rating on the issue had fallen by 10 points in recent weeks.\nEven if voters are prepared to accept the White House ignoring court rulings, any such move could pose a significant challenge to many Republican members of Congress who feel squeamish about it. So far, the party's senators and representatives have virtually given Trump free rein to do whatever he likes. But could they remain silent when faced with a president defying the law?\nElon Musk and his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" have not wasted a minute of these 100 days, taking their chainsaw to large parts of the federal workforce and cutting government spending including on international aid.\nAs with much of Trump's agenda, there is a tension between the very real voter sympathy for the message - in this case, that the government is bloated, wasteful and inefficient - versus the extreme actions sometimes taken by the White House to address that message.\nAnd with DOGE, the political risk for the president could come if it begins to cut government spending and programmes that voters readily rely on. That is a real risk, as the anger at Musk is already bubbling up.\nMany elected Republicans have stopped holding open meetings for constituents, known as town halls, after being confronted by angry voters who are worried about cuts to their pensions or government-funded healthcare. \nTensions are also running high within Trump's cabinet over Musk's interference, culminating in a heated shouting match in the West Wing recently between the billionaire adviser and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nThe reality is that Musk is considerably less popular than Trump, and his expensive effort to influence a special election in Wisconsin fell completely flat with voters.\nThe tech billionaire will soon have to leave the president's side. He is under pressure from Tesla shareholders to return to his struggling car company, and as a \"special government employee\" he faces time limits on working within this administration. There is a world in which less-frequent appearances at the White House could prove to be in the best interests of Trump.\nBut while Musk may be leaving, DOGE is expected to continue its work until July 2026. That leaves plenty of opportunities for it to make deeply unpopular spending cuts, which is undoubtedly a longer-term political risk for this White House, especially ahead of next year's mid-term elections.\nFor now, however, Trump's 100-day blitz of orders, actions and noise has steamrolled opposition and proved popular with his loyal base, who say he is simply doing what he promised. \nThose risks, however, are there - and with an administration as unpredictable and fast-moving as this one, the potential for a crisis never truly goes away.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nJose Mourinho v Pep Guardiola: How Jose became 'The Dark Lord'\nWhen Inter Milan drew Barcelona in the semi-finals of the 2009-10 Champions League, few backed the Italian side to progress against Pep Guardiola's world-beaters.\nBoth were chasing their own piece of history. Barcelona were trying to become the first team to claim back-to-back titles in the Champions League era while Inter were seeking a first European Cup final since 1972 and a first win in the competition since 1965.\nIt was a tie tinged with bitterness, with Inter boss Jose Mourinho going up against Guardiola, who had worked together at Barca but were now intense rivals.\nIt was a tie that defined Mourinho as a coach and ultimately saw him lead Inter to the Treble - the first Italian side to achieve such a feat - as they wrapped up the Serie A title, the Coppa Italia and the Champions League.\nAnd on 28 April 2010, he and Inter took a mighty leap towards that historic achievement.\nFifteen years on from the captivating second leg in Barcelona and with the two preparing to face each other in another Champions League semi-final, BBC Sport takes a look at the story of that fascinating tie.\nTension had been brewing long before the players set foot on the pitch.\nIn the summer of 2008, Barcelona were looking for a new manager, having sacked 2006 Champions League winner Frank Rijkaard.\nThe choice was Mourinho or Guardiola, who had worked closely with the Portuguese during the 1990s when he was Sir Bobby Robson's assistant and the Spain midfielder was Barca's captain.\nIt was a position Mourinho had acquired having first started out as an interpreter for Robson at Sporting, before evolving into an assistant coach. He followed Robson to Porto then Barca.\nBut while in Catalonia, the Portuguese was disgruntled with his treatment. \nHe was nicknamed 'the translator' and felt he was not taken seriously.\nWhen it came to Barca appointing a new coach a decade later, Mourinho - who by then boasted Champions League and Premier League titles on his CV - was shunned in favour of Guardiola, who had just finished his first year in management with Barca's reserves.\nIt was a decision that did not sit well with Mourinho and had a profound impact on the way he would go on to set up his teams, sacrificing pretty football - like Guardiola's tiki-taka - in favour of efficiency a solid defence.\nBarca's decision instigated a managerial rivalry between Mourinho and Guardiola that came to a head in 2010 in the tie and was later ramped up while the former was at Real Madrid.\nHow to Win the Champions League\nJose Mourinho\nMourinho's 'the translator' nickname returned in mocking tribute in the build-up to the first leg at San Siro.\nThe feeling was that Mourinho did not stand a chance against a Guardiola team at the height of its power, having won the Treble the previous season.\nAlready rife with drama and a gripping narrative, the first leg was played under a cloud of ash following the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajokull. \nIt meant Barca could not fly to Italy and instead had to take a 10-hour bus journey.\nWhether that had any bearing on the match is impossible to know. But it certainly gave an already intriguing tie an air of theatre.\n\"When you get to the knockouts against a team like Barcelona, you have to win your match at home,\" said Mourinho in a new BBC Sport documentary - How to Win the Champions League: Jose Mourinho.\nThat is of course easier said than done with Guardiola's illustrious squad including Lionel Messi, Xavi, Sergio Busquets and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who Barca had acquired from Inter in a swap deal that season with striker Samuel Eto'o.\n\"Before the first leg, Mourinho told me 'you're going to play left-back and you will mark Messi',\" recalls former Inter defender Javier Zanetti in the documentary.\n\"I knew Messi from the Argentina team and he was the best player in the world. I followed Messi around and in every zone he went into, two of my team-mates came to pressure him to deny him space to make a difference.\"\nMourinho's tactics worked and Inter bounced back from an early Pedro goal as Wesley Sneijder levelled before the break then Maicon and Diego Milito assured a 3-1 victory at a rocking San Siro.\n\"It could have been more. A fantastic performance,\" said Mourinho.\nListen: How to Win the Champions League - Jose Mourinho\nHow rejection fuelled Mourinho's second Champions League triumph\nBarcelona fans unveiled a banner which read 'comeback' in Catalan at the semi-final second leg at the Nou Camp\nSo to the second leg.\nWith a two-goal advantage to protect, Inter needed to produce a defensive masterclass to prevent Guardiola's men, backed by their expectant supporters, overturning the deficit.\nThe players emerged from the Nou Camp tunnel to be greeted by a banner printed simply with the word 'remuntada' - comeback in Catalan.\n\"I think that put the pressure on them [Barcelona] because everyone believed they could do it,\" said Zanetti.\nMourinho's style of play is synonymous with a solid defence, and it was something he relied on that night in Spain. That and a number of top, experienced players.\n\"At Inter, my bench was full of top players at the end of their careers. [Ivan] Cordoba, [Francesco] Toldo, [Marco] Materazzi, [Dejan] Stankovic. They were not my first choices, but they were my big allies,\" Mourinho said.\nHe recalled a speech made before the match by defender Cordoba in the dressing room.\n\"He was saying 'this is my dream, this is my last opportunity. I am not playing because of him [Mourinho]. He decided to put me on the bench and decided to play you. So you are going to play for me',\" Mourinho said.\n\"When you have this kind of person on the bench and in the dressing room, your work becomes much more easy. I knew that they would do anything for me and I would have done anything for them.\"\nInter's task became much harder in the 28th minute when midfielder Thiago Motta was sent off for catching Busquets in the face as he raised a hand when defending the ball.\nBusquets rolled around on the ground with his hands clutching his face, stopping momentarily to move his hands in a 'peekaboo' gesture to ensure the referee had produced a red card.\nThe Brazilian's reaction following the dismissal, man-handling Busquets in protest, only fanned the flames of a high-octane encounter.\n\"We went there with a strategy to try to control, to try and bite in counter-attack,\" said Mourinho.\n\"After 20 minutes or so Motta is sent off. People are sometimes afraid to speak about it, I am never afraid to speak about it - the referee's decisions are always crucial.\"\nDown to 10 men and with a 90,000-strong crowd willing their opponents on, Inter sat deep and flooded their defensive areas while the hosts' passing game was typically brilliant but failed to find the gaps.\n\"During half-time he [Mourinho] was still convinced we would reach the final. His confidence was contagious,\" said Zanetti.\nAnd, having already dubbed himself The Special One, Mourinho felt confident he had his tactics spot on.\n\"To play with 10 players against Barcelona, it becomes epic. You need heroes. You need to have the best out of everybody,\" said Mourinho.\n\"I think I was brilliant in the way I organised the team. We defended with everything we had. We defended with hearts, with souls. We gave absolutely everything.\"\nMourinho guided Inter to a first European title in 45 years\nHigh-pressure tactics and gamesmanship continually frustrated Barcelona as almost the entire second half was played in Inter's defensive third. But Guardiola's team of superstars probed without success.\nThat was until, with six minutes of normal time remaining, Barcelona broke the Italians' backline for virtually the first time as Gerard Pique collected Xavi's pass, turned inside Cordoba's challenge and slid home.\nBarca's tails were up and so was the crowd. One more and they would level the tie and progress to the final thanks to their away goal in Milan.\nBojan Krkic thought he had secured victory after he broke free in the Inter box and lashed into the roof of the net in injury time.\nBut the Nou Camp's joy was short-lived as the referee gave handball against Yaya Toure in the build-up and the match finished 1-0, with Inter progressing to the final to face Bayern Munich.\nThe full-time whistle had barely sounded before Mourinho sprinted onto the pitch, one arm in the air, to celebrate with his players.\nBarcelona chose that moment to put the sprinklers on.\nAn attempt to annoy the Inter players and stop them from celebrating on the pitch? Perhaps. For Inter, it did not matter.\n\"It was the most beautiful defeat of my career,\" said Mourinho.\n\"The fact that we played with 10 men for so long, makes it absolutely incredible. If I could choose one of my most emotional performances, in a career of more than 20 years, I would choose that one.\"\nInter continued to celebrate after the sprinklers were turned on at Camp Nou\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "Days after a 7.7-magnitude earthquake shook Myanmar at the end of March, killing at least 3,700 people, the country's ruling junta agreed to a halt in its devastating military campaign.\nIt then violated that ceasefire, again and again.\nI went inside rebel-held territory in the eastern Karenni state for 10 days from mid-April. I witnessed daily violations by the junta, including rocket and mortar attacks which killed and injured civilians and resistance fighters.\nOne of those was Khala, a 45-year-old father killed in a strike by military warplanes, in a place his wife Mala said should have been safe.\nWhen the ceasefire was announced, on 2 April, Mala and Khala sensed an opportunity to return to their home for the first time in years.\nWith their four-year-old child, they headed from the camp where they'd taken refuge to their village, Pekin Coco. They found it abandoned, with buildings shattered from drawn-out fighting. Almost everyone there had moved to farmland further away from the junta's weapons.\nBut as the young family was about to leave Pekin Coco again, their car loaded with their possessions, the shelling started.\n\"We were all at the front of the house. Then, shells landed near us. We hid at the back of the house. But he [Khala] stayed where he was,\" said Mala. \"The artillery shell landed and exploded near him. He died in the place where he thought he was safe.\n\"He was a good man,\" she said and began to cry.\nLater that afternoon, the junta's warplanes attacked a house on the same street, killing four more men.\n\"I hate them,\" Mala said. \"They always attack people without reason. I don't feel safe here. Jet fighters are flying over the sky often but there is no place to hide.\"\nMala is 31 and seven months pregnant. When we spoke she was back in a displaced people's camp, grieving. Her son Zoe, missing his father, wouldn't leave her side.\nBefore the earthquake, Myanmar was in the midst of a nationwide civil war.\nAfter decades of military rule and brutal repression, ethnic groups, along with a new army of young insurgents, brought the dictatorship to crisis point. As much as two-thirds of the country has fallen to the resistance.\nTens of thousands of people have been killed, including many children, since the military seized power in a coup in 2021. The UN says the earthquake has pushed a further two million people into need, some 2.5 million were already displaced before the quake.\nKarenni, or Kayah, state is far from the earthquake's epicentre. Its remoteness is both a blessing and a curse. Its thick jungle provides cover for those who oppose military rule, but it is difficult to get around, the roads are poor and main highways remain in range of the army's guns. Most of the state is now controlled by rebel and armed ethnic groups.\nOn 28 March when the quake hit, there were no reported deaths in Karenni - but the hospitals still filled quickly with people suffering spinal and crush injuries.\nA 30m (100ft) sinkhole had appeared in the forests around the town of Demoso. Locals who heard the ground open up thought it was another air strike. For many weeks, the sinkhole continued to expand with the aftershocks.\nThe UN noted that the Myanmar military continued operations after the earthquake and beyond the ceasefire, and called for them to end. The State Administration Council, the ruling junta, has not commented on the alleged violations but has claimed that it was attacked by resistance groups. During the ceasefire all sides in the conflict have reserved the right to respond if attacked.\nDuring my 10 days in Mobeye, Karenni, I witnessed daily attacks by the junta.\nI met Stefano there, a 23-year-old fighting the military dictatorship with the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force (KNDF).\nHe leads a platoon of young fighters who have set up trenches around the base.\nFrom a dugout just 100m (330ft) from the junta's positions, he explained the army had continued attacks \"using all means\" during the ceasefire - soldiers on the ground, drones and jets.\n\"They usually attack with drones and heavy artillery on this side. When it rains, they advance by taking advantage of the weather.\"\nHe called the ceasefire a \"joke\". \n\"We did not believe the military council from the beginning. We don't believe it now, and we won't believe it in the future.\"\nThe day after we spoke, the military launched a full-scale assault with heavy weapons and men, attacking rebel lines. As we made our way to the front lines, small-arms fire could be heard nearby, along with mortar strikes. The ground was pitted with fresh hits from armed drones.\nNearby lay the corpse of a junta fighter who had tried to breach the rebel positions. The resistance forces say they have suspended all offensive activities during the ceasefire, but they have said they will respond if attacked. Yi Shui, the commander of another resistance group, the Karenni National Army, showed me pictures on his phone. \"When we saw them, we shot them. One of them got hit\" and another ran away, he said.\nAnd again, the military wasn't just targeting the resistance forces. Its rockets hit farmland beyond, killing a 60-year-old woman. We arrived at fields where four rockets had landed, children were playing with the bent metal and shrapnel from the strikes.\nThe injured were taken to local hospitals, which are hidden deep in the jungle to avoid air strikes from junta warplanes.\nIn one, a young fighter was being treated in a wooden ward with a dirt floor. He had a shrapnel wound to his shoulder and was losing a lot of blood.\nThe doctor in charge, 32-year-old Thi Ha Tun, said he'd treated around a dozen patients for war-related injuries since the ceasefire was declared. Two of the patients, resistance fighters, died.\nHe dismissed what he called the junta's lies. \"They only care about their own interests,\" he said. \"They will only care about their own organisation. They will not care about the rest of this country, their own generation, the youth, the children, the elderly, anything.\"\nThe only solution is to keep fighting, he said.\nHigh on a hilltop in the rebel-controlled areas is the church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The earthquake brought down the church steeple and part of the roof. The bell from Rome now sits in a temporary cradle. Repairs have been made, but the church will probably need to be rebuilt.\nThey are still feeling the aftershocks here weeks later.\nBut for Father Philip, the local priest, the greatest threat to his congregation, many of whom are the war displaced, comes from above, not below.\n\"No place is safe. When we have jet fighters flying in the sky\u2026 you never know what will come falling from the sky.\"\nBack at the Mobeye front, Stefano and his men pass the hours between attacks, cleaning their weapons and singing songs. \"I can hear the people's prayers, cries, and cries. We will overthrow the dictatorship,\" they sing in unison. They say the only ceasefire they will trust will come with the junta's defeat. \nThe truce will finish at the end of the month, but for most of the people here, it's as if it never existed at all.",

        "article_text": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the Week.\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\nRobert Sanchez (Chelsea): He's been pretty poor all season and the general consensus is that Chelsea are going to have to change their goalkeeper, but he was very good against Everton. He made three or four decent saves and then was in a position where he could command his box much better than he has done for most of the season.\nKieran Trippier (Newcastle): He was excellent, assured, calm and quality on the ball. At the ripe old age of 34, he is still showing that it's necessary to have experience in the side. He helped Newcastle to manage the game when they went 2-0 up. He showed quality for two of the goals - standing a cross up for Dan Burn and also his corner for Newcastle's third was magnificent.\nCarlos Baleba (Brighton): Brighton will do well to keep hold of Baleba. There are so many levels to go up in his armoury - he is just frightening. He's tall and powerful and his celebration after his last-minute winner wasn't too bad either.\nDan Burn (Newcastle): Burn is the magic man of Newcastle, he just keeps on going. Every time you think his story is doing to drop off, he just keeps getting better. Burn had a real ding-dong with Liam Delap but had the Ipswich forward in his back pocket and then also scored a goal.\nRayan Ait-Nouri (Wolves): It looks to me like he is playing for a move, he looks focused and has the right mindset. His assist for the goal was fantastic but he just continually gets up and down the field. There are only a couple of games left and he still has that burning desire to have an impact.\nAlexis Mac Allister (Liverpool): He has been Liverpool's most consistent midfielder this season. It was a great finish from him, he just looked so calm. The best bit wasn't the goal but it was that he was the standard-setter throughout.\nYasin Ayari (Brighton): He was good and solid but it's all about his goal. What a hit and what a show of technical ability to use Lucas Paqueta who was running at him and just bend it round him.\nMatheus Cunha (Wolves): I'm running out of ways to praise him. He is just at home at Wolves - we know he is leaving but he just looks so comfortable in that side. Wolves know the offer is coming and he just wants to sign off on a positive. He is known as a bit of a maverick and has a wild side but at the moment he has his head screwed on.\nMohamed Salah (Liverpool): He just continues to score goals and had a very decent celebration - a selfie in front the Kop. It's at a time when you think he isn't playing at his full potential too and on a weekend when Liverpool secure the title.\nAntoine Semenyo (Bournemouth): I'm so impressesed every time I watch him. I played against him at Bristol City and didn't think he would be able to go on and do what he's doing in the Premier League, but he is going from strength to strength. Manchester United need to be looking at him - he is powerful and drives, that's what they need.\nAlexander Isak (Newcastle): He could have scored four on the day. His movement and link-up play is excellent. This guy is the complete striker in world football.\nArne Slot (Liverpool): Could it be anyone else on the weekend that he delivers Liverpool a 20th league title? He has come in and only bought Federico Chiesa and turned Liverpool into a title winning team. He's excellent as a manager, excellent in every interview and handles any adversity in the right kind of way.\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

        "article_text": "The morning after the heist, burglar Yunice Abbas went home to catch up on some sleep.\nWhen he woke up, his wife was glued to the TV. The headline news of the day was that American reality TV star Kim Kardashian, then 35, had been tied up and robbed at gunpoint in a luxury Paris apartment.\nAll her jewellery - worth about $10m (\u00a37.5m), and including the engagement ring her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m (\u00a33m) - had been taken.\nYunice Abbas' wife glared at him. \"This has you written all over it,\" she grumbled.\nShe was right. The 62-year-old had dabbled in crime his whole life, from petty offences to bank heists.\nThe Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement.\nBut a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017 - three months after the robbery - Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested.\nTen of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks. \nOut of those, five are accused of taking part in the heist, and six are accused of being accessories to the crime.\nMost of them were born in the 1950s, leading French media to dub them the \"grandpa robbers\".\nAbbas and a 68-year-old man, Aomar Ait Khedache, have confessed; the others have not. \nOne has since passed away, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he is suffering from advanced dementia. \nBy the time the trial starts, almost nine years will have gone by since the heist.\nOn the night between 2 and 3 October 2016, Abbas and four accomplices allegedly staked out Kardashian's discreet suite in Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s, in the glitzy Madeleine neighbourhood in Paris, not far from the Op\u00e9ra and Place Vendome.\nAt around 03:00 local time, they burst into the hotel's entrance hall, dressed as policemen and wielding a gun.\nThey threatened and handcuffed Abderrahmane Ouatiki, an Algerian PhD student who regularly took up shifts as night receptionist, and marched him up to Kardashian's room.\nShe was resting on her bed, tired from days of attending Paris Fashion Week events, when she heard stomping up the stairs. \nShe called out for her sister Kourtney and her stylist Stephanie, but when they didn't answer she panicked.\n\"I knew someone was there to get me,\" she recalled in an interview with US interviewer David Letterman years later. \"You just feel it.\"\nKim dialled 911 but the number, of course, didn't work outside of the US. As she was calling her then-security guard Pascal Duvier - who had accompanied her sister to a club - the men burst in, pushed her on the bed and started shouting.\n\"They kept on saying: the ring, the ring! And I was so startled that it didn't compute for a minute,\" she told Letterman. \nThe language barrier meant Ouatiki had to act as an interpreter.\nThey found the ring and stuffed it in a bag along with several other jewels, as well as \u20ac1000 in cash. One of the men grabbed her and pulled her towards him. \nBecause she was wearing a robe with nothing underneath, she thought he was going to assault her, Kim later told Letterman, wiping tears away.\nBut instead \u2013 using the technique of saucissonnage, or the practice of tying victims up like a saucisson, a salami - the man bound her with zip ties and duct tape, and left her in the bathroom.\nThen, he and the rest of the burglars fled on bikes and on foot. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up.\nTraumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn.\nIt wasn't until later that day, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was.\n\"There were breaking news alerts saying Kim Kardashian had been robbed at gunpoint \u2013 that's how important it was,\" says LA-based entertainment journalist KJ Matthews.\n\"We were so fascinated with her and her family and their rise to fame... When the heist happened we were so surprised. How could burglars have gotten so close to her?\" Matthews says.\nBut while mistakes were made in terms of Kardashian's security, serious errors were made on the burglars' side, too.\n\"They didn't take into account the progress made by police techniques, which can now find micro traces of DNA anywhere,\" said Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and the author of \"Kim and the Grandpa Robbers\" - a thorough account of the heist and of the lives of its perpetrators.\n\"When they dressed up as police they thought 'that's it, nobody will be able to recognise us',\" she adds.\nBut in 2016 Paris was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of the previous year, and there were a huge number of CCTV cameras all round the city, meaning police were able to spot the thieves and see them make off with the jewels.\nOther details of this story suggest that the thieves' planning was rather haphazard. When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels.\nThe next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from.\nPolice arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as \"Omar the Old\".\nFrench media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian caf\u00e9 that winter, just before their arrest.\nThe question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian's schedule.\nCourt documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements.\nBut how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard?\nThe documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael's firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim's whereabouts.\nMr Madar was arrested in January 2017. His lawyer Arthur Vercken vehemently pushed back against the accusations, telling the BBC that \"since the start the case was built on assumptions, theses, theories - but no proof [of Madar's involvement] was ever found\".\nHe added that although the Madar brothers exchanged texts about the Kardashians during Fashion Week it was just because they were \"bored\" and that when the heist took place Gary was asleep.\nGary's brother, Michael, is not a defendant.\n\"Five men did this. You don't think one of them was keeping an eye on who was coming and going from her hotel?\" he said, suggesting that Mr Madar had only been arrested \"to prove that the French justice system works\".\nThe trial will also attempt to determine where the jewels ended up. \nPolice tracking of the gang's phones showed that soon after the heist Omar the Old travelled from Paris to Antwerp in Belgium, where 50% of the world's polished diamonds and 80% of rough diamonds are sold, according to the Diamond Investment Office.\nMany jewels were reportedly melted or broken up and sold. Abbas got \u20ac75,000 (\u00a364,000); others far less.\nAs for Kim's engagement ring, Omar the Old said the gang was too scared to sell it on as it would be too easily traceable. It has never been found.\nKim was undoubtedly spooked by the event, which marked the start of her social media hiatus.\nIn an episode of the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she tearfully recalled the night of the heist and said had been scared for her life; later she also said the robbery had made her a \"less materialistic person\".\nSoon after the incident her sister Khloe told The Ellen DeGeneres Show that, for safety reasons, the Kardashian family were making some changes to how freely they posted on social media.\n\"The biggest change was her security detail,\" KJ Matthews told the BBC.\nPatricia Tourancheau, the author of the book about the heist, said she was \"fascinated\" by the \"clash between these old-style burglars from the Parisian banlieue and this global social media star\".\n\"They fled on bikes and she flies around on private jets,\" she laughed. \n\"These are a group of elderly down-and-out thieves, they're always broke, they're forever involved in convoluted plans\u2026 and they're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is.\"\nThe gang was not \"elite\" as it was suggested in the early days, she added.\n\"This isn't the creme de la creme of French banditry. They're a bit of a bunch of losers, really. They're the same kind of people who in the 60s and 70s would burglar banks or post offices and who then rebranded to drug trafficking and then moved on to jewels because it was easier,\" she said.\nAround mid-May, Kim will face the suspects for the first time in years when she takes the stand as a witness. \nCameras are not allowed in French courts but her arrival to the tribunal on Ile de la Cit\u00e9 alone will inevitably spark the same media frenzy that has accompanied her for over a decade.\nIn his memoir, Abbas expressed the hope the victim's status and the global resonance of the case would not influence judges unduly.\nHowever, he also said that on the last day of the trial he would bring a duffle bag with his belongings, ready to be sent to jail.\n\"The problem with the past,\" he wrote, \"is that it sticks with you as long as you live\".",

        "article_text": "A small number of BBC stars and managers \"behave unacceptably\" at work, and bosses often fail to tackle them, a report into the broadcaster has found.\nThe review, commissioned by the BBC's board in the wake of the Huw Edwards scandal, concluded there is not a widespread \"toxic\" culture, but that there is \"a minority of people\" whose bad behaviour \"is not addressed\".\nIn response, the BBC said it would introduce reforms, and its chairman Samir Shah said he would draw \"a line in the sand\".\nHe told presenters: \"After today, let me state it clearly, if you think you're too big a star or too important to live by the values of this organisation, not only are you wrong, but we will find you out.\"\nShah, who is chairman of the BBC board, said the report highlighted \"some deep-seated issues\", and that people who \"abuse power or punch down or behave badly\" have no place at the corporation.\nThose people make life \"not just difficult, but at times unbearable\" for colleagues, he said.\nWhile most staff are respectful, he said: \"There continues to be pockets in the organisation where this is not the case.

EdwardsA small number of BBC stars and managers \"behave unacceptably\" at work, and bosses often fail to tackle them, a report into the broadcaster has found.The review, commissioned by the BBC's board in the wake of the Huw Edwards scandal, concluded there is not a widespread \"toxic\" culture, but that there is \"a minority of people\" whose bad behaviour \"is not addressed\".In response, the BBC said it would introduce reforms, and its chairman Samir Shah said he would draw \"a line in the sand\".He told presenters: \"After today, let me state it clearly, if you think you're too big a star or too important to live by the values of this organisation, not only are you wrong, but we will find you out. \"Broadcasting union Bectu said the \"commitment to draw a line in the sand must not be an empty promise\".However, many employees have \"a degree of cynicism\" about the ability of BBC leaders and managers to enact the necessary change, the report said.The corporation announced the review in the wake of revelations about Edwards, formerly its most senior news presenter, who committed offences involving child abuse images.Separately, some BBC staff members had accused Edwards of sending them flirtatious and \"pushy\" private messages, and one said he was treated \"like this God of news\" who was \"allowed to feel like he could get away with anything\".The new report comes 12 years after a previous review, carried out in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal, which suggested there was \"a strong undercurrent of fear\" at the BBC when addressing issues of bullying.That report found some bad behaviour appeared to go unchallenged by senior managers, with certain individuals \"seen as being 'untouchable' due to their perceived value to the BBC\".The past year has seen a string of allegations about BBC presenters, and questions raised about how the corporation has dealt with them.In January, the BBC apologised to staff who felt they could not speak up with concerns about Russell Brand's behaviour because he was seen as \"too influential\" and they felt he \"would always get his way and therefore they stayed silent\".Then in February, the BBC board apologised over \"missed opportunities\" to tackle \"bullying and misogynistic behaviour\" by former Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood.Jermaine Jenas, who presented The One Show and appeared on Match of the Day, was sacked last summer following complaints about workplace conduct.Gregg Wallace stepped aside as Masterchef co-host after allegations including inappropriate sexual comments by 13 people who worked with him, which he has said are \"not all true\".Two Strictly Come Dancing professionals including Giovanni Pernice did not return for last year's series, with the BBC upholding some of complaints against him, but clearing him of the most serious allegations.BBC launches review into preventing abuses of powerWhistleblowers criticise BBC over Huw Edwards inquiryBBC apologises for culture of silence over

deep-seated issues\", and that people who \"abuse power or punch down or behave badly\" have no place at the corporation.Those people make life \"not just difficult, but at times unbearable\" for colleagues, he said.While most staff are respectful, he said: \"There continues to be pockets in the organisation where this is not the case. \"The report also said it had heard instances of

        "article_text": "Over the past week I have crossed a radically changing North America, from Arizona to Washington DC in the US and then on to Saskatchewan in Canada, witnessing clear evidence of the consequences of historic change in the way the world economy is run. Huge uncertainty means nobody really knows where it is headed.\nThe walk from the White House Rose Garden to the HQ of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) takes just 9 minutes. In the past few days, in this very short stroll, two very different worlds collided with each other.\nThe former is the place where at the start of this month, with an extraordinary chart and questionable equation, President Trump took on the world with his so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\".\nThe latter is the place where just three weeks on from that, after rowback, market tumult, and confusion, the finance ministers of the entire world gathered to try to pick up the pieces, even as they were still rebounding off the ground.\nAt the IMF meetings that included gatherings of G7 and G20 members, something unique happened. The US representatives faced not open hostility, but exasperation, bewilderment and deep concern, from almost the entire rest of the world, for having sent the global economy back towards a crisis, just as it had finally emerged from four years of pandemic, war and energy shocks.\nThe concern was most acutely expressed by the East Asian countries, who had in early April been classed as \"looters and pillagers\" of American jobs because of the fact that these economies, many of them key allies of the US, export more goods to the US than the other way around.\nThe talk of the G7 was the quiet determined fury of the Japanese, who were said to feel betrayed by the US turn on trade, and whose confusion over what US trade negotiators actually wanted recently sparked a sell off of US government bonds. The finance minister Katsunobu Kato told the roundtable the US tariffs were \"highly disappointing\", hurting growth and destabilising markets.\nI was reminded of the time at the IMF in 2022 when developing country finance ministers asked me if everything was OK in Britain during the mini budget crisis of Liz Truss' government. Then the UK was the source of fragility, trading like an emerging market, when its normal role was solving crises in those markets.\nIn the face of febrile bond markets, this week the faint sound of the bugle of retreat on the US trade war got louder. A forest of olive branches seemed to be on offer from the US to get the Chinese to come back to the table to negotiate, from respect for their economic achievements to the offer of a deal to do a \"beautiful rebalancing\" of the world economy. It was a far cry from the claims of \"looting and pillaging\".\nYet a much hoped for meeting between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart did not materialise.\nMost of the rest of the world leaving their meetings with Bessent are reporting back an assumption that the US is edging away from what it cannot acknowledge was overreach.\nAnd there is a widespread view that there is no need for countries to retaliate, when the CEOs of Walmart and Target are telling the President privately that there will be empty shelves from early May.\nThe collapse in container traffic from China to the port of Los Angeles - the main artery of the world economy for the first quarter of the 21st century - is the one to watch. The IMF's boffins say they can start to see the impact from space as satellites track fewer, increasingly empty ships leaving China's ports. Of course this will be denied by the US.\nIt is true that there was far more relative calm at the end of the IMF Meetings compared to the beginning. Why? Because the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has seized control of the tariff agenda and has almost single-handedly calmed markets and the rest of the world.\nFinancial diplomats put down the Bessent ascendancy and the critical 90 day pause in the so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs to some farcical West Wing antics.\nThe story goes Bessent was able to get the ear of Trump regarding the bond market damage from his tariffs, only after a separate White House economic adviser managed to use the bait of a fake meeting to lure away the hardline tariff hawk and author of the infamous reciprocal tariff equation Pete Navarro from patrolling the Oval Office.\nWall Street bosses are thought to have suggested that only by firing Navarro, can some semblance of normality return. Insiders suggest that Trump will never get rid of his trade adviser, as he served time in jail after the January 6 riots in support of the President.\nAt best this sounds like the future of the world economy and all our livelihoods played out like a real time Hilary Mantel novel about the court of Trump. At worst it is leading to financiers and Governments starting to think the unthinkable about how much further the US or the rest of the world might go and  currently, the uncertainty about everything is more concerning than the direct impact of the tariffs.\nAnd that uncertainty is prompting some fairly wild theories about what might come next.\nAt times of acute global financial stress, \"swap lines\" between central banks exist to preserve financial stability, making sure there is a constant supply of US dollars.\nBut now some of the world's central banks have started to game out what might happen if the US chose to use its dollar \"swap lines\" to the rest of the world as a form of diplomatic leverage or even a weapon.\nIs it inconceivable that the US might deny them or veto the Federal Reserve handing them out? One just has to assume it is inconceivable, because in many instances there is no way to mitigate it. But the nightmarish scenario for the world financial system, however unlikely, is now not wholly implausible.\nA little less unlikely perhaps is the idea that those countries with a trade surplus with the US could help fund the US with an effective tax on their holdings of US government debt. Some of these ideas have been floated in speeches and papers by US government advisers.\nIn this atmosphere, worrying but incorrect ideas can start to infect confidence. For example, there was a \"whodunnit\" about significant selling of US Government debt just after the original tariff reveal.\nSome speculated it was China. But Tokyo currently happens to be the biggest overall creditor to the US. Was this Japanese selling that helped make the case to Trump for the tariff pause, an almost deliberate diplomatic tactic? Two very well connected officials suggested this scenario to me, which shows the febrility right now, even though it seems implausible.\nWhile Bessent commanded the weekend airwaves in the US having assumed control of this process, it was still quite something to see him sending the message that \"Investors need to know that the U.S. government bond market is the safest and soundest in the world\". If you have to say it\u2026\nAnother significant finance minister told me of his global counterparts that \"no one was crawling to the Americans\" given the unbeatable effectiveness of the US having to negotiate with its own bond market.\nAmid the uncertainty, no one seems to know if the \"baseline\" universal tariff of 10% is even negotiable. President Trump's message that tariff revenue could be sufficient to \"completely eliminate\" income taxes for \"many people\" would rather suggest that it will stay.\n\"It depends on who you talk to on which day of week\u2026 I've heard three different positions articulated on the baseline, one by the White House, one by the Commerce Dept, and one by a US Trade representative,\" said one senior G7 official. \"Do you know what the final outcome will be? Whatever the president wants at that moment, shaped by industrial, market and political issues,\" I was told.\nThis is of particular interest to the UK, because the baseline bites the UK hard. Alongside big tariffs on cars which are our biggest goods export and likely further ones on pharmaceuticals, our second most important export, the US hit to the UK appears inexplicable when by the White House's own creative definition of \"trade cheating\" - running a goods surplus - the US is actually slightly \"cheating\" the UK.\nI put this point to the Chancellor several times over two interviews in Washington. She diplomatically rejected that suggestion.\nBut eventually right at the end of our last interview, strolling around the famous reflecting pool in between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument, she volunteered something rather telling of the changing world. \"I understand why there's so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they're our nearest neighbours and trading partners,\" she told me. It caused a bit of a fuss back home, but it was not an off the cuff gaffe.\nThat's because concessions to the US on food standards are off limits for domestic political reasons. This appears to have been accepted by the Americans after consistent UK diplomacy, as the focus remains on a technology prosperity deal. It seems pretty clear now that the UK is going to push ahead with a \"high ambition high alignment\" deal with the European Union. And word had got out here among finance ministers.\nA very senior international official used the example of the UK-EU rapprochement as an example of the rest of the world coordinating and \"doing its homework\" as a response to US unreliability. \"Brexit was a bitter divorce, but now I see you are dating again,\" I was told privately.\nThere was also some relief that the US remained engaged with the World Bank and IMF. The Project 2025 plan that was published in April 2023 by the think tank The Heritage Foundation in anticipation of a second Trump presidency envisaged the US leaving those international organisations, and the Governor of the Bank of England recently expressed his concerns to me. \nBessent used the meetings to confirm US commitment to the Bank and the Fund, albeit with a return to their core functions and away from considerations of social issues and the environment. The Europeans counted that as a win.\nBut a bigger canvas remains. Will the US use this trade war in order to try to corral the rest of the world on to its side in a grand battle with China? It seems astonishing to have annoyed allies so significantly and fundamentally if this was the strategic point of all this. A test case here is Spain, which faces 20% tariffs as an EU member state.\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez met President Xi in Beijing a fortnight ago. Spain's booming economy (the fastest growing advanced economy last year -  and forecast to be again this year) is the only one to be upgraded by the IMF. It is built on green energy, access to foreign labour, tourism and significant investment and technology transfer from China. The US took a dim view of the visit and held a \"frank\" discussion with its finance minister Carlos Cuerpo.\nHe appeared rather unmoved by all this, telling me at the Semafor World Economy Summit in DC: \"There's a huge trade deficit with China, and we need to correct that by opening up to China, by also attracting Chinese investment, of course, within an overall economic security umbrella. And that can only be done by engaging and actually talking to the Chinese authorities\".\nSpain has secured notable Chinese electric vehicle factory investment and technology transfer. The US doesn't like it. But if the US wanted to persuade the Spanish and EU of its reliable long term allyship against China, it is difficult to see the strategy in the past month's tariff accusations and chaos.\nWhoever wins in Canada's election will bring that G7 economy firmly back into this globally transformative debate. Could the newly elected Canadian PM start a full fat negotiation with the UK too? And then he will chair the G7 Summit in Canada in June as President Trump's 90 day deadline expires. It is presumed Donald Trump will travel to Alberta, to the country he claims should be part of his own.\nThere is a path to trade peace, calm and deescalation. But it could get much worse too. This is a critical few weeks for the world economy.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Because the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has seized control of the tariff agenda and has almost single-handedly calmed markets and the rest of the world.\nFinancial diplomats put down the Bessent ascendancy and the critical 90 day pause in the so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs to some farcical West Wing antics.\nThe story goes Bessent was able to get the ear of Trump regarding the bond market damage from his tariffs, only after a separate White House economic adviser managed to use the bait of a fake meeting to lure away the hardline tariff hawk and author of the infamous reciprocal tariff equation Pete Navarro from patrolling the Oval Office.\nWall Street bosses are thought to have suggested that only by firing Navarro, can some semblance of normality return. Insiders suggest that Trump will never get rid of his trade adviser, as he served time in jail after the January 6 riots in support of the President.\nAt best this sounds like the future of the world economy and all our livelihoods played out like a real time Hilary Mantel novel about the court of Trump. At worst it is leading to financiers and Governments starting to think the unthinkable about how much further the US or the rest of the world might go and  currently, the uncertainty about everything is more concerning than the direct impact of the tariffs.\nAnd that uncertainty is prompting some fairly wild theories about what might come next.\nAt times of acute global financial stress, \"swap lines\" between central banks exist to preserve financial stability, making sure there is a constant supply of US dollars.\nBut now some of the world's central banks have started to game out what might happen if the US chose to use its dollar \"swap lines\" to the rest of the world as a form of diplomatic leverage or even a weapon.\nIs it inconceivable that the US might deny them or veto the Federal Reserve handing them out? One just has to assume it is inconceivable, because in many instances there is no way to mitigate it. But the nightmarish scenario for the world financial system, however unlikely, is now not wholly implausible.\nA little less unlikely perhaps is the idea that those countries with a trade surplus with the US could help fund the US with an effective tax on their holdings of US government debt. Some of these ideas have been floated in speeches and papers by US government advisers.\nIn this atmosphere, worrying but incorrect ideas can start to infect confidence. For example, there was a \"whodunnit\" about significant selling of US Government debt just after the original tariff reveal.\nSome speculated it was China. But Tokyo currently happens to be the biggest overall creditor to the US. Was this Japanese selling that helped make the case to Trump for the tariff pause, an almost deliberate diplomatic tactic? Two very well connected officials suggested this scenario to me, which shows the febrility right now, even though it seems implausible.\nWhile Bessent commanded the weekend airwaves in the US having assumed control of this process, it was still quite something to see him sending the message that \"Investors need to know that the U.S. government bond market is the safest and soundest in the world\". If you have to say it\u2026\nAnother significant finance minister told me of his global counterparts that \"no one was crawling to the Americans\" given the unbeatable effectiveness of the US having to negotiate with its own bond market.\nAmid the uncertainty, no one seems to know if the \"baseline\" universal tariff of 10% is even negotiable. President Trump's message that tariff revenue could be sufficient to \"completely eliminate\" income taxes for \"many people\" would rather suggest that it will stay.\n\"It depends on who you talk to on which day of week\u2026 I've heard three different positions articulated on the baseline, one by the White House, one by the Commerce Dept, and one by a US Trade representative,\" said one senior G7 official. \"Do you know what the final outcome will be? Whatever the president wants at that moment, shaped by industrial, market and political issues,\" I was told.\nThis is of particular interest to the UK, because the baseline bites the UK hard. Alongside big tariffs on cars which are our biggest goods export and likely further ones on pharmaceuticals, our second most important export, the US hit to the UK appears inexplicable when by the White House's own creative definition of \"trade cheating\" - running a goods surplus - the US is actually slightly \"cheating\" the UK.\nI put this point to the Chancellor several times over two interviews in Washington. She diplomatically rejected that suggestion.\nBut eventually right at the end of our last interview, strolling around the famous reflecting pool in between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument, she volunteered something rather telling of the changing world. \"I understand why there's so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they're our nearest neighbours and trading partners,\" she told me. It caused a bit of a fuss back home, but it was not an off the cuff gaffe.\nThat's because concessions to the US on food standards are off limits for domestic political reasons. This appears to have been accepted by the Americans after consistent UK diplomacy, as the focus remains on a technology prosperity deal. It seems pretty clear now that the UK is going to push ahead with a \"high ambition high alignment\" deal with the European Union. And word had got out here among finance ministers.\nA very senior international official used the example of the UK-EU rapprochement as an example of the rest of the world coordinating and \"doing its homework\" as a response to US unreliability. \"Brexit was a bitter divorce, but now I see you are dating again,\" I was told privately.\nThere was also some relief that the US remained engaged with the World Bank and IMF. The Project 2025 plan that was published in April 2023 by the think tank The Heritage Foundation in anticipation of a second Trump presidency envisaged the US leaving those international organisations, and the Governor of the Bank of England recently expressed his concerns to me. \nBessent used the meetings to confirm US commitment to the Bank and the Fund, albeit with a return to their core functions and away from considerations of social issues and the environment. The Europeans counted that as a win.\nBut a bigger canvas remains. Will the US use this trade war in order to try to corral the rest of the world on to its side in a grand battle with China? It seems astonishing to have annoyed allies so significantly and fundamentally if this was the strategic point of all this. A test case here is Spain, which faces 20% tariffs as an EU member state.\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez met President Xi in Beijing a fortnight ago. Spain's booming economy (the fastest growing advanced economy last year -  and forecast to be again this year) is the only one to be upgraded by the IMF. It is built on green energy, access to foreign labour, tourism and significant investment and technology transfer from China. The US took a dim view of the visit and held a \"frank\" discussion with its finance minister Carlos Cuerpo.\nHe appeared rather unmoved by all this, telling me at the Semafor World Economy Summit in DC: \"There's a huge trade deficit with China, and we need to correct that by opening up to China, by also attracting Chinese investment, of course, within an overall economic security umbrella. And that can only be done by engaging and actually talking to the Chinese authorities\".\nSpain has secured notable Chinese electric vehicle factory investment and technology transfer. The US doesn't like it. But if the US wanted to persuade the Spanish and EU of its reliable long term allyship against China, it is difficult to see the strategy in the past month's tariff accusations and chaos.\nWhoever wins in Canada's election will bring that G7 economy firmly back into this globally transformative debate. Could the newly elected Canadian PM start a full fat negotiation with the UK too? And then he will chair the G7 Summit in Canada in June as President Trump's 90 day deadline expires. It is presumed Donald Trump will travel to Alberta, to the country he claims should be part of his own.\nThere is a path to trade peace, calm and deescalation. But it could get much worse too. This is a critical few weeks for the world economy.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

You can probably guess what he is like...\"\nA lot of people have been asking. Because a lot of people have been watching.\nIt is not just what Pollock has done in the past 12 months - winning the Under-20 World Cup, scoring two tries on his senior England debut, being nominated for the Champions Cup player of the year, preparing to line up against Leinster in Saturday's semi-final and butting into the Lions selection conversation.\nIt is the way he has done it.\nThe 20-year-old back row has swagger and self-possession, and a side order of skulduggery.\nThere has been no dutiful trade-learning and spur-earning.\nInstead, just prodigious talent, Tigger-ish energy, galloping pace and a presumption that the world is his for the taking.\nIt gets people talking. And has done for a while.\nEighteen months ago a video circulated among Bedford's players.\nThey had been told that Pollock, then only 18, was joining them in the Championship on loan.\n\"He came with a little bit of a reputation as he was very well thought of by Saints' academy,\" says Bedford's Alex Woolford.\n\"This viral clip of him did the rounds among us. He was being interviewed after an England Under-18 win over South Africa and swore three times in about 10 seconds.\n\"We knew he was going to be very enthusiastic.\"\nHe was.\n\"We were pretty poor in the first half against Ampthill,\" adds Woolford, remembering Pollock's first start.\n\"Henry tried to give us the hairdryer treatment. He was effing and blinding and telling us we were not good enough and I remember thinking 'bloody hell, what is this kid doing?'\n\"But you have to give him credit.\n\"In rugby environments it is very easy to get confidence confused with arrogance. For all the stick he gets, I don't actually think he is an arrogant person.\"\nPollock spent part of the 2023-24 season on loan at Championship side Bedford\nStill, that perception persists.\nFreeman and Woolford say Pollock is a different, calmer character off the pitch, and his Northampton team-mates assured the rest of the England camp that the incoming youngster wasn't the \"idiot\" they were expecting., external \nTheir PR work was duly undermined by Pollock gleefully ripping the ball from Ollie Chessum when tasked with holding a tackle shield in an early training drill.\n\"Probably some of the boys were quite shocked with how I was when I first joined up with England,\" Pollock told BBC's Rugby Union Weekly.\n\"But I guess over time they realised this is just him.\n\"I am quite loud, someone that just brings a different type of energy to other types of players. Whether that is good or bad energy depends who you are talking to.\"\nPollock scored two tries when he made his senior England debut off the bench against Wales in Cardiff in March\nThere are plenty of fans.\nAt Franklin's Gardens kids wear his distinctive black head tape and make cardboard signs asking for Pollock's boots.\nThey love his celebrations. A basketball-style finger-roll lob in the direction of a beaten defender against Castres and an extravagant swallow dive against Bristol were two recent efforts. \nThey love his cunning. Pollock cheekily pulling the sock of Wales prop Gareth Thomas to milk a penalty gained social media traction during the Six Nations.\nAnd they love his abrasive style as he goes nose-to-nose with the opposition, raising tempers and the stakes.\n\"I want to entertain and get the crowd as close as possible to the team,\" he told BBC Radio Northampton's Saints Show.\n\"When I was growing up there, there was a lack of a idols. There were one or two that stick in my mind - Courtney Lawes, Michael Hooper, Richie McCaw - but not many.\n\"For this game to grow and this sport to get bigger, we need more characters, more players the fans want to come and watch.\n\"If you look to the football world, fans very much have their players and the personalities they like.\"\nThis video can not be played\nPollock ruffling feathers!\nPollock is harder to warm to when you are up against him.\nWoolford, Pollock's Bedford team-mate, also faced him in the Blues' annual pre-season fixture against Saints.\n\"On the pitch he is very loud, very confrontational, very in-your-face,\" Woolford remembers.\n\"He just exhausts you, as much mentally and emotionally as physically. But he has backed it up at every level he has stepped up to.\"\nIn the teams' most recent match, one Bedford player attempted to sledge back at Pollock, suggesting he would be back with the Blues on loan by October.\nInstead, by then, Pollock was a Premiership regular.\n\"Being annoying is part of my game,\" Pollock agrees.\n\"I want to wind the opposition up; I want to get under their skin. It is something I relish.\"\nThis weekend he will be digging into Leinster in a re-run of last season's Champions Cup semi-final.\nThe Irish giants could field back-row trio Caelan Doris, Josh van der Flier and Jack Conan.\n\"It is probably one of the best back rows there is,\" says Pollock. \"I am just excited to be able to say I played against them. To share the field with them is special.\"\nBut the deference won't last past the first whistle.\n\"They are beatable,\" he adds. \"We definitely see parts of their game we can attack and go after and hopefully ruffle a few feathers.\"\nIf Pollock's streak of success extends to the Aviva Stadium and his final and toughest Lions audition, he could well make the squad cut five days later.\n\"I have heard the rumours and stuff, but as a player you can't control that,\" he says.\n\"I just have to keep playing well, and if it happens, it happens.\"\nSo far in his career, things invariably do.\nPollock played in England A's win over an Australia second string at the start of this season before being promoted into the senior side",

        "article_text": "Days after a 7.7-magnitude earthquake shook Myanmar at the end of March, killing at least 3,700 people, the country's ruling junta agreed to a halt in its devastating military campaign.\nIt then violated that ceasefire, again and again.\nI went inside rebel-held territory in the eastern Karenni state for 10 days from mid-April. I witnessed daily violations by the junta, including rocket and mortar attacks which killed and injured civilians and resistance fighters.\nOne of those was Khala, a 45-year-old father killed in a strike by military warplanes, in a place his wife Mala said should have been safe.\nWhen the ceasefire was announced, on 2 April, Mala and Khala sensed an opportunity to return to their home for the first time in years.\nWith their four-year-old child, they headed from the camp where they'd taken refuge to their village, Pekin Coco. They found it abandoned, with buildings shattered from drawn-out fighting. Almost everyone there had moved to farmland further away from the junta's weapons.\nBut as the young family was about to leave Pekin Coco again, their car loaded with their possessions, the shelling started.\n\"We were all at the front of the house. Then, shells landed near us. We hid at the back of the house. But he [Khala] stayed where he was,\" said Mala. \"The artillery shell landed and exploded near him. He died in the place where he thought he was safe.\n\"He was a good man,\" she said and began to cry.\nLater that afternoon, the junta's warplanes attacked a house on the same street, killing four more men.\n\"I hate them,\" Mala said. \"They always attack people without reason. I don't feel safe here. Jet fighters are flying over the sky often but there is no place to hide.\"\nMala is 31 and seven months pregnant. When we spoke she was back in a displaced people's camp, grieving. Her son Zoe, missing his father, wouldn't leave her side.\nBefore the earthquake, Myanmar was in the midst of a nationwide civil war.\nAfter decades of military rule and brutal repression, ethnic groups, along with a new army of young insurgents, brought the dictatorship to crisis point. As much as two-thirds of the country has fallen to the resistance.\nTens of thousands of people have been killed, including many children, since the military seized power in a coup in 2021. The UN says the earthquake has pushed a further two million people into need, some 2.5 million were already displaced before the quake.\nKarenni, or Kayah, state is far from the earthquake's epicentre. Its remoteness is both a blessing and a curse. Its thick jungle provides cover for those who oppose military rule, but it is difficult to get around, the roads are poor and main highways remain in range of the army's guns. Most of the state is now controlled by rebel and armed ethnic groups.\nOn 28 March when the quake hit, there were no reported deaths in Karenni - but the hospitals still filled quickly with people suffering spinal and crush injuries.\nA 30m (100ft) sinkhole had appeared in the forests around the town of Demoso. Locals who heard the ground open up thought it was another air strike. For many weeks, the sinkhole continued to expand with the aftershocks.\nThe UN noted that the Myanmar military continued operations after the earthquake and beyond the ceasefire, and called for them to end. The State Administration Council, the ruling junta, has not commented on the alleged violations but has claimed that it was attacked by resistance groups. During the ceasefire all sides in the conflict have reserved the right to respond if attacked.\nDuring my 10 days in Mobeye, Karenni, I witnessed daily attacks by the junta.\nI met Stefano there, a 23-year-old fighting the military dictatorship with the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force (KNDF).\nHe leads a platoon of young fighters who have set up trenches around the base.\nFrom a dugout just 100m (330ft) from the junta's positions, he explained the army had continued attacks \"using all means\" during the ceasefire - soldiers on the ground, drones and jets.\n\"They usually attack with drones and heavy artillery on this side. When it rains, they advance by taking advantage of the weather.\"\nHe called the ceasefire a \"joke\". \n\"We did not believe the military council from the beginning. We don't believe it now, and we won't believe it in the future.\"\nThe day after we spoke, the military launched a full-scale assault with heavy weapons and men, attacking rebel lines. As we made our way to the front lines, small-arms fire could be heard nearby, along with mortar strikes. The ground was pitted with fresh hits from armed drones.\nNearby lay the corpse of a junta fighter who had tried to breach the rebel positions. The resistance forces say they have suspended all offensive activities during the ceasefire, but they have said they will respond if attacked. Yi Shui, the commander of another resistance group, the Karenni National Army, showed me pictures on his phone. \"When we saw them, we shot them. One of them got hit\" and another ran away, he said.\nAnd again, the military wasn't just targeting the resistance forces. Its rockets hit farmland beyond, killing a 60-year-old woman. We arrived at fields where four rockets had landed, children were playing with the bent metal and shrapnel from the strikes.\nThe injured were taken to local hospitals, which are hidden deep in the jungle to avoid air strikes from junta warplanes.\nIn one, a young fighter was being treated in a wooden ward with a dirt floor. He had a shrapnel wound to his shoulder and was losing a lot of blood.\nThe doctor in charge, 32-year-old Thi Ha Tun, said he'd treated around a dozen patients for war-related injuries since the ceasefire was declared. Two of the patients, resistance fighters, died.\nHe dismissed what he called the junta's lies. \"They only care about their own interests,\" he said. \"They will only care about their own organisation. They will not care about the rest of this country, their own generation, the youth, the children, the elderly, anything.\"\nThe only solution is to keep fighting, he said.\nHigh on a hilltop in the rebel-controlled areas is the church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The earthquake brought down the church steeple and part of the roof. The bell from Rome now sits in a temporary cradle. Repairs have been made, but the church will probably need to be rebuilt.\nThey are still feeling the aftershocks here weeks later.\nBut for Father Philip, the local priest, the greatest threat to his congregation, many of whom are the war displaced, comes from above, not below.\n\"No place is safe. When we have jet fighters flying in the sky\u2026 you never know what will come falling from the sky.\"\nBack at the Mobeye front, Stefano and his men pass the hours between attacks, cleaning their weapons and singing songs. \"I can hear the people's prayers, cries, and cries. We will overthrow the dictatorship,\" they sing in unison. They say the only ceasefire they will trust will come with the junta's defeat. \nThe truce will finish at the end of the month, but for most of the people here, it's as if it never existed at all.",

In the UK, nearly 18,000.\nThe study says governments should update their dietary advice to urge people to cut back on these foods.\nBut the UK government's expert panel on nutrition recently said there wasn't any strong evidence of a link between the way food is processed and poor health.\nThere is no one definition that everyone agrees on, but the NOVA classification is often used. Examples include:\nWhat is ultra-processed food and what does it mean for my health?\nThe numbers in the study are based on modelling the impact of ultra-processed foods on people's health. \nProf Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics, Open University, said the study makes lots of mathematical assumptions which make him cautious about what the findings mean.\n\"It's still far from clear whether consumption of just any UPF at all is bad for health, or what aspect of UPFs might be involved.\n\"This all means that it's impossible for any one study to be sure whether differences in mortality between people who consume different UPF amounts are actually caused by differences in their UPF consumption.  \n\"You still can't be sure from any study of this kind exactly what's causing what.\"\nDr Nerys Astbury, an expert in diet and obesity at the University of Oxford, also agrees there are limitations to the research.\nIt's been known for some time that diets high in energy, fat and sugar can increase the risk of diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, heart conditions and some cancers, which can lead to premature death.\n\"Many UPF tend to be high in these nutrients,\" she says, adding that studies to date haven't been able to prove that the effects of UPFs are due to anything more than \"diets high in foods which are energy dense and contain large amounts of fat and sugar\".\nThis type of research cannot prove that consumption of ultra-processed foods is harmful, says Dr Stephen Burgess at Cambridge University.\nHow physically fit someone is may be the main cause of poor health instead. But when numerous studies across many countries and culture suggest UPFs could be a risk to health, Dr Burgess says \"ultra-processed foods may be more than a bystander\".\nThe Food and Drink Federation, which represents manufacturers, said the term 'ultra-processed food' \"demonises a wide variety of food that can help people achieve a healthy balanced diet, such as yoghurt, pasta sauces or bread\". \nIt said all additives used by food manufacturers are approved by the Food Standards Agency, who ensure they are safe to eat and drink.\n",

        "article_text": "The model of football that has come to define our era - often associated with Pep Guardiola, who expanded on what he learned from Johan Cruyff and Louis van Gaal - is not only the most prominent today, but also the one shaping the present and future of the game.\nGuardiola didn't invent 'juego de posicion' - or positional football - but he developed it further than anyone before him, laying the foundation for a new cultural framework. And whether we like it or not, it has already taken over.\nIndeed, three of Guardiola's disciples - Luis Enrique, Mikel Arteta and Hansi Flick - find themselves in this week's Champions League semi-finals. The Guardiola way will again be on show at the business end of Europe's biggest club competition.\nThere has been growing resistance to this model. Critics argue that it turns players into robots, removes spontaneity and asks defenders to behave like midfielders.\nSome fans and pundits feel it's overcoached, overly structured, and lacking the chaos and excitement of \"real football\".\nBut perhaps that resistance is missing the broader picture - or reacting not to the model itself, but to poor implementations of it.\nLet's look at the facts. Five of the eight Champions League quarter-finalists this season played a version of positional football. Clubs across Europe - even traditional powerhouses like Liverpool and, eventually, Manchester United under Ruben Amorim - are gravitating towards it.\nIt produces brilliant games, particularly in European competition, where elite coaches and players amplify its potential. More than just a style, it's a winning model.\nMost importantly, it's a cultural force. Clubs are hiring managers who believe in it, academies are shaping players to fit it, and football education globally is being reoriented around it.\nNot everyone gets it right. But that's always been true in football. Not every team in the 1970s could play like Nottingham Forest or Liverpool - but many tried, because those styles defined their time. Every era has a prevailing model, and it's natural that most teams move towards it.\nWe're emerging from a footballing culture best summarised as: structured at the back, freedom up front. In other words, we train the defence and leave the attack to the imagination of the forwards.\nThat's changing, but cultural shifts take time. The new footballing paradigm is settling in, but hasn't fully taken hold yet.\nMikel Arteta (left) was Pep Guardiola's assistant at Manchester City\nThe attacking phase can be broken down into three stages: the build-up, the construction and the finishing. The French even refer to an additional phase - the preparation of the final pass - which sits between construction and finishing. But for the purpose of this discussion, let's stick with three.\nWhen Guardiola began coaching in 2001, his focus was on the build-up phase. The famous conversation with Victor Valdes, in which Valdes thought his manager had gone mad for asking him to pass to centre-backs who didn't want the ball, is now part of football folklore. A landmark moment in the evolution of the game.\nAfter the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, and especially following the rule change in 2019 that allowed players to receive the ball from a goal-kick from inside the penalty area, training the build-up phase became not just common practice, but a fundamental pillar of modern football.\nThe construction phase - managing the middle third - has taken longer to spread, but Guardiola had already started developing it at Barcelona, and refined it further at Bayern Munich and Manchester City.\nThe finishing phase, however - the final act of an attacking move - remains largely unorganised. Football still hasn't figured out how to fully systematise it. The culture of the game, among players and coaches alike, isn't quite ready for it. But one day, a new revolutionary will come along and advance that final phase. That's the history of football.\nFor now, we have brilliant practitioners perfecting the model as it stands - as well as the three semi-finalists, Unai Emery and even Enzo Maresca are two more. Roberto de Zerbi had started to push the boundaries, but his progress has stalled.\n\"Pep has been a reference for all of us who want to play football in a certain way\u2026 You always learn by watching his teams play. Always,\" said Paris St-Germain manager Luis Enrique.\n\"Working alongside him changed the way I see football. He gave me the tools to be a coach,\" said Arsenal's Arteta.\n\"Pep influenced me a lot. He has an incredible ability to organise the game, to control space and to constantly find new solutions. Watching him train Bayern was an eye-opener. He's one of the greatest thinkers football has ever had,\" added Barcelona's Flick.\nLuis Enrique's PSG beat Pep Guardiola's Manchester City 4-2 in this season's Champions League\nMuch of the criticism towards positional football is rooted in frustration: \"If we can't do it well, let's not do it at all.\"\nBut that's not how progress works. Just because only the top teams can currently execute the model exceptionally well doesn't mean it's flawed. It means we're watching football in transition. The conversation shouldn't be \"this doesn't work\", rather \"how can we implement it better?\"\nIt's easy to romanticise the past, to argue that football used to be more spontaneous, more human. But the truth is football today is better. More complex, more collective, more intelligently designed. It's harder to coach, harder to play and, when done well, arguably more beautiful to watch.\nThat's why managers like Emery are so fascinating. He challenged his own beliefs, read the evolution of the game and adapted. He embraced positional principles not because of ideology, but because they offered greater control, clarity and consistency - even without elite-level players.\nThat kind of flexibility is brave. Not every manager can do it. Not every player can either. But I admire clubs that choose to live in the now, rather than clinging to what worked then.\nWhy shouldn't defenders like Virgil van Dijk, Pau Torres or Pau Cubarsi touch the ball more than midfielders? Why can't they be the architects of the play? Why can't they be the role models for a new generation of defenders?\nEven PSG, a club historically reliant on individual brilliance, has adopted positional ideas in attack - making sure they're prepared to press the instant they lose the ball.\nThe hardest thing in football, as in life, is to look forward and imagine what's next. It's far easier to look back and say \"that was better\".\nI don't pretend to know what football will look like in a decade. But I listen to those who do. And I believe positional play is the present - and the future.\nWe are in the middle of a cultural shift. Some managers are trying to copy the model. Some are succeeding. Others are still learning. And yes, some are resisting altogether.\nBut in five years almost everyone will be playing some version of positional football. Not because they'll be forced to, but because football doesn't wait for those who refuse to evolve.\nThe next generation of coaches is already fluent in its language. And soon it will be universal.\nWe're not asking every restaurant to be Michelin-starred. But we are asking them to stop serving frozen food.\nLet's not fight the model. Let's enjoy the process. Let's celebrate the teams trying to get it right - mixing structure with their own cultural identity - instead of dismissing them because they're not Guardiola's City.\nA new football culture has taken over - and it's here to stay.\nThis video can not be played\n'PSG worry me more than Real Madrid'\nA beautiful story but we want much more - Arteta\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

At least certainly not the aggro-and-pyro, strict segregation scenario the phrase brings to mind in this country.\nFans are not kept apart. And neither are they forced to sit with their own tribe. The option to mix in with the hosts is still there and taken by many.\nAnd, secondly, away ends haven't just arrived in rugby. Travelling fan groups have been block-booking sections of opposition stands off their own backs for decades.\nQuinssa - Harlequins' supporters association, external - are one of the most proactive.\nThey have concentrated more than a thousand fans together on European jaunts, where ticket offices are more accommodating and the idea of any travelling fans is novel.\nTheir members, given a dedicated area because of Covid restrictions of the time, helped inspire their team's semi-final comeback against Bristol at Ashton Gate in 2021.\nTheir club's trip to Welford Road, which holds more than 25,000, was an obvious pick for the Premiership's trial.\nMarcus Smith takes a selfie with travelling fans after Harlequins' Champions Cup match away to Bordeaux-Begles in 2024\n\"It is a great initiative,\" said Leicester chief executive Andrea Pinchen, playing host.\n\"We want to be innovative, we want to try new things and it adds to the atmosphere with fans of both sides getting louder and louder,\"\nHer Quins counterpart Laurie Dalrymple, who was previously managing director of Premier League football side Wolves, agrees.\n\"It isn't the catch-all that is going to fix all the challenges we have had in our sport over the past few years, but not necessarily about that,\" he said.\n\"It is about giving a slightly different fan experience for the diversifying audience that we need to reach and grow.\"\nAllow X content?\nThis article contains content provided by X.

We need to grow the game and this is a step in the right direction.\"\nNick and Joel Baker, attending with their Leicester-supporting partners and sat among the Tigers fans, summed up the split.\n\"I am a bit more old school,\" said Nick. \"I like mixing in together and having a laugh and a bit of fun. There is never any nastiness at rugby, it's not like football where you need the segregation. I am not a great fan of it, to be honest.\"\n\"I think it is good to have the option,\" said Joel. \"If you support a club and now live in a different part of the country, it is nice to sit in with your fellow fans. \n\"I have lived in Leicester for five or six years and it is nice to hear some familiar accents when they come to town.\"\nRachael Pawley, far right, admitted giving Harlequins-supporting Joel, second from right, \"a lot of grief\" as her side emerged victorious\nAs Leicester's lead stretched out in the second half, the volume dipped on the London voices though.\nThe lowing sound of 'C'mon you Quins' and more youthful chanting of star fly-half Marcus Smith's name become less frequent and more quiet.\nOnly 500-odd strong, Harlequins fans were unlikely to break through often, even if the match had been more even.\nBy contrast, Gloucester's fans, congregated in the more sparsely-attended Stonex Stadium for last weekend's first trial match, made their presence felt and voices heard, external with some pithy chants about the deficiencies of London life and Saracens fly-half Fergus Burke.\nWhatever Burke made of it, other players have been supportive of the idea.\nHarlequins flanker Will Evans, who has spoken about the benefits of away support for visiting teams and the league as a whole,, external notably offered up applause to the Quins section.\nLeicester's players also relish focused pockets of support when on the road, according to Pinchen.\nWhether they will see more of it on next season's travels will depend on how Premiership Rugby, who will rebrand the competition for the next campaign, and its clubs' leaders, not all of whom have initially been keen, assess these two experiments.\nJudging by Saturday though, any expansion won't be the radical change to matchday alchemy some traditionalists most feared.\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

        "article_text": "Within hours of taking his second oath of office, Donald Trump signed a flurry of executive orders and declarations, and fired the starting gun on what has been a rapid and radical programme of change in his first 100 days.\nSo far, he has shown no sign of taking his foot off the pedal.\nThe sheer quantity of his news-generating actions over the past few months could be seen as a carefully considered strategy. It is one that Steve Bannon, the right-wing podcast host who advised Trump during his first term, first floated as long ago as 2018.\n\"The Democrats don't matter,\" Bannon told the writer Michael Lewis at the time. \"The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone.\"\nSo seven years on, with Trump back in the Oval Office and the zone not just flooded but virtually submerged, does Bannon think the strategy has worked?\n\"Flooding the Zone' is an overwhelming success,\" he tells me via text. \"The biggest victory is a broken globalist media that finds itself too frayed to cover our assault on the institutions of America's oppression.\"\nIt is a typically bombastic response. A wide variety of opinion polls, however, suggest the public is less enthusiastic. Trump's overall approval rating at this stage of his presidency, for example, is the lowest of any president in the past 80 years, according to a joint ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll released on the weekend.\nIn his usual fashion, Trump hit out at \"fake polls from fake news organisations\".\nBut do they suggest ailing support that could pose a problem for him down the line?\nIt is still early, of course, and Trump's base remains fully committed. Even so, the best laid plans of even the most cautious politicians can go awry. So after 100 days of action, is there anything that could derail Trump's promised agenda in the coming months?\nHere are three potential scenarios.\nTrump has spent many years talking about the good that tariffs could do for America's economy \u2013 and now he is trying to make it a reality.\nBut staking your presidency on a policy of global economic disruption comes with significant risks.\nTrump has already reacted to tanking global markets by announcing tariff pauses, and he has signalled he is ready to make a deal with China by recently making warmer comments than the earlier angry barbs aimed at Beijing.\nBut in July, steep tariffs on imports from any countries that do not have a trade deal with the US are set to come into force.\nCan the administration really agree 90 trade deals in 90 days as Trump has promised? If not, the president may find that his tariff regime and the potential for more market chaos begins to further shake his standing with voters.\nVoters who backed the president in November, at least many I have spoken to, appreciate the White House message that he is standing up to countries that have for decades taken advantage of the US and seeking to inject fresh life into American manufacturing.\nBut there is a tension between this message and what plays out on the ground -  not in diplomatic talks between leaders, but on main streets and in supermarkets as Americans go about their daily lives.\nTrump's tariff plans have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. And a poll by CBS News on Monday indicated there is a growing belief among voters that the administration is focused too much on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices.\nThis feels key to the success of the Trump administration in coming months. Ambitions to reset the global trading order are one thing - and a popular one among the president's supporters at that - but handing the cost of this to the average American consumer by increasing taxes on virtually all imports is dangerous politically, even more so if the country were to tip into recession.\nImmigration has always been Trump's signature issue. He enjoys higher approval ratings on it than any other policy area, with polls suggesting a significant number of voters support his swift actions to deport thousands of undocumented migrants.\nAs the administration pursues this immigration crackdown, it may not be the views of voters that hamper Trump, but rulings from the nation's courts. Judges are repeatedly telling the White House that its actions may be in breach of the law.\nThe case of one man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, has already made it to the Supreme Court. The administration has admitted it made a mistake when deporting him to a notorious prison in El Salvador, but appears unwilling to follow a Supreme Court order to \"facilitate\" his return to the US.\nSo far, the White House has avoided the kind of clash with judges that could prompt a full-blown constitutional crisis, even as it has maneuvered around court rulings aimed at limiting some of its most radical policy moves. But a showdown may happen soon.\nThe ultimate confrontation, of course, would come if Trump chose to ignore an order from the Supreme Court.\nUntil now the administration has been happy to argue about deportations in the court of public opinion, convinced that voters are much more concerned about removing illegal immigrants from the country than they are about due process.\nMike Madrid, a Republican political consultant, agrees. He told me that, in his view, many people do not believe undocumented migrants deserve legal rights. \n\"If you frame it between giving them due process and getting terrorist gang members... Republicans are going to side with getting MS-13 members off the streets,\" he said.\nStill, public support for Trump's immigration moves could be slipping. A poll published late last week indicated his approval rating on the issue had fallen by 10 points in recent weeks.\nEven if voters are prepared to accept the White House ignoring court rulings, any such move could pose a significant challenge to many Republican members of Congress who feel squeamish about it. So far, the party's senators and representatives have virtually given Trump free rein to do whatever he likes. But could they remain silent when faced with a president defying the law?\nElon Musk and his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" have not wasted a minute of these 100 days, taking their chainsaw to large parts of the federal workforce and cutting government spending including on international aid.\nAs with much of Trump's agenda, there is a tension between the very real voter sympathy for the message - in this case, that the government is bloated, wasteful and inefficient - versus the extreme actions sometimes taken by the White House to address that message.\nAnd with DOGE, the political risk for the president could come if it begins to cut government spending and programmes that voters readily rely on. That is a real risk, as the anger at Musk is already bubbling up.\nMany elected Republicans have stopped holding open meetings for constituents, known as town halls, after being confronted by angry voters who are worried about cuts to their pensions or government-funded healthcare. \nTensions are also running high within Trump's cabinet over Musk's interference, culminating in a heated shouting match in the West Wing recently between the billionaire adviser and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nThe reality is that Musk is considerably less popular than Trump, and his expensive effort to influence a special election in Wisconsin fell completely flat with voters.\nThe tech billionaire will soon have to leave the president's side. He is under pressure from Tesla shareholders to return to his struggling car company, and as a \"special government employee\" he faces time limits on working within this administration. There is a world in which less-frequent appearances at the White House could prove to be in the best interests of Trump.\nBut while Musk may be leaving, DOGE is expected to continue its work until July 2026. That leaves plenty of opportunities for it to make deeply unpopular spending cuts, which is undoubtedly a longer-term political risk for this White House, especially ahead of next year's mid-term elections.\nFor now, however, Trump's 100-day blitz of orders, actions and noise has steamrolled opposition and proved popular with his loyal base, who say he is simply doing what he promised. \nThose risks, however, are there - and with an administration as unpredictable and fast-moving as this one, the potential for a crisis never truly goes away.",

It was part of a performance that featured 13 beaten defenders (a record for a single match this season), 190 metres made, a 100% success rate off the tee and the player of the match award.With Russell on the bench and Gloucester's Santi Carreras and Racing's Henry Arundell en route in the summer, Donoghue, who also plays full-back, is another entry on a fearsome roster for the leaders' 2025-26 campaign.Another youngster to step in and step up was Leicester's Emeka Ilione.The 23-year-old back row, who signed a contract extension in March, was a destructive cameo on both sides of the ball in the Tigers' win over Harlequins.In 31 minutes on the pitch, Ilione made 34 metres - more than any other Tigers forward - and six tackles.LISTEN: Ilione on bulking up and medical degree on Tigers' Rugby ShowA former England under-20s captain, Ilione still has another year until he completes the medical degree he is juggling alongside playing.We may see plenty more of the doctor in the future.Officials explain errors and earn respectImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ridley refereed the Premiership final last year between Northampton and Bath\"It's my fault, I made a mistake, I apologise.",

Already one of the best players in the world - and before he even turns 18.\nA picture that says it all - Getty photographer Michael Regan captured this image of Yamal\n\n\"I don't think I have seen a 45 minutes like that from one individual before in my life. It is unbelievable,\" said TNT Sports pundit Ally McCoist as the players walked off the pitch at half-time.\nInter Milan boss Simone Inzaghi gave Yamal the highest of praise afterwards.\n\"Lamine is the kind of talent that comes along every 50 years, and to see him up close really impressed me,\" he said.\n\"He caused us huge problems because we were supposed to double up on him and it wasn't enough.\"\nBarca boss Hansi Flick said: \"He's special, he's a genius. In the big matches, he shows up.\n\"If it only comes every 50 years like Simone said, I'm glad it's for Barcelona.\"\nBBC pundit Stephen Warnock called him \"a future Ballon d'Or winner\".\nOne of the games of the season has everyone excited about the second leg at the San Siro in Milan next week, a change of pace from Paris St-Germain's hard-fought 1-0 win at Arsenal the day before. \n'A very, very special player' - Yamal, 16, makes Euros history\n'A talent that comes along every 50 years' - 'genius' Yamal steals show\nThis video can not be played\nLamine Yamal - The Boy King\nThere was a bit of drama before the game when Yamal appeared to hurt his groin and went down the tunnel during the warm-up, with speculation that he might not play.\nHe did start but had barely had an impact before Inter led 2-0 via two fantastic goals - Marcus Thuram's 30-second backheel flick from a Dumfries cross, and Dutchman Dumfries' flying close-range volley.\nBut then Yamal - who was being double marked - came to life, beating a few Inter players before whipping the ball in off the far post with astonishing ease and confidence.\nMoments later, he beat more defenders on the byeline and slammed in a shot which Inter keeper Yann Sommer tipped on to the bar.\nFerran Torres then capped off a fine team move to get Barca level before the break.\nDumfries, though, got his second with a header to put the Italian side back in front.\nBut moments later Barca were level again as Yamal cleverly dummied a pass and Raphinha lashed a shot in from 25 yards which hit the bar and went in off the back of Sommer for an own goal.\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan thought he had made it 4-3 to Inter but his goal was ruled out for a marginal offside.\nYet Yamal almost had the final say, one more memorable moment, when his cross-shot hit the angle of post and bar.\nThis video can not be played\nWarnock on Yamal's 'outrageous' performance against Inter\nIt is tough to even fathom how much Yamal has achieved at his age.\nThis was his 100th Barcelona appearance, and a 22nd goal to go with four in 19 games for Spain.\nYamal has 27 assists too, including two in Saturday's Copa del Rey final extra-time win over Real Madrid.\nMessi and Ronaldo did not make their international debuts until they were 18, while Yamal won Euro 2024 the day after his 17th birthday.\nMessi scored one goal and had no assists before he was 18, with Ronaldo bagging five and four assists.\nYamal is Barcelona's youngest La Liga player (aged 15) and the youngest to score and assist in La Liga for any team.\nHe also holds records for being the youngest Champions League starter, youngest player to score in a knockout game, a quarter-final and now a semi-final.\nYamal is Spain's youngest player and goalscorer and the youngest player and goalscorer in a European Championship.\n'Superstar' Yamal makes more history with Euros triumph\nThis video can not be played\nYamal is a genius, he is special - Flick\nVery few players have had the impact in football by Yamal's age.

His goal was outrageous.\n\"It's ridiculous watching Yamal. You know, effectively, what he always wants to do \u2013 he wants to come inside on his left foot. So you over-compensate and he has got the ability to drag it with his left foot on to his right foot, and he can actually put a decent ball in with his right foot too.\n\"He is just a phenomenal talent and I love watching him.\"\nAnd Ferdinand wrote on social media: \"As a pure football talent I'm going as far as to say I think Lamine Yamal is on another level to any player playing the game in the top five leagues in world football.

I mean, I disagree with what it was that they did, but she wasn't the only person that did it.\"\nThe English pop star and actress was one of a number of high-profile critics of the Blue Origin flight, which briefly took Perry and five other women to the edge of space two weeks ago.\n\"She was possibly the most famous, and the one that divides people the most, and so there was something in me that decided to choose her as the person that should [be singled out],\" Allen continued.\n\"Well, anyway, I'm just sorry. I would have been hurt if it had been me and someone in my industry used me and my name, and I saw that, and I'm sorry.\"\nAllen's apology came after she discussed \"Katy Perry and her mates all going up to space for 12 minutes\" with co-host Miquita Oliver in a previous episode.\n\"I mean, what the... hell was all that about?\" Allen said. \"I mean, in all seriousness, what? Why? For why?\n\"It's so out of touch. Like, we're on the brink of recession. People are really... struggling to make ends meet and put food on their tables.\"\nShe added: \"And the fact that they've, like, made it like some sort of feminist thing...\"\nThe flight, on a rocket designed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's company Blue Origin, marked the first all-female mission to space since 1963.\nPerry said beforehand: \"It's an important moment for the future of commercial space travel and for humanity in general and for women all around.\"\nAlso on board were Bezos's fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez, TV presenter Gayle King, former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn.\nBut Perry bore the brunt of the ridicule after it emerged she sang Louis Armstrong's What a Wonderful World, and held up the setlist for her new tour to an in-flight camera.\nFast food chain Wendy's posted on social media, \"Can we send her back\", before adding several days later that they had \"a ton of respect for Katy Perry and her out-of-this-world-talent\".\nModel Emily Ratajkowski was among the other critics of the flight, saying she was \"disgusted\", and took aim at Bezos in a follow-up video arguing that taking \"his fianc\u00e9e and a few other famous women to space for space tourism is not progress\".\nUS actress Olivia Munn described the flight as \"gluttonous\", explaining: \"It's so much money to go to space, and there's a lot of people who can't even afford eggs. What's the point?

        "article_text": "A new Apple TV+ series explores the life of the so-called \"King of Chefs and the Chef of Kings\" \u2013 shown as a wild enfant terrible in post-Revolutionary France who blazed a trail for future generations of cooks.\nIt's described as \"the story of the first celebrity chef\". The French language series Car\u00eame is a dramatisation of the life of Antonin Car\u00eame, who was born into poverty in pre-Revolutionary Paris around 1784. His talent would make him chef for the French diplomat Charles Talleyrand, the Emperor Napoleon, the future George IV of Britain, Tsar Alexander of Russia and the Baron de Rothschild. He also wrote celebrated cookbooks and introduced the Toque (the tall chef's hat), still in use today \u2013 giving birth to the very idea of the \"celebrity\" chef.\nIndeed, Benjamin Voisin, the actor playing Antonin Car\u00eame, believes that if the chef had been working in the 2020s, \"he'd have been the one with 100 million views on TikTok. That would be the equivalent of what he did at the time,\" he tells the BBC.\nAnd Voisin's portrayal of Car\u00eame feels modern; he plays him with a touch of the rock star as well as kitchen chef. He wears an earring, his clothes seem to owe more to the 1980s New Romantic movement than 19th-Century costume, and from his affairs with women to his lack of deference to his so-called superiors, he is what could be described (in French) as an enfant terrible. He is also confident, brash and authoritative in his kitchen \u2013 a manner that echoes 21st-Century celebrity chefs such as Gordon Ramsay.\u00a0\nThe series is inspired by a biography of Car\u00eame and his gastronomy by Ian Kelly, who also co-created the series with screenwriter Davide Serino. The historical figure of the young chef is actually described by Kelly in his book as a \"bookish innocent\" when he takes his first job, but Voisin's look in the series isn't too far from Kelly's description of Car\u00eame aged 25: \"He was handsome, his hair cut and tousled forward in the fashionably Byronic manner... he was described as slight, and a slight eater.\" Kelly also describes Car\u00eame as \"ambitious, solipsistic, even narcissistic\" as a person \u2013 although the Car\u00eame on screen risks much for those he loves.\nIndeed, perhaps inevitably, the series takes various liberties with the truth, also depicting Car\u00eame as a spy for his powerful masters, something there's no historical evidence for. The show's lead director Martin Bourboulon describes the added drama as \"the charm of fiction in the show\". The reality is that the real man didn't leave much information behind. As Kelly says in his biography, \"He [Car\u00eame] would disclose the minutiae of his professional life\u2026 and the menus, guests and ingredients that made up his working days. But about his personal life he revealed nothing.\"\nWhat is true to the era is the depiction of the aristocratic kitchens he worked in, his small army of staff, and their fevered preparations for royal banquets. He's seen in the series organising a meal for Napoleon Bonaparte, and in real life he was responsible for the Emperor's wedding cake. Car\u00eame's ability to sugar-sculpt led to extraordinary creations in the shape of classical lyres and Venetian gondolas, all carefully sketched out on paper first by the chef himself. But that wasn't all he was capable of, according to Paul Freedman, Professor of History at Yale University.\n\"He helped establish a routine for how kitchens were run,\" Freedman tells the BBC. \"He also defined dishes and the repertoire of sauces, what was considered to go with what food, what kind of garnishes would be standard, and the kind of multi-course dining that would come to be characteristic [of haute cuisine]. And as his original metier was confectionery and sugar sculpting, even having a centrepiece of sculpted food is owed to Car\u00eame.\"\u00a0\nWhile some of the real-life recipes in his cookbooks still sound mouthwatering (Kelly mentions an orange flower and pink champagne jelly), others, such as a stuffed boar's head, might seem strange to today. But Bourboulon says that, above all, he wanted to make the chef himself accessible to a modern audience.\nBourboulon, responsible for two successful film adaptations of Alexandre Dumas's historical novel The Three Musketeers, tells the BBC that he wanted to avoid \"the usual period drama style\" in this story.\n\"I really wanted to bring a bit of sexiness, rock 'n' roll attitude, and a modern twist for all the main characters, especially Car\u00eame,\" he says. \"And Benjamin Voisin is like this in real life.\"\nVoisin says their idea of the chef was that he had \"a Mick Jagger aspect to him. It's really what attracted me\".\n\"I love looking to the historical story of Car\u00eame, but this rock star element, that kind of Lenny Kravitz look he has, plus the idea the show gives about his attitude to life, is really important. Maybe that's why Martin came to me to talk about playing him. I also love the story of this young man trying to find his place in society.\"\nThe historical Car\u00eame's stellar career might well have given him a swagger; he was known as \"the King of Chefs and the Chef of Kings\". He's often credited as\u00a0a founder of French gastronomy and of\u00a0Grande Cuisine\u00a0(classic French cuisine which was at its most lavish during the 19th Century).\nHowever, according to\u00a0Paul Freedman, Professor of History at Yale University, he might not even be France's first celebrity chef. The Frenchman\u00a0Guillaume Tirel, known as \"Taillevent\", is famous for cooking for French kings during his lifetime (1310-95), and wrote a cookbook that still survives, The Viandier. Several\u00a0restaurants\u00a0still bear his name.\u00a0\nCar\u00eame's status is, he says, \"a celebrity chef of modern Europe, but still almost the last of a kind. He lived still in the time of the courts and chefs finding aristocratic patrons. He doesn't have a restaurant or interact with ordinary people, [and] his tremendous number of cookbooks aren't directed towards amateurs, but towards other chefs.\n\"So he's a transitional point to the purely modern celebrity chef, who are celebrities in the sense of media exposure, their television presence or just their ability to be a character and to run a restaurant.\"\nThe young Car\u00eame's turnaround in life was remarkable. Historian Ian Kelly describes him in his biography, Car\u00eame: The First Celebrity Chef (which inspired the series) as one of multiple children in a family from one of Paris's worst slums. By 1792, around the same time that\u00a0 the \"Reign of Terror\" would begin in the French Revolution (a period of state-sanctioned violence and executions) he had been abandoned by his parents but was taken in by a cook, and then apprenticed to a notable p\u00e2tissier, Sylvain Bailly. While still a very young man, he was hired by one of the most famous politicians of the Napoleonic era: Prince Charles Maurice Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord, known as Talleyrand.\nEven if the real Car\u00eame didn't dabble in espionage, Bourboulon points out that the chef's culinary brilliance would have been exploited as a display of power by his employers, and that food would have been as much a part of diplomacy during the early 19th Century as the modern state banquet is now.\n\"We know that Car\u00eame worked for Prince of Talleyrand and for Napoleon,\" he tells the BBC. \"It's so French to share the menu, the food, and use the quality of the food to help diplomatic relationships, and historically, they really did do this. There's an example at the end of the first episode, when Car\u00eame brings in a dessert for Napoleon and an English diplomat seated at the same table. And it's exactly how we imagine it would have been done during that time.\"\nPolitics isn't the only display of passion in the narrative either, or as Bourboulon says, \"Love is as important in the lives of French people, possibly more so\". The visuals directly link the food Car\u00eame cooks with sensuality; the camera lingers over the dishes, while red fruit drips over the title sequence. The series even starts with Car\u00eame licking cream off his love interest Henriette, played by Lyna Khoudri.\u00a0\n\"The parallel between the two types of pleasure is there in the series,\" Voisin says. \"Hands are involved in both cooking and the pleasures of the flesh, that's the connection.\"\nThe link between French food and sensuality are linked was certainly there in Car\u00eame's Paris. Ian Kelly describes how the post-Revolution capital \"had become the City of Light \u2013 and the capital of food\". The talk around the young Car\u00eame, he says, would have been \"of philosophy, fashion, food and sex: what the world has come to expect from Paris\".\nCar\u00eame's fame grew across Europe because of his celebrity clientele, but he also benefited from France's growing interest in gastronomy as culture (he was also a contemporary of gourmet Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, celebrated for writing about the art of eating) and the idea that French cuisine was superior because of the sensuality of its people, Paul Freedman says.\n\"I think it goes back to the image that France continues to have today as pleasure-loving, as sophisticated, not merely gorging themselves or getting drunk, but [possessed of] a kind of sensuality that is cultivated in the sense it's tasteful and distinguished,\" he tells the BBC.\nA French chef, he explains, would become necessary as a status symbol for many aristocrats of the 19th and 20th Century. \"One of the biggest examples in literature is PG Wodehouse writing about one of Bertie Wooster's aunts, Dahlia, living in terror that her temperamental French chef, Anatole, would quit.\"\nThe era of the celebrity restaurant chef was ushered in by Car\u00eame's growing fame, and the cookbooks he wrote, according to Professor Nathalie Cooke, the author of Tastes and Traditions: A Journey Through Menu History. Before the French Revolution, restaurants existed in limited form in Paris, but most served only soup. Their proliferation, Cooke tells the BBC, was born from \"economic disaster\".\u00a0\n\"Imagine you're an aspiring young chef and you're working in Paris in the late 18th Century, and they've beheaded Marie Antoinette, and they're getting rid of all those jobs that you've aspired to, cooking for royalty and the aristocracy,\" she says. \"That's why the restaurant culture grew: these very skilled chefs needed to make money and find an audience during economic turbulence, and in a post-royalty age. That's also why Car\u00eame wrote cookbooks: he was establishing himself in this new age of print media, but also, by addressing his work to other chefs, he was training a new breed of chef that was going to serve a larger audience instead of just royalty.\"\nA later French celebrity chef who dominated European food culture, Auguste Escoffier, (1846-1935) \u2013 who ran restaurants at the Ritz hotels in Europe, and at the Savoy Hotel and Carlton Club in London \u2013 \"is really Car\u00eame's heir,\" Cooke says.\n\"Escoffier really becomes famous when he decides to write down formal French cooking methods,\" she explains. \"He was able to achieve Car\u00eame's vision [of making recipes accessible to other chefs] in a way that Car\u00eame could not, because Car\u00eame was living in the age of the birth of restaurant culture, which was only just developing and only in Paris. Escoffier took it to London too.\" (Car\u00eame did spend time in England, serving the then Prince Regent, later George IV, but although he cooked for Tsar Alexander of Russia in Paris, he refused to move there and take a job.)\nThe emergence of TV and radio (and later internet) in the 20th Century has meant that the celebrity chef has become an international phenomenon, not just confined to those writing cookbooks or running restaurants, but open to all those with a knack for connecting with their audience. The most famous chef of the television era, Julia Child, (portrayed by Meryl Streep in the 2009 film Julie and Julia) was an American who had lived in Paris, and a devotee of French cooking. She even received the Antonin Car\u00eame Medal for excellence, although this is a US, not a French, honour.\nIn another nod to modernity, the young Car\u00eame in the series is also shown taking part in a chef's competition, normalised now by the growth of shows such as Iron Chef, MasterChef, and The Great British Bake Off (which streams internationally as The Great British Baking Show.) While the latter's \"Showstopper\" category might trace its ancestry back to Car\u00eame's own sugar sculptures of the 19th Century, the first modern professional event of this kind for chefs started in 1983, when another chef, Paul Bocuse, established the Bocuse D'Or, in Lyon, France.\nBut now that TV shows, podcasting and social media also allow skilled amateurs to become celebrities, Paul Freedman says there are characteristics of how he discerns a truly \"celebrity\" chef\u00a0\n\"My definition in books and articles that I've written is that the contemporary celebrity chef is distinguished by being regarded as a genius or an artist, [as opposed to] people who are [just] excellent at their craft. The Frenchman Paul Bocuse would be the first celebrity chef according to that definition, in the 1980s. Even before he invents dishes, he created the ethos of the chef as genius, and a version of a creative artist. So the celebrity chefs of our era are excellent at their craft, but Ferran Adri\u00e0, who was at El Bulli, or Ren\u00e9 Redzepi of Noma, or Heston Blumenthal in Britain are all [also] creative geniuses, or at least that's how they're presented.\"\u00a0\nThere is though, a direct line traceable from their creations, and their kitchens, to those of Antonin Car\u00eame \u2013 and not just because some of them might still wear a Toque. Bourboulon hopes that this new portrayal of the chef, nearly 200 years after he died, will give his legacy new attention.\u00a0\n\"Although Car\u00eame's name is quite famous in France, it could be even more famous, I think,\" he says. \"I would love people to rediscover, or just discover, what he did, how this young man brought all his talents to the tables of these powerful men like Napoleon. His life is a really exciting thing to mix together \u2013 food, love and politics.\"\u00a0\nCar\u00eame premieres globally on Apple TV+ from April 30, 2025.\n--\nIf you liked this story\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X, and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Marks and Spencer (M&S) customers have been telling the BBC of their frustration as disruption caused by the cyber attack which has hit the retailer continues into another trading week.\nThe incident - which it disclosed last Monday - has caused delayed parcels, paused online orders and suspended gift card payments, and has seen the retailer take down several parts of its operations over the last few days.\nIt has yet to disclose the nature of the cyber attack or when it expects operations to return to normal.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nEngland survive France comeback to win Grand Slam by a single point\nSaturday at Allianz Stadium, Twickenham saw a thrilling 43-42 spectacle between England and France for the Women's Six Nations title.\nJohn Mitchell's side managed to hold on for victory to secure their fourth consecutive Grand Slam and seventh title in a row.\nThe competition had the finale it needed, but it also remained predictable.\nIt was the fourth time in a row that both France and England played in the final round with the Grand Slam on the line.\nThe decider may live up to the hype, with three out of those four games finishing within a score, but the gap to the rest of the teams remains vast.\nNot since Ireland's triumph a decade ago has there been a tournament winner other than the Red Roses or Les Bleues.\nWould a change to the format improve the competitiveness of the tournament?\nThe contenders to derail England's home World Cup\nIs the Women's Six Nations competitive enough?\nResilient England finally get test they needed\nEngland coach Mitchell to stay past home World Cup\nIn 2022, the tournament fixture list changed so England and France were guaranteed to play each other in the final round.\nThis differs to the men's Six Nations, won by France in March, which has a different fixture schedule every year.\nThe idea was to keep Grand Slam interest alive by holding back the likely title decider.\nSuccess has come, with final fixtures between Ireland, Scotland, Italy and Wales also adding interest as they battle for places and to avoid the Wooden Spoon.\nBut the competitiveness of their games against the top two is a growing concern.\nFrance, the last team to beat England in the Six Nations in 2018, have been less dominant, but have still recorded a full house of wins against the other teams in each of the past four championships.\nEngland used 34 players this campaign and despite regularly rotating scored 33 tries and conceded only five before the Grand Slam decider.\nA reason for the gulf in quality comes from the fact England awarded 28 full-time professional contracts in 2019 and that level of investment left the other nations behind.\nWales began handing out deals at the start of 2022, followed by Ireland in August 2022, while Scotland announced their professional plans at the end of that year.\nBefore the 2023 Six Nations, Italy announced 22 professional contracts had been given out to their players.\nScotland defeated Ireland on Saturday to end their campaign on a high, with Ireland's highlight coming in a hammering of Italy. Italy ran France close and finished with a thumping win over Wales to show signs of improvement.\nUnder new head coach Sean Lynn, Wales lost every game to pick up the Wooden Spoon, but will be hopeful of improvement after the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) this month confirmed a revamp of its top women's teams to develop the pathway and depth of talent.\nWhen asked on the BBC's Rugby Union Weekly how long it would take for a different winner of the Six Nations, Scotland head coach Bryan Easson replied: \"It will take time but I genuinely believe someone else will eventually win it.\"\nHis side suffered heavy defeats by both England and France, who have much wider player pools because of investment into their domestic leagues, with the Premiership Women's Rugby league going from strength to strength.\n\"The gap will get closer,\" added Easson. \"But it will be a little bit longer than everybody expects in terms of professionalism.\n\"We've only been professional now for 18 months. Wales, Ireland, Italy, and ourselves are all pretty much in the same boat.\"\nThis video can not be played\nOops! Six Nations trophy falls apart again\nTo avoid too many one-sided scorelines, BBC Sport's Sara Orchard, speaking on Rugby Union Weekly, suggested a two-tier system where teams are ranked before the championship.\nThe idea was backed by former England fly-half Katy Daley-McLean, who lost titles to France and Ireland during her playing days, with the 2014 World Cup-winner saying the tournament must be \"brave\" in trying something new., external\nThe Rugby Football Union's director of women's game Alex Teasdale told BBC that the RFU would \"listen to any proposals\".\n\"I think Six Nations as a tournament across men's and women's is steeped in that kind of background in history and its format is quite special,\" she said.\n\"It would probably take quite a lot to change that.

        "summary": "Is it time for change in the Women's Six Nations?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, England survive France comeback to win Grand Slam by a single pointAlastair TelferBBC Sport journalistPublished29 April 2025, 09:39 BST192 CommentsUpdated 3 hours agoSaturday at Allianz Stadium, Twickenham saw a thrilling 43-42 spectacle between England and France for the Women's Six Nations title.John Mitchell's side managed to hold on for victory to secure their fourth consecutive Grand Slam and seventh title in a row.The competition had the finale it needed, but it also remained predictable.It was the fourth time in a row that both France and England played in the final round with the Grand Slam on the line.The decider may live up to the hype, with three out of those four games finishing within a score, but the gap to the rest of the teams remains vast.Not since Ireland's triumph a decade ago has there been a tournament winner other than the Red Roses or Les Bleues.Would a change to the format improve the competitiveness of the tournament?The contenders to derail England's home World CupPublished1 day agoIs the Women's Six Nations competitive enough?Resilient England finally get test they neededPublished2 days agoEngland coach Mitchell to stay past home World CupPublished3 hours agoSuccess with previous changeIn 2022, the tournament fixture list changed so England and France were guaranteed to play each other in the final round.This differs to the men's Six Nations, won by France in March, which has a different fixture schedule every year.The idea was to keep Grand Slam interest alive by holding back the likely title decider.Success has come, with final fixtures between Ireland, Scotland, Italy and Wales also adding interest as they battle for places and to avoid the Wooden Spoon.But the competitiveness of their games against the top two is a growing concern.France, the last team to beat England in the Six Nations in 2018, have been less dominant, but have still recorded a full house of wins against the other teams in each of the past four championships.England used 34 players this campaign and despite regularly rotating scored 33 tries and conceded only five before the Grand Slam decider.A reason for the gulf in quality comes from the fact England awarded 28 full-time professional contracts in 2019 and that level of investment left the other nations behind.Wales began handing out deals at the start of 2022, followed by Ireland in August 2022, while Scotland announced their professional plans at the end of that year.Before the 2023 Six Nations, Italy announced 22 professional contracts had been given out to their players.Scotland defeated Ireland on Saturday to end their campaign on a high, with Ireland's highlight coming in a hammering of Italy. Italy ran France close and finished with a thumping win over Wales to show signs of improvement.Under new head coach Sean Lynn, Wales lost every game to pick up the Wooden Spoon, but will be hopeful of improvement after the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) this month confirmed a revamp of its top women's teams to develop the pathway and depth of talent.When asked on the BBC's Rugby Union Weekly how long it would take for a different winner of the Six Nations, Scotland head coach Bryan Easson replied: \"It will take time but I genuinely believe someone else will eventually win it. Six Nations trophy falls apart againTwo-tier system & triple-header finals dayTo avoid too many one-sided scorelines, BBC Sport's Sara Orchard, speaking on Rugby Union Weekly, suggested a two-tier system where teams are ranked before the championship.The idea was backed by former England fly-half Katy Daley-McLean, who lost titles to France and Ireland during her playing days, with the 2014 World Cup-winner saying the tournament must be \"brave\" in trying something new., externalThe Rugby Football Union's director of women's game Alex Teasdale told BBC that the RFU would \"listen to any proposals\". \"The proposed idea would follow a similar format to the 2021 Six Nations, which was spilt into two pools because of Covid restrictions.Orchard's idea would see the number one ranked team play home and away fixtures against those ranked second and third, with the second pool - ranked three to six - following the same structure.Play-offs then follow to determine the final standings, with the top team in pool one facing the second team in their group for the Six Nations title.The side who finished third in pool one would play against first team in pool two for a place in the following year's top group, while fifth and sixth see who picks up the Wooden Spoon.All those games would take place on a triple-header finals day in the same venue that is rotated around a different nation every year. \"Being the women's version of the Six Nations means you don't have to do it the same as the men,\" former Wales captain Philippa Tuttiett told BBC Radio 5 Live.",

Maybe their best ever achievement,\" said Davis.\nFifteen years ago, Davis defeated Mark King 10-9 in the Crucible first round, won 13-11 against a then-34-year-old Higgins, the reigning champion, before losing 13-5 to eventual winner Neil Robertson in the last eight.\n\"It was a fantastic buzz, I maybe ran out of belief,\" recalled Davis.\n\"Hopefully they don't do that. They are much more in touch with the top part of the game than I was.\"\nMark Williams and John Higgins at the China Open in March 2006\nThe trio's achievements are legendary. O'Sullivan has seven world titles, Higgins four and Williams three.\nIf any of them lift the trophy on Monday, 5 May, they would become the oldest winner in the modern era, breaking O'Sullivan's record when he won it three years ago, aged 46.\nThirty-three years ago they were all hungry, driven, talented teenagers with the desire to reach the top.\nWilliams described how he first met Higgins at the final of an event in 1990, when they were both 15.\n\"We played in the final and he beat me,\" said the Welshman. \"It was live on TV and he beat me 6-1, he had five grand for a win, I had three grand for runner-up.\n\"We then played in the British Under-16s in Birmingham and I thrashed him 4-0 after 50 minutes and I got 200 quid so I was a week late.\n\"That was the first time I really remembered John as it was me and O'Sullivan playing in all the junior events when we were 13 and 14.\"\nWilliams and Higgins have their own Crucible history and have met five times, with four victories for Williams, including an 18-16 success in an epic showdown in the 2018 final.\n\"That world final was one of the best games I've ever been involved in and people say it was the best final ever,\" said Williams.\nWilliams hopes eye surgery in June will help to extend his snooker career\nKen Doherty, the 1997 world champion, played against the 'Class of 92' throughout his career and felt this match was \"the tie of the round\".\n\"They've been at the top of the game since 1992, 33 years, and are still at the top and still producing,\" the Irishman said.\n\"As you get older it becomes a lot more difficult as players like me, Stephen Hendry, Alan McManus, Peter Ebdon have all found out. It's hard to cope in terms of tension, intensity and also to be able to devote your life to the game.\n\"You become a father, a family man and it's hard to dedicate themselves to the game but they still have the appetite, willingness and hunger and that's an incredible talent as well.\n\"I've been logging heads with them for 30 years. I've beaten them all but also lost to them all in big finals. I just had great times playing them and you used to relish it as it was a great test of your own game.\"\nDoherty, who is part of the BBC TV team for the competition, felt the atmosphere would be electric.\n\"When you see them coming into the Crucible for their match they will get a standing ovation as they did in the Masters,\" he added. \"We might not see the kind of these three again so we have to enjoy them while we can. They've given the sport great entertainment, great matches and are still delivering.\"\nShaun Murphy tipped Judd Trump, who beat him 13-10 on Monday, to win the title but thought the Williams-Higgins clash would be \"fabulous for the sport\".\nHe added: \"The Class of 92 are three of the best players we've ever seen and it's wonderful we still get to watch them.\n\"None of them would be here if they didn't want to be, they obviously love it enough to put themselves through it.\"\nRonnie O'Sullivan became the oldest man in the modern era to become world champion with his victory over Judd Trump in the 2022 final\nWorld number one Trump will play the winner of Williams-Higgins in the semi-final if he triumphs in his own quarter-final against Luca Brecel.\nTrump felt the veteran trio would continue to feature at the top level for years to come.\n\"They inspired me a little bit, especially Ronnie and John when I was younger,\" said Trump. \"Ronnie was someone I really looked up to. They're miles away from retiring and not far from their absolute best.\n\"When I played Williams in the semi-finals (when Trump won a final-frame decider for a 17-16 win in 2022) I've never seen him play like that.\n\"These three could be here when they're 65 if they wanted to be.\"",

        "article_text": "Famous for its adorable quokkas, Rottnest Island has become a global favourite. But beyond the selfies lies a rich, complex story of culture, conservation and community.\nOn a recent visit to Perth, I mentioned to a local that I was heading to Rottnest Island the next day. She sighed wistfully. \"I love it there,\" she said. \"You're going to love it too. It has a special kind of magic \u2013 the kind of place where you kick off your shoes the minute you arrive. Everything slows down and you can breathe a little more deeply.\"\nI already felt that Perth was a little like that \u2013 at least, life there felt slower and less frenzied than in my hometown of Melbourne on Australia's east coast \u2013 but I smiled back, not really knowing what she meant.\nHowever, she was right. Rottnest Island, a peaceful 19-sq-km isle off the coast of Western Australia, is, in fact, magical. The spell was cast as soon as our ferry left the mainland, skimming over the Indian Ocean. Humpback whales breached nearby, sending jets of sea spray into the air and flipping their tails as if in welcome. The sky was clear with the promise of a perfect day to come.\nJust 19km and 30 minutes later, I stepped off the ferry into another world. Rottnest Island has been famously car-free since 1931, and those more in the know than me immediately jumped onto bikes they'd brought with them or wandered off to hire one from Pedal and Flipper, said to be the largest bike hire place in the southern hemisphere.\nKids zoomed around in packs, dodging groups of tourists ambling through the main settlement. Some people had fishing rods under one arm; others, surfboards strapped to their bikes. Families stopped at the bakery for a flat white and vanilla slice before heading off to explore the island's 63 beaches and 20 bays, many with evocative names like Little Parakeet Bay and Cathedral Rocks that in no way came close to capturing the grandeur of the scenery in real life.\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nThere was no urban noise, no traffic and nothing to worry about. It was idyllic and glorious and everything I imagined a nostalgic care-free (and car-free) island holiday to be.\nThe isle has long been a cherished playground for generations of Western Australian families. \"Rottnest is very, very special, particularly to the people of Perth, like me,\" explained Paul Campbell, a volunteer guide I met not long after I arrived. Campbell spent his childhood holidays on Rottnest and now returns regularly to tell people about his beloved island. \"There are no multi-storey high-rise hotels here,\" he added. \"There is no private ownership. If you ever tried to put a multi-storey-anything here for wealthy people, you would be absolutely torn to shreds. We are very protective of our beautiful island.\"\nOnce a well-kept secret from the rest of the world, in recent years Rottnest has become one of Australia's most Instagrammed destinations, thanks to a certain fuzzy-faced resident: the quokka.\nIn 2013, Huffington Post dubbed the quokka \"the happiest animal in the world\", and the internet responded in glee. Quokkas \u2013 tiny marsupials found only in this small pocket of south-western Australia \u2013 seem to smile for selfies in a way that feels almost staged. Tennis star Roger Federer to actress Margot Robbie were among the first celebrities to pose with the infamous animal, helping spark a wave of global attention. Then in 2019 came Chris Hemsworth's now-iconic #QuokkaSelfie\u00a0with Matt Damon, which racked up more than four million likes. \"Rotto\", as locals call it, became the hottest ticket in town, transforming from local secret to global sensation. According to the Rottnest Island Authority, annual visitor numbers have nearly tripled in the last decade, peaking at more than 800,000 at last count.\nWhat's in a name?\nThe island was first sighted by Dutch explorers in the 17th Century and was named by one such captain, Wallem de Vlamingh, who stayed on the island for six days and mistook the quokkas for rats. He referred the island as \"'t elyandt 't rottenest\" which means \"rat's nest island\" in Dutch \u2013 although by all accounts he was also captivated by the pristine scenery and referred to it as \"paradise on Earth\" in his journal.\nRottnest, once simple and sleepy, has had to quickly grow up to meet the demands of all these domestic and international tourists. That meant creating more accommodation than the basic cabins and camping that existed, as well as better food and activity options. And what it has done is exemplary, transforming into a model of eco-conscious tourism without losing its soul.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs Campbell put it: \"When I was nine years old, the [cultural] experience that I had on Rottnest is not that much different to what you're going to experience today.\"\u00a0\nYou won't find any private cars here \u2013 just a few vehicles for rangers and staff \u2013\u00a0so most everyone gets about on two wheels or two feet (or the odd skateboard, scooter or Segway), having to occasionally dodge quokkas lounging on the road. Accommodation ranges from beachside cottages with bike racks out front to backpacker dorms to relaxed boutique hotels. While many tourists come on a day trip from Perth, it's much better to stay the night: quokkas are nocturnal and will spend most of the day sleeping under shady bushes. In addition, most day-trippers leave by 16:30, at which point the island truly comes into its own.\n\"Someone once said to me that you can feel the island exhale [when they leave],\" said Erin Gallagher from the Rottnest Island Authority. \"I just thought it was the most beautiful thing \u2013 and it's so true.\"\nI was staying at Discovery Resorts, the island's first eco resort, whose 83 glamping tents are shaded by gum trees and Aleppo pines, tucked behind Pinky Beach in the sand dunes. My tent had no aircon or TV, just a ceiling fan for airflow and the sound of the ocean through canvas walls. It was perfect in its simplicity. \"[The resort] is designed to immerse guests into the environment,\" explained Krizza Miclat, the resort's sales and event manager. \"A lot of the infrastructure is elevated on steel poles to ensure that we're not damaging the sand dunes. So, if ever we were to pick up and move, we haven't impacted it too much.\"\nIn fact, nearly everything here works in harmony with the natural environment. Renewable energy is provided by the Indian Ocean's sea breezes and the strong Western Australian sun; while drinking water is drawn from the sweeping white semi-circle of\u00a0Longreach Bay, desalinated and filtered. Marine sanctuary zones below water mean world-class snorkelling and diving, and an island nursery grows native plants from locally sourced cuttings and seeds. In 2023, a new management plan reaffirmed Rottnest's commitment to sustainability, conservation and culture.\u00a0\n\"We're always striving to improve,\" said Gallagher. \"Our target is to achieve 75% renewables. There's even an app where anyone can see how much power the island is generating in real time.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A day out with Bluey: Australia's new experience brings the Heeler family to life\n\u2022 Bindi Irwin's top outdoor adventures in Australia\n\u2022 The hike making Australia a better place \nIn the spirit of low-impact activities, I decided to take a Segway tour around the undulating landscape, rolling along the endless beaches, gliding past the cluster of salt lakes in the north-eastern corner and looking out for whales on the island's Humpback Highway. I steered past the scrub heath that covers much of the island, breathing in its signature salty-sweet smell and dodging prickle lily and feather speargrass. The island is just 11km long and 4.5km at its widest point, but its biodiversity is vast \u2013 a Class A reserve where everything from the blue-flowered Rottnest daisy to the long, black king skink I saw on the side of a trail is protected.\nBut not all scenes here are so idyllic.\nIn 1838, Rottnest was turned into an Aboriginal prison. Over the next century, more than 4,000 Indigenous men and boys were incarcerated here for \"crimes\" that they often didn't know they'd committed. Some were as young as eight years old. Many never returned home.\nPlan your trip:\nGet there: Regular ferries are operated by Sealink and Rottnest Express (leaving from Perth CBD and Fremantle) and Rottnest Fast Ferries (leaving from Hillarys Boat Harbour, north of Perth CBD).\nWhen to go: Summer (December-February)\u00a0is the most popular (and crowded) time, but September-April is still warm enough for water-based activities. If you want to celebrate quokka joeys taking their first hops, visit 21-22 September 2025 for Little Quokka's Big Birthday Weekend.\nWhere to stay: Book an eco-glamping tent at Discovery Resorts or stay at the newly opened The Lodge Wadjemup.\nEat: Frankies for pizzas and salads; Sunset snacks and drinks at Pinky's; The Lane for craydogs (a spicy crayfish-stuffed roll); Isola for more upmarket fare.\nDo: Hire a bike, snorkel and mask from Pedal and Flipper to explore the island at your own pace. Head to Garden Lake at sunset for epic quokka sightings. Take a guided Segway tour to learn about the island's history as you explore.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt's a dark legacy that the island is only beginning to address. As I wobbled my Segway back to the main settlement, we passed what looked like an ordinary field. But, my tour guide explained, it is a place of immense significance: the\u00a0Wadjemup Aboriginal Burial Ground\u00a0where 373 unmarked graves of prisoners were uncovered, with the first discoveries made during construction work in the 1970s. Shockingly, holidaymakers continued to camp on the site until the practice was finally banned in 2007.\n\"It was the largest number of Aboriginal deaths in custody in history in Australia,\" explained volunteer guide Anne Yardley, when I met her later at the island's Wadjemup Museum. \"And from the biggest number of Aboriginal nations.\"\nBut Indigenous connection to the island stretches far beyond this painful chapter. Long before European settlement, the island was part of the mainland, and archaeological evidence shows that the Noongar people lived on and used the island for tens of thousands of years. Its Indigenous name \u2013 Wadjemup \u2013 means \"place of spirits\".\n\"This was a significant place for Indigenous people,\" Campbell told me. \"Ceremonies were held here. But about 6,500 years ago, sea levels rose and this patch of land became an island. The Aboriginal people stayed on the mainland and it was left alone for thousands of years\u2026 all through Christianity, the Roman Empire, the Egyptian Empire\u2026 until Europeans arrived.\"\nToday, Wadjemup is working to tell this fuller story. The small but compelling Wadjemup Museum has been revamped; while walking trails such as the 45km\u00a0Wadjemup Bidi\u00a0\u2013 made up of five connected trails and built in part by volunteers \u2013 connects visitors to historical and cultural sites across the landscape, with interpretive signage and installations by Noongar artists. The\u00a0Wadjemup Project, an Aboriginal-led initiative, focusses on acknowledging Wadjemup's history of Aboriginal incarceration and the memorialisation of former prison sites.\nVolunteers play a huge part, too, from the Winnit Club, formed in 1931 by a group of regular campers, to the yellow-shirted Rottnest Volunteer Guides. These and other groups collectively contribute more than 40,000 hours a year to maintaining the island, and their dedication to preserving and sharing its stories speaks volumes about how deeply the island is loved.\n\"There's this balancing act between having enough people to make the place work financially, but not so many people coming here that you lose the reason to come,\" said Campbell. \"It is a very, very special place.\"\u00a0\nI certainly felt that on my visit. One moment I was riding my bike past salt lakes ringed with grey saltbush and coastal pigface, the next watching irresistibly cute quokkas hop around at sunset. I snorkelled an underwater trail through turquoise shallows, gazed onto shipwrecks just offshore and had sunset drinks looking out to incredible ocean vistas. I even tried to get my own quokka selfie, respecting the signs not to feed or touch them in any way but to keep my distance and let them come to me. I laughed as I tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to get both myself and a quokka fully in shot, and was reminded of something Gallagher had said to me about the smiling-faced marsupial: \"Why wouldn't you be happy if this is where you lived?\"\nIt was more than just a line \u2013 it was a truth that settled into the bones of the island. Rottnest may be famous now, but it hasn't lost what makes it feel like a local secret: the sense that once you arrive, you can slow down, breathe deeply and kick off your shoes for a while.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Sir Tony Blair has called for a major rethink of net zero policies, arguing that limiting energy consumption and fossil fuel production is \"doomed to fail\".\nIn a new report, the former Labour prime minister says voters \"feel they're being asked to make financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle when they know the impact on global emissions is minimal\".\nHe does not call for Labour to halt its push to decarbonise the UK economy - but says all governments need to rethink their approach, as it is not working.\nThe Tories - who have joined Reform UK in opposing net zero emissions by 2050 - urged Labour to end the \"mad dash\" to this goal - but Downing Street said it would not be changing course.\nIn its report The Climate Paradox: Why We Need to Reset Action on Climate Change, the Tony Blair Institute argues that global institutions such as COP and the UN have failed to make sufficient progress in halting climate change.\nAt the same time, it argues, the public have lost faith in climate policies because the promised green jobs and economic growth have failed to materialise, thanks in part to global instability and the Covid pandemic.\nWriting in the foreword, Sir Tony says: \"Though most people will accept that climate change is a reality caused by human activity, they're turning away from the politics of the issue because they believe the proposed solutions are not founded on good policy.\"\nHe says \"any strategy based on either 'phasing out' fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail\".\nHe also warns against the \"alarmist\" tone of the debate on climate change, which he  says is \"riven with irrationality\".\nThe report calls for the rapid deployment of carbon capture and storage technology, greater use of AI to make energy grids efficient and investment in small scale nuclear reactors.\nIt also argues for a greater focus on climate change adaptation measures such as flood defences and a new international push to persuade China and India to cut emissions. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight, the author of the report dismissed claims that the foundation was rejecting net zero targets, saying it \"is a paper that is about increased climate ambition\".\nLindy Fursman, director of climate and energy policy at the Tony Blair Institute, said:  \"We are certainly not rejecting net zero targets. The paper is really clear that we need to keep these because of the certainty they provide for businesses.\"\nMs Fursman said the report was \"pointing out that while many economies are doing well, we need to do more, particularly in the global picture because global emissions continue to rise\".\nDowning Street said it would not be changing course on net zero - and rejected Sir Tony's suggestions that the public was no longer prepared to make sacrifices to meet green goals.\n\"We will reach net zero in a way that treads lightly on people's lives, not telling them how to live or behave,\" said the prime minister's official spokesman.\n\"Net zero is the economic opportunity of the 21st century, one that has the potential to reignite our industrial heartlands, create good jobs for the future and lower bills in the long term.\"\nThe government claims its net zero strategy is already delivering results, with \u00a343bn of private investment since last July and that its climate policies \"now support around 600,000 jobs across the UK\".\nLabour sources are also pushing back against claims Sir Keir Starmer is going cold on the net zero agenda, pointing to a speech he made last week in which he said the clean energy mission was \"in the DNA of my government\".\nReacting in the Commons to Sir Tony's comments in the report, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said he agreed \"with a lot of what it says\" particularly on carbon capture and storage and AI \"which the government are doing\".\nBut Labour's opponents were quick to seize on the former prime minister's words.\nWriting on social media, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: \"Even Tony Blair now says the push for Net Zero has become 'irrational' and 'hysterical'. We are winning the argument!\"\nConservative acting shadow energy secretary, Andrew Bowie said the government needed to \"urgently  change course\".\n\"It seems even Tony Blair has come to the realisation that Keir Starmer and the Labour Party's mad dash to net zero by 2050 is simply not feasible, or sustainable,\" he added.\nGreen Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said: \"Blair is wrong, both morally and pragmatically. The British public understands the need for decisive climate action and expects politicians to lead in delivering this action.\"\nSir Tony's intervention has also been met with dismay by Labour-supporting environmental groups. \nOne campaigner told the BBC: \"This is an oddly public and oddly-timed intervention that would usually be made by someone struggling for access. \n\"The Labour government are getting on with many of the policies outlined in the report because they know this is popular with people, especially the voting coalition they need to maintain for the next election. \n\"But adopting the anti-net-zero framing of [Tory leader Kemi] Badenoch and Reform is out of step with where the public are on this issue and will not help Labour.\"\nA Liberal Democrats spokesperson said: \"There is no doubt that the last Conservative government set us back by failing to invest in cheap, clean energy and home insulation. \n\"But that makes it all the more important that we act with urgency now, to bring down energy bills and emissions, free ourselves from reliance on Putin's gas, and restore the UK's role as a world-leader in the clean technology of the future and the jobs that go with it.\"\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.",

You can see the code is written by him,\" says Maria, the 21-year-old tech coach leading the class.\nNext to them, 14-year-old Eric and Narek are showing their smart greenhouse model that monitors temperature and controls fans automatically through a mobile app.\nOther children are enthusiastically showcasing their inventions: games, robots, apps and smart home projects.\nEleven-year-old Arakel is holding his cardboard model of a house with a retractable clothesline.\n\"I have made my mother's work easy, one part of the device is set on the roof, and another is a motor,\" he says. \"When it rains the line goes under the roof to keep the clothes dry.\"\nThese young inventors have been attending engineering lab classes where they learn programming, robotics, coding, 3D modelling and more.\nThe programme started in 2014, and is called Armath, which translates into English as \"root\". Today there are 650 Armath labs in schools across Armenia.\nThe initiative was established by a business organisation called the Union of Advanced Technology Enterprises (UATE), which represents more than 200 high-tech Armenian companies.\n\"The vision is that we want to see Armenia becoming a tech centre powerhouse that delivers utmost values to Armenia and to the world,\" says Sarkis Karapetyan, the chief executive of UATE.\nIn his spacious, open-plan office in Yerevan he says that there are now around 4,000 tech companies in Armenia.\nArmath is part of the UATE's education and workforce development programme. Mr Karapetyan says the programme is the most successful public-private partnership in the country.\n\"We raise capital expenditure from the private sector, we go to the schools and establish Armath labs, we donate the equipment,\" he says. \"And the government, the education ministry gives us a budget of $2m (\u00a31.5m) annually to pay the salaries of the coaches.\"\nThere are now more than 600 coaches, and 17,000 active students.\n\"The goal is to have 5,000 of the most talented kids decide to become engineers every year,\" says Mr Karapetyan.\nArmenia is a landlocked country of 2.7 million people, the smallest in the South Caucasus region, and its borders with neighbouring Azerbaijan and Turkey have been shut for decades due to unresolved territorial disputes.\nUnlike its neighbours, Armenia does not have natural resources or access to the sea. But throughout the Soviet era it had been a centre of mathematics and computer science.\nIn 1956 the Yerevan Scientific Research Institute of Mathematical Machines was established in Armenia and by 1960 it had developed two first generation computers.\nToday, the country is tapping into its legacy with the ambition to transform itself into the tech powerhouse of the Caucasus.\nAnd there has been some success already. Picsart, a AI-powered photo and video editing website and app, was launched in Armenia in 2011. Today the company of the same name, which has dual headquarters in Yerevan and Miami, is valued at $1.5bn.\nKrisp, which makes audio-processing software, and Service Titan, which provides business software, are other Armenian success stories.\nMeanwhile, an annual report says that Armenia is the best country in the Caucuses region in which to launch a company, putting it in 57th place globally. This compares with Georgia in 70th position, and Azerbaijan in 80th. \nA critical factor in boosting Armenia's tech development is the nation's global diaspora \u2013 some 75% of the world's estimated Armenians, and people of Armenian descent, live elsewhere.\nThis worldwide community provides important connections, especially in the US tech industry. In the US there are as many as 1.6 million people of Armenian ancestry, centred on California.\nSamvel Khachikyan, is director of programs at SmartGate, a venture capital firm based in both California and Armenia that focuses on tech investments.\nHe says that if you look at the top 500 companies in the US, \"for sure you'll find at least one or two Armenians\" in the boardroom or one management level below.\nMr Khachikyan explains how his company helps Armenian entrepreneurs set up operations in the US.\n\"Imagine an Armenian start-up, two young people deciding to go to the US to try to operate there, they have no connections, no knowledge about the culture how it works.\n\"It's gonna be hard, very hard. We are helping them, it's like the launch of the rocket, the first couple of seconds is the hardest.\"\nSmartGate takes Armenian founders to Silicon Valley and Los Angeles for intensive networking with top US companies and investors.\nBut many Armenian start-ups first test their products in their home market.\nIrina Ghazaryan, is the founder of an app called Dr Yan that is changing how Armenians access healthcare by enabling them to more easily book appointments with doctors.\nMs Ghazaryan was previously working in product and web design when, helped by the fact she comes from a family of doctors, she identified a gap in the market. \"Patients couldn't find the right doctors, and doctors were suffering from endless calls.\"\nThe app operates on a subscription model, with doctors paying to be listed on the platform, and there are plans to expand.\n\"We are growing at least 25% revenue month by month,\" adds Ms Ghazaryan. \"We are almost break-even in Armenia and that gives us strength to start expanding to other markets, like Uzbekistan.\"\nArmenia's tech ecosystem received an unexpected boost in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Thousands of Russian IT specialists left their country, and many chose to settle in Armenia.\nMeanwhile, US chipmaking giant Nvidia moved its Russian office to Armenia.\nVasily is a Russian IT consultant who relocated to Armenia in 2023. \"Armenia was the most friendly to people from Russia in order to help them move, adapt and so on,\" he says.\nHe estimates that that the Russian IT community in Armenia now totals 5,000 to 8,000 people. This influx has said to have filled crucial skill gaps in Armenia's tech sector, in areas such as data processing, cybersecurity, and financial technologies.\nYet Vasily says that Armenia can be expensive and the country needs to reduce the tax burden on IT firms if it wants them to stay in the country.\nHowever, overall optimism remains high about Armenia's tech future. Samvel Khachikyan expects the sector to boom. He points to Service Titan, which floated on the New York Stock Exchange last December, and is now worth more than $10bn.",

        "article_text": "One week after a devastating militant attack near the mountain resort of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, the town wears a look of quiet desolation, although tourists have begun trickling back in small numbers.\nThe main high street, abandoned by visitors last week - with shops shuttered and hotels completely emptied out - is seeing fleeting signs of life again.\nLast Tuesday, militants opened fire on people, mostly tourists, who were visiting Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5 km) from Pahalgam, often described as the \"Switzerland of India\".\nThe attack was one of the deadliest in recent years, devastating the lives of many families and sparking widespread anger in India.\nIn the days since, tensions between India and Pakistan, which both claim Kashmir in full but administer it only in part, have significantly risen, with each side announcing retaliatory measures against the other.\nThere is now growing speculation about whether there will be a military response from Delhi. The government in Kashmir has closed down over half the tourist destinations in the valley, as authorities review the security situation and carry out search operations. \nWhile violence has often broken out in the region, with militants targeting security forces and civilians since an insurgency broke out in 1989, the brazen killing of tourists has been rare and has shocked local businesses and tourists alike.\nTourism is a mainstay of the economy in places like Pahalgam and there's now fear that many livelihoods might be irrevocably hit.\nAt a \"selfie point\" outside town, overlooking lush meadows and a rushing river, Akshay Solanki, a tourist from Mumbai, said there was \"panic\" among his group of travellers on the day of the attack. But they had decided to continue with their journey because flights back home had become unaffordable.\nOther tourists said constant reassurances from the locals and security forces had given them a sense of comfort. A driver who had brought visitors from the capital, Srinagar, told BBC Hindi that he was pleading with those visiting not to \"distance\" themselves from Kashmir.\nAfter a washout three days, shawl-seller Rafi Ahmed said he'd managed to sell just a few pieces and feared for his livelihood in the long run if tourists stopped coming.\nAmong those exhorting tourists to come to Pahalgam was Bollywood actor Atul Kulkarni, who visited the town days after the attack. He told BBC Hindi, if the message from the militants was \"don't come here, we should respond by coming in even larger numbers\".\n\"Don't cancel bookings, cancel your other plans and come here,\" Kulkarni said.\nBut uncertainty and apprehension loom large in Pahalgam and it could take several years before a sense of normalcy is restored, local business owners and residents told the BBC.\nIndian authorities have launched combing operations in the region, detaining hundreds of people and destroying homes belonging to alleged militants.\nIndia and Pakistan have also reportedly exchanged small arms fire across the border.\nThe escalation in tensions is keeping tourists and business owners on tenterhooks.\nIndian authorities have often claimed Kashmir witnessed a period of relative peace after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked its autonomous status in 2019. Ahead of India's general elections in 2024, Modi hailed the \"freedom\" that had come to the region, saying Kashmir was touching new heights of development because it was breathing freely.\nTop leaders pointed to high tourism numbers - some 23 million last year and millions more in the years before - as proof of a big boom after years of unquiet. But last week's attacks have, yet again, shattered any idea of lasting peace in the restive valley.\n\"This [attack] is a blot on us\u2026How we wipe it off is a long-term concern,\" Rafi Ahmed Meer, a politician from Pahalgam told BBC Hindi, urging tourists to remember that it was local Kashmiris who rushed to help after the attacks, even picking up bodies.\nThe cancellation rate for trips planned from cities like Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru are very high, Abhishek Sansare, a Mumbai-based tour operator told the BBC. A group of prominent tour operators said in a press conference that some 80-90% of all bookings had been cancelled.\n\"After the attack, there's a sense that a war is looming. So tourists are confused about what to do,\" said Sansare. \"Some of those who've already made advance bookings are going ahead with their plans. I'm also going there on the 2nd of next month.\"\nThe attack on tourists is also likely to weigh on Kashmir in other ways. The inauguration of the world's highest single-arch rail bridge, set to connect the Kashmir valley with the rest of India was slated to happen this month after several delays.\nThe timeline for the opening of this showpiece project now \"looks uncertain\", a source told the BBC.\nThe region was just beginning to attract fledgling business investments, but those too could dry up if hostilities go up.\n\"People who were investing in logistics and other sectors will now think twice because of the security environment. Until they regain some confidence, I don't foresee investments coming to Kashmir immediately,\" said Ubair Shah, who owns one of Kashmir's largest cold storage facilities for fruits in Pulwama district in south Kashmir.\nAs the region continues to boil over, local leaders have expressed deep anguish to the families who lost their loved ones.\nIn an impassioned speech in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly on Monday, the state's chief minister and tourism minister Omar Abdullah paid tributes to the victims by reading out names of all the 26 people.\nHe said people from every part of the country had come under attack, and while they'd come to Kashmir at his invitation he could not ensure their safe return.\n\"I had no words to apologise to them. What could I say to the children who saw their father drenched in blood? To the widow of the navy officer who was married barely a few days ago?\n\"Some people told me they'd come to Kashmir for the first time, but will have to pay for their holiday life long,\" he said, adding that the attack had \"hollowed out\" Kashmir.",

        "article_text": "From Alzheimer's to cancer, earwax can contain valuable indicators to a person's health. Now scientists are analysing its chemistry in the hope of finding new ways of diagnosing diseases.\nIt's orange, it's sticky, and it's probably the last thing you want to talk about in polite conversation. Yet earwax is increasingly attracting the attention of scientists, who want to use it to learn more about diseases and conditions like\u00a0cancer, heart disease, and metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\nThe proper name for the gloopy stuff is cerumen, and it's a mix of secretions from two types of glands that line the outer ear canal; the ceruminous and sebaceous glands. The resulting goo is mixed with hair, dead skin flakes, and other bodily debris until it reaches the waxy consistency we all know and try our best not to think about.\u00a0\nOnce formed in the ear canal, the substance is transported by a kind of conveyer belt mechanism, clinging on to skin cells as they travel from the inside of the ear to the outside \u2013 which they do at a speed of approximately one 20th\u00a0of a millimetre every day.\nThe primary purpose of earwax is debated, but the most likely function is to keep the ear canal clean and lubricated. However, it also serves as an effective trap, preventing bacteria, fungi and other unwelcome guests such as insects from finding their way into our heads. So far, so gross. And yet, possibly due to its unpalatable appearance, earwax has been somewhat overlooked by researchers when it comes to bodily secretions.\nThat's now starting to change, however, thanks to a slew of surprising scientific discoveries. The first is that a person's earwax can actually convey a surprising amount of information about them \u2013 both trivial and important.\nFor example, the vast majority of people of European or African descent have wet earwax, which is yellow or orange in colour and sticky. However, 95% of East Asian people have dry earwax, which is grey and non-sticky. The gene responsible for producing either wet or dry earwax is called\u00a0ABCC11, which also happens to be responsible for whether a person has smelly armpits. Around 2% of people \u2013 mostly those in the dry earwax category \u2013 have a version of this gene which means their armpits have no odour.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, perhaps the most useful earwax-related discoveries relate to what the sticky stuff in our ears can reveal about our health.\u00a0\nIn 1971, Nicholas L Petrakis, a professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco, found that Caucasian, African-American and German women in the USA, who all had \"wet earwax\", had an approximately four-fold higher chance of dying from breast cancer than Japanese and Taiwanese women with \"dry\" earwax.\nMore recently in 2010, researchers from the Tokyo Institute of Technology took blood samples from 270 female patients with invasive breast cancer, and 273 female volunteers who acted as controls. They found that Japanese women with breast cancer were up to 77% more likely to have the gene coding for wet\u00a0earwax\u00a0than healthy volunteers.\nNevertheless, the finding remains controversial, and large scale studies in Germany, Australia and Italy have found no difference in breast cancer risk between people with wet and dry earwax, although the number of people in these countries with dry ear wax is very small.\nWhat is more established is the link between some systemic illnesses and the substances found in earwax.\u00a0Take maple syrup urine disease, a rare genetic disorder that prevents the body from breaking down certain amino acids found in food.\u00a0This leads to a buildup of volatile compounds in the blood and urine, giving urine the distinctive odour of maple syrup.\u00a0\nThe molecule responsible for the sweet-smelling wee is sotolone, and it can be found in the earwax of people with the condition. This means the condition could be diagnosed through simply swabbing someone's ears, a much simpler and cheaper process than doing a genetic test.\u00a0Although such a test may not even be necessary.\u00a0\n\"The earwax literally smells like maple syrup, so within 12 hours of the birth of the baby, when you smell this distinct and lovely smell it tells you that they have this inborn error of metabolism,\" says Rabi Ann Musah, an environmental chemist at Louisiana State University.\nCovid-19 can also\u00a0sometimes be detected\u00a0in earwax, and a person's earwax can also tell you whether they have type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Early work has suggested that you can tell if someone has a certain form of heart disease from their earwax, although it's still easier to diagnose this condition from blood tests.\nThere's also M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, an inner ear condition that causes people to experience vertigo and hearing loss. \"The symptoms can be very debilitating,\" says Musah. \"They include severe nausea and vertigo. It becomes impossible to drive, or to go places accompanied. You eventually suffer complete hearing loss in the ear that is afflicted.\"\nMusah recently led a team which discovered that the earwax of patients with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease has\u00a0lower levels of three fatty acids than that of healthy controls. This is the first time anyone has found a biomarker for the condition, which is usually diagnosed by excluding everything else \u2013 a process which can take years. The finding raises the hope that doctors could use earwax to diagnose this condition more quickly in the future.\n\"Our interest in earwax as a reporter of disease is directed at those illnesses that are very difficult to diagnose using typical biological fluids like blood and urine or cerebral spinal fluid, and which take a long time to diagnose because they're rare,\" says Musah.\nMore like this:\u00a0\nBut what is it about earwax that makes it such a treasure trove of health information? The key, it turns out, is down to the waxy secretions' ability to reflect the inner chemical reactions taking place inside the body \u2013 a person's metabolism.\n\"Many diseases in living organisms are metabolic,\" says Nelson Roberto Antoniosi Filho, a professor of chemistry at the Federal University of Goi\u00e1s in Brazil, who lists diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease as examples. \"In these cases, mitochondria \u2013 the cell organelles responsible for converting lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins into energy \u2013 begin to function differently to those in healthy cells. They start to produce different chemical substances and may even stop producing others.\"\u00a0\nAntoniosi Filho's lab have discovered that earwax concentrates this great diversity of substances more than other biological fluids such as blood, urine, sweat, and tears.\u00a0\n\"It makes a lot of sense because there's not a lot of turnover in earwax,\" says Bruce Kimball, a chemical ecologist at the Monell Chemical Senses Centre, a research institute based in Philadelphia. \"It kind of builds up, and so there's certainly a reason to think that it might be a good place to capture long-term snapshots of changes in metabolism.\"\nWith this in mind, Antoniosi Filho and his team are developing the \"cerumenogram\" \u2013 a diagnostic tool they claim can accurately predict whether a person has certain forms of cancer based on their earwax.\nIn a 2019 study, Antoniosi Filho's team collected earwax samples from 52 cancer patients who had been diagnosed with either lymphoma, carcinoma, or leukaemia. The researchers also took earwax from 50 healthy subjects. They then analysed the samples using a method which can accurately detect the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) \u2013 chemicals that evaporate easily\u00a0in air.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe researchers identified 27 compounds in earwax that served as a kind of \"fingerprint\" for cancer diagnosis. In other words, the team could predict with 100% accuracy whether someone had cancer (either lymphoma, carcinoma, or leukaemia) based on the concentrations of these 27 molecules. Interestingly, the test could not distinguish between different types of cancer, suggesting that the molecules are produced either by, or as a response to, cancer cells from all these types of cancer.\n\"Although cancer consists of hundreds of diseases, from a metabolic point of view, cancer is a single biochemical process, which can be detected at any stage through the evaluation of specific VOCs,\" says Antoniosi Filho.\nWhile in 2019 the team identified 27 VOCs, they are currently focusing on a small number of these that are exclusively produced by cancer cells as part of their unique metabolism. In as-yet unpublished work, Antoniosi Filho says they have also shown that the cerumenogram is able to detect the metabolic disturbances that occur in pre-cancerous stages, where cells exhibit abnormal changes that could potentially lead to cancer, but are not yet cancerous.\n\"Considering that medicine indicates that most cancers diagnosed at stage 1 have up to a 90% cure rate, it is conceivable that the success in treatment will be much higher with the diagnosis of pre-cancer stages,\" says Antoniosi Filho.\nThe research group is also studying whether the metabolic changes caused by the onset of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's could also be picked up by such a device, although this work is in the early stages.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\"In the future, we hope that the cerumenogram will become a routine clinical examination, preferably every six months, that allows, with a small portion of earwax, to simultaneously diagnose diseases such as diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's, as well as evaluate metabolic changes resulting from other health conditions,\" says Antoniosi Filho.\nIn Brazil, the Amaral Carvalho Hospital has recently adopted the cerumenogram as a diagnostic and monitoring technique for cancer treatment, says Antoniosi Filho.\nMusah is also hopeful that her research will one day help people suffering from M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, a condition for which there is currently no cure. She first hopes to validate her test on a larger sample of patients in the clinic, before producing a diagnostic test that could be used by clinicians in their offices.\n\"We are currently working on developing a test kit very similar to what you would see in over-the-counter types of kits that you can buy for Covid-19 testing,\" says Musah.\nJust the observation that three fatty acids are very low compared to normal earwax may also provide some clues that can be further investigated, Musah explains. \"It might help us understand what causes the disease, or perhaps even suggest ways in which it can be treated,\" she says.\nMusah says that a lot of foundational work is still needed to understand the chemical profile of normal, healthy earwax \u2013 and how this changes in different disease states. But she hopes\u00a0 that one day it may be routinely analysed in hospitals to diagnose diseases, in much the same way as blood.\n\"Earwax is a really wonderful matrix to use because it is very lipid rich, and there are lots of diseases that are a consequence of dysregulation of lipid metabolism,\" says Musah.\nPerdita Barran, a chemist and professor of mass spectrometry at the University of Manchester in the UK, doesn't study earwax specifically, but does analyse biological molecules and investigate if they could be used to diagnose diseases. She agrees that, theoretically at least, it makes sense that this substance would be a good place to look for signs of illness.\n\"The compounds that you find in blood tend to be water soluble, whereas earwax is a very lipid-rich substance, and lipids don't like water,\" says Barran. \"So if you only study blood, you only get half the picture. Lipids are the canary in the coal mine molecules. They're the ones that really start changing first.\"\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better\u00a0health\u00a0and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health\u00a0Fix\u00a0newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and\u00a0health\u00a0stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Miami Grand Prix\nVenue: Miami International Autodrome Dates: 2-4 May Race start: 21:00 BST on Sunday\nCoverage: Live commentary of practice and qualifying online and BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra; race on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text updates on BBC Sport website and app\nFormula 1 heads to the United States this weekend for the Miami Grand Prix, the sixth round of the 2025 world championship.\nLast time out in Saudi Arabia, McLaren's Oscar Piastri won his third race of the season to take the lead in the drivers' standings. \nA year ago, Miami was the scene of Lando Norris' first F1 victory.\nBefore this year's race, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions.\nWould it be fair to say Lando Norris is faster than Oscar Piastri, but Piastri is a better racing driver? \u2013 Rob\nThe comparison between McLaren team-mates Norris and Piastri - as drivers, and as personalities - is one of many interesting aspects of this season.\nThat's because they are such contrasting people. Piastri is the epitome of robustness. Nothing seems to faze him. Even the weekends when he is a little off Norris' pace he seems to take in his stride. As Max Verstappen pointed out in Jeddah, he is very \"solid\" and he rarely makes mistakes.\nNorris, on the other hand, wears his heart on his sleeve. He seems to be a little more prey to the twisting fortunes of life. He beats himself up about his weaknesses. And he seems more prone to small errors that can have an impact in a title campaign.\nThat was happening last year, and it's still happening this.\nLast year, the question asked above would have been considered fair comment. Norris was definitively faster than Piastri in 2024. He out-qualified him 20 times to four, at an average of 0.147secs. And he won four races to Piastri's two.\nYet Piastri's race-craft was plain for all to see - for example in his superb overtaking move on Norris on the first lap in Monza, or to take the lead and eventually win against Charles Leclerc in Baku.\nBut this season? Piastri has three wins and two poles and Norris one of each. Piastri is 4-2 ahead in qualifying at an average of 0.185secs a lap.\nAnd he's leading the championship despite his unfortunate escapade on the wet grass in Melbourne, which dropped him to ninth at the flag having been challenging Norris for the lead from the start.\nNorris is incredibly fast. But there has never been any doubt that Piastri's highs were at least as good as the Briton's. \nAustralian Piastri came into this season setting himself a target of accessing them much more consistently.\nSo far, he is bang on target. Add that to his robustness, and he is going to make a tough title rival for anyone.\nDo you think Max Verstappen can sustain his amazing run in a car that some have labelled as \"fourth fastest\" or has he been helped by the characteristics of the tracks visited so far? \u2013 Steve\nVery few people in F1 doubt that Verstappen is the all-round best driver on the grid, and that's because his performances have been so strong for so long.\nThe Red Bull driver has been operating at a consistent level of excellence since, basically, the 2018 Canadian Grand Prix, the race he finally ironed out the series of errors that blighted his start to that season. So there is no reason to believe that's about to change.\nHe simply always seems to get the best out of his car, apart from on the odd occasions when he allows tangles with other drivers to get the better of him, such as in Mexico and Hungary last year.\nAs for the Red Bull car, on average qualifying pace, it's second fastest to McLaren by 0.177secs so far, and ahead of the Mercedes and the Ferrari.\nOf course, Verstappen's performances are a factor in that statistic - it's his car that is the fastest Red Bull. But is he definitively faster over one lap than Charles Leclerc and George Russell?\nHe may be, a bit. He may not be. But would he be, for example, consistently 0.135secs a lap faster than Leclerc in qualifying - the gap between Red Bull and Ferrari this year? No one knows for sure. And the answer can only be subjective. But few doubt Leclerc's pace over one lap.\nSo far, the Red Bull has been a fast car, in Verstappen's hands, on certain types of track. It is quick in high-speed corners, and slow. But it lags behind McLaren in long, medium-speed corners, which emphasise its often inconsistent balance.\nThat's why Verstappen was quick in Australia, Japan and Saudi Arabia, but not so in China and Bahrain.\nRed Bull believe they can fix their issues with some upgrades that are due soon, perhaps for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in two races' time.\nBut McLaren are hardly likely to stand still in terms of development.\nVerstappen will get the very best out of the Red Bull, and stay in the title fight as long as he can.\nBut as Fernando Alonso pointed out recently, it's very difficult to sustain a season-long title challenge with a car deficit.\nHow to follow Miami Grand Prix on the BBC\nChequered Flag Extra: Steiner, Verstappen & Will Cadillac Be Competitive?\nCan Ferrari turn this season around and be in contention for either championship? \u2013 Laura\nAfter five races this season, Ferrari have a sprint victory in China, courtesy of Lewis Hamilton, a single grand prix podium finish, thanks to Charles Leclerc in Saudi Arabia, and lie fourth in the constructors' championship, already 110 points behind leaders McLaren.\nTheir car is the fourth quickest on average on raw performance - 0.312 seconds a lap slower than McLaren in qualifying.\nIt's fair to say this is significantly below their expectations.\nTeam boss Frederic Vasseur predicted over the winter that this season would be as open as last year, that the advantage would swing between the top four teams from race to race. And there is no secret that Ferrari were expecting to start the season in a competitive position and mount a title challenge from the off.\nVasseur believes they can turn their season around. He has repeatedly pointed to last season, and the fact that they were in a less competitive position at the same point in 2024 but transformed their car and came close to winning the constructors' title at the end of the year.\nThey also made an effective job of developing the 2023 car, which was vicious at the start of the season, but much better by the end of it.\nAn upgrade is due soon, although Ferrari have not said at which race.\nThe complication for Ferrari is that they have two sizeable problems.\nThe first is the performance of their car. The second is the performance of Hamilton, which could turn into a major distraction if the seven-time champion cannot improve after three dismal races in Japan, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.\nIf neither of those improve soon, the pressure will start to mount.\nLewis Hamilton described his Saudi Arabian Grand Prix as \"horrible\" after finishing seventh, 31 seconds behind team-mate Charles Leclerc\nWhy do the regulations change just when the field is beginning to close up in competitiveness? The new regs for 2026 seem like a lottery for teams who either nail or fail them, leading to a dominant team and those lagging behind. Stable regs = competitive racing. \u2013 Matt\nF1 has always changed its regulations from time to time. It's an inevitable and necessary part of the sport.\nOften in the past, it has been because the governing body felt the need to intervene in some way.\nPerhaps because the cars were getting too fast or dangerous, such as at the end of the last ground-effect era in 1982, or when Ayrton Senna was killed in 1994. Or to change an aspect of racing that was no longer considered desirable, such as when refuelling was banned for 2010. Or to add an aspect that was felt to be lacking, such as when wider, faster cars were introduced in 2017.\nAnd the engine rules have also often changed, again for various reasons.\nThis time, the starting point was the engine rules. F1 and the FIA wanted to make the sport more attractive to new manufacturers. So they set up some working groups involving the manufacturers and came up with the 2026 rules.\nThese retain 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids, but simplify them by removing the MGU-H, which recovers energy from the turbo and is highly complex and was considered a barrier to new suppliers.\nThey have also upped the electrical capacity so that about 50% of the total power output will come from the electrical part of the engine, and will run on 100% sustainable fuel.\nIt has worked. Audi came in - which was the idea behind changing the rules. Porsche in the end did not. But Ford has come back, in partnership with Red Bull. Honda is staying when it was going to pull out. And General Motors is entering next year, too, although its engine won't be ready until 2029.\nThere was already a desire to refine the chassis rules, to fix some of the issues that have arisen with the 2022 ground-effect regs. But the new engine rules required further changes.\nIt became clear that recovering sufficient energy to supply the batteries was going to be a problem. So the rule-makers turned to moveable aerodynamics, reducing drag on the straights so the cars were in the braking zones for longer.\nWrangling is still going on about this topic, although the rules are not expected to change significantly - for example by limiting the electrical deployment in races, as some are pushing at the moment - as there is a blocking majority preventing it.\nYes, this might open up the field, but that often happens with new rules. But it will close again. It also provides opportunity for a shake-up of the competitive order, which is often regarded as a positive.\nSeeing as Mercedes dominated the first eight years of the engine regulations when the V6 engines came in, do you see them building that sort of dominance again from the new regulations? - Keegan\nJust because Mercedes nailed the last new engine rules in 2014, does not necessarily mean they will do so again in 2026.\nBasically, Mercedes achieved that because they invested more resources sooner into those rules than their rivals. The other manufacturers have learned from that experience.\nHaving said that, the word in F1 is that Mercedes are currently best placed for the new rules. \nMany believe that what's motivating the current debate about the engine rules - whether it be changing them again earlier than originally planned, or tinkering with the 2026 rules - is founded in the concerns of Mercedes' rivals - especially Red Bull - that they may face a competitive deficit next year.\nOne interesting angle to emerge in recent weeks is that senior sources say that the FIA's single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis is telling teams and manufacturers that the governing body doesn't want engines to be a performance differentiator in the future.\nBut that raises a major philosophical question. Why not? Engines have always been a performance differentiator. It's called motorsport, after all. Cars don't move without engines.\nAnd who decided this? Was this agreed with the other stakeholders first?\nIt appears not.\nThis will likely run for a while.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\nSenna's Lotus 'the most beautiful F1 livery'\nWhat is the format for F1 sprint races in 2025?",

        "article_text": "One week after a devastating militant attack near the mountain resort of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, the town wears a look of quiet desolation, although tourists have begun trickling back in small numbers.\nThe main high street, abandoned by visitors last week - with shops shuttered and hotels completely emptied out - is seeing fleeting signs of life again.\nLast Tuesday, militants opened fire on people, mostly tourists, who were visiting Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5 km) from Pahalgam, often described as the \"Switzerland of India\".\nThe attack was one of the deadliest in recent years, devastating the lives of many families and sparking widespread anger in India.\nIn the days since, tensions between India and Pakistan, which both claim Kashmir in full but administer it only in part, have significantly risen, with each side announcing retaliatory measures against the other.\nThere is now growing speculation about whether there will be a military response from Delhi. The government in Kashmir has closed down over half the tourist destinations in the valley, as authorities review the security situation and carry out search operations. \nWhile violence has often broken out in the region, with militants targeting security forces and civilians since an insurgency broke out in 1989, the brazen killing of tourists has been rare and has shocked local businesses and tourists alike.\nTourism is a mainstay of the economy in places like Pahalgam and there's now fear that many livelihoods might be irrevocably hit.\nAt a \"selfie point\" outside town, overlooking lush meadows and a rushing river, Akshay Solanki, a tourist from Mumbai, said there was \"panic\" among his group of travellers on the day of the attack. But they had decided to continue with their journey because flights back home had become unaffordable.\nOther tourists said constant reassurances from the locals and security forces had given them a sense of comfort. A driver who had brought visitors from the capital, Srinagar, told BBC Hindi that he was pleading with those visiting not to \"distance\" themselves from Kashmir.\nAfter a washout three days, shawl-seller Rafi Ahmed said he'd managed to sell just a few pieces and feared for his livelihood in the long run if tourists stopped coming.\nAmong those exhorting tourists to come to Pahalgam was Bollywood actor Atul Kulkarni, who visited the town days after the attack. He told BBC Hindi, if the message from the militants was \"don't come here, we should respond by coming in even larger numbers\".\n\"Don't cancel bookings, cancel your other plans and come here,\" Kulkarni said.\nBut uncertainty and apprehension loom large in Pahalgam and it could take several years before a sense of normalcy is restored, local business owners and residents told the BBC.\nIndian authorities have launched combing operations in the region, detaining hundreds of people and destroying homes belonging to alleged militants.\nIndia and Pakistan have also reportedly exchanged small arms fire across the border.\nThe escalation in tensions is keeping tourists and business owners on tenterhooks.\nIndian authorities have often claimed Kashmir witnessed a period of relative peace after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked its autonomous status in 2019. Ahead of India's general elections in 2024, Modi hailed the \"freedom\" that had come to the region, saying Kashmir was touching new heights of development because it was breathing freely.\nTop leaders pointed to high tourism numbers - some 23 million last year and millions more in the years before - as proof of a big boom after years of unquiet. But last week's attacks have, yet again, shattered any idea of lasting peace in the restive valley.\n\"This [attack] is a blot on us\u2026How we wipe it off is a long-term concern,\" Rafi Ahmed Meer, a politician from Pahalgam told BBC Hindi, urging tourists to remember that it was local Kashmiris who rushed to help after the attacks, even picking up bodies.\nThe cancellation rate for trips planned from cities like Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru are very high, Abhishek Sansare, a Mumbai-based tour operator told the BBC. A group of prominent tour operators said in a press conference that some 80-90% of all bookings had been cancelled.\n\"After the attack, there's a sense that a war is looming. So tourists are confused about what to do,\" said Sansare. \"Some of those who've already made advance bookings are going ahead with their plans. I'm also going there on the 2nd of next month.\"\nThe attack on tourists is also likely to weigh on Kashmir in other ways. The inauguration of the world's highest single-arch rail bridge, set to connect the Kashmir valley with the rest of India was slated to happen this month after several delays.\nThe timeline for the opening of this showpiece project now \"looks uncertain\", a source told the BBC.\nThe region was just beginning to attract fledgling business investments, but those too could dry up if hostilities go up.\n\"People who were investing in logistics and other sectors will now think twice because of the security environment. Until they regain some confidence, I don't foresee investments coming to Kashmir immediately,\" said Ubair Shah, who owns one of Kashmir's largest cold storage facilities for fruits in Pulwama district in south Kashmir.\nAs the region continues to boil over, local leaders have expressed deep anguish to the families who lost their loved ones.\nIn an impassioned speech in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly on Monday, the state's chief minister and tourism minister Omar Abdullah paid tributes to the victims by reading out names of all the 26 people.\nHe said people from every part of the country had come under attack, and while they'd come to Kashmir at his invitation he could not ensure their safe return.\n\"I had no words to apologise to them. What could I say to the children who saw their father drenched in blood? To the widow of the navy officer who was married barely a few days ago?\n\"Some people told me they'd come to Kashmir for the first time, but will have to pay for their holiday life long,\" he said, adding that the attack had \"hollowed out\" Kashmir.",

The occasion deserved more from the club to help with the atmosphere and fan engagement. \n\"Certainly if Arsenal get to this stage again, they need to be better prepared and involve the fans in the process, not just in tifos but the wider experience and build-up for the match. \n\"Hopefully we won't wait so long for another semi-final and the club will be better prepared to make more impact.\"\nBroadcaster and Arsenal fan Harry Symeou: \"I think the fans were hoping to see something with a bit more of a wow factor. Given there was lots of talk online with regards to some more elaborate, striking designs - you can understand why some felt underwhelmed.\n\"Tifos on the continent tend to be more creative and really can set the scene ahead of a huge occasion. Fan groups, in particular those known as 'ultras' normally have a big input - leading to a higher rate of fan satisfaction. But this is something we don't do well enough in English football generally.

That tells you how unique and beautiful this is.\n\"We are making history. It's a beautiful story right now - but we want much more.\"\nArsenal's season has been hampered by injuries to key players including Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Ben White.\nThey have won only one of their past four Premier League matches, which helped Liverpool clinch the title on Sunday with four games to spare.\nBut in Europe they have won six of their eight league-phase games and also beat PSV Eindhoven 9-3 on aggregate in the last 16 on their way to the semi-finals. \nArteta added: \"The fact that we are here as one of the four best teams in Europe, it tells about the mindset, spirit and how much we really want it.\" \nHis squad will be boosted by the return of Mikel Merino and White to training, but Arteta also challenged the Gunners faithful to create an even better atmosphere than in the 3-0 win against Real Madrid. \n\"I'm not exaggerating. Guys, bring your boots, your shorts and T-shirt and let's play every ball together,\" said Areta, who is eyeing his first major silverware at the club since the FA Cup in 2020. \n\"You want to do something special?

I think we're a better team and we've shown that throughout the competition. \n\"We had the toughest league phase. At first I thought it was detrimental, but in the end it was positive because it helped us progress.\n\"We are a more complete team and we now want to write a page in history.\" \nPSG, who were crowned domestic champions again this month, are aiming for a first Champions League title despite the exits of Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar. \nAfter beating fellow French club Brest 10-0 on aggregate in the play-offs, they overcame successive English opponents in Liverpool and Aston Villa.\nBefore the semi-final, Luis Enrique said he sees similarities between his side and Arteta's Arsenal.\n\"They are built as a team with collective strength - you can see that from the way they attack and defend,\" he said.\n\"They do everything together.

We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.\nHe said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".\nThe antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.\n\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.\n\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.\nThe 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.\nIt is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.\nCurrently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.\n\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics. \n\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\" \nOn the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back. \nThe satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"\nDespite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch. \n\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.\nAirbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.\nL3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.\nThe team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.\nThese annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.\n\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney. \nAnother advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.\nIt is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.\n\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\" \nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "One week after a devastating militant attack near the mountain resort of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, the town wears a look of quiet desolation, although tourists have begun trickling back in small numbers.\nThe main high street, abandoned by visitors last week - with shops shuttered and hotels completely emptied out - is seeing fleeting signs of life again.\nLast Tuesday, militants opened fire on people, mostly tourists, who were visiting Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5 km) from Pahalgam, often described as the \"Switzerland of India\".\nThe attack was one of the deadliest in recent years, devastating the lives of many families and sparking widespread anger in India.\nIn the days since, tensions between India and Pakistan, which both claim Kashmir in full but administer it only in part, have significantly risen, with each side announcing retaliatory measures against the other.\nThere is now growing speculation about whether there will be a military response from Delhi. The government in Kashmir has closed down over half the tourist destinations in the valley, as authorities review the security situation and carry out search operations. \nWhile violence has often broken out in the region, with militants targeting security forces and civilians since an insurgency broke out in 1989, the brazen killing of tourists has been rare and has shocked local businesses and tourists alike.\nTourism is a mainstay of the economy in places like Pahalgam and there's now fear that many livelihoods might be irrevocably hit.\nAt a \"selfie point\" outside town, overlooking lush meadows and a rushing river, Akshay Solanki, a tourist from Mumbai, said there was \"panic\" among his group of travellers on the day of the attack. But they had decided to continue with their journey because flights back home had become unaffordable.\nOther tourists said constant reassurances from the locals and security forces had given them a sense of comfort.

He told BBC Hindi, if the message from the militants was \"don't come here, we should respond by coming in even larger numbers\".\n\"Don't cancel bookings, cancel your other plans and come here,\" Kulkarni said.\nBut uncertainty and apprehension loom large in Pahalgam and it could take several years before a sense of normalcy is restored, local business owners and residents told the BBC.\nIndian authorities have launched combing operations in the region, detaining hundreds of people and destroying homes belonging to alleged militants.\nIndia and Pakistan have also reportedly exchanged small arms fire across the border.\nThe escalation in tensions is keeping tourists and business owners on tenterhooks.\nIndian authorities have often claimed Kashmir witnessed a period of relative peace after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked its autonomous status in 2019. Ahead of India's general elections in 2024, Modi hailed the \"freedom\" that had come to the region, saying Kashmir was touching new heights of development because it was breathing freely.\nTop leaders pointed to high tourism numbers - some 23 million last year and millions more in the years before - as proof of a big boom after years of unquiet. But last week's attacks have, yet again, shattered any idea of lasting peace in the restive valley.\n\"This [attack] is a blot on us\u2026How we wipe it off is a long-term concern,\" Rafi Ahmed Meer, a politician from Pahalgam told BBC Hindi, urging tourists to remember that it was local Kashmiris who rushed to help after the attacks, even picking up bodies.\nThe cancellation rate for trips planned from cities like Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru are very high, Abhishek Sansare, a Mumbai-based tour operator told the BBC. A group of prominent tour operators said in a press conference that some 80-90% of all bookings had been cancelled.\n\"After the attack, there's a sense that a war is looming. So tourists are confused about what to do,\" said Sansare. \"Some of those who've already made advance bookings are going ahead with their plans. I'm also going there on the 2nd of next month.\"\nThe attack on tourists is also likely to weigh on Kashmir in other ways. The inauguration of the world's highest single-arch rail bridge, set to connect the Kashmir valley with the rest of India was slated to happen this month after several delays.\nThe timeline for the opening of this showpiece project now \"looks uncertain\", a source told the BBC.\nThe region was just beginning to attract fledgling business investments, but those too could dry up if hostilities go up.\n\"People who were investing in logistics and other sectors will now think twice because of the security environment. Until they regain some confidence, I don't foresee investments coming to Kashmir immediately,\" said Ubair Shah, who owns one of Kashmir's largest cold storage facilities for fruits in Pulwama district in south Kashmir.\nAs the region continues to boil over, local leaders have expressed deep anguish to the families who lost their loved ones.\nIn an impassioned speech in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly on Monday, the state's chief minister and tourism minister Omar Abdullah paid tributes to the victims by reading out names of all the 26 people.\nHe said people from every part of the country had come under attack, and while they'd come to Kashmir at his invitation he could not ensure their safe return.\n\"I had no words to apologise to them. What could I say to the children who saw their father drenched in blood? To the widow of the navy officer who was married barely a few days ago?\n\"Some people told me they'd come to Kashmir for the first time, but will have to pay for their holiday life long,\" he said, adding that the attack had \"hollowed out\" Kashmir.",

Hope and fear as tourists trickle back to Kashmir town after attack2 days agoShareSaveRaghvendra RaoBBC Hindi, PahalgamNikhil InamdarBBC News, LondonShareSaveSeraj AliSome tourists decided to stay back in Pahalgam because flight tickets back home were expensiveOne week after a devastating militant attack near the mountain resort of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, the town wears a look of quiet desolation, although tourists have begun trickling back in small numbers.The main high street, abandoned by visitors last week - with shops shuttered and hotels completely emptied out - is seeing fleeting signs of life again.Last Tuesday, militants opened fire on people, mostly tourists, who were visiting Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5 km) from Pahalgam, often described as the \"Switzerland of India\".The attack was one of the deadliest in recent years, devastating the lives of many families and sparking widespread anger in India.In the days since, tensions between India and Pakistan, which both claim Kashmir in full but administer it only in part, have significantly risen, with each side announcing retaliatory measures against the other.There is now growing speculation about whether there will be a military response from Delhi. A driver who had brought visitors from the capital, Srinagar, told BBC Hindi that he was pleading with those visiting not to \"distance\" themselves from Kashmir.After a washout three days, shawl-seller Rafi Ahmed said he'd managed to sell just a few pieces and feared for his livelihood in the long run if tourists stopped coming.Among those exhorting tourists to come to Pahalgam was Bollywood actor Atul Kulkarni, who visited the town days after the attack. \"Seraj AliIndian authorities have launched combing operations in Kashmir and destroyed homes belonging to alleged militants The attack on tourists is also likely to weigh on Kashmir in other ways. \"Some people told me they'd come to Kashmir for the first time, but will have to pay for their holiday life long,\" he said, adding that the attack had \"hollowed out\" Kashmir.TourismAsiaKashmir tensionsIndiaKashmir",

        "article_text": "A commercial expedition is planning to take clients up the tallest mountain in the world in record time with the help of xenon gas. But some in the climbing and medical world worry whether the strategy is an unnecessary gamble.\nWhen Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary\u00a0made their first successful ascent of Mount Everest in 1953, it took more than two months of effort to reach the summit. In order to adjust to the extreme thin air at high altitude, the team spent several weeks acclimatising, working their way slowly upwards. After reaching Base Camp, they spent seven weeks making brief forays up and down the mountain to set ropes, lay ladders and establish ever higher camps before their assault on the summit. In short, they laid siege to the mountain.\nToday, the miles of fixed ropes put along the route by teams of Sherpas and the slick logistics perfected by commercial guiding companies allow hundreds of climbers to summit Everest every year. But the time it takes for most to climb Mount Everest hasn't changed dramatically since that first ascent.\nMany expeditions still recommend allowing around two months to reach the top with extensive acclimatisation, although this depends on a range of factors including the weather, traffic on the mountain and the fitness of the climber. It can take up to a week to trek to Base Camp, but once there most people need, on average, around 40 days to reach the summit. But some companies even offer fast-track expeditions that claim to get clients there in as little as two weeks.\nThis season, however, one guiding company has promised to slash the time even further by taking its clients to the top of the world in just one week, starting from an airport in London. They will fly to Kathmandu in Nepal, take a helicopter to Everest base camp and climb the mountain in only a few days. This way, they will skip the usual painstaking three weeks of acclimatisation in the mountains \u2013 all for around \u20ac150,000 (\u00a3127,000/$170,000) per person. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe offer, which raised more than a few eyebrows in the climbing community, came from Austrian guide Lukas Furtenbach, who will rely on an unexpected new strategy \u2013 inhaling xenon, a noble gas that is sometimes used as an anaesthetic.\nThe logic behind the idea is relatively simple. Around 10 years ago, it became apparent that xenon has one interesting side effect \u2013 it increases production of a protein called erythropoietin. Known for short as EPO, erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that our kidneys produce as reaction to insufficient oxygen levels. EPO fights hypoxia \u2013 a condition that occurs when the body can't get enough oxygen \u2013 by increasing the number of red blood cells and the crucial protein they carry, haemoglobin, which transports oxygen around the body. At high altitudes, this process will naturally happen after multiple rounds of going up and down the mountain \u2013 acclimatisation in other words \u2013 to slowly adapt the body to lower oxygen levels.\nBut xenon, it is claimed, could potentially offer a shortcut. By inhaling carefully controlled doses of the gas shortly before the expedition, it may be possible to accelerate the effects of acclimatisation. Furtenbach says he successfully tested xenon himself on previous expeditions. There is, however, little published scientific evidence showing the strategy works. One recent systematic review of the scientific research, for example, found no conclusive evidence that inhaling xenon had a positive effect on the action of EPO in the human body.\n\"Increase in erythropoietin does nothing on its own,\" says Andrew Peacock, an honorary professor specialising in altitude medicine at the University of Glasgow in the UK. \"The question in this case is, does it really stimulate production of red blood cells in such a short period?\"\nFor Furtenbach, the main goal of this strategy is to allow climbers to summit faster and so reduce the risk of being caught in bad weather, avalanches or getting sick.\n\"The less time you spend on the mountain, the safer the expedition becomes,\" he says.\u00a0\nMore like this:\u00a0\n\u2022 How tall will Mount Everest get before it stops growing\n\u2022 Death in the clouds: The problem with Everest's bodies\n\u2022 Scientists in Antarctica began developing their own accent\nFurtenbach has a reputation for pushing the limits of what is possible on Everest. He has specialised in offering \"flash\" three-week expeditions, where mountaineers pre-acclimatise at home before making their trip. In the Everest climbing season of 2025, he is planning to use the xenon approach to help four British clients reach the summit in early May.\nMany in the mountaineering community, however, have reacted to his plans with a mix of scepticism and condemnation.\nThe medical commission at the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA) \u2013 the umbrella group for mountaineering organisations around the world \u2013 issued a cautionary statement after Furtenbach revealed his plans. It warned of the absence of clinical research or scientific proof about the safety and efficiency of using xenon at high altitudes. A previous assessment by the same body also warned that drugs designed to induce EPO could potentially increase the risk of blood clots capable of triggering strokes or pulmonary embolisms.\nSome climbers have also\u00a0pointed\u00a0out that substances that artificially increase the amount of EPO in the blood \u2013 including xenon \u2013 are\u00a0banned\u00a0by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) in competitive sport.\n\"Why would we use substances in mountaineering that are banned in all other sports,\" says Adrian Ballinger, an American climber and owner of rival guiding company Alpenglow Expeditions. His own company guided climber Roxanne Vogel to the summit of Everest in just 14 days in 2019, where she used an \"altitude chamber\" at the gym and work to help her pre-acclimatise before the expedition.\nBut in the world of commercial guided mountaineering, where anti-doping rules don't apply, clients are largely unconcerned about the style of ascent. Some in the climbing community are simply curious to see how this will unfold.\n\"It would be great if this is true, and we could use xenon in the future to make the work of Sherpas safer,\" says Dawa Steven Sherpa, owner of Nepal-based guiding company Asia Trekking.\nAfter all, it won't be the first time humans have enlisted the help of drugs to survive on the tallest mountains \u2013 one of the harshest environments on Earth.\nAs climbers ascend to high altitude, they experience a drop in atmospheric pressure that reduces the amount of oxygen they inhale. This is because the number of air molecules in the atmosphere falls the higher you get. At 5,500m (18,045ft) \u2013 slightly above the Everest base camp \u2013 there is roughly only half as much oxygen available for us to breathe compared with at sea level. On the summit at 8,850m (29,035ft), this drops to one-third of the usual oxygen. The weather on any given day can also have an effect, leading to dramatic swings in atmospheric pressure to such an extent that it would be equivalent to climbing an additional 700m (2,297ft), according to one study.\nAll of this means that climbers are able to get less oxygen into their blood stream and into their bodies. Researchers who have studied blood oxygen levels of climbers on Everest have recorded some of the lowest levels ever seen in humans.\nIf exposed suddenly to these conditions, people can become severely hypoxic, a state that is normally only seen in critically ill patients being treated in hospitals or during serious incidents while under anaesthetic. From altitudes as low as 4,500m (14,764ft) \u2013 brain function starts to become impaired in ways that affect decision-making and problem-solving tasks.\nThe human body, however, is able to adapt to hypobaric hypoxia (hypoxia caused by low air pressure) and reacts with a range of different responses, explains Martin Burtscher, a long-time researcher in the field of high-altitude medicine and professor at University of Innsbruck in Austria. We start to hyperventilate and consequently exhale more carbon dioxide, which helps counteract oxygen desaturation. Kidney and bladder function also change to increase the concentration of blood cells, while an increase in heart rate drives more oxygen around the body, says Burtscher.\nErythropoiesis, a process that increases red blood cell production in response to the presence of EPO, is one of the most important adaptations. After weeks of acclimatisation, erythropoiesis increases total blood volume and oxygen transportation capacity.\nSometimes, however, these adaptive responses can fail.\n\"If hypoxia becomes too severe, acute mountain sickness or life-threatening pulmonary or brain oedema develop,\" says Burtscher.\nIn those cases, capillaries of the lung and the brain lose their ability to retain fluids, which leaks out between the cells into brain or lung tissue, explains Andrew Peacock. The consequence is loss of brain or lung function, both potentially fatal.\nIt is why most climbers on the world's highest mountains use supplementary oxygen, delivered from canisters through breathing apparatus, with a constant flow of the gas coming from high-pressure cylinders that mountaineers carry in their backpacks.\n\"It makes a huge difference,\" says Peacock. \"You are basically mimicking a lower altitude. It makes you less breathless, and it improves the function of the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver and muscles.\" \u00a0\u00a0\nBoth Hillary and Norgay used supplementary oxygen in 1953 and that approach continues today. Of 7,269 people known to have reached the summit of Mount Everest, only 230 have done it without the aid of supplemental oxygen.\nThere are some in the mountaineering community, however, who believe supplemental oxygen could also be considered as doping. It is a highly charged debate, balancing climber safety against ideals of a more \"pure\" style of mountaineering. The Piolet d'Or, the most prestigious annual award in mountaineering, tends to celebrate ascents achieved without supplemental oxygen, for example.\nEager to mitigate the effects of altitude further, some mountaineers and doctors have been willing to experiment with other remedies too, from existing prescription drugs to sketchy stimulants.\nIn 1953, the legendary Austrian alpinist Hermann Buhl achieved one the greatest feats in the history of mountaineering, summiting alone on the 8,126m (26,660ft) Himalayan peak Nanga Parbat. It remains the only time anyone has managed a \"solo\" first ascent of an 8,000m (26,247ft) peak. Buhl's feat is considered even more impressive as he did it without supplemental oxygen. During the gruesome descent, he was famously forced to spend the night at 7,900m (25,919ft), standing on a narrow ledge while leaning against a rock. At that time, Buhl was already known as a hard-core, pioneering alpinist. Still, it was unthinkable that somebody could survive this ordeal.\nAs he later described in his autobiography, he did, however, have a little help in his backpack in form of pervitin, methamphetamine pills that had been widely used by Nazi troops during World War Two.\nAnother stimulant, amphetamine, is often rumoured to be occasionally used by climbers on high-altitude mountain slopes. One study from 1993 analysed urine samples taken from 253 male mountaineers after a successful ascent to different mountains. Amphetamines traces were found in 7.1% of samples from those climbing above 3,300m (10,827ft).\nBy far the most popular prescription drug among mountaineers is acetazolamide, better known as Diamox. This carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, used in the treatment of many conditions, from glaucoma to epilepsy, also happens to be quite useful at high altitudes.\n\"It accelerates acclimatisation and improves sleep,\" says Burtscher.\nDexamethasone, a powerful corticosteroid, is still considered as the number one life-saving medicine for cerebral oedema and acute mountain sickness since it buys some time for the sick person to descend. Some research has indicated that dexamethasone could also be useful as a prophylactic treatment to stave off acute mountain sickness, although medical experts warn that it can result in potentially serious side effects and do not recommend it for this use.\nThere were hopes that sildenafil, commonly known as Viagra, could also help to protect against high-altitude pulmonary oedema, but trials did not shown it to be effective.\nThe search for other drugs that can help give climbers a boost in performance and acclimatisation at high altitude never stopped. A team of doctors in Willemstad, Cura\u00e7ao, for example, recently published details about a test of a drug normally used to treat anaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Two climbers took the drug, which stimulates EPO production, as they ascended Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.\nBut even with all this help, Everest is a treacherous place and there is no guarantee of survival. Although there is little research on how long someone can remain at very high altitudes, experts agree that even with acclimatisation, the body will eventually start to deteriorate. Extremes of cold and wind exposure, the strain placed on the lungs and heart, deterioration of the tissues and organs, dehydration and weight loss all make spending any prolonged visit to the so called \"Death Zone\" \u2013 generally considered to be above 8,000m (26,247ft) \u2013 increasingly dangerous.\nSo, cutting down the time spent on the mountain is always beneficial.\nThis is where xenon could make a real difference, at least according to Michael Fries, head of the department of anaesthesiology at St Vincenz Krankenhaus Limburg in Germany, who came up with the idea and suggested it to Furtenbach. \u00a0\nXenon has been used in a wide range of products, from car headlights to ion propulsion engines and ballistic missiles. It could also serve as an anaesthetic, which is something Fries spent years researching while working at University Hospital Aachen in Germany.\n\"It is an almost ideal anaesthetic since it has a very rapid effect, quickly leaves the body and doesn't interact with other drugs,\" says Fries.\nUsing xenon for anaesthesia, however, proved to be challenging for multiple reasons. This extremely expensive gas must make up 70% of the anaesthetic mixture and it requires special equipment for administration.\nThen, in 2014, Fries and his colleagues heard claims that some Russian athletes had used xenon at the 2014 Winter Olympics to improve performance, so the group from University Hospital Aachen did their own study on 24 healthy volunteers. The results confirmed that a single inhalation of 30% xenon for 45 minutes significantly increased EPO level eight hours after exposure. According to Fries, the main effect of EPO production should be strongest within the first few days and last up to 14 days.\nCurious if this advantage could be used in the hypoxia-inducing world of high-altitude mountaineering, Fries contacted Furtenbach.\nPreviously, Furtenbach had managed to shorten the Everest expedition time to two weeks by using so-called hypoxic pre-acclimatisation. However, sleeping at home for eight weeks in tents with a lower percentage of oxygen or repeatedly breathing reduced amounts of air through a mask was never a strategy that found much favour among his clients.\nKeen to try the xenon idea, Furtenbach did a test run on Aconcagua, 6,961m (22,838ft) high mountain in Argentina. He received a low dose of xenon shortly before the expedition in 2020.\n\"I reached the summit within a week, without any prior acclimatisation. I felt strong and fast,\" says Furtenbach.\nHe claims his red blood cell count went up by 10% while measurements of his blood oxygen saturation on the summit showed it was 89%.\nIf true, academics say, this would be remarkable. \u00a0At sea level, normal blood oxygen saturation is between 96-100%. Measurements taken from nine climbers during an expedition to Everest in 1993 showed that blood oxygen saturation of climbers fell below 90% at around 4,700m (15,420ft), while at 8,000m (26,247ft) climbers had only 70% saturation without supplementary oxygen. Even with supplementary oxygen, this increased only to 80%. Measurements taken during a research expedition to Everest in 2007 showed an even starker reduction in blood oxygen saturation in four climbers at an altitude of 8,400m (27,559ft), measuring some of the lowest levels ever recorded in humans who are not already close to death.\n\"I'm quite sceptical,\" says Mike Grocott, professor of anaesthesia and critical care at University of Southampton who led the research team during the 2007 expedition and has summited Everest himself. \"Xenon has a number of biological mechanisms, including boosting EPO, but the effect on red blood cells and oxygen transport is questionable.\"\nIn 2022, Furtenbach and two fellow guides did another xenon test \u2013 this time on Everest. The results, he says, were the same as on Aconcagua, except this time the group prepared at home with hypoxic pre-acclimatisation, where their bodies were slowly introduced to lower levels of oxygen by sleeping in a hypoxic tent at home.\n\"In each of these cases, we could see the effects on the endurance and the physical abilities,\" says Fries, who was involved in analysing the data gathered during the tests. \"They all had high oxygen saturations without the long acclimatisation periods and increase in haemoglobin levels.\"\nBut he acknowledges there is still a lack of peer-reviewed scientific research on this and says he hopes to publish findings in the future.\nFries also refutes concerns that xenon, when administered in small doses, could reduce decision-making ability on the mountain. The UIAA medical committee, for example, warned that using an anaesthetic gas in an unmonitored setting could affect brain function, stating \"even slight sedation is detrimental in the potentially dangerous setting of high-altitude mountaineering\". Fries says that in small doses, xenon only results in a short period of dizziness immediately after administration. \u00a0\nThree medical experts the BBC contacted for this story \u2013 all veterans of high-altitude research \u2013 are not entirely convinced about the strategy as a way to summit the highest mountain on Earth. They argue there is insufficient scientific proof that xenon actually does enhance performance at high altitude.\nBurtschner and Grocott both point to a study which confirmed that xenon did increase EPO concentration, but failed to \"stimulate increases in plasma volume or erythropoiesis, leaving cardiorespiratory fitness and athletic performance unchanged\".\nXenon, Grocott says, would need to have an \"extraordinary\" effect to enable someone to climb to the summit in just one week. \"That would have to be a very dramatic change. And I haven't seen any data suggesting that's true.\"\nIn the meantime, Furtenbach is proceeding with the plan to send four clients up Everest with the help of xenon gas. All four are in good physical shape, he says. They will climb with guides and bottled oxygen. Once new fixed ropes are in place, all the team will need is seven days of good weather.\u00a0\nThe rest of the world, meanwhile, will be watching.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "summary": "\"It would be great if this is true, and we could use xenon in the future to make the work of Sherpas safer,\" says Dawa Steven Sherpa, owner of Nepal-based guiding company Asia Trekking.After all, it won't be the first time humans have enlisted the help of drugs to survive on the tallest mountains \u2013 one of the harshest environments on Earth.Researchers who have studied blood oxygen levels of climbers on Everest have recorded some of the lowest levels ever seen in humansAs climbers ascend to high altitude, they experience a drop in atmospheric pressure that reduces the amount of oxygen they inhale. At high altitudes, this process will naturally happen after multiple rounds of going up and down the mountain \u2013 acclimatisation in other words \u2013 to slowly adapt the body to lower oxygen levels.Getty ImagesMost climbers undergo extensive acclimatisation at high altitude to help their bodies adapt to the low levels of oxygen (Credit: Getty Images)But xenon, it is claimed, could potentially offer a shortcut. According to Fries, the main effect of EPO production should be strongest within the first few days and last up to 14 days.Curious if this advantage could be used in the hypoxia-inducing world of high-altitude mountaineering, Fries contacted Furtenbach.Previously, Furtenbach had managed to shorten the Everest expedition time to two weeks by using so-called hypoxic pre-acclimatisation. A previous assessment by the same body also warned that drugs designed to induce EPO could potentially increase the risk of blood clots capable of triggering strokes or pulmonary embolisms.Furtenbach AdventuresLukas Furtenbach hope that giving climbers small doses of xenon gas before their ascent will reducing the amount of time they spend on the mountain (Credit: Furtenbach Adventures)Some climbers have also\u00a0pointed\u00a0out that substances that artificially increase the amount of EPO in the blood \u2013 including xenon \u2013 are\u00a0banned\u00a0by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) in competitive sport. Measurements taken from nine climbers during an expedition to Everest in 1993 showed that blood oxygen saturation of climbers fell below 90% at around 4,700m (15,420ft), while at 8,000m (26,247ft) climbers had only 70% saturation without supplementary oxygen.",

        "article_text": "In Armenia tech education starts early.\nIn a typical three-storey state school in the suburbs of Yerevan, the Armenian capital, nine-year old Slavik is demonstrating his invention - a box with three LED lights.\n\"He has learned how to control it, and the programming language. You can see the code is written by him,\" says Maria, the 21-year-old tech coach leading the class.\nNext to them, 14-year-old Eric and Narek are showing their smart greenhouse model that monitors temperature and controls fans automatically through a mobile app.\nOther children are enthusiastically showcasing their inventions: games, robots, apps and smart home projects.\nEleven-year-old Arakel is holding his cardboard model of a house with a retractable clothesline.\n\"I have made my mother's work easy, one part of the device is set on the roof, and another is a motor,\" he says. \"When it rains the line goes under the roof to keep the clothes dry.\"\nThese young inventors have been attending engineering lab classes where they learn programming, robotics, coding, 3D modelling and more.\nThe programme started in 2014, and is called Armath, which translates into English as \"root\". Today there are 650 Armath labs in schools across Armenia.\nThe initiative was established by a business organisation called the Union of Advanced Technology Enterprises (UATE), which represents more than 200 high-tech Armenian companies.\n\"The vision is that we want to see Armenia becoming a tech centre powerhouse that delivers utmost values to Armenia and to the world,\" says Sarkis Karapetyan, the chief executive of UATE.\nIn his spacious, open-plan office in Yerevan he says that there are now around 4,000 tech companies in Armenia.\nArmath is part of the UATE's education and workforce development programme. Mr Karapetyan says the programme is the most successful public-private partnership in the country.\n\"We raise capital expenditure from the private sector, we go to the schools and establish Armath labs, we donate the equipment,\" he says. \"And the government, the education ministry gives us a budget of $2m (\u00a31.5m) annually to pay the salaries of the coaches.\"\nThere are now more than 600 coaches, and 17,000 active students.\n\"The goal is to have 5,000 of the most talented kids decide to become engineers every year,\" says Mr Karapetyan.\nArmenia is a landlocked country of 2.7 million people, the smallest in the South Caucasus region, and its borders with neighbouring Azerbaijan and Turkey have been shut for decades due to unresolved territorial disputes.\nUnlike its neighbours, Armenia does not have natural resources or access to the sea. But throughout the Soviet era it had been a centre of mathematics and computer science.\nIn 1956 the Yerevan Scientific Research Institute of Mathematical Machines was established in Armenia and by 1960 it had developed two first generation computers.\nToday, the country is tapping into its legacy with the ambition to transform itself into the tech powerhouse of the Caucasus.\nAnd there has been some success already. Picsart, a AI-powered photo and video editing website and app, was launched in Armenia in 2011. Today the company of the same name, which has dual headquarters in Yerevan and Miami, is valued at $1.5bn.\nKrisp, which makes audio-processing software, and Service Titan, which provides business software, are other Armenian success stories.\nMeanwhile, an annual report says that Armenia is the best country in the Caucuses region in which to launch a company, putting it in 57th place globally. This compares with Georgia in 70th position, and Azerbaijan in 80th. \nA critical factor in boosting Armenia's tech development is the nation's global diaspora \u2013 some 75% of the world's estimated Armenians, and people of Armenian descent, live elsewhere.\nThis worldwide community provides important connections, especially in the US tech industry. In the US there are as many as 1.6 million people of Armenian ancestry, centred on California.\nSamvel Khachikyan, is director of programs at SmartGate, a venture capital firm based in both California and Armenia that focuses on tech investments.\nHe says that if you look at the top 500 companies in the US, \"for sure you'll find at least one or two Armenians\" in the boardroom or one management level below.\nMr Khachikyan explains how his company helps Armenian entrepreneurs set up operations in the US.\n\"Imagine an Armenian start-up, two young people deciding to go to the US to try to operate there, they have no connections, no knowledge about the culture how it works.\n\"It's gonna be hard, very hard. We are helping them, it's like the launch of the rocket, the first couple of seconds is the hardest.\"\nSmartGate takes Armenian founders to Silicon Valley and Los Angeles for intensive networking with top US companies and investors.\nBut many Armenian start-ups first test their products in their home market.\nIrina Ghazaryan, is the founder of an app called Dr Yan that is changing how Armenians access healthcare by enabling them to more easily book appointments with doctors.\nMs Ghazaryan was previously working in product and web design when, helped by the fact she comes from a family of doctors, she identified a gap in the market. \"Patients couldn't find the right doctors, and doctors were suffering from endless calls.\"\nThe app operates on a subscription model, with doctors paying to be listed on the platform, and there are plans to expand.\n\"We are growing at least 25% revenue month by month,\" adds Ms Ghazaryan. \"We are almost break-even in Armenia and that gives us strength to start expanding to other markets, like Uzbekistan.\"\nArmenia's tech ecosystem received an unexpected boost in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Thousands of Russian IT specialists left their country, and many chose to settle in Armenia.\nMeanwhile, US chipmaking giant Nvidia moved its Russian office to Armenia.\nVasily is a Russian IT consultant who relocated to Armenia in 2023. \"Armenia was the most friendly to people from Russia in order to help them move, adapt and so on,\" he says.\nHe estimates that that the Russian IT community in Armenia now totals 5,000 to 8,000 people. This influx has said to have filled crucial skill gaps in Armenia's tech sector, in areas such as data processing, cybersecurity, and financial technologies.\nYet Vasily says that Armenia can be expensive and the country needs to reduce the tax burden on IT firms if it wants them to stay in the country.\nHowever, overall optimism remains high about Armenia's tech future. Samvel Khachikyan expects the sector to boom. He points to Service Titan, which floated on the New York Stock Exchange last December, and is now worth more than $10bn.",

        "article_text": "Cristina Horez, an influencer from the Northern city of Iasi \nRomanians are returning to the polls this weekend, following the unprecedented cancellation of presidential elections last December which fuelled protests and nationwide turmoil.\nFar-right candidate Calin Georgescu's shock victory in the first round of elections was annulled amid accusations of Russian interference, suspicious TikTok accounts and secret payments to online influencers. Moscow denied interfering in the election.\nGeorgescu is now banned from running, and was detained, facing a criminal investigation including attempting to overthrow constitutional order. He has denied the charges and accused the authorities of \"inventing evidence to justify stealing the election\".\nThe leader of Romania's far-right AUR party, George Simion, has been polling as the frontrunner in the first round of the election re-run on Sunday.\nHe is followed in the polls by Crin Antonescu of the National Liberal Party and independent candidate Nicu\u0219or Dan.\nAt the centre of this unprecedented political crisis are TikTok influencers accused by the Romanian authorities of participating in social media campaigns which artificially boosted Georgescu's online presence. The BBC has spoken to some of them.\nProtesters took to the streets in March, after it was announced Georgescu couldn't run in the May elections. \nPro-Russian independent candidate Calin Georgescu's victory in the first round of elections came as a surprise.\nGeorgescu was relatively unknown in the months before the election, polling at between 3-5%. \nHe declared a zero campaign budget, had no campaign office and didn't engage in traditional campaigning. \nInstead, he focused on TikTok videos including some showing him riding horses in traditional Romanian outfits, and practising judo. He went viral on TikTok weeks before the election and soared in the polls, ultimately winning almost 23% of the vote.\nAn independent think tank, Expert Forum, published a report saying Georgescu's explosive rise on TikTok was \"created suddenly and artificially - consistent with the way he exploded in the polls\".\nAuthorities say TikTok's algorithm was exploited in the November vote in three different ways: over 100  influencers for hire who posted paid content indirectly promoting Georgescu, thousands of inauthentic accounts whose comments boosted Georgescu on the platform, and finally a \"King of TikTok\" who supposedly paid thousands of dollars to facilitate the campaign.\nThe authorities said that one of these campaigns was \"identical\" to an operation \"run by the Russian Federation in Ukraine\".\nSeparately, declassified intelligence documents also stated that Russia carried out \"cyberattacks, leaks, and sabotage\" in Romania.\nBut authorities still haven't provided any concrete evidence of Russian interference in the election, frustrating many Romanians. \nThe Foreign Intelligence Services and Romanian Police declined to comment on ongoing investigations.\nCalin Georgescu has been barred from running in May's re-run of the election\nShortly before the election, a campaign using the hashtag \"stability and integrity\" flooded Romanian TikTok. Influencers uploaded videos describing what they were looking for in a future president: \"stability\", \"progress\", \"a patriot\". \nThey did not name a specific candidate.\nThey had been paid to upload videos with these messages through a marketing platform called FameUp, which allows brands to hire influencers at scale to promote products. But the influencers say they didn't know who paid for it. \nFameUp declined to comment to the BBC.\nCristina, an influencer from the city of Iasi, says that when she took the job she felt \"there was nothing shady about it\". She says \"in the back of [her] mind\" she thought one of the 14 candidates likely paid for it and she \"just thought it was a smart approach. That's not doing any political propaganda. It's just encouraging people to go out and vote\".\nSome influencers did not mark the posts as paid content. This goes against TikTok rules, where paid political advertising is banned.\nWhile the adverts didn't mention Georgescu's name, influencers we spoke to described a \"wave of comments\" supporting him that appeared under the videos. Romeo Rusu, a micro-influencer from the city of Constanta with 25,000 followers, said: \"Right after I posted the video, within a few seconds, I started receiving dozens of comments. In the end, I received around 300 comments, all backing the independent candidate Calin Georgescu\u2026 I was absolutely surprised.\"\nThe comments came into focus after TikTok stated in a report it had removed a network of over 27,000 inauthentic accounts that \"used fictitious personas to post comments related to the Romanian elections\".\nIt is still not clear who created these bot accounts.\nExperts say that flooding unrelated videos with pro-Georgescu comments was a tactic to game TikTok's algorithm and get his name trending, which would in turn push his content into more users' feeds.\nA TikTok spokesperson told the BBC that, during the presidential campaign, the company \"blocked millions of fake engagement attempts, removed hundreds of thousands of spam accounts, prevented impersonation of political candidates, and disrupted three covert influence networks with limited reach\".\n\"We continue to work closely with local and EU authorities and partner with local organisations to elevate reliable election information,\" they said.\nThe uncertainty around the campaign lasted into the new year, until a surprising twist in January. \nThe Romanian Tax Authority revealed that the #stabilityandintegrity campaign was paid for by the centre-right National Liberal Party (PNL), who were backing their own candidate in the elections. \nIn response, the PNL told Romanian journalists at news outlet Snoop that their campaign was hijacked to support Georgescu.\nRomeo couldn't understand why he'd been named in declassified documents\nThen, in March, TikTok influencer Bogdan Peschir was arrested for \"corrupting voters through electronic means of communication\". Peschir was known across Romania as the \"King of TikTok\", famous for awarding influencers with TikTok gifts, online tokens worth real money.\nThe prosecution is reported to have claimed that Peschir paid over $900,000 to over 250 influencers \"to induce them to vote for \"a certain candidate\" in the presidential elections\" via TikTok gifts. \nHis lawyers are reported to have said \"none of the donations made by Peschir on TikTok were for electoral purposes\".\nWe spoke to Lucian Elgi, a musician and influencer who admitted being paid thousands of dollars by Peschir via TikTok gifts. \nHe says he believes these payments were made in support of his work as a musician. Elgi denied that he promoted Georgescu. The BBC could not confirm this, as his videos on TikTok \u2013 along with those by others who were paid by Peschir's TikTok handle \u2013 have been removed.\nElgi says his content wasn't about the election, but about manele music, a genre of pop-folk music with roots in the Roma community.  Several high-profile manele musicians have been accused of taking payments from Peschir to campaign for Georgescu.\nElgi said this content was flooded in pro-Georgescu comments. \"It was madness,\" he says. \"Every single post, comments like: Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President!\"\nMuch is unknown about the election's annulment. Investigations are ongoing at the European Commission and Romania's highest courts. While Romanians are concerned about the alleged foreign interference, many are outraged that there is still no publicly available evidence undeniably proving Russian interference in the election.\nIt's painstaking and complex work untangling an influence operation and its effects. Razvan Lutac, the Editor of Romanian news outlet Snoop, fears it could take a very long time to get clarity.\n\"We have these small pieces now, like a puzzle,\" he says, \"I think that maybe in a year or two years we will have a complete image of why they cancelled the elections.\"\nAdditional reporting by Georgiana Tudor and Oana Marocico.",

        "article_text": "The US has signed a deal with Kyiv to share profits from the future sale of Ukraine's mineral and energy reserves, after months of tense negotiations.\nThe deal aims to provide an economic incentive for the US to continue to invest in Ukraine's defence and reconstruction - as well as to address Washington's concerns over the amount of aid it has already contributed. \nUkraine is believed to have vast reserves of critical minerals like graphite, titanium and lithium. They are highly sought after because of their use in renewable energy, military technology and infrastructure.\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it showed both sides were committed to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine. \nThe deal will also see the establishment of an investment fund to spur Ukraine's economic recovery from the war. \nAccording to the statement from the US Treasury on Wednesday afternoon, the newly created US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund recognises the \"significant financial and material support\" the US has given Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022. \nThe US treasury secretary said in a video statement that the deal would help \"unlock Ukraine's growth assets\".\nThe language of the announcement shows much more solidarity with Ukraine than is usual for the Trump administration.\nIt refers to \"Russia's full scale invasion\" and adds that \"no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine\".\nThe Kremlin has not yet responded to the agreement.\nFor Kyiv, it is seen as essential to accessing US military aid.\nUkraine's Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko - who flew to Washington to ink the deal on Wednesday - said in a post on X that the new fund would \"attract global investment into our country\". \nListing the deal's provisions, she said it would involve projects in minerals, oil and gas, although the resources would remain the property of Ukraine.\nThe partnership will be equal, on a 50:50 basis, she added, and must be ratified by lawmakers in Kyiv.\nUnder the deal, the US would contribute new assistance to Kyiv, she added, including, for example, air defence systems.\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly pushed for the agreement as a prerequisite to offering any future security guarantees to Kyiv. \nCrucially, the draft of the deal indicates Ukraine will be giving Washington access to some of its natural resources in return for future US security assistance.\nBut that is significantly less than what Trump had wanted, which was to get paid back for all US military aid given since the start of the war.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has managed to eke out some concessions from Washington.\nThe deal was delayed after US authorities said Kyiv was trying to make last-minute changes. \nOn Wednesday afternoon, a US source familiar with the talks criticised Ukraine for seeking to reopen some terms that had apparently been finalised over the weekend.\nThe source said sticking points had included governance of the fund, issues with transparency, and steps to ensure that all funds would be fully traceable.\nTechnical documents were signed last week by representatives of both countries.\nThe initial agreement was due to be signed in February, but fell apart following a heated exchange at the White House when Trump accused Zelensky of \"gambling with World War Three\". \nThe breakthrough comes days after Trump and Zelensky held a face-to-face meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral, and as talks between Moscow and Washington over a possible ceasefire in Ukraine grind on.\nPhoning into the NewsNation network on Wednesday evening, Trump said he had pressed Zelensky at Vatican City to seal the deal.\n\"I was telling him that it's a very good thing if we can produce a deal that you sign it,\" he said, \"because Russia is much bigger and much stronger. Russia is just chugging forward.\"\nThe US president said the deal would recuperate the multi-billion dollar US assistance to Ukraine since the war began and \"much more in theory\".\n\"So I went to them and said, 'Look, we got to get rare earth.' They have great rare earth, meaning certain minerals, materials,\" said Trump.\n\"They have things that a lot of places don't have.

        "article_text": "Vaibhav Suryavanshi has the highest strike-rate of all batters in this year's IPL\nWhy hit a single when you can hit the ball for a six?\nThat was the very question posed by 14-year-old batting sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi to one of his first coaches in professional cricket.\n\"Vaibhav was hitting sixes and fours off almost every ball,\" recalls Manish Ojha, a former first-class cricketer for Jharkhand.\n\"After the session, I said: 'Vaibhav, why are you only hitting boundaries? The state matches are a four-day format and we will need you to take more singles.' He replied: 'Sir, if I can hit a ball for six, why would I take a single off it?' That's when I realised he was ready for the next level.\"\nThat six-hitting lit up the most glamourous of cricketing stages on Monday when the teenager became the youngest player to score a century in men's T20 cricket.\nBatting for Rajasthan Royals against Gujarat Titans, he took down some of the world's best bowlers in a scintillating 38-ball innings that included 11 sixes and seven fours.\nExperienced international bowlers Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Washington Sundar and Rashid Khan were treated with the same disdain as those unlucky 12-year-olds who netted with Suryavanshi a couple of years earlier.\n14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi stuns the IPL\n'Remember the name' - cricket world reacts to Suryavanshi century\nVaibhav's entry to the IPL has been dramatic. He started his career with a six off the first ball he faced and went on to score a hundred in just his third appearance.\nBorn in Samastipur, a small district in India's Bihar, he quickly showed promise. Vaibhav's father, Sanjeev Suryavanshi, himself a club-level cricketer, saw a spark in his son. But there were no proper academies around the district, so he started his training at home from the age of five.\nSanjeev, who used to run a small shop, began to realise his son needed a proper coach. So when Vaibhav turned eight, his father decided to take him to Patna city, a three-hour journey away.\n\"Many people would tell him: 'What are you doing?' But he was the first person to believe in Vaibhav's abilities,\" said Robin Singh, a coach from Bihar.\n\"To ensure his son trained well and got to use the best facilities, his father had to sell a plot of land. His mother had to make a lot of sacrifices too. She would wake up at three in the morning to prepare breakfast for him and would even send food for the coaches.\"\nVaibhav impressed his new coaches in no time.\n\"When I started working with him, I found him quite different from others. You would give him a demo of a technique or a shot, and he would pick it up in no time,\" Ojha said.\n\"Most of the players adopt things easily in practice, but when it comes to playing matches, they fail. But the unique feature about Vaibhav was that he would execute things perfectly even during high-pressure matches.\"\nVaibhav was always ahead of his age group. From his strokeplay to game awareness, he would stand out.\n\"Within 10 days of playing alongside the kids of his age, we realised we were wasting his time. So, we started making him practise with senior players,\" Singh recalled.\nVaibhav would practise daily from 7.30am to 4pm, facing 450 balls each day. By the time he was 12, his coaches were confident enough to let him pursue cricket professionally.\nHe played for the Bihar under-19s team and amassed consistent runs, prompting selectors to name him in the India Under-19s team. Aged just 13, he smashed a 58-ball hundred in a youth Test against Australia.\nHe was soon drafted into Bihar's squad for the Ranji Trophy (India's premier first-class tournament) before becoming the youngest player to get a contract at the IPL auction as Rajasthan signed him for \u00a3103,789 (1.1 crore rupees) in December 2024.\n\"Vaibhav's role model is Brian Lara, so his game is aggressive, and he plays the ball on merit without any fear at all,\" Ojha added.\n\"We expected him to get an IPL contract, and our joy doubled the moment Rajasthan Royals got him because they have [India legend] Rahul Dravid on their coaching staff.\"\nSingh added: \"When he became the youngest to debut in first-class cricket, I told him: 'Anyone can become the youngest. I'll be happy when you become the youngest centurion.' So yesterday he called me up after scoring the century and said: 'Sir, youngest centurion.' And I couldn't be prouder.\"\nAlmost half of the runs Suryavanshi has scored in the IPL (46%) have come through the mid-wicket and long-on region. He is particularly savage against pace bowling, scoring more than 100 runs at a strike-rate of 243 in this season's IPL against the quicker men\nSuryavanshi has already been nicknamed Boss Baby in cricketing circles by those who see comparisons with Chris Gayle, aka The Universe Boss.\nWest Indian Gayle still holds the record for the fastest IPL century, having taken just 30 balls in 2013, while Suryavanshi easily beat the record of 18 years and 118 days for the youngest player to score a T20 century which was previously held by Maharashtra's Vijay Zol.\nSachin Tendulkar - the greatest run-scorer of all time - made his India debut aged just 16, and Suryavanshi's former coach believe he will soon follow The Little Master into the national team.\n\"A guy from a small village in Bihar has made it to the IPL. The whole world is talking about him. So, he knows how to open doors. Don't be surprised if he makes it to international level soon,\" Singh said.\nBefore then, Suryavanshi, who has been gifted almost \u00a39,000 by his state government following his IPL century, has his sights set on title-chasing Mumbai Indians on Thursday, where he comes face-to-face with Jasprit Bumrah, the world's best bowler.\nListen to live commentary on Rajasthan Royals v Mumbai Indians on Thursday, live on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app\nSuryavanshi's century has made the front pages of the newspapers in India \n1 of 3\nIPL auction: Vaibhav Suryavanshi and Rishabh Pant make history\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

Lewis Ludlam beat Ben Hammersley to a grubber kick for the third after a fine passing move, before Harris went in after Tomos Williams, Christian Wade and Ruan Ackermann linked up to set up the Scotland centre.\nExeter's defence continued to struggle as Seb Atkinson strode through a massive gap 22 metres out to go in under the posts for the fifth try after 26 minutes, and it was just as tepid three minutes later when Anscombe got the sixth.\nIt took 32 minutes for Exeter to get into Gloucester's red zone as Paul Brown-Bampoe went close before Exeter lost the ball, although a minute later Josh Hodge at least got his side on the scoreboard when he raced in from 22 metres.\nBut once again Exeter's defence melted as Williams' lovely looping pass started a move that the Welsh scrum-half got on the end of for the seventh try shortly before half-time.\nExeter made five changes five minutes into the second period, but a minute later went further behind when Wade raced on to pick up his own chipped kick and was stopped just short of the Exeter line, only for Ford-Robinson to dot down from an inch or two out a few phases later.\nWade edged closer to the all-time Premiership try record when his chipped kick was gathered by Carreras, before the Argentine full-back gave it back for his 90th try in the league, and Atkinson got his second soon after when Carreras shook off a tackle from Brown-Bampoe to race in from distance to make it 60-7.\nIt continued to get embarrassing for the former European champions as Singleton broke off a lineout maul for the 11th try, 18 minutes into the second half, and the replacement hooker dotted down in the corner five minutes later when Gloucester broke the 70-point mark for the first time in a Premiership match.\nWhen Exeter did think they had scored a try it was ruled out for a forward pass, as Hodge was denied shortly after Singleton's second score, with Exeter's Will Haydon-Wood sin-binned for a tackle off the ball moments later.\nFrom the resulting penalty Gloucester kicked out the corner and Singleton was mauled in for his third try to take it to 79-7 with 11 minutes left, before Will Rigg and Haydon-Wood scored two late consolation tries for a shell-shocked Exeter side.\nGloucester head coach George Skivington told BBC Radio Gloucester:\n\"It's obviously a good day for us. The most pleasing thing for me is the balance of the tries was good.\n\"We've had a tough couple of weeks away from home and we didn't feel the balance of our game was quite right.\n\"But I thought today the boys used the maul well, they used the scrum well and when we attacked we looked really good and our defence as very good as well.\n\"Whilst we're a really good attacking team, we have to have the balance of the game to compete.\"\nExeter head coach Rob Hunter told BBC Radio Devon:\n\"In my many years as a coach that is my lowest point.\n\"You can't put any gloss at all on that. That's a heavy beating and at this stage it's a real kick in the teeth.\n\"In no way at all did we have any foothold in that game - nothing really held up and we gave up momentum so easily.\n\"You've got to not hide away from it, you've got to take responsibility that comes from putting the shirt on, and that will be our first point of call, and then we'll try and sit through the whys and hows.\n\"Right now it's important that we wear it and recognise that that is not an acceptable level of performance from anybody involved.\"\nGloucester: Carreras; Wade, Harris, S Atkinson, Morris; Anscombe, Williams; Rapava Ruskin, Blake, Fasogbon, Clark, Thomas, Clement, Ludlow (capt), Ackermann\nReplacements: Singleton, Ford-Robinson, Gotovtsev, Jordan, Clarke, Englefield, C Atkinson, Cotgreave\nExeter: Hodge; Hammersley, Slade, Hawkins, Brown-Bampoe; Skinner, Armstrong; Sio, Yeandle, Street, Tuima, Jenkins (capt), E Roots, Vintcent, Fisilau\nReplacements: Norey, Blose, Iosefa-Scott, Capstick, Vermeulen, Townsend, Haydon-Wood, Rigg\nYellow card: Haydon-Wood 68\nReferee: Karl Dickson",

        "article_text": "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, has won Canada's election to become the country's next prime minister.\nHe was sworn into the position last month after his predecessor resigned, but called for a snap election that saw Canadians head to the polls on Monday.\nCarney was the first non-British person to take on the top banking role in the central bank's more than 300-year history. He had previously steered his home country through the 2008 financial crash as the governor of the Bank of Canada.\nUnlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney had never held political office. Still, he handily won the Liberal Party contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in early March, and has now been elected by the people.\nHe had touted his experience handling global economic crises, hoping Canadians will see him as the leader mostly likely to stand up to US President Donald Trump who has launched a trade war on his northern neighbour.\nAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.\nWith three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.\nThe son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. \nIn 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs. \n\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race. \n\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"\nIn 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.\nIn 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.\nAlthough central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. \nThat move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.\nHe is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.\nIn 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.\nInterest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.\nConfusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.\nUnlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.\nIn 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.\nBefore the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.\nIn the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.\nHe described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.\nThe Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.\nHis final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\". \nCarney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.\nFrom 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.\nHe was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.\nAlthough he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.\nAfter Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.\n\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said. \n\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"\nHe seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".\nThe Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 60-year-old had brushed off the idea.\n\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.\nThings changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.\nReports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.\nFreeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.\n\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\" \nStill, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. \nThe Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.\nThey have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets over conflict-of-interest concerns. \nCarney has placed his assets in a blind trust and has said he is in full compliance with existing conflict-of-interest rules, but has been pressed for more transparency. \nIn addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.\nHe is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\nOne of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.\nShortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April, though he has in the past advocated for similar policies. \n\"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.\nOn the campaign trail, he has also advocated for making Canada a \"clean and conventional\" energy superpower, and to speed up major project approvals. \nCarney has called himself a \"pragmatist\" when questioned about potential conflicts between his energy policies and his climate values.\nOn immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.\nHis biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.

There he scored 176 runs at an average of 44.He plays first-class cricket for Bihar, a state in eastern India where he grew up, and made his debut aged 12 last January.He has played five Ranji Trophy matches for Bihar and has scored 100 runs with a highest score of 41.Related topicsFranchise CricketCricketIPL 2025 points table and top run-scorers & wicket-takersPublished10 hours ago14-year-old becomes youngest player in IPL historyPublished19 AprilMore on this storyNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 January",

        "article_text": "The UK government has condemned alleged comments made by rap group Kneecap as \"completely unacceptable\" and suggested they should not be able to receive government funding. \nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch blocked a government grant to the bilingual Belfast group while she was business secretary, but the decision was overturned.\nVideo footage has emerged of the group at a concert in November 2023, where one of the band members appears to say: \"The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP\".\nA spokesperson for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he did not think \"individuals expressing those views should be receiving government funding\".\nKneecap have said on social media that they have \"faced a co-ordinated smear campaign\".\nThe footage is being assessed by counter-terrorism police and Badenoch has called for prosecution.\nThe Metropolitan Police said they are assessing that and another video, from November last year, where the footage appeared to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\" at a performance in London.\nThe Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Mich\u00e1el Martin called on the trio to \"urgently clarify\" the comments.\nBoth Hamas and Hezbollah are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\nNone of the members of Kneecap has been charged with any offences.\nIn Dublin on Monday the taoiseach said: \"Have they, or do they, support Hamas and Hezbollah, because that would be unacceptable.\n\"I mean Hezbollah are responsible, in my view, for the murder of Sean Rooney. \n\"And both Hamas and Hezbollah have views that are absolutely... not just views, but participated in terrorist activities and appalling killing of innocent people, as witnessed on October the 7th. \n\"But it's not clear to me that they do, that Kneecap does support Hezbollah and Hamas. It's been asserted that they have made commentary in support of both. I think they need to urgently clarify that.\"  \nHe said there was a \"huge responsibility\" when it comes to the safety of public representatives.\n\"I think it's important that free speech is always facilitated and the capacity to speak out and criticise and condemn policies of others. That's all legitimate. But in terms of life and security and safety of people, that's a different issue,\" he added.\nLast year, Kneecap won a discrimination case against the UK government after Badenoch withdrew arts funding for the band, in a move which was deemed \"unlawful\".  \nKneecap was awarded \u00a314,250 - the same amount they were initially granted.\nBadenoch, speaking on a local election campaigning visit to Lincolnshire, said the statement was \"disgusting \"and the band \"should be prosecuted\" and that \"people are in prison for sending tweets that don't go that far\".\nShe said they \"should not be glorifying terrorism\" and are \"anti-British\".\nNorthern Ireland's Economy Minister Caoimhe Archibald told BBC News NI that she did not agree with what was said, but that Kneecap is \"group that have been very vocal on issues that are important to them like Gaza\".\n\"I think the most outrageous issue facing the world today is the ongoing genocide that we are seeing in Palestine and the bombardment that continues on a daily basis, the blockading of aid, the slaughter of innocent women and children and I think that's what our focus should be on as an international community in bringing an end to that,\" she added. \nDUP leader Gavin Robinson said Kneecap had become a \"hatefest\".\nThe East Belfast MP said the band's position was \"appalling and outrageous\" and said there was a collective political will in London and Dublin to \"call out\" their comments.\n\"These gentlemen don't need to be on a stage they need to be in a courtroom because it is a hate crime what they are doing,\" he added.\nThe Alliance MLA, Sian Mulholland, said that Kneecap's alleged comments \"crosses a line from art as a tool of protest and into incitement\".\nShe described the rap group's political views on the conflict in Gaza as \"valid\" however, Mulholland said the band's views were being \"undermined and overshadowed\" by the group's actions.\nThe First Minister of Scotland, John Swinney, has backed calls for Kneecap to be axed from Glasgow's TRNSMT music festival this summer.\nSpeaking at the Scottish Trades Union Congress in Dundee, John Swinney said the band's alleged comments had \"crossed a line\" and were \"beyond the pale\".\nThere has also been a call by two MPs for the group to be removed from the Glastonbury Festival line-up in June.\nIn a letter to Sir Michael Eavis, a co-creator of the festival, Labour MP David Taylor said it would be \"deeply troubling\" to see the band performing at the event.\nNorth Antrim MP and leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) Jim Allister has written to organisers of the Glastonbury Festival asking them to drop Kneecap from the festival. \nHe said that it was \"wholly unacceptable for a mainstream, UK-wide cultural event to be seen to endorse \u2014 even by implication \u2014 messages of political violence and terror glorification\".\nThe band are listed to play on the Saturday of this year's festival.\nA BBC spokesperson said: \"As the broadcast partner, the BBC will be bringing audiences extensive music coverage from Glastonbury, with artists booked by the festival organisers.\"\n\"The Glastonbury broadcast plans will be considered in the coming weeks, and all output will adhere to our editorial guidelines,\" they added. \nMeanwhile, a spokesperson for a German concert promoter and event producer, FKP GmbH, said Kneecap \"will not be performing at Hurricane or Southside festival this year\" in the country.\nOn Monday, the daughter of a Conservative MP who was stabbed to death at a constituency surgery said the rap group should apologise.\nKatie Amess, whose father Sir David Amess was an MP when he was murdered in 2021, said she was \"gobsmacked at the stupidity of somebody or a group of people being in the public eye and saying such dangerous, violent rhetoric\".\nMs Amess said she would be prepared to meet Kneecap and have a conversation with them.\n\"If they are willing to listen to how my life has been obliterated and will never be the same, for them to say those words is obviously very triggering,\" she said.\nLast week, TV personality Sharon Osbourne said the group should have their United States work visas revoked after they ended their set at Coachella, an annual music festival in California, with pro-Palestinian messages.\nMs Osbourne said that Kneecap \"took their performance to a different level by incorporating aggressive political statements\".\nWhen asked by BBC News NI for response, the band said: \"Statements aren't aggressive, murdering 20,000 children is though.\"",

        "article_text": "Canadians will cast their ballots on Monday in a pivotal election that has been completely transformed by US President Donald Trump.\nThe Conservatives appeared certain to win any contest by a landslide at the start of the year, until Trump's tariffs and barbs about making Canada the \"51st state\" upended the country's politics and injected fresh life into Mark Carney's Liberal Party.\nThe final polls suggest the Liberals are slightly ahead, although the race has tightened in the past week and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre says his party can win.\nThe 36-day campaign ended on a sombre note as party leaders responded to the Saturday evening car ramming that killed 11 people in Vancouver.\nCarney, the incumbent prime minister, cancelled a stop in Hamilton on Sunday morning to address the nation following the attack, which saw an SUV ram into a crowd gathered for a local Filipino festival.\nPoilievre, meanwhile, added a campaign stop in Mississauga, a Toronto suburb, to speak with members of the Filipino community there.\nLater in the day, Carney held a spree of events in three provinces - Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia - in a final push to get out the vote in western Canada, where the Conservatives have more support.\nTrump's decision to impose 25% tariffs on America's northern neighbour and his repeated threats to annex the country as the \"51st state\" fanned deep anger as well as feelings of Canadian nationalism. It led hockey fans to boo the US national anthem before games, a sign of just how suddenly decades of stable US-Canada relations had been shaken.\nThe US president came to dominate on the campaign trail, with the contest being viewed by many as a referendum on how Canada should approach the man fresh into his second term in the White House.\nDuring campaign stops, Carney, 60, often spoke of the need to counter an existential threat from President Trump, who he said was \"trying to break us so the US can own us\".\nHe positioned himself as best fit to lead the country through the present crisis, leaning on his experience as the former central banker for Canada during the Great Recession and for the UK at the Bank of England during Brexit.\nAt a campaign stop in Saskatoon on Sunday, Carney said Canada should strengthen its ties with other \"reliable trade partners\" like the UK and the European Union. Earlier in the election, he said the old relationship that Canada had enjoyed with the US for decades was \"over\".\nMeanwhile, Conservative leader Poilievre made his final stops in Ontario where polls indicate his party is trailing behind. The populous province is home to 122 seats in Parliament out of 343 that could alter the outcome of the election. A party must win 172 seats to have a majority government. The Liberals currently hold 152 seats, the most of any party, but they would have to pick up a significant number of seats to control the House of Commons.\nMuch of Poilievre's messaging has centred on what he has called the \"lost Liberal decade\" under the leadership of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who stepped down earlier this year when his party was ailing in the polls.\nThe Conservative leader frequently drew upon frustrations with soaring housing costs, unaffordability and crime to pitch himself as the change that Canadians need.\n\"We need to vote for change so you can afford food and homes,\" he told supporters at a campaign stop in Peterborough, a city north-east of Toronto.\nAnd with the election shaping up as a race between the Conservatives and the Liberals, smaller parties have struggled to gain traction.\nThe left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP), led by Jagmeet Singh, faces the prospect of losing a number of seats as it trails behind the separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which runs candidates only in the French-speaking province of Quebec.\nSingh cancelled a number of campaign events on Sunday in light of the deadly attack in Vancouver. The NDP leader, who is running for re-election in a Vancouver-area riding, was meeting supporters at the Lapu Lapu festival minutes before the attack. He appeared visibly emotional when he spoke to the media afterwards.\nThroughout the election, Singh called on Canadians to vote for his party's candidates so they can act as a check on power in Ottawa. \nThe Bloc has also struggled, with fears over Trump's threats and Canada's future fuelling anxiety throughout the country and pushing voters towards the bigger federal parties.\nHistorically, Canada has only been led by Liberal or Conservative governments. \nWhile President Trump has been a central figure to Canada's election, he has steered clear of commenting on its outcome.\nBut the Trump administration has continued its rhetoric on taking over Canada. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that \"the president has stated repeatedly he thinks Canada would be better off as a state\".\nPolls will open at 08:30 local time on Monday in Newfoundland and Labrador (12:00 GMT). The election will span across six time zones, with the last polls closing in British Columbia at 19:00 PST (03:00 GMT on Tuesday). \nA record number of Canadians - more than 7 million - have already cast their ballots in advance.",

        "article_text": "John Higgins, Mark Williams and Ronnie O'Sullivan have all been at the top level of snooker for more than 30 years\nAt a combined age of 99, two of snooker's all-time greats go head-to-head on Tuesday as John Higgins takes on Mark Williams with a place in the World Championship semi-finals up for grabs.\nThe sport's legendary 'Class of 92', with Ronnie O'Sullivan completing the trio, have won 14 world titles between them - and are all still going strong this year.\nWilliams turned 50 last month, Higgins reaches his half century 13 days after this year's final with O'Sullivan celebrating his 50th birthday in December.\nBut they have proved that age is just a number.\nCould one of them again go all the way at the Crucible?\nThe first session of their best-of-25 quarter-final takes place on Tuesday at 10:00 BST, with the second session at 19:00 BST, before the match is played to a finish from 10:00 BST on Wednesday\nWilliams has become the oldest man to reach the last eight at the Crucible since six-time winner Steve Davis did so at the age of 52 back in 2010.\nBut one of Williams' fiercest opponents stands in his way.\n\"Twenty years ago, we were really big rivals - now we walk into the practice room and we give each other a nod as if to say: 'How are we still here competing with everybody?'\" said Higgins.\nIt is a sentiment Williams agrees with.\n\"Normally the older you get, the worse you get,\" he said. \"Your eyes are going, everything is going and your stamina drops a bit and you get tired a lot more easier.\n\"But somehow us three are hanging around like a bad smell.\"\nWith O'Sullivan in the opposite half of the draw a final between two of the 'Class of 92', named after the year they turned professional, is a real possibility.\n\"If one of those three players was to win the World Championship, maybe beat a young whippersnapper in the final, what an achievement that would be. Maybe their best ever achievement,\" said Davis.\nFifteen years ago, Davis defeated Mark King 10-9 in the Crucible first round, won 13-11 against a then-34-year-old Higgins, the reigning champion, before losing 13-5 to eventual winner Neil Robertson in the last eight.\n\"It was a fantastic buzz, I maybe ran out of belief,\" recalled Davis.\n\"Hopefully they don't do that. They are much more in touch with the top part of the game than I was.\"\nMark Williams and John Higgins at the China Open in March 2006\nThe trio's achievements are legendary. O'Sullivan has seven world titles, Higgins four and Williams three.\nIf any of them lift the trophy on Monday, 5 May, they would become the oldest winner in the modern era, breaking O'Sullivan's record when he won it three years ago, aged 46.\nThirty-three years ago they were all hungry, driven, talented teenagers with the desire to reach the top.\nWilliams described how he first met Higgins at the final of an event in 1990, when they were both 15.\n\"We played in the final and he beat me,\" said the Welshman. \"It was live on TV and he beat me 6-1, he had five grand for a win, I had three grand for runner-up.\n\"We then played in the British Under-16s in Birmingham and I thrashed him 4-0 after 50 minutes and I got 200 quid so I was a week late.\n\"That was the first time I really remembered John as it was me and O'Sullivan playing in all the junior events when we were 13 and 14.\"\nWilliams and Higgins have their own Crucible history and have met five times, with four victories for Williams, including an 18-16 success in an epic showdown in the 2018 final.\n\"That world final was one of the best games I've ever been involved in and people say it was the best final ever,\" said Williams.\nWilliams hopes eye surgery in June will help to extend his snooker career\nKen Doherty, the 1997 world champion, played against the 'Class of 92' throughout his career and felt this match was \"the tie of the round\".\n\"They've been at the top of the game since 1992, 33 years, and are still at the top and still producing,\" the Irishman said.\n\"As you get older it becomes a lot more difficult as players like me, Stephen Hendry, Alan McManus, Peter Ebdon have all found out. It's hard to cope in terms of tension, intensity and also to be able to devote your life to the game.\n\"You become a father, a family man and it's hard to dedicate themselves to the game but they still have the appetite, willingness and hunger and that's an incredible talent as well.\n\"I've been logging heads with them for 30 years. I've beaten them all but also lost to them all in big finals. I just had great times playing them and you used to relish it as it was a great test of your own game.\"\nDoherty, who is part of the BBC TV team for the competition, felt the atmosphere would be electric.\n\"When you see them coming into the Crucible for their match they will get a standing ovation as they did in the Masters,\" he added. \"We might not see the kind of these three again so we have to enjoy them while we can. They've given the sport great entertainment, great matches and are still delivering.\"\nShaun Murphy tipped Judd Trump, who beat him 13-10 on Monday, to win the title but thought the Williams-Higgins clash would be \"fabulous for the sport\".\nHe added: \"The Class of 92 are three of the best players we've ever seen and it's wonderful we still get to watch them.\n\"None of them would be here if they didn't want to be, they obviously love it enough to put themselves through it.\"\nRonnie O'Sullivan became the oldest man in the modern era to become world champion with his victory over Judd Trump in the 2022 final\nWorld number one Trump will play the winner of Williams-Higgins in the semi-final if he triumphs in his own quarter-final against Luca Brecel.\nTrump felt the veteran trio would continue to feature at the top level for years to come.\n\"They inspired me a little bit, especially Ronnie and John when I was younger,\" said Trump. \"Ronnie was someone I really looked up to.

Along with the greater use of visual aids, the key to successful sessions, explains Grace, was the ability to demonstrate and emphasise exercises.\nA rare positive legacy of the pandemic was the passing of the British Sign Language Act 2022, which made BSL one of the recognised languages of Great Britain.\nWhen she first won the NACs in 2023, Buckle was a novice boxing out of Miquel's gym in Brixton.\nHer triumph at the NACs, when she beat Emily Asquith, a European champion at youth level - despite only having one amateur bout and a handful of white-collar fights under her belt - provided the foundation for a rapid rise.\nBuckle subsequently beat the Kazak Lazzat Kungeibayeva, previously a gold medallist at the world championships, at her first overseas tournament for England.\nShe would go on to win the 2023 Haringey Box Cup, another NAC gold medal in 2024 and the Golden Girl tournament in Sweden in 2025.\n\"You do get natural born fighters,\" says Quinton Shillingford, Buckle's current coach.\n\"It's not just a question of technique and motivation, it's about whether you keep coming forward when you are hurt and have taken a shot.\n\"Grace's mum and dad are both deaf and I know she takes inspiration from them.\n\"She's always saying 'my mum is so strong'. She knows the difficulties they have had to navigate.\"\nBack in the ring, Buckle has not had things all her own way.\nA loss to Celine Lee-Lo of New Zealand at Haringey last year was the catalyst for a move to Shillingford's Heart of Portsmouth gym and her triumph at this years NACs.\n\"I used to think it was a clich\u00e9, but there is a lot of wisdom in the idea, 'that it's not a loss, it's a learning',\" Buckle says.\nClaressa Shields (L) recently fired the women's heavyweight division into the mainstream by becoming undisputed champion\nThe heavyweight division is generally the glamour weight class in boxing, housing the biggest stars and attracting the most attention.\nThe UK's biggest attractions of recent years has been Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury's run as heavyweight world champions.\nBut the women's weight category that has hitherto been neglected.

Nearby boaters used their own vessels to take a number of the ferry passengers to safety. \nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission will handle the crash investigation, helped by the Coast Guard.\nClearwater is on Florida's west coast, near the cities of Tampa and St Petersburg.

It posted graphic footage showing multiple bodies covered in the rubble of a destroyed building.\nA US defence official said the US military's Central Command was aware of the claims of civilian casualties.\nThe strike came hours after Central Command announced its forces had hit more than 800 targets since President Donald Trump ordered an intensification of the air campaign against the Houthis on 15 March.\nIt said the strikes had \"killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders\", including senior officials overseeing missile and drone programmes.\nHouthi-run authorities have said the strikes have killed dozens of civilians, but they have reported few casualties among the group's members.\nThe migrant detention centre in Saada was reportedly holding 115 Africans when it was hit four times shortly before 05:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Monday, according to Al Masirah.\nThe casualty reports could not be immediately verified, but Al Masirah's videos showed first responders recovering the bodies of at least a dozen men among pieces of concrete and metal debris on the floor of a large building with partially destroyed walls and no roof.\nAt a local hospital, another injured man told Al Masirah: \"The strike hit us while we were sleeping, that's it.\"\nFollowing a visit to the scene, the chairman of the Somali community in Yemen,  Ibrahim Cabdulqaadir Macallin, told the BBC: \"It was tragic and horrific... I saw burnt people. We couldn't recognise some of the bodies we saw.\"\nHe said the number of Somali migrants who were killed was \"very small\" because a group had been removed from the detention centre three days earlier, and that the majority of the detainees were Ethiopians.\nHe also said that the facility was in an \"open area\" and \"not near any military base\".\nThe Houthi-run interior ministry condemned what it called the \"deliberate bombing\" of the facility and said it constituted a \"war crime\".\nThe US defence official said Central Command took the claims of civilian casualties very seriously, and that it was currently conducting a battle-damage assessment and inquiry into them.\nThe UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said it was \"deeply saddened by the reports of the tragic loss of life in Saada\".\n\"While IOM has not been operating at this facility, we remain committed to closely monitoring the situation and stand ready to offer support as needed,\" it added.\n\"We call on all parties to the conflict to prioritize the protection of civilians and ensure full respect for international laws.\"\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said teams from the Yemen Red Crescent Society provided lifesaving support by evacuating the wounded to hospitals and were ensuring a dignified management of the dead. \nIn 2022, at least 66 people were reportedly killed when the Saudi-led coalition supporting Yemen's government struck a pre-trial detention facility only 100m (330ft) away from the location of Monday's attack.\nAl Masirah also reported that another eight people had been killed in overnight US air strikes in the Houthi-controlled capital, Sanaa.\nThe statement put out by Centcom late on Sunday said the US had \"intentionally limited disclosing details of our ongoing or future operations\" in order to \"preserve operational security\".\nDespite the devastation and humanitarian crisis in Yemen caused by 11 years of conflict, migrants continue to arrive in the country by boat from the Horn of Africa, motivated by political and economic instability, droughts and other extreme weather events in their own countries.\nMost of them are intending to cross into neighbouring Saudi Arabia to find work. Instead, they face exploitation, detention, violence, and dangerous journeys through active conflict zones, according to the IOM.\nIn 2024 alone, it says, almost 60,900 migrants arrived in the country, often with no means to survive. The majority of them are Ethiopians and Somalis.\nThousands of migrants are thought to be held in detention centres like the one in Saada, but there are no official statistics from the Houthi-run authorities. Rights groups say detainees experience dire conditions, including overcrowding, abuse and poor sanitation.\nEarlier this month, the Houthi-run government said a series of US air strikes on the Ras Isa oil terminal on the Red Sea coast killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others. It said the terminal was a civilian facility and that the strikes constituted a \"war crime\".\nCentcom said the attack destroyed the ability of Ras Isa to accept fuel and that it would \"begin to impact Houthi ability to not only conduct operations, but also to generate millions of dollars in revenue for their terror activities\".\nLast month, Trump ordered large-scale strikes on areas controlled by the Houthis and threatened that they would be \"completely annihilated\". He also warned Iran not to arm the group - something it has repeatedly denied doing.\nOn Sunday, Centcom said it would \"continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region\".\nOn Monday evening, the Houthis' military spokesman said its forces had retaliated for the US \"aggression and massacres against civilians\" by targeting the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier battle group with \"a number of cruise and ballistic missiles and drones\".\nHe also said the group had launched a drone towards the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon. Israel's military announced earlier that it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen.\nSince November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.\nThe Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.\nThe Houthis were not deterred by the deployment of Western warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to protect merchant vessels last year, or by multiple rounds of US strikes on military targets ordered by former President Joe Biden.\nAfter taking office in January, Trump redesignated the Houthis as a \"Foreign Terrorist Organisation\" - a status the Biden administration had removed due to what it said was the need to mitigate the country's humanitarian crisis.\nYemen has been devastated by a civil war, which escalated in 2015 when the Houthis seized control of the country's north-west from the internationally-recognised government, and a Saudi-led coalition supported by the US intervened in an effort to restore its rule.\nThe fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered a humanitarian disaster, with 4.8 million people displaced and 19.5 million - half of the population - in need of some form of aid.",

It looks like Fifa career mode.\"\nAnother claimed: \"I think this may be the most commonly agreed worst tifo of all time given the circumstances.\"\nWhile a third said: \"Arsenal turned down the fans' tifo design request to produce this monstrosity. Champions League semi-final and this was the best they could come up with? So disappointed.\"\nAccording to former England striker Wayne Rooney, working as a TV pundit, the atmosphere at the Emirates on Tuesday was in contrast to the Real Madrid game.\nBefore that match, supporters in each block of the stadium held up red and white cards above their heads.\n\"For Arsenal, I was a bit disappointed with how they played, disappointed with the fans as well,\" Rooney told Amazon Prime.\n\"I thought tonight they were a bit subdued, almost like an anti-climax that they beat Real Madrid and were going to walk into the final and win the competition.\"\nThis video can not be played\nArteta reacts to defeat against PSG in Champions League semi-final\nWhy Arsenal can still reach Champions League final\nArsenal fan writer Laura Kirk: \"One of the fan groups Ashburton Army had raised some money for a tifo which was ultimately rejected by the club, I imagine because the designs were not in keeping with the club's brand but the club haven't actually said anything. \n\"In comparison with what we see elsewhere in Europe, like the one Real Madrid had against us last week, it just felt like a massively missed opportunity to do something amazing.\"\nOli Price-Bates from The Fresh Arsenal Podcast: \"The tifo from the club was certainly a bit underwhelming. The occasion deserved more from the club to help with the atmosphere and fan engagement. \n\"Certainly if Arsenal get to this stage again, they need to be better prepared and involve the fans in the process, not just in tifos but the wider experience and build-up for the match. \n\"Hopefully we won't wait so long for another semi-final and the club will be better prepared to make more impact.\"\nBroadcaster and Arsenal fan Harry Symeou: \"I think the fans were hoping to see something with a bit more of a wow factor. Given there was lots of talk online with regards to some more elaborate, striking designs - you can understand why some felt underwhelmed.\n\"Tifos on the continent tend to be more creative and really can set the scene ahead of a huge occasion. Fan groups, in particular those known as 'ultras' normally have a big input - leading to a higher rate of fan satisfaction. But this is something we don't do well enough in English football generally. If as a club, you're going to take it upon yourselves to both plan and execute such displays, you've got to deliver something with far more imagination than that.\"\nCrystal Palace's tifo prior to their FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa.\nManchester United's tifo prior to their Europa League fixture against Lyon.\nAston Villa's tifo prior to their Champions League tie with Paris St-Germain.\n1 of 3\nOn the whole?

        "article_text": "The Spanish grid operator has ruled out a cyber attack as the cause of a massive power cut that crippled Spain, Portugal and parts of France on Monday. \nRed El\u00e9ctrica's operations director Eduardo Prieto said preliminary findings suggest \"there was no kind of interference in the control systems\" to imply an attack, echoing Portuguese Prime Minister Lu\u00eds Montenegro the day before.\nBut the exact reason behind the cut is still unclear. \nThe grid operator said on Tuesday they \"cannot draw conclusions\" until they get concrete data. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said investigators were trying to pinpoint the cause, and then would take all necessary measures \"to ensure that this does not happen again.\"\nInformation is trickling out about what happened at the time of the cut, leading to theories about what could have caused it. Experts told the BBC it was likely caused by several failures.\nHere is what we know and what questions remain unanswered.\nFollow live: Travel chaos continues\nS\u00e1nchez on Monday evening said 15GW of power - the equivalent to 60% of demand at that time - was \"suddenly lost from the system... in just five seconds\".\nMr Prieto said during a news conference on Tuesday that there were two \"disconnection events\" barely a second apart in the south-west of Spain, where there is substantial solar power generation.\nOne issue that the Spanish grid operator may have been referring to was when power companies identify a mismatch of supply and demand for electricity that could lead to instability, and disconnect temporarily in order to protect their systems.\nHowever, S\u00e1nchez later said the power cut was \"not a problem of excessive renewables\". He said there was not a failure of coverage - meaning supply - and there was a relatively low demand for electricity that was quite normal in the days running up to the crisis.\nSo what exactly happened? It is unclear, especially as many systems fail in electricity supply quite frequently, not only renewables, and outages on this scale happen somewhere in the world around once a year on average.\nThe mismatch between supply and demand of electricity can change the frequency of the electricity grid, which is 50HRZ in Europe and the UK.\nIf that frequency changes out of a narrow range, it could lead to damage to equipment.\n\"When a big company detects that the frequency is moving out of their tolerance, they can go offline to protect their equipment,\" said Prof Hannah Christensen at the University of Oxford.\nIf lots of companies do that in quick succession, it can have \"cascading effects\" and lead to a black-out, she added.\nBut when it comes to renewables, operators have very accurate short-term weather forecasts to predict when there will be a surplus of wind of solar power, so they adjust power supply accordingly, Prof Christensen said.\nRenewable power has different challenges to fossil fuel energy \"because of its intermittency\", she said, but it is a well-known issue that is planned for.\n\"It is a little perplexing that this wouldn't have been predicted,\" she said.\nProf Keith Bell, at the University of Strathclyde, added that \"if a system is relying on solar and wind, they design a system to reflect that,\" suggesting that the additional supply of energy from renewables will not have been a surprise to the grid.\n\"Spain has a lot of experience of wind and solar, and a long-standing system of forecasting weather and its impacts,\" he said.\n\"All sorts of systems fail,\" he added. \"Things can and do go wrong, whether that is from renewables, fossil fuels or nuclear power. This could be the Swiss cheese model, where the holes in the system have happened to align.\"\nRed El\u00e9ctrica also suggested that the drop of power caused a grid interconnection between Spain and France to trip.\nTwo basic technologies are used to interconnect parts of a grid or countries - a standard transmission line that carries alternating currents, and increasingly, high voltage direct current lines called AC/DC lines.\nSpain has an AC/DC line that came into service seven years ago, meaning it is well-tested, Prof Bell said.\nThe Iberian peninsula is often referred to as an \"electricity island\" because it relies on just a few connections through the Pyrenees to France, meaning it can be vulnerable to failures.\nS\u00e1nchez said power was brought back online thanks to connections with France and Morocco as well as gas and hydropower sources.\nPortugal's grid operator REN refuted initial reports, attributed to the agency on Monday, which said the blackout was caused by a rare atmospheric event.\nThe message in Portuguese said that \"due to extreme temperature variations in the interior or Spain, there were anomalous oscillations in the very high voltage lines (400 KV), a phenomenon known as 'induced atmospheric vibration'\".\n\"These oscillations caused synchronisation failures between the electrical systems, leading to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network.\" \nHowever, REN spokesman Bruno Silva told AFP on Tuesday that the grid operator \"did not put out this statement,\" without giving further details.",

By doubling the rate of building, Carney hopes to have a supply of 500,000 new homes a year.\nThe Liberals want to create a standalone federal entity that would act as a developer for affordable housing. They plan to use this body to supply tens of billions of Canadian dollars in debt-financing for prefabricated home builders.\nLike people in other countries, Canadians have been grappling with higher prices for everyday goods while wages have failed to keep up - an issue over which Carney's party was criticised while under the stewardship of his predecessor Justin Trudeau. \nThe Liberals have proposed a slight tax cut for those in the lowest  bracket, who are due to see their rate reduce from 15% to 14%.\nCarney's party has also vowed to scrap sales taxes on homes under C$1m ($720,000; \u00a3540,000) for first-time buyers.\nIt also wants to make dental care available to lower-income Canadians by extending a national insurance programme to 4.5 million people aged 18 to 64. The plan currently covers children, the elderly and some disabled Canadians.\nThe Liberals have vowed to maintain the push on reducing emissions - as part of the fight against climate change - while ensuring Canadian companies are still competitive.\nCarney has promised to build a national \"east to west\" electricity grid to reduce energy dependence on the US.\nOne of his first moves as PM, before the election, was to repeal Trudeau's unpopular carbon pricing programme, which was designed to give financial incentives for people and firms to turn away from fossil fuels.\nBut Carney maintained a similar tax on large carbon emitters.\nIn his victory speech, he said: \"It's time to build Canada into an energy superpower in both clean and conventional energy.\"\nCarney has vowed to raise defence spending to 2% of Canada's GDP, which is the target for all countries in the Nato military alliance. Last year, it spent less than 1.4%.\nTrump has been critical of countries not meeting the 2% benchmark, and says Canada relies too much militarily on the US.\nAnd Trump's pursuit of Canada as a \"51st state\" of the US has focused minds north of the border on their own security independence.\nThe Liberals say they will spend C$18bn on defence over the next four years, which will go to purchasing new equipment like submarines and heavy icebreakers that can be used in Canada's north.\nCarney has pledged to find new ways to trade in light of the impediments placed on cross-border commerce by Trump's tariffs regime. \nIn his speech on Tuesday, Carney vowed new \"trade and energy corridors working in partnership with the provinces, territories, and Indigenous peoples\".\nAmong his plans are an \"all-in-Canada\" network for vehicle parts, under which more manufacturing will happen domestically - meaning less reliance on imports from the US.\nThe Liberals also want to invest C$5bn in national ports, railways, roads and other infrastructure that would help the country further diversify its trading partners.",

We'll see you around the world, this is just the beginning.\"\nPerry left a comment expressing her gratitude, telling fans: \"I love you guys and have grown up together with you and am so excited to see you all over the world this year! \n\"Please know I am OK, I have done a lot [of] work around knowing who I am, what is real and what is important to me.\"\nShe said she is \"not perfect\", but rather on a \"human journey playing the game of life with an audience of many and sometimes I fall\".\n\"But I get back up and go on and continue to play the game and somehow through my battered and bruised adventure I keep looking to the light and in that light a new level unlocks.\"\nShe added: \"When the 'online' world tries to make me a human Pi\u00f1ata, I take it with grace and send them love, cause I know so many people are hurting in so many ways and the internet is very much so a dumping ground for unhinged and unhealed.\"\nThe singer, whose hits include Roar, Firework and I Kissed A Girl, has just started a world tour, which will run until December and visit the US, Canada, South America, Canada, Europe and the United Arab Emirates.\nPerry said she was looking forward to \"seeing your faces every night, singing in unison, reading your notes, feeling your warmth\".

Certainly I have longer legs and I always have huge bruises on my body from driving the car just because the seat is poking me in the wrong places.\"\nDespite the discomfort, the chance to step into the JPS Lotus 97T in which his late uncle achieved his first grand prix victory at a rainy Estoril on 21 April 1985 is always a huge thrill for Bruno Senna.\nNot just because Ayrton Senna is unquestionably one of the all-time greats of Formula 1, but also because he sees it as a way of maintaining an emotional connection to his life and racing legacy.\nThe statistics are simple - Ayrton Senna won three Formula 1 World Drivers' Championship titles, 41 grands prix and took pole on 65 occasions.\nHis rivalries with other drivers, primarily France's Alain Prost, but also Nigel Mansell and Michael Schumacher, are among the most epic in the sport's history. \nBut although those world titles were all achieved for McLaren, Bruno believes the 1985 Lotus was something special.\n\"It's probably the most beautiful livery ever in F1,\" he told BBC Radio Northampton. \n\"It's a very iconic, classic livery, the black and gold colour scheme. Everybody who knows anything about motor racing will recognise this car.\n\"When you look at the modern cars, they're so big and so complicated, this is like the polar opposite. They're small, they're simple and it makes you sort of sit on the road with a rocket on your back.\" \nBruno also competed in Formula 1, from 2010 to 2012, and believes modern drivers are \"spoiled\" when it comes to the machinery provided for them.\nHe stepped into the Lotus at the Goodwood 82nd Members' Meeting and described it as a \"real visceral experience\".\nThe 41-year-old said: \"I raced in modern cars my whole life and they are so refined, so simple and easy. When you drive these things it's such a stressful experience because the smallest mistake you make and it's game over.\"\n1985: Ayrton Senna and his Lotus F1 car\nSporting Witness: The fatal crash of Ayrton Senna\nKeeping the Ayrton Senna brand and legacy alive\nAyrton Senna beat Alain Prost and Keke Rosberg at the 1985 Portuguese GP\nOn 1 May, it will be exactly 31 years since Ayrton Senna died in a crash at the Tamburello corner at Imola at the age of only 34.\nHe was given a state funeral and his memory lives on thanks to the work of the Instituto Ayrton Senna, which was founded by his sister.\n\"In all sports people remember the greatest, but Ayrton sort of went above that. He was someone people connected with on the very personal side, rather than just admiring a successful sportsman,\" said Bruno.\n\"I think it's mostly because of what he stood for, what he believed in and how strongly he carried that message.\n\"When you see young kids born decades after Ayrton passed away being so passionate about him, it's because their parents or grandparents carry this on and they identify with this.\"\nHe continued: \"It's amazing that this legacy stays so strong. We are very proud of it because we believe the world needs a lot of Ayrton's values to be a better place, and the 30th anniversary (of his death) last year was a huge celebration of his legacy.\"\nBruno Senna drove in other championships including Formula E, sports cars and endurance racing\nBruno was only 18 months old when his uncle triumphed at Estoril, a victory that always remained special throughout his career.\n\"He'd always been someone who puts so much pressure on himself to deliver and I think this moment allowed him to get into his own groove and then achieve everything he achieved afterwards,\" he said.\n\"When I was three or four years old I remember watching his races but by then he was with McLaren. I didn't watch many of these Lotus races live, I watched them on replays but always the family was rooting for him back home.\n\"He was my hero and I was driving go-karts when I was five years old, so obviously I was trying to follow in his footsteps from a very early age.\"\nBruno was always fascinated to hear his uncle speak about Prost and his other rivals.\n\"In Portuguese you have so many specific expressions that don't mean anything in other languages, but he had so much respect for Alain, even at the height of their rivalry.\n\"It was a lot of fun talking to him about some races where something went wrong or something went right, he understood the challenge he had from his opponents and the whole racing career built him to what he was.\"\nSo how did it feel for him to step behind the wheel of the Lotus 97T at Goodwood, apart from the difficulty of fitting into the driver's seat?\n\"I think the moment you kind of feel emotional about it is when you do the in-lap and you're just cruising around, cooling the car.\n\"Then you can sort of interact with the crowd a little bit and see what their faces are expressing. It means so much to the people.... a lot of them never even saw this car on the race track and having this opportunity really is a special thing.\nHe added: \"We're so happy the classic Team Lotus keep this car in such great shape, but the human element here is as important as the machine.\"\nListen to The Motorsport Show on BBC Radio Northampton at 6pm on Tuesday.",

        "article_text": "The government has made very little progress in preparing the UK for the growing threats posed by rising temperatures since coming to power, its climate watchdog has warned.\nIn a highly critical report, the independent Climate Change Committee says progress is \"either too slow, has stalled, or is heading in the wrong direction\".\nFrom hospitals and care homes to food and water supplies, this could leave the UK vulnerable to serious economic and health impacts in the decades ahead, the CCC warns.\nIn response, the government pointed to its investment in flood defences, but acknowledged more work was needed. \nFloods Minister Emma Hardy told BBC News that preparing for the changing climate was \"something we're really committed to\".\n\"We are putting \u00a32.65bn into upgrading, maintaining and building new flood defences.\n\"But we absolutely know, of course, there's more that needs to be done.\"\nFuelled by climate change, the UK's weather extremes are intensifying, from the 40C heat of July 2022 to England's wettest 18 months on record between October 2022 to March 2024.\nSuch events are only likely to become more severe and happen more often, as the planet continues to get hotter due to humanity's emissions of planet-warming gases.\nBetter preparation can limit the damage by making the country more resilient, but the CCC says this is not happening at anywhere near the required pace.\n\"We are seeing climate impact happening faster and more intensely and increasing [but] government just doesn't yet seem to be taking it seriously,\" Baroness Brown, chair of the Adaptation Committee at the CCC, told BBC News.\n\"The manifesto said it was going to address this issue of resilience and yet, so far, it's done nothing,\" she added.\n\"We've heard some warm words\u2026 but nothing has come out yet.\"\nNone of the 46 areas assessed were found to be making \"good\" progress in adapting to climate change. Only three had \"good\" plans and policies in place for the future.\nThese are mostly unchanged from the CCC's last report in 2023.\nHealth is one of the areas that remains most poorly prepared.\nThe CCC points to the rising number of deaths linked to extreme heat and hospitals themselves being vulnerable to hot weather.\nBaroness Brown highlights the case of Guy's and St Thomas', the biggest hospital trust in London, which was hit by a failure to its data centres during the extreme heat of July 2022.\nThis meant it was unable to operate its appointments system at a time of intense demand, and it had to move to paper appointments.\n\"We lost thousands of crucial appointments for people for critical tests,\" she said.\n\"We're trying to improve the NHS. Unless we take into account that it has to be resilient to the climate, we're going backwards.\"\nFlooding is another challenging area. Plans and policies to ensure places are resilient to river and coastal flooding are found to have worsened since the CCC's previous report.\nThe ancient town of Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire is a case in point. It's been flooded repeatedly in the last four years, most recently in November 2024.\nPolly Pearce described how her charity shop flooded.\n\"It was so quick...  [like] a tsunami,\" she said.\n\"[The water] came up as high as the panelling right up on the wall... we had all our Christmas stuff ready but lost it.\"\nThe main street is studded with empty shops, many reportedly put out of business by the cost of repeated floods. \nShop owners say insurance companies either won't insure their properties or that the premiums are now so high many shop keepers say they simply can't afford it.\nAnd the Environment Agency has said it can't afford the \u00a325m-\u00a330m cost of flood protection for the town. \nThe government says it is committed to helping residents, however, and that work to improve the flood resilience of properties will begin in the summer.\nThe CCC notes progress in some other areas of climate adaptation, such as plans to identify risks to businesses and financial institutions.\nAt the heart of these discussions is the question of cost.\nBut putting off efforts to prepare the UK for the changing climate in an attempt to save cash would be \"a huge mistake\" and could increase economic damage in the long run, Baroness Brown said.\n\"We are very worried about their spending review,\" she added, in an unusually strong plea from the Committee.\n\"This is not a tomorrow problem; it's a today problem. If we don't address it today, it becomes a disaster tomorrow.\"\nA freedom of information request submitted by the BBC found there are just 18 members of staff working fully on climate adaptation at the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra).\nThat's just 0.3% of Defra's nearly 6,600 full-time-equivalent core staff.\nDefra said some of these employees also worked on climate adaptation part-time, and the figures don't include those working in other parts of government.\n\nAdditional reporting by Miho Tanaka\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

        "article_text": "The latest in the superhero franchise \"is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun\", with a \"charismatic\" Florence Pugh at its centre, writes Nicholas Barber.\nEver since Avengers: Endgame came out in 2019, the subtitle has felt a lot more appropriate than the studio might have liked. It's not that Marvel hasn't had any hits in the 2020s, but it is no longer releasing an unbroken chain of talked-about blockbusters, nor is it keeping audiences invested in a story that threads through all of them. That particular game has come to an end.\nThe Marvel films that have worked best since Endgame are the ones that have moved furthest away from the pattern set by the so-called \"Infinity Saga\" \u2013 the first 22 instalments in the franchise, which pivoted around a fight against uber-villain Thanos. Last year's R-rated Deadpool & Wolverine used almost no characters from the main Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU); the postmodern Spider-Man: No Way Home paid tribute to the Spider-Man films which weren't made by Marvel Studios; and the latest Marvel film, Thunderbolts*, has its own distinct identity, too. That's not to suggest that it isn't a part of the MCU. In fact, one of its clever touches is that it specifically addresses how gloomy people feel in a world where Iron Man, Thor and Captain America are no longer around. But the director, Jake Shreier, and the screenwriters, Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo, have come up with an unruly take on the superhero genre which makes it the most refreshing MCU offering in years.\nThe key is that, rather than trying to be as glossy and expansive as the Infinity Saga films, Thunderbolts* is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun. It isn't the epic tale of indestructible titans saving the Universe, let alone the multiverse; it's a comedy-tinged caper about bungling secret agents who are deemed a liability by the very company that used to employ them. It's not a new scenario: after The Bourne Identity, there were countless action films in which disavowed spies dodged their erstwhile handlers. But Thunderbolts* stands out because it has a whole group of such spies: a ragtag bunch of depressive, dysfunctional loners who must work together and can't stop grumbling about it. What's especially unusual about the film, in Marvel terms, is that its premise would be viable even if the characters weren't super-powered. And, indeed, they aren't all that super-powered compared to the aforementioned Captain America and Thor. Part of their appeal is that they can be killed by bullets and trapped in rooms with locked doors, which makes them a lot easier to relate to than Norse gods.\nThere's a lesson there that the makers of such disappointments as Eternals and The Marvels should have learnt. It's not the characters' powers that count; it's their personalities. In Thunderbolts*, those characters are Yelena (Florence Pugh), a Russian assassin who was the adoptive sister of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and is now deeply miserable about all the mindless violence in her life; her adoptive father, Red Guardian (David Harbour), a washed-up slob who is nostalgic for his days as a national hero; the bionic-armed Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who was Captain America's sidekick in World War Two, and still seems uncomfortable in the 21st Century; John Walker (Wyatt Russell), an embittered super-soldier who was supposed to be the new Captain America, but wasn't up to the job; the confused, conflicted Bob (Lewis Pullman), another flawed attempt to create a Captain America substitute; and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), who is a science experiment gone wrong \u2013 but who, unlike the other characters, isn't very well defined beyond that. In various ways, they are all connected to one of Marvel's most memorably slippery villains, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a businesswoman with all the brittle, condescending confidence that you might expect from the reliably excellent star of Seinfeld and Veep.\nDe Fontaine, it seems, has been behind several superhero-related black ops. Now that her political opponents are closing in on her, she decides to destroy all the evidence of her shady undertakings, including the people who carried them out. And so it is that Yelena and the others switch from trying to kill each other to trying to keep each other alive. They become a sort-of team, but they aren't sure whether or not to call themselves the Thunderbolts, so the asterisk in the title signifies that it's just a placeholder name until they can think of something better.\nThunderbolts*\nDirector: Jake Schreier\nCast: Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, Olga Kurylenko, Lewis Pullman, Geraldine Viswanathan, Chris Bauer, Wendell Pierce, David Harbour, Hannah John-Kamen, Julia Louis-Dreyfus\nRuntime: 2hr 16min\nOne small snag is that most of the characters' back stories are in other films, and in a TV series, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, rather than in Thunderbolts* itself. Another snag is that the gang's pursuit by De Fontaine's troops accounts for the majority of the film's running time, so there aren't many set pieces that haven't been in the trailers already. On the other hand, superhero films are rarely so tightly focused, and rarely progress so seamlessly from scene to scene, with no pausing for breath, and no sudden jumps to different ends of the Earth. Captain America: Brave New World, which came out in February, was similar to Thunderbolts* in that it revolved around Washington DC politics, and followed on from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. But that film was a messy sprawl, whereas this one is so neatly plotted that you can get the gist and enjoy the ride whether you're a Marvel nerd or not.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A combat epic that 'does what film does best'\n\u2022 Disney's Snow White has a major 'identity crisis'\n\u2022 Mickey 17 is a 'disappointment' \nThe underlying issues in Thunderbolts* are just as focused as the narrative. The characters all have to deal with the shame and trauma of their troubled pasts \u2013 and this theme is there from the opening scene to the requisite Final Battle, which is slightly rushed, but stylishly surreal enough to recall two mind-bending films written by Charlie Kaufman, Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In between, the characters' guilt is explored in some touching and surprisingly brutal sequences, as well as in some sharply-scripted, briskly-edited and skilfully-performed comic scenes.\u00a0\nAt both ends of the spectrum, Pugh delivers a performance which would win her awards if it weren't in a superhero film. She delivers her punchlines with expert timing, especially when she is bickering and bantering with Red Guardian. But she can also radiate raw emotion \u2013 and all while maintaining a decent Russian accent and cartwheeling through her acrobatic fight scenes. When it comes down to it, that's why Thunderbolts* is so much better than most of Marvel's post-Endgame films. It's not just because it's a rough-edged, big-hearted spy thriller about lovably clueless anti-heroes. It's because it has an actor as charismatic as Pugh at its centre.\u00a0\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\u00a0--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

The teachers' pay review body makes recommendations for England only but the NHS pay review body covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Public sector pay is set through a separate process in Scotland.\nThe recommendation of an above-inflation pay rise for teachers is likely to be because of ongoing concerns about staff recruitment and retention in schools.\nThese have been raised in previous pay recommendations. \nCalculations by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) show that, despite the 5.5% average cash pay rise teachers received in 2024-25, the average pay of most teachers in that year - when adjusted for inflation - was still lower than than it was back in 2010.\nIn the case of the most experienced teachers, pay was 9% lower than it was 15 years ago in real terms.\nOfficial government data also shows widening gaps between the recruitment figures for teachers in specific subjects and their recruitment targets.\nJust 17% of the target for secondary school physics teacher recruitment was achieved in 2023-24, down from 42% in 2019-20.\nOverall teacher recruitment was 62% of the target, down from 87% in 2019-20\nWe do not know what all the individual pay recommendations from the review bodies will be, but Verify has done some calculations that give a rough sense of the potential impact.\nOverall UK public sector pay in 2023-24 was \u00a3272bn, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nThe previous Conservative government had budgeted for a 2% cash increase in public sector pay in 2024-25.\nAnd last July, Labour said the cost of meeting the full 2024-25 pay recommendations would be an additional \u00a39.4bn.\nThat implies that total public sector pay in 2024-25 will have been roughly \u00a3287bn, which is around a fifth of total government spending.\nSo, if the total bill across the public sector for 2025-26 went up by another 3% - rather than 2.8% - that would imply the government needing to find about an extra \u00a3550m.\nBut if it went up by 4% it would imply the need to find around an extra \u00a33.5bn.\nThe government said in the 2024 Autumn Budget that it would seek to fund any pay rises above what departments have budgeted for not by raising taxes or more borrowing but by \"productivity improvements\".\nIn other words, departments would have to accommodate the additional pay rise by making cuts elsewhere in their budgets.\nThe government has reiterated this, with the prime minister's spokesperson telling reporters in December 2024 that: \"For pay awards to go beyond inflation they will have to be met by productivity improvements.\"\nThe National Education Union (NEU), England's largest teaching union, has already said it would resist any further effective cuts to the overall education budget.\nAnd it is demanding any pay rise for teachers be fully funded with new money.\nThe NEU said in April 2025 that it would vote on taking strike action if the government stuck with its 2.8% pay offer for the 2025-26 academic year.\nAnd when the government indicated in December 2024 that it could only afford a 2.8% pay rise in the health sector in England, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing both said the figure was too low.\nThe government funded last year's above inflation pay increase for public sector workers by increasing employers' National Insurance contributions and Chancellor Rachel Reeves said in November that she did not want to increase taxes again this Parliament.\nAs for borrowing, she has left herself only \u00a39.9bn of \"headroom\", or leeway, against hitting her chosen fiscal rules in 2029-30 and taking on additional debt to pay for higher public sector pay would risk being on course to breach her rules.\nBut analysts also warn that it will be far from easy to pay for higher pay through increased public sector productivity.\n\"If the pay recommendations come in higher than what departments have planned for, that will create a budgeting challenge,\" says Ben Zaranko of the IFS. \n\"If no additional funding is forthcoming, it will force ruthless prioritisation and tough choices elsewhere. Public service leaders are already being asked to find major efficiency savings, and there is a limit to what is realistic.\"\nAdditional reporting by Anthony Reuben\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

Calculations by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) show that, despite the 5.5% average cash pay rise teachers received in 2024-25, the average pay of most teachers in that year - when adjusted for inflation - was still lower than than it was back in 2010.In the case of the most experienced teachers, pay was 9% lower than it was 15 years ago in real terms.Official government data also shows widening gaps between the recruitment figures for teachers in specific subjects and their recruitment targets.Just 17% of the target for secondary school physics teacher recruitment was achieved in 2023-24, down from 42% in 2019-20.Overall teacher recruitment was 62% of the target, down from 87% in 2019-20How much would it cost to meet these higher pay settlements?We do not know what all the individual pay recommendations from the review bodies will be, but Verify has done some calculations that give a rough sense of the potential impact.Overall UK public sector pay in 2023-24 was \u00a3272bn, according to the Office for National Statistics.The previous Conservative government had budgeted for a 2% cash increase in public sector pay in 2024-25.And last July, Labour said the cost of meeting the full 2024-25 pay recommendations would be an additional \u00a39.4bn.That implies that total public sector pay in 2024-25 will have been roughly \u00a3287bn, which is around a fifth of total government spending.So, if the total bill across the public sector for 2025-26 went up by another 3% - rather than 2.8% - that would imply the government needing to find about an extra \u00a3550m.But if it went up by 4% it would imply the need to find around an extra \u00a33.5bn.Where would the money come from?The government said in the 2024 Autumn Budget that it would seek to fund any pay rises above what departments have budgeted for not by raising taxes or more borrowing but by \"productivity improvements\".In other words, departments would have to accommodate the additional pay rise by making cuts elsewhere in their budgets.The government has reiterated this, with the prime minister's spokesperson telling reporters in December 2024 that: \"For pay awards to go beyond inflation they will have to be met by productivity improvements. \"What have the unions said?The National Education Union (NEU), England's largest teaching union, has already said it would resist any further effective cuts to the overall education budget.And it is demanding any pay rise for teachers be fully funded with new money.The NEU said in April 2025 that it would vote on taking strike action if the government stuck with its 2.8% pay offer for the 2025-26 academic year.And when the government indicated in December 2024 that it could only afford a 2.8% pay rise in the health sector in England, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing both said the figure was too low.Why does the government not fully fund the recommended pay rise?The government funded last year's above inflation pay increase for public sector workers by increasing employers' National Insurance contributions and Chancellor Rachel Reeves said in November that she did not want to increase taxes again this Parliament.As for borrowing, she has left herself only \u00a39.9bn of \"headroom\", or leeway, against hitting her chosen fiscal rules in 2029-30 and taking on additional debt to pay for higher public sector pay would risk being on course to breach her rules.But analysts also warn that it will be far from easy to pay for higher pay through increased public sector productivity. Public sector pay is set through a separate process in Scotland.No extra cash for higher pay deals, says Downing StreetWhy would the teachers' pay review body recommend 4%?The recommendation of an above-inflation pay rise for teachers is likely to be because of ongoing concerns about staff recruitment and retention in schools.These have been raised in previous pay recommendations. The teachers' pay review body makes recommendations for England only but the NHS pay review body covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland.",

        "article_text": "Mark Carney's Liberals have won Canada's federal election - riding a backlash of anti-Trump sentiment to form the next government.\nIt is a stunning political turnaround for a party who were widely considered dead and buried just a few months ago.  \nIt's not yet clear if the party - which has been in power for almost a decade - will be able to secure a majority as results continue to roll in. \nEither way, the prime minister faces major challenges, including divisions in the country laid bare by the campaign. \nHere are five takeaways from an election which saw the Conservative opposition make major gains but still lose. \nThere is no doubt the US president's tariff threats and comments undermining Canada's sovereignty played an outsized role in this election, suddenly making leadership and the country's economic survival the defining issues of the campaign.\nMark Carney used it to his advantage, running as much against Trump as he did against his main opposition rival, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre.\nCarney warned Canada was at a crisis moment, saying frequently on the campaign trail - and in his victory speech - that Trump \"wants to break us so America can own us\".\nPoilievre brought Trump up much less frequently during the campaign, focusing his message on domestic issues - the cost of living, the housing affordability crisis, and crime - and targeting the Liberals for their record on those matters.\nCarney - who has declared the old relationship with the US \"over\" - plans to start negotiations on a new economic and security relationship immediately following the election.\nKevin O'Leary, a Canadian businessman close to Trump who previously ran for the Conservative leadership, acknowledged it was a successful campaign strategy.\n\"Right now Canadians are very frustrated with America and Carney has used that to his advantage,\" he told the BBC just before polls closed. \"He was able to distract Canadians from his own mistakes... and say 'Stop looking at that. Look south of the border and I can save you'.\"\nAt the start of the year, Carney was a former central banker with no experience as a politician. By mid-March, he was being sworn in as prime minister - the first to have never held elected public office before - after a resounding win in the Liberal leadership race.\nNow, he's faced the Canadian electorate as a first time campaigner, won an Ottawa-area seat in the House of Commons and steered his party to an unlikely victory.\nCarney had long flirted with entering Canadian politics - and he seized his moment, swooping in after former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's sudden resignation in January. \nHe also took full advantage of the new political landscape, leaning into his experience helping Canada and the UK navigate previous crises at a time when Canadians were feeling anxious about their economic future.\nTrump's late-March announcement of global levies on foreign automobile imports gave Carney the chance to publicly audition to keep his job during the campaign. He was able to step away from the trail and take on the prime minister's mantle, setting up a call with the president and bringing together his ministers on the US file.\nIn a different election, this would have been a successful one for the Conservatives.\nIn 2011, the Conservatives won a majority with 39.6% of the vote. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is on track to beat that this time, with roughly 41.4% of the vote with most polls reporting, according to Elections Canada.\nThey are currently projected to have won 144 seats - that's up from 120 at dissolution, when the election was called in March.\nBut with the progressive vote coalescing around the Liberals, those numbers weren't enough this time. \nThe bitter blow was Poilievre losing his riding (parliamentary seat) in Carleton, Ontario.\nOnly months ago his party had a clear path to victory and they will now need to figure out a way forward after a series of electoral defeats.\nWhether that includes the diminished figure of Poilievre as leader is the first big question for them to face.He is the third leader they've had since the Liberals swept the 2015 election.\nThe election results have highlighted divisions in Canada that could pose a challenge for Carney. \nNotably, the Liberals are largely shut out of Alberta and Saskatchewan - oil-rich and gas-rich prairie provinces where a sense of alienation from the centre of power in Ottawa has long festered.\nEven before the election, some in those regions were warning of a national unity crisis if the Liberals won another mandate.\nCarney touched on those divisions in his victory speech, acknowledging the millions who had voted for a different outcome. \n\"I intend to govern for all Canadians,\" he said. \nMeanwhile, Poilievre's message, which relentlessly focused on cost of living issues, especially on housing affordability, resonated with many young people.\nSupport for the Conservatives outpaced Liberals by 44% to 31.2% among 18 to 34 year olds, a Nanos poll on 25 April indicated. The divide was more stark among younger men.\nSeparately, Abacus Data polling found that about 18% of 18 to 29 year olds were worried about Trump. That jumped to 45% for voters over 60, suggesting a polarisation on issues between generations. \nOn Monday night, Poilievre remarked on demographic breakthroughs Conservative had made, including with younger Canadians.  \n\"We gave voices to countless people across the country who've been left out and left behind for far too long,\" he said. \nIn this election, the smaller political parties have taken a hit as Canadians choose to park their votes with either the Liberals or the Conservatives - especially the left-wing New Democrats, or NDP. \nSome of the smaller parties have lost a significant amount of vote share - particularly the NDP who have received just 6% of votes counted across Canada so far, compared with 18% in 2021. \nJagmeet Singh, who has been NDP leader for almost eight years, lost his own riding in British Columbia and announced he will step down. \n\"Obviously I know this night is a disappointing night for New Democrats,\" he said, adding: \"We're only defeated if we stop fighting.\"\nThe Greens have also seen their vote share cut in half from 2% to 1%.\nShachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute, a non-profit public opinion research organisation, told the BBC that Trump's rhetoric was behind the shift to the Liberals.  \n\"The threats, the annexation talk, all of that has been a huge motivator for left of centre voters,\" she said.\nThe sovereigntist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois have maintained a vote share of around 7%. They are on track to win 23 seats in Quebec. \nThis is based on around 97% of polls reporting.\nCanada doesn't have a two-party system, even though it has historically voted in conservative or liberal governments in some form.\nIn the country's political system, these smaller parties still play a role in Parliament. Both the NDP and the Bloc have at some points formed Official Opposition in the House of Commons.",

        "article_text": "After great reviews and buzz, Ryan Coogler's vampire film had an extraordinary second weekend at the box office. It's a victory for a wholly original big-budget film in a cinema landscape dominated by familiar franchises.\nIn less than a fortnight since it was released, Sinners has already made more money at the US box office than Disney's Snow White. Could Ryan Coogler's vampire film go on to overtake two more of this year's Disney hits, Mufasa: The Lion King and Captain America: Brave New World? It's definitely possible. The Hollywood Reporter calls Sinners a \"rule-defying\" proposition that \"continues to defy all the odds\", because it was almost as lucrative in its second weekend in US cinemas as it was in its first, earning $45m (\u00a334m) against its opening $48m (\u00a336m). \"Put another way, Sinners boasts the smallest second-weekend decline for any film opening north of $40m since 2009's Avatar and the smallest ever for an R-rated horror title,\" says the article. Meanwhile The Wrap predicts that it will be \"the highest-grossing original live-action film in the US since Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity in 2013\". Its current worldwide box office total stands at $161m (\u00a3120m), against a $90m (\u00a367m) budget, and it likely has a long distance left to run. Sinners is a winner \u2013 just a week after a sceptical article by Variety sniffed that \"profitability remains a question mark\".\nPerhaps this shouldn't come as a shock. The director of Creed and the Black Panther films, Coogler is adept at taking familiar Hollywood genres (sports drama, superhero blockbuster) and putting his own distinctive-yet-crowd-pleasing stamp on them. But he has gone a step further than usual this time. Featuring Michael B Jordan as a pair of twins defending their juke joint from vampires, Sinners is a horror film \u2013 but it's also a blues musical, a gangster thriller and a deeply-researched period drama about Mississippi in the 1930s. It doesn't stick to the rules of one particular genre, and it isn't based on existing intellectual property (IP), so audiences don't come to it knowing how it's all going to play out. Thanks also to some carefully-vague trailers, viewers get to discover the story for themselves \u2013 which is an increasingly rare treat. Reviewing a new Hollywood film often comes down to answering one question: \"Is it slightly better or slightly worse than every other Marvel/ DC/ Star Wars/ Alien /Jurassic World/ King Kong film I've seen?\" But Sinners is idiosyncratic enough to prompt other questions, which may explain its box office momentum, as word-of-mouth has spread.\nThis unorthodox quality is a sign of the freedom that Coogler felt when he was making it. All of his previous films were adapted from other material \u2013 or from true events, in the case of his debut, Fruitvale Station \u2013 but he told The Atlantic that with Sinners, he didn't want to use IP as \"something to hide behind\". He wanted to make the most personal film he could \u2013 a \"love letter\" to a late uncle from Mississippi \u2013 and that meant a film which didn't follow conventions.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 10 of the best films of 2025 so far\n\u2022 The best films to watch in April\n\u2022 Warfare review: it 'does what film does best'\nIn some ways it could be filed alongside two other films with \"must-see\" and \"must-talk-about\" appeal, 2024's The Substance and 2023's Saltburn. Sinners is a far bigger commercial success than they were, but each offer transgressive, sexually charged, gore-smeared excitement, none of them is based on a superhero comic, a video game or an earlier film, and each expresses the vision of a writer-director being allowed to do their own thing. (And their titles all begin with S, but that could be a coincidence.) The fact that it is so tricky to say which genre they belong to is a key factor. Is The Substance primarily a body-horror film or a Hollywood satire? Is Saltburn a crime thriller or a class comedy? All of these films stir different ingredients together to cook something unexpected. As Coogler put it to The Atlantic: \"I wanted it to feel like you were reading Salem's Lot while listening to the best blues record, eating a bowl of spicy gumbo.\"\nThat could be why, anecdotes suggest, many people are already paying to see Sinners more than once. Because it isn't a generic, IP-based exercise, they know that they're going to discover more on a second viewing. And they know that they're going to have a good time while they're doing it. Maybe if they go for third and fourth viewings, too, Hollywood might decide that original, auteur-driven, big-budget films shouldn't be quite as rare in the cinema landscape as they are today.\n--\nIf you liked this story\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Sinners is a winner \u2013 just a week after a sceptical article by Variety sniffed that \"profitability remains a question mark\".Because it isn't a generic, IP-based exercise, audiences know that they're going to discover more on a second viewingPerhaps this shouldn't come as a shock.

England team-mates Alex Dombrandt and Ollie Chessum squaring up.\nThere were plenty of flashpoints at Mattioli Woods Welford Road on Saturday.\nYet the dedicated away fans section stubbornly refused to ignite into more than mild frustration.\nOn the fringes, where Richard Buck, sporting a Harlequins' striped blazer, and Phil Ellis, a slightly bewildered Leicester season ticket holder of 16 years, sat side by side, the only thing lobbed between the two were pleasantries and cheery small talk.\n\"I've been a bit ambused by this today,\" Ellis smiled. \"You usually get the odd smattering of away fans but this is a bit more concentrated than normal.\"\n\"They are all good lads though.\"\nPhil Ellis (left) and Richard Buck sat side by side on the edge of a block of Harlequins fans\n'Away ends arrive in rugby' shouted the headlines - including our's -  last month when Premiership Rugby last announced two trial matches with specified areas for visiting supporters.\nIt is a story with couple of caveats though.\nFirstly, they aren't really away ends. At least certainly not the aggro-and-pyro, strict segregation scenario the phrase brings to mind in this country.\nFans are not kept apart. And neither are they forced to sit with their own tribe. The option to mix in with the hosts is still there and taken by many.\nAnd, secondly, away ends haven't just arrived in rugby.

We need to grow the game and this is a step in the right direction.\"\nNick and Joel Baker, attending with their Leicester-supporting partners and sat among the Tigers fans, summed up the split.\n\"I am a bit more old school,\" said Nick. \"I like mixing in together and having a laugh and a bit of fun.

        "article_text": "Bruno Fernandes has led Manchester United into the Europa League semi-finals, but they will finish in the bottom half of the Premier League\nAfter an hour of Manchester United's draw at Bournemouth, their travelling support struck up a familiar refrain.\n\"Twenty times, 20 times, Man United. Twenty times, 20 times, I say. Twenty times, 20 times, Man United, playing football the Matt Busby way.\"\nThe song has been a source of both pride and solace since United won the most recent of those championships to ease Sir Alex Ferguson into retirement in 2013.\nOn Sunday, it felt particularly poignant. \nAt the time they sang, those supporters did not know the day would end with Liverpool being crowned champions. But they knew it was coming. That very soon, their fierce rivals would join them on the total that had previously meant they stood alone as the most successful team in English football.\nAnd while Rasmus Hojlund's injury-time equaliser prevented them experiencing yet another defeat in this torturous domestic campaign as they drew 1-1 at the Vitality Stadium, there is no disguising the reality of the situation.\n\"Oh yes, it matters,\" said Adam Bell - a long-time United fan, who started following the club in 1973-74, just as they were about to be relegated.\n\"It was really important for us to get to 20. Now they are joining us and you have to say they have a better chance of getting to 21 and 22 than we have.\"\nHis friend Andrew Harris agreed.\n\"But if you look back,\" he said, \"this kind of thing happens in cycles at Manchester United.\n\"We had the Busby Babes and the 1968 team, then we dropped back in the 1970s and 1980s, then Fergie came. Now we are in the next Ice Age.\"\nAfter David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag tried, it is Ruben Amorim's turn to attempt to prise United out of the deep freeze.\nHis results since replacing Ten Hag in November have been patchy.\nThe draw at Bournemouth means United have collected two points from their past five games. It lifted them a place to 14th but they are still heading for their worst finish since the relegation season over half a century ago. The nadir since then was 13th place in 1989-90, when Liverpool won their 18th league crown.\nWhat Amorim has done is to understand the history around Old Trafford.\nTo his credit, he also refuses to dodge a question.\nLiverpool and their achievements, he said, were not his concern. What he thinks about Manchester United is another matter.\n\"The first thing is to focus on ourselves and not on the other teams,\" he said. \"The next thing is to be really honest.\n\"We are in different levels [to Liverpool] in this moment. But I remember when I start seeing Premier League, was the opposite. So, everything can change.\"\nAmorim said United must not try to think too far ahead.\n\"We have an ultimate goal that is winning the Premier League,\" he said. \"I'm not crazy, I know it's not going to be next year. But we are trying to build something and the small things we did during this year are really important.\n\"We need to improve next year, we know that.\"\nThis video can not be played\nMan Utd deserved late draw at Bournemouth - Amorim\nThere is support for Amorim in the fanbase, even if they don't all feel the salvation that would come from a Europa League triumph this season is realistic.\nIn an ordinary season, a two-legged semi-final with Athletic Bilbao - fourth in La Liga - would be regarded as tricky. Ferguson's team couldn't beat them in a 2011-12 Europa League last-16 tie when Andoni Iraola - now Bournemouth manager - played for them.\nThis season, many fans will have hope rather than expectation.\nVictory in the final in Bilbao - which, of course, offers United's opponents even more incentive - not only provides Champions League riches but is also their only route back into Europe full stop.\n\"I hope the project to rebuild works but it is going to take a few years,\" said Bell. \"Even winning the Europa League is a long shot.\n\"I like Amorim. I am positive about him, but we need patience. It takes time to build a team and make them successful. It took Sir Alex Ferguson a long time.\"\nFerguson was three and three-quarter seasons into his tenure before he delivered the trophy that changed United's history for the better. The parallels with that season and this are impossible to ignore given the respective league positions.\nThere was no social media then, no 24-hour rolling news cycle and endless talk on infinite platforms for opinion to be expressed on the club's dysfunctional results.\n\"Two to three years\" was Bell's assessment on the time Amorim will need.\nHis friend is not so sure.\n\"Ten,\" he said, referring back to his Ice Age comment, \"using the same Glacial calendar.\n\"It is not going to be instant, that's for sure.\"\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

        "article_text": "One of Prince Andrew's prized business assets was administered for two years by a company controlled by the controversial millionaire Doug Barrowman, the BBC can reveal. \nAfter the prince's disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019, legal ownership of his Dragons' Den-style start-up competition, Pitch@Palace Global, was transferred to a Barrowman-linked firm, Knox House Trustees (UK).\nBarrowman and his wife, lingerie boss Baroness Michelle Mone, hit the headlines when she admitted they had lied about their links to a company that won large government contracts during the Covid pandemic after she recommended it to ministers.\nA lawyer for Mr Barrowman said he \"at no time... had any business or personal involvement with the duke\".\nPitch@Palace Global remained the prince's company, under his control. But in line with longstanding royal practice, it was owned under the names of other people or companies, acting on his behalf as so-called \"nominees\". \nDocuments filed at Companies House show that from 2021, the nominee owner was Knox House Trustees (UK), which was controlled and ultimately owned by Mr Barrowman until 2023.\nPrince Andrew's finances have been under intense scrutiny, with questions about how he can afford to live in his Royal Lodge mansion in Windsor after he was cut off financially by his brother, King Charles.\nThe prince's choice of business associates has long been controversial. In December, he said he \"ceased all contact\" with Yang Tengbo, who led the Chinese arm of Pitch@Palace, after receiving advice from the UK government which alleged that he was a spy.\nMr Yang has denied being a spy or doing anything unlawful.\nMr Barrowman has attracted plenty of controversy too. In 2017, HMRC began an investigation into one of his companies, AML Tax (UK), which it said \"aggressively promoted\" tax avoidance schemes. It was fined \u00a3150,000 in 2022.\nIn January that year, the Guardian newspaper first reported links between Mr Barrowman, Baroness Mone and PPE Medpro. The pair denied involvement until December 2023, when she admitted in a BBC interview that they had lied about their links with the company. \nThe National Crime Agency is now investigating suspected criminal offences at the firm. Mr Barrowman and Baroness Mone both deny any wrongdoing.\nAuthor Andrew Lownie, who is writing a biography of the prince, said: \"Andrew has a long history of associating with dubious business figures and disguising his business activities behind nominee and offshore accounts. There really needs to be a full investigation into the duke's financial activities.\"\nPitch@Palace was a start-up competition, founded in 2014, where entrepreneurs would pitch their ideas to possible investors in the hope of winning their backing. It had two parts:\nBoth arms of Pitch@Palace suspended operations following the Newsnight interview in 2019 about the prince's links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which led to Andrew stepping down as a working royal.\nNonetheless, the international operation has emerged as a possible way for the duke to fund his lifestyle. In a court witness statement from 2023, Mr Yang wrote that the duke had needed money \"and saw the relationships with China through Pitch as one possible source of funding\".\nEarlier this year a Dutch company said it was in talks to buy it, saying it saw \"immense value\" in the network, even though it had suspended operations. \nHowever, Prince Andrew has never held the company in his own name.\nFounded in 2017, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd was initially held in the name of Amanda Thirsk, the prince's private secretary, in an arrangement often used by the Royal Family.\nBut early in 2021, the legal ownership was transferred to Knox House Trustees (UK) Limited.\nThis company had been set up the year before, and Mr Barrowman was named as having \"significant influence and control\" over it. \nCorporate filings in the Isle of Man show Knox House Trustees (UK) was ultimately owned by Knox Limited, whose sole shareholder is Mr Barrowman. \nIn 2023, ownership of Knox House Trustees (UK) Ltd \u2013 which still owned Pitch@Palace Global - was transferred to Arthur Lancaster, an accountant who has a longstanding working relationship with both the prince and Mr Barrowman. This remains the situation today.\nThe same year Mr Lancaster took over as the sole director and shareholder of PPE Medpro. He was also a director of many of the companies involved in the AML tax avoidance case. \nThe judge in that case called him \"evasive\" and said he had \"real concerns as to the reliability of Mr Lancaster's evidence\", which contained \"significant inconsistencies\". \nAfter the case, his lawyer wrote to the court arguing that the conclusions were \"unnecessarily harsh\", that Mr Lancaster had been a \"diligent and truthful witness\", and that his efforts to provide information had been hampered by the Covid pandemic.\nFor decades the Royal Family has held investments through nominees, and still does. In the past this has served to keep details of their holdings private, though not in this case. Prince Andrew's involvement in Pitch@Palace Global is well known, and he is listed as having \"significant influence or control\" over the company on Companies House.\nMr Barrowman's lawyer said in a statement: \"Mr Lancaster was a director of KHT (UK) Ltd which provided company administration services to a number of external companies, including Pitch@Palace, a company wholly owned by the duke. Mr Lancaster acted for the duke in a personal capacity at all times and has been an associate of the duke for many years.\"\nMr Lancaster declined to comment. Prince Andrew did not respond to requests for comment.\n",

It was just about digging in and putting him under pressure.\"\nNevertheless it brought up Trump's 11th century at this year's World Championship, with the record of 16 in a single Crucible campaign, set by Stephen Hendry in 2002 and equalled by Mark Williams in 2022, now in his sights.\nBrecel, who won the world title two years ago simply had no answer, scoring a meagre 19 points from the first four frames, and when he missed a brown to the left middle Trump wrapped up the contest.\nSeven-time world champion, Stephen Hendry\nJudd Trump is all about bullying the table, and Mark Williams is all about guile. It's going to be incredible in the semis.\nBut it's Zhao Xintong I can't wait to watch in a one-table situation, he has breezed through the tournament.

Many residents had called one another to check on their loved ones.\n\"I don't think my phone has buzzed that much in my entire life,\" he said. \"There was a lot of panic and, you know, relief, when somebody answers.\" \nAt the scene on Sunday, people laid flowers and paid their respects.\nOne woman, named Donna, was at the festival and said it was packed with young people and families.\n\"People were here to celebrate and have fun,\" she told the BBC. \"This is tragic.\"\nThe attack came just before Canada's federal election on 28 April. It prompted Prime Minister Mark Carney to cancel large gatherings of Liberal Party supporters in Calgary and Richmond. \nIn a televised address to Canadians, Mr Carney said he was \"heartbroken\" and \"devastated\" by the attack. \nHe visited the scene of the attack on Sunday evening, where he lit a candle and stood in silence with dozens of members of the local community.\nMr Carney also met family members of the victims and laid flowers during a church service vigil.\nThe main opposition candidate, Pierre Poilievre, continued campaigning, but made an unscheduled stop at a church in Mississauga - a suburb of Toronto - to meet with members of the Filipino community.\nAppearing alongside his wife Anaida Poilievre, the Conservative leader expressed his condolences. \"I wanted to be here with you in solidarity,\" he told the church attendees.\nMeanwhile, the leader of the British Columbia New Democratic Party David Eby, said he was \"shocked and heartbroken\". \nOne Canadian political leader, the New Democrats' Jagmeet Singh, was among those who attended the Lapu Lapu festival on Saturday, and subsequently changed his planned events on Sunday. \nHe said it was \"heart-breaking\" to see that \"such joy can be torn apart so violently.\n\"I saw families gathered together, I saw children dancing, I saw pride in culture, in history and community,\" he added.

I don't think I want to say a lot. The only thing now is to send my appreciation to Jurgen Klopp,\" Slot, who replaced Klopp as Liverpool manager last summer, told LFCTV.\nThe 46-year-old immediately launched into a rendition of the song Klopp asked Liverpool fans to sing after his final game last May, but replaced the lyrics 'Arne Slot' with 'Jurgen Klopp'.\n\"I am 99.9% sure that if I pick up my phone there will be a message from Jurgen,\" he told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"So many moments in the season the two of us have had contact. I think he showed last season what a wonderful human being he is by introducing me. \n\"But what mattered most is the team he left behind that was able to win the trophy.\"\nSlot, speaking to Sky Sports, added: \"The work Jurgen and Pep [Lijnders] did - the culture, work-rate, quality - was outstanding,\"\nThis video can not be played\nCommentary cam scenes as Liverpool win title\nFew expected Slot to oversee a successful title charge in his first season at Anfield, not least the man himself.\n\"We started really well and maybe it helped that [Manchester] City had a difficult spell that they have not had in five years,\" he said.\n\"When the season started, we would have been happy with top four. But I don't think that is fair on the players as they are much better than that and they have shown it this season.\"\nDominic Solanke gave Spurs a surprise lead at Anfield, but Slot had no doubts his side would turn things around.\n\"I think from the moment we arrived on the bus everyone could feel that we were never going to lose this game,\" he told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"The fans were so supportive before and during the game. Even at 1-0 down you felt this team and the fans could get it over the line.\"\nHe told LFCTV: \"They always find a way to win. I'm incredibly proud, not only of the players but the people standing here, sport directors, my staff members, we should give them a big round of applause.\n\"Let's forget it's the second title in 35 years... it's the second in five years.\"\nLiverpool crowned Premier League champions with thumping win over Tottenham - reaction\n'No-one expected this' - how Slot guided Liverpool to the title\nLiverpool rejoin Man Utd on 'perch' with 20th title\nLiverpool last won the Premier League five years ago, but the Coronavirus pandemic meant there were no fans inside Anfield to witness it.\nFor fans and players alike, a first title win in front of supporters since 1990 is something special.\n\"It's special to win it at Anfield - it's very difficult to describe,\" Mohamed Salah told BBC Sport.\n\"Everyone wanted Palace to finish it [at Arsenal on Wednesday], but I know what Anfield is like, so I'm glad we did it here.\n\"It's completely different [to the title in 2020]. The feeling is unbelievable. The first time was lockdown and the pandemic, but to be here five years later is incredible.\"\nSalah told Sky Sports: \"This is 100% better than last time.\"\nVirgil van Dijk - the first non-British captain to lead Liverpool to a top flight title - dedicated the triumph to the club's supporters.\n\"I was desperate to win it for them [the fans] and all the fans around the world, and for us as well,\" Van Dijk told Sky Sports.\n\"This is the most beautiful club in the world. We deserve this. We are going to enjoy the next couple of weeks and take it in.\"\nThis video can not be played\nSalah on securing PL title after Tottenham win\nLeft-back Andy Robertson was also a member of the 2019-20 title-winning team, and he has now become just the third Scotsman to win multiple Premier League titles after Darren Fletcher and Brian McClair.\n\"Last time [we won the league in 2020] was a strange time,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\"It was unique the way we did it. We enjoyed it of course but you cannot beat what we experienced today. Nothing compares to that.\n\"It is special. For me, when I came to this club I quickly realised how good Scottish players have been here. There is a bit of pressure with that. I am glad I managed to continue that and hopefully can carry that forward.\"\nIt has been a remarkable few years for midfielder Alexis Mac Allister, who won the 2022 World Cup with Argentina before joining Liverpool in 2023.\n\"To win a World Cup and now a Premier League is really special,\" he said. \n\"But it would not be possible without my team-mates. I am just one part of the puzzle. This team has been really good the last two years. \n\"It wasn't enough last year but this year we made a big difference. Hopefully we can enjoy this week.\"\n20 of the best photos from Liverpool's momentous day\n'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'\nDespite uncertainty regarding his future hanging over him for much of this season, Salah has been sensational.\nHis 63rd-minute goal on Sunday was his 28th of the season, while he has set up another 18 for his team-mates.\n\"It's incredible. Winning the Premier League and having the impact I've had is incredible,\" Salah told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"For me, this [title] feels more special. Jurgen [Klopp] is not here and other players I respect a lot are not here, but to do it with a new manager and a new team shows what I'm capable of.\"\nDefending their title will not be easy, but having committed his immediate future to the club with a new two-year contract earlier this month, Salah is confident.\n\"People think it's going to get easier, but now it's going to be difficult because other teams will catch us and it's going to be harder for him [Slot],\" he said. \n\"Even in my time here, the second season was way harder.\n\"I believe next season and the year after will be great, for sure.\"\nSlot shared his star man's optimism.\n\"That is something we are definitely going to try [to defend the title],\" he told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"But first we are going to enjoy the last few games.\"\nThis video can not be played\nMurphy on phenomenal first season for Slot",

Slot has led Liverpool to a 20th league title.\nBut, while the Dutchman has been the mastermind behind Liverpool's campaign this season, his success - as he highlighted following his team's confirmation as champions on Sunday - is also due to the squad and culture created by Klopp.\nThe Reds only added one player to their ranks for this campaign in Federico Chiesa and, despite him only playing a bit-part role, they have equalled the title tally of arch-rivals Manchester United.\nBBC Sport - through a documentary on BBC iPlayer about Liverpool's journey to winning the Champions League in 2018-2019 - charts how Klopp ended up with the Reds and how he created the foundations for Slot to build on.\nWhen Liverpool were looking for a manager to replace Brendan Rodgers, the \"two main candidates\" - according to former Reds director of research Ian Graham - were Klopp and Carlo Ancelotti, who were both out of work at the time.\nAncelotti was a \"great coach\" but Liverpool didn't have the \"sort of squad\" with \"proven superstars\" that he was used to managing.\nKlopp, on the other hand, had guided a youthful Borussia Dortmund side to the Bundesliga title in 2011 and 2012 and was seen as a better fit.\n\"Our strategy was to recruit young players, have them reach peak age together to give us this success one or two years down the line,\" said Graham.\nKlopp was appointed as Reds boss with the club 10th in the Premier League in October 2015, and he set about instilling a philosophy and principles at the Anfield club which Slot has benefitted from.\n\"We always wanted to create stories which we can tell our grandkids,\" said Peter Krawietz, who had been with Klopp at Mainz and Dortmund before following him to Liverpool and becoming his assistant.\n\"There's only one way. Do it as a team. Do it with your mates.\n\"Use that to make sure we are feeling like friends, like brothers, like a family. Know about the support you need from all the teams around, from the analysts, from the doctor, from the physiotherapists, from the nutritionists.\n\"We can do it only together. As long as you are alone, or you leave others alone, then you don't have a chance.\n\"Keep believing, follow your dream, don't quit. Then one day you will get the bonus. So the idea was always for us to invest everything without expecting a guarantee for success.\"\nHow to Win the Champions League\nLiverpool\nSuccess in the form of silverware had proved elusive.\nLiverpool had achieved an impressive 97 points in 2018-2019 and, even though that would have won them the league title in most other seasons, they were pipped to the top-flight crown by a point by Manchester City.\nThe Reds had also been beaten in the League Cup final and Europa League final in 2016, as well as the 2018 Champions League final.\nHowever, the work Klopp had done with his players was eventually rewarded when he won the first trophy of his Liverpool reign with a 2-0 victory against Tottenham in the 2019 Champions League final.\nThe club's journey to that trophy embodied the tactics, emotion and thrilling football that was Klopp's hallmark, and one which Slot has refined rather than revolutionised.\n\"The idea is to press the opponent, don't allow them to get into the game,\" said Krawietz. \"They do on the pitch what we allow them to do, being dominant already without having the ball, and then - the moment we win the ball - the first idea is, win it high on the pitch and attack the goal.\n\"We had to adapt over time. It was constantly learning without changing our basic ideas until the end.\"\nHe added: \"We, as the managing staff, were convinced about our way.\n\"We had to convince the players as well and then, the next step is to convince the people around, turning doubters into believers.\"\nKrawietz admitted Klopp's gameplan could be \"wild\" but \"was part of the plan\", and there was no better evidence of it in action than their 2019 Champions League semi-final against Lionel Messi's Barcelona.\nThe Reds looked down and out after losing the first leg 3-0 at the Nou Camp, before what turned out to be one of the most memorable comebacks in Champions League history.\n\"Right after the first game, there was a very decisive moment in the dressing room because Jurgen stood up and said, 'hey, gentlemen, this game is not over yet. We have half-time. Yes, we are 3-0 down, but we are Liverpool and we play next week in our stadium',\" said Krawietz.\n\"For us, football is always playing football as well with your heart. \n\"All the strategy, all the tactics, all the instructions you give to them but, giving the team the possibility to feel the game and the energy of a stadium, the support of each other and bringing the crowd into the game as well in home games, which is possible at Anfield, we knew it and this is what we tried to develop.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'It's like a father hugging the son' - Alisson and Robertson on Klopp's hugs\nLiverpool's in-house data department had given them a 3.5% chance of overcoming Barcelona before the second leg but, as the injured Mohamed Salah's T-shirt read before the match, Klopp's Liverpool 'never give up'.\nDivock Origi pulled one goal back early on for Liverpool and two from Georginio Wijnaldum, who was \"angry like crazy\" at not having started, levelled the tie at 3-3 before 'that' corner.\nWith Barcelona still getting organised for a Liverpool corner, Trent Alexander-Arnold pretended to walk away from the ball before quickly turning and sending in a low ball which Origi swept in to cause scenes of bedlam as Liverpool won 4-0.\n\"I didn't know at the time but our video analysts pay a lot of attention to set-pieces,\" said Graham.\n\"They noticed that this was a recurring theme - when Barcelona concede a corner they are more concerned with arguing amongst themselves than they are defending the corner - and so Divock and Trent had been briefed.\n\"Credit to the video analysts and Trent and Divock for spotting the opportunity and converting it as well.\"\nLiverpool went on to beat Spurs and win Europe's top competition for a sixth time.\n\"It's not hard to play for Jurgen. He's a motivator. He gets you to run through a brick wall for him effectively. The good thing is that he'll do the exact same for you,\" said Liverpool left-back Andy Robertson.\n\"I just think he was probably quite a loving person. He was always just going about the training ground giving hugs.\n\"He wanted everyone to feel a part of it at that time. Going into the training ground was a good place to go. You could see everyone was highly motivated.\"\nKlopp might have gone but his players have proved this season that the atmosphere  he created at Liverpool remains, along with the 'all-for-one-one-for-all' attitude he embedded in his players.\nLiverpool keeper Alisson added: \"Jurgen was always clinical in the words he used before matches.

        "article_text": "The government has defended its net-zero policies after Sir Tony Blair said limiting fossil fuels was \"doomed to fail\" and a new approach was needed.\nThe ex-Labour prime minister argued the climate change debate had become \"irrational\" and people in rich countries no longer wanted to make financial sacrifices \"when they know that their impact on global emissions is minimal\".\nHis comments have been seized on by opposition parties as an attack on Sir Keir Starmer's plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2050.\nAsked about the comments at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said: \"If you look at the detail of what Tony Blair said he's absolutely aligned with what we're doing here.\"\nLabour ministers have insisted the drive to net zero will not involve any financial sacrifices and have minimal impact on people's lives.\nMinutes before PMQs, the Tony Blair Institute (TBI) issued a statement saying they \"support the government's 2050 net zero targets\" and that the UK government's approach is \"the right one\".\nQuestioned whether the institute had been asked by the government to issue a clarification to help defuse a growing political row, the prime minister's spokesman said: \"I won't get into private conversations.\"\nSir Keir's spokesman also stressed that the PM had confidence in Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, adding that he was \"doing a great job\".\nBut he said the PM did not agree with Sir Tony that there was too much \"hysteria\" in the climate change debate. \nHe told reporters: \"I don't think so, I mean I think we're taking a very practical and pragmatic approach to this here in the UK.\"\nHe added: \"Our approach to net zero is clear. It is families up and down this country that will pay the price for the UK's dependence on fossil fuel markets.\"\nNicholas Stern - who wrote an influential report on the economics of climate change for Tony Blair when he was in government in 2006 - described the report from the Tony Blair Institute as \"muddled and misleading\".\nHe said there was \"far more progress being made around the world to decarbonise the global economy than it suggests\" and that it did not take account of the UK's leadership in the field.\n\"If the UK wobbles on its route to net zero, other countries may become less committed. The UK matters,\" said Prof Stern, who chairs the Grantham Research institute on climate change at the London School of Economics.\nThe report argues that the expected global rise in fossil fuel use and the doubling of airline travel over the next 20 years undermines current climate policies.\n\"These are the inconvenient facts, which mean that any strategy based on either 'phasing out' fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail,\" Sir Tony wrote in the foreward to the report.\nThe report says existing carbon targets should be kept in place to give certainty to business but a rethink of how they are achieved was urgently needed.\nIt says the focus should instead be on emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage and nuclear fusion - and new international effort to persuade the world's biggest economies, such as China and India, to cut their emissions.\nTo help achieve the 2050 target, Labour and the previous Conservative government made a series of pledges including \"clean\" electricity, ending the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030 - and installing 600,000 electric heat pumps a year by 2028.\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch recently ditched her party's support for net zero by 2050.\nShadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins said there was \"consensus across the board\" on the need to protect the environment, but that \"we have to take the public with us\".\nAnd she said Sir Tony had sent a \"clear message\" to the government that it needs to \"rethink\" its approach to net zero.\n\"This is an oddly public and oddly-timed intervention that would usually be made by someone struggling for access,\" he added.\nIn a sign of the acrimony swilling around this debate within Labour, one government source suggested Sir Tony's comments may have been affected by the Tony Blair Institute having received funding from oil rich Saudi Arabia.\nThe Labour Party has had a complicated relationship with Sir Tony and his legacy since he left Downing Street in 2007. \nEd Miliband's election as leader in 2010 over his brother, David, was seen in part as a repudiation of Blairism, as was Jeremy Corbyn's leadership to a much greater extent.\nBut since Sir Keir Starmer became leader in 2020 he has often embraced the most electorally-successful leader in Labour's history.

        "summary": "Labour defends net-zero policies after Blair criticism2 hours agoShareSaveBrian WheelerPolitical reporterHenry ZeffmanChief Political CorrespondentShareSaveGetty ImagesThe government has defended its net-zero policies after Sir Tony Blair said limiting fossil fuels was \"doomed to fail\" and a new approach was needed.The ex-Labour prime minister argued the climate change debate had become \"irrational\" and people in rich countries no longer wanted to make financial sacrifices \"when they know that their impact on global emissions is minimal\".His comments have been seized on by opposition parties as an attack on Sir Keir Starmer's plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2050.Asked about the comments at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said: \"If you look at the detail of what Tony Blair said he's absolutely aligned with what we're doing here. \"These are the inconvenient facts, which mean that any strategy based on either 'phasing out' fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail,\" Sir Tony wrote in the foreward to the report.The report says existing carbon targets should be kept in place to give certainty to business but a rethink of how they are achieved was urgently needed.It says the focus should instead be on emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage and nuclear fusion - and new international effort to persuade the world's biggest economies, such as China and India, to cut their emissions.To help achieve the 2050 target, Labour and the previous Conservative government made a series of pledges including \"clean\" electricity, ending the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030 - and installing 600,000 electric heat pumps a year by 2028.Blair says current net zero policies 'doomed to fail'What does net zero mean?Miliband accuses net zero opponents of 'nonsense and lies'Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch recently ditched her party's support for net zero by 2050.Shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins said there was \"consensus across the board\" on the need to protect the environment, but that \"we have to take the public with us\".And she said Sir Tony had sent a \"clear message\" to the government that it needs to \"rethink\" its approach to net zero. \"Labour ministers have insisted the drive to net zero will not involve any financial sacrifices and have minimal impact on people's lives.Minutes before PMQs, the Tony Blair Institute (TBI) issued a statement saying they \"support the government's 2050 net zero targets\" and that the UK government's approach is \"the right one\".Questioned whether the institute had been asked by the government to issue a clarification to help defuse a growing political row, the prime minister's spokesman said: \"I won't get into private conversations. Lord Mandelson, one of Sir Tony's closest political friends and a former cabinet minister, is now the UK ambassador to Washington.It comes as a highly critical report by the independent Climate Change Committee says Labour has made very little progress in preparing the UK for the growing threats posed by rising temperatures since coming to power.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.A simple guide to climate changeFour ways climate change worsens extreme weatherWhere does the UK get its energy from?Tony BlairNet zero \"Nicholas Stern - who wrote an influential report on the economics of climate change for Tony Blair when he was in government in 2006 - described the report from the Tony Blair Institute as \"muddled and misleading\".He said there was \"far more progress being made around the world to decarbonise the global economy than it suggests\" and that it did not take account of the UK's leadership in the field.",

        "article_text": "On a searing afternoon in Vietnam, Tung Linh declared she \"basically knows nothing\" about the bloody, decades-long war that pitted her country's Communist-run North against the United States-backed South.\n\"My grandparents fought in the war and because of that today we can look at the sky and see an airplane and we don't feel scared, like they did,\" says the 20-year-old college student.\nStuck to her right cheek was a little yellow star on a red rectangle - the Vietnamese flag. Like her, Ho Chi Minh City, where she lived, was gearing up to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, when the Communists triumphed.\nToday's Vietnam is a remarkably different country than the one American troops withdrew from in defeat \u2013 it's enterprising, it's growing fast and it's getting richer.\nIts authoritarian Communist leadership has embraced capitalism. They aspire to follow in China's footsteps, and have ploughed money and effort into becoming a reliable manufacturing hub, even an alternative to China. \nBut that is a risky ambition during US President Donald Trump's trade war \u2013 it's partly why he is threatening a 46% levy against the South East Asian nation. That could shatter the country's economic potential.\nVietnam was a French colony, a Chinese vassal and for 20 years, the proxy battlefield in America's bloody struggle to stop China spreading communism across South East Asia.\nBut it cannot escape its geography. Nestled beneath China's wide rump, it is once again on the frontline in a new American battle \u2013which hopes to stem Beijing's rise as an economic superpower.\nVietnam is a young country in a hurry. The median age is 33, considerably younger than Thailand or China (40), and far younger than Japan (50).\n\"I want to do a job that will bring more success to Vietnam,\" said Linh in fluent English. She is studying economics and marketing. \"And yes, success for me too,\" she admits, with a smile, when prodded.\nIt's a dream that suits her bustling city \u2013 now a sprawling metropolis of 10 million people, Ho Chi Minh City has the same choking traffic, glass-clad skyscrapers, five-star hotels, restaurants and seedy massage parlours as any Asian mega city.\nYou would be hard put to find traces of the socialist ideology that led to the city's capture in 1975, when it was the capital of South Vietnam. The victors renamed it city Ho Chi Minh, after the revolutionary father of North Vietnam. But to locals, it is still Saigon. \nAnd when it fell on this day 50 years ago, South Vietnam ceased to exist as North Vietnamese tanks smashed through the tall iron gates of the presidential compound and raised the red flag with a yellow star over the presidential palace.\nAmerica's ally, the southern regime, was vanquished. Its last president had fled the previous day. More than two decades of bitter conflict was over. \nThe victory had come at an enormous cost. An estimated three million dead and millions more injured. Between 1968 and 1975, a greater tonnage of bombs was dropped on this slender piece of land than in all theatres in World War Two.\nBut few here want to talk about the war even as they celebrate the anniversary of their \"reunification\".\nLinh and her friends screamed in delight as a truck carrying soldiers drove past. The shy idols waved back \u2013 they were on their way to the barracks after rehearsals for the anniversary parade.\n\"I am excited because this is the day when we reunited, when we became one country again,\" Linh said.\nHer answer sounded a little rehearsed, not least because of the government-appointed minder who accompanied the BBC throughout. But her enthusiasm for her future \u2013 and her country's - is not uncommon.\nA little further down the road, 18-year-old Minh, who did not want to share her last name, told us she was studying to be a lawyer so she could \"become successful\".  With a laugh, she added: \"And rich!\"\nWhen we asked about how young people feel about Americans, the minder winced visibly and tried to stop her answering.\n\"We're not angry,\" she says. \"We don't hate them. That was the past. Now we want to trade with America. You know globalisation? We want to learn from America.\"\nVietnam's new leaders appear to have the same ambition. In January the country's new Communist party chief, To Lam, embarked on a program to slash bureaucracy that could impress Elon Musk, who has been overseeing the Trump administration's controversial cost-cutting team.\nThe country's 63 provinces and municipalities are being reduced to 34, and government ministries and agencies cut from 30 to 17. This year, 100,000 government employees are being laid off, according to official estimates.\nThe ambition is huge. So far only one country in South East Asia, Singapore, has managed to escape the \"middle-income trap\", where economic growth slows before countries become rich. Vietnam, whose economy is growing at a steady 5%, intends to be the second. It has flung its doors wide open to investment \u2013 and is welcoming back those it once drove from its shores.\nAfter the 1975 victory around two million southern Vietnamese fled the country. Many were ethnic Chinese. They packed on to flimsy boats and set out across the South China Sea. They became known as \"the boat people\". Today their descendants make up a diaspora of nearly six million stretching from the United States and Canada to France, Germany, Japan and Taiwan.\n\"Since 2017, I have promoted many Taiwanese companies to invest in Vietnam, and I myself am an advisor to several large electronics companies that I brought here,\" said Lisa Wu, who was born in Saigon but spent three decades in Taiwan. Now she is back.\n\"The most attractive thing is that the Vietnamese government is very supportive. The electronics industry is expanding out of China and a lot will choose Vietnam.\"\nIt's no coincidence this shift began around 2018, when Trump declared his first trade war against China.\nTwo young businesswomen from southern China, who did not want to share their names, tell us they have spent the last two years setting up a shoe factory here: \"Now it's ready to go.\"\nThey plan to export to the US. They are concerned about the possibility of higher tariffs for Vietnam - it currently faces a 10% levy, like most of the world \u2013 but \"it's a lot better here than China\", they say with a laugh. Chinese imports to the US face a range of tariffs that go up to 245% for some goods.\nStill, Vietnam is feeling the impact, Ms Wu said. \"I had several factories preparing to begin operations here this May. But because of the policy change, all have stopped and everyone is waiting.\"\nVietnam is again being asked to choose \u2013 America or China. But it's not a choice it can or will make because it needs both.\nLess than two weeks ago, they rolled out the red carpet to welcome Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the capital Hanoi. Warm words were spoken of fraternal friendship and support. But relations with their big neighbour are trickier than they may appear. For years, Vietnam has walked a tightrope between Washington and Beijing \u2013 the latter's expansive ambitions can be a threat to neighbours, especially growing economies that are keen to woo US businesses.\nAs Vietnam insists on \"looking forward\", it appears to have almost forgotten the men and women who fought in the jungles and through the hell of American bombs.\nBut even they say there must be no return to the past. \"I used to have a scar here,\" says Le Thanh Gian, pointing to his right hand, where a bullet had once lodged.\n\"There are still some pieces of shrapnel in my body that couldn't be removed. There were battles where it seemed like we would all be killed. But some of us survived while others fell.\"\nBut he says he bears no anger anymore.\n\"We must have peace. We have already made a lot of progress. People's lives are more prosperous and fulfilled. Now we must work together with the Americans for the future.\"",

I felt good.\n\"I think probably for the players who are from the UK or who don't play on this surface often, they go into it with the mindset they are not going to be that great on it and, therefore, that can prevent them going further. \n\"I know I can play well on this surface and this year it's been a big goal of mine to prove that I can play really well. I know that if I want to be a top player that I have to.\"\nThe powerful forehand of Draper, who did not face a break point in the match, was in good working order throughout as he hit 13 of his 20 winners with it.\nPaul only managed seven winners in the match, while he made 31 unforced errors compared to 11 from his opponent.\nDraper, who is at a career-high sixth in the world rankings, is the fifth seed at the Madrid Open and the highest ranked player remaining. \nHe will play Matteo Arnaldi in the last eight after the Italian, who knocked out Novak Djokovic, beat Frances Tiafoe 6-3 7-5 and Draper can move to number five in the men's rankings if he wins.\nIn the women's draw, defending champion Iga Swiatek recovered from losing the first set without winning a game to beat Madison Keys 0-6 6-3 6-2 in their quarter-final.\nAmerican Keys, who won the Australian Open for her first Grand Slam victory earlier this year, took the first set in 24 minutes before four-time French Open champion Swiatek recovered to secure a semi-final spot.\n\"Honestly, it was one of the weirdest matches I've ever played,\" said Poland's Swiatek.\n\"I didn't feel like [the first set] was that bad. I felt the ball well - it just went super long. I tried to play a bit shorter and with some mistakes by Maddy, the momentum changed in the end. I'm happy that I did it.\"\nSwiatek will face Coco Gauff in the last four after the American beat Mirra Andreeva 7-5 6-1.\nGauff faced two set points in the first set before taking control and securing victory.\nUkraine's Elina Svitolina is also into the semi-finals courtesy of a 6-2 6-1 win against Japan's Moyuka Uchijima and will play world number one Aryna Sabalenka, who earned a hard-fought 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (9-7) win against Marta Kostyuk.\nPlay was briefly halted in the second-set tie-break, before Sabalenka saved three set points on the way to registering her victory.\n\"Honestly, that was a battle and conditions were incredibly tough,\" said the 26-year-old. \"It wasn't about tennis, it was about the way you handled your emotions.\n\"I think I did really well and I'm super proud I was able to handle myself in such a difficult situation.\"\nLive scores, results and order of play\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "The runner who went viral and sparked a campaign for change for women\nSophie Power had not even laced up her trainers for her first run when she signed up to an ultramarathon.\nBut what was initially a fresh challenge after being made redundant has manifested into a life-changing passion that has led to positive change for women in sport.\nIn 2018, a photograph of Power breastfeeding her then three-month-old son during a 106-mile race went viral.\nThere had been no option for her to defer her place until she was fit to compete and it highlighted what she saw as a major issue facing women and mothers.\nNow, many of the world's biggest events, including the London Marathon, have implemented pregnancy deferral policies and Power's work has been central to that change.\nPower signed up for her first 250km (155-mile) ultramarathon at the age of 26, shortly after having been made redundant from her job in banking.\nAlthough she was not a runner and never had been, a friend had recently completed the challenge himself and recommended she try it, as he believed she could have the stamina needed due to her time in the air squadron at university.\n\"I went for my first run the next day and realised pretty quickly that I loved ultra-running. I love being outside, the breadth of phenomenal people you meet [who] you wouldn't come across in everyday life,\" the 42-year-old, who lives near Guildford in Surrey, told BBC Sport.\n\"And really kind of pushing my body to the limits in a new way.\"\nImmediately hooked, Power devoted her time to training and travelling to compete in stage races around world.\nShortly after the birth of her second child, Cormac, she was faced with a dilemma.\nPower juggles her campaigning and ultrarunning alongside bringing up her three children\nHaving given up her entry to the iconic Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc (UTMB) race while she recovered from the birth of her first child, Donnacha, three years before, she was not prepared to do so again.\nLike many races, UTMB had no pregnancy deferral policy at the time.\nDespite not being able to run so soon postpartum, Power entered the 106-mile event with a view to starting and maybe walking the first 10km.\nYet 43.5 hours after setting off she completed the challenge, that included 10,000m of climbing, inside the cut-off time, walking the whole way except for a short stretch after one of the highest points when she was worried she might get hypothermia. She crossed the line with then three-year-old Donnacha.\nThat moment is one she looks back on with immense pride, though it was a photograph of her taken with her younger son that day that would inspire what followed.\nFrench photographer Alexis Berg was at UTMB photographing the 2018 race, as he is at many ultra events. And it was at one of the refuelling stations that he saw something he had never previously seen at one of these events.\n\"I knew it was unusual. At that moment it was impossible to realise the photo would have such an impact, but I just pushed one button that day and everything else that has happened is because of Sophie,\" he said.\nWhat he captured was Power sitting down and breastfeeding her baby son during a break from the race.\n\"That photo has undoubtedly changed the course of my life. I worked out I should never have been on that start line,\" she said.\n\"I should have been given the opportunity to complete that kind of dream race when I was fit and healthy, not three months postpartum, trying to go 106 miles around a huge mountain by breastfeeding my baby. It was crazy.\"\nAlexis Berg's photograph of Power breast-feeding her three-month-old son, Cormac, at UTMB went viral in 2018\nPower wanted to ensure returning mums did not face the same choice and put their bodies through the same risk as she had done.\nShe founded the charity SheRaces with the core aim of breaking down barriers preventing women from entering events alongside men and safeguarding returning mothers.\nAfter the photo went viral, many male directors contacted her almost immediately to say they had added pregnancy deferrals to their programmes and expressed embarrassment that it was something they had not thought of before.\nShe engaged with more than 2,000 women to find out what prevented them from getting on the start line of races alongside men.\nHer research went far beyond elite level sport. Power is not a professional athlete herself and her real passion is for other women and girls who had been like her.\n\"Girls drop out of sport at such a high rate. There's a massive dream deficit for girls compared to boys,\" she said.\nPower believes a big reason for this is the language used when promoting sports and sporting events.\n\"It's 'hardest, toughest, baddest', and for a lot of women that's quite off-putting,\" she said.\n\"How do we redesign sport in a female lens? Can we make sure that the opportunities for girls are tailored to them, and what they want and sports provided in the right places in the right way?\"\nThe result of her research was a set of nine principles that organisers could commit to in order to make their events more inclusive for women.\nThese included adapting the use of language and imagery on websites to reflect and appeal to female runners, changing cut-off times, providing female toilets, period products, changing facilities and event T-shirts made specifically for female entrants, rather than unisex ones for all, and a safeguarding and harassment policy.\nCriteria for elite races includes equal exposure for the female race on social media coverage and prizes for female competition.\nPower has seen change in some of the world's biggest races.\nUTMB's policy, external since 2023 for some of its marquee events entitles those who are pregnant, have a pregnant partner or are adopting or birthing via surrogacy to a full refund and priority re-entry for up to five years.\nBut she says there is still a long way to go.\nAssefa sets women's record as Sawe wins men's race\nLondon Marathon breaks world record for most finishers\n'Finish lines not finish times' at London Marathon\nThe London Marathon had a world record number of finishers in 2025, surpassing the previous record of 55,646 set by the New York Marathon in November\nThe New York, Boston and London marathons now all have pregnancy deferrals in place, yet mothers must pay the entrance fee for a second time when they use the deferral scheme, she said.\nHer organisation's criteria requests races to implement a two-year deferral to allow people enough time to recover fully from their pregnancies.\n\"The majority of races are commercial, it's a business. If they can get more people on their start lines then they're going to do it and the purpose of the guidelines is they're almost non-cost. It's a no-brainer,\" she said.\n\"There are a lot of brands out there who say they are pro-women, yet they're sponsoring women's races that don't have pregnancy deferrals, that don't treat women equally.\n\"And then there are dinosaurs, they don't value the voice of female athletes.\n\"Then there are races that still need to make improvements, I put London Marathon in that bracket. They have listened to us, they are phenomenally inclusive, they've got loads of initiatives that they put out for diversity on their start lines, but they still want to make women pay twice for their place when they have a baby.\n\"I've definitely lost faith in some race organisers because of it but so many are changing and becoming better. You always feel like you fail at the battles you don't win but we're winning so many battles and driving so much change.\"\nThe London Marathon's policy, external allows entrants to defer for up to three years after giving birth. The event's organisers did not respond when asked why users of the deferral system must pay their entrance fee again.\nWhat is Couch to 5k and how do I start?\nPower suffered from hallucinations while on a world record-breaking ultramarathon across Ireland\nAs the scale of her work and its influence has grown, Power's propensity for testing her physical limits has grown with it.\nShe is now the holder of two Guinness world records - becoming the fastest woman to run the length of Ireland, last year.\nPower completed the gruelling 340-mile route in three days 12 hours and eight minutes, smashing the previous record set by Mimi Anderson by more than three hours.\nThe route took her through Munster, where husband John was born, and to County Cork, where many of the Power family live, running through torrential rainfall, experiencing the early stages of sun stroke and sleeping for little more than two hours, while sustaining herself on a diet of jam-filled tortilla wraps, gels, chews and ice cream.\nHer tongue was burned after two days of eating nothing but fruit and sweets. She pushed herself to the brink of total exhaustion.\n\"I was seeing nativity and Christmas scenes everywhere in this town. And all the trees had turned into plastic. The hallucinations were phenomenal, crazy,\" she said.\nShe has since gone on to set a second world record for the longest distance covered on a treadmill by a female in 48 hours and will be hosting her own women-only ultra races in the Peak District in August.\nSo how will she know when she has achieved what she set out to do?\n\"My ultimate goal for SheRaces is that we don't exist because it's not needed anymore and every woman is able to get on the start line,\" she added.\n\"Part of the reason I created it was to have something that wasn't just me and was owned by all women. We can all help each other and demand fairness.\"\nPower completed the 84-hour Ireland challenge with just short 20-minute naps on the roadside ",

America's trade deficit with Canada - expected to be $45bn in 2024 - was mostly driven by US energy demands.\nCanada and US relations have been strained in recent months, driven by Trump's talk of a \"51st state\" and referring to previous Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as \"governor\" - the title for leaders of individual American states.\nThe US president has also sparked a global trade war in which Canada was one of the first countries targeted with tariffs.\nTrump has partially imposed a blanket 25% tariff on various Canadian goods, along with 25% import taxes on all aluminium and steel imports, but has exempted products covered by a US, Canada and Mexico trade deal known as USMCA.\nCanada has retaliated with some C$60bn ($42bn; \u00a332bn) worth of tariffs on US goods.\nCarney said talks with Trump would be \"on our terms, not on their terms\".\n\"There is a partnership to be had, an economic and security partnership,\" he said.\n\"It's going to be a very different one than we've had in the past.\"\nCarney has touted his experience handling global economic crises as a way to deal with Trump on tariffs.\nBefore becoming PM in early March, Carney had never held political office. \nHe is a banker by trade, leading the Bank of Canada during the 2008 global financial crisis before becoming the first non-British person to take on the top job at the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020.\nThe PM said Canada was the \"biggest client for more than 40 states\" in the US.\n\"Remember that we supply them [the US] with vital energy. Remember that we supply their farmers with basically all their fertiliser,\" Carney told the BBC.\n\"We deserve respect. We expect respect and I'm sure we'll get it in due course again, and then we can have these discussions.\"\nCanada and the US, along with Mexico, have deeply integrated economies, with billions of pounds worth of manufactured goods crossing the borders on a daily basis, for example, car parts.\nThe introduction of tariffs, which are taxes levied on goods as they enter a country and paid for by the importer, threatens decades of collaborations between the nations.\nTrump has argued tariffs will encourage more Americans to buy domestically-made goods, which will ultimately boost US manufacturing and jobs. \nWhile America's main opponent in the global trade conflict is China, the introduction of Trump's blanket, so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the likes of the UK and other European countries has led to allies seeking fresh agreements in response to barriers to trading with the world's largest economy.\nCarney, who endorsed UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves during the British general election, said \"one would think\" that Canada and the UK could sign a stalled free trade agreement as part of diversifying trade, but highlighted about 95% of trade between the countries is effectively tariff-free already.\n\"We could expand the level of integration between our countries, like-minded countries. You think about defence partnerships, and those conversations have just just begun, so there's a lot that we can do,\" he added.\nIn a statement congratulating Carney, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"I know we will continue to work closely on defence, security, trade and investment.\"\nCarney said the G7 summit hosted by Canada in June would be \"very important\" in deciding the future path of the global trade war, adding it would \"put to the test\" whether the group of the world's seven most advanced economies - which includes the US - was still the most \"like-minded of like-minded countries\".\nThe summit will occur just before the 90-day pause on some of Trump's higher tariffs is set to expire.",

        "article_text": "Early summer. A Test squad due to be announced. It takes me back to the times I was bowling for a place in the England team.\nI was an international cricketer between 2010 and 2017. At the beginning of each of those summers, there was a mix of optimism, hope and determination that I would bowl well enough in Championship cricket to get the call.\nWickets were the currency. James Anderson and Stuart Broad were inked in the side, so Tim Bresnan, Graham Onions, Chris Tremlett, Chris Woakes, myself and a number of others were competing for the other spot.\nThis bred competition and hunger, because I knew the other guys were trying to do exactly the same thing. Backing up performances and demonstrating the stamina to do it over a number of weeks in the domestic game was another aspect of showing you were hardened for the intensity of international cricket.\nIn recent years, under Rob Key, Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes, the way England select their teams has changed. I wonder if the feelings of the players hoping to be selected, those feelings I remember so well, have changed too.\nThere is still the opportunity for a player to prove himself the 'old school' way, even if it does feel like that is becoming a more difficult route into the England team.\nSam Cook has 318 first-class wickets to his name, at an average of just 19.77\nSam Cook has been the outstanding seam bowler in county cricket for the past number of years. At the age of 27, with 318 first-class wickets at an average of 19.77, it seems as though his time has finally come.\nAfter he was asked to rest from Essex's Championship match against Worcestershire a couple of weeks ago, it would be surprising if he is not in the squad for the Test against Zimbabwe next month.\nEven with that overwhelming body of evidence and a stack of wickets behind him, I do feel like it is one performance that has convinced England Cook is finally worth backing.\nAt the beginning of last summer, when the pitches were flat and the Kookaburra ball was being used in the Championship, bowlers toiled. Cook took 10 wickets for Essex to lead them to victory over Nottinghamshire. It is the sort of display that will catch the eye of the selectors, who will rightly look for more than statistics when it comes to making their judgements.\nAnd that, perhaps, is the difference between what I felt I was going through more than a decade ago and what can earn selection at this moment. Now it is far more exciting.\nYes, Cook has an outstanding record, but he also needed that standout display to give Key and company a nudge. In an attack that only has room for one 'English' style seamer, an injury to Woakes has presented an opportunity. And it might actually be one outstanding performance for other England hopefuls that earns them a call-up.\nWood irritated by England's 'golf, golf, golf' narrative\nCook in line for Test call-up as England ask Essex to rest him\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nI see bowlers in the domestic game who have the raw materials to be international players. Sonny Baker and John Turner are two of them, both of Hampshire (although Turner has been on loan at Lancashire), and have been identified by England despite having almost no first-class cricket behind them.\nBaker, Turner and others who have the attributes to trouble the best batters will know that one performance, even one spell, might be enough to earn them a call-up. There's precedent for it, too. Stokes first saw off-spinner Shoaib Bashir bowl in a clip on social media, then shared it in his WhatsApp group with Key and McCullum. Not long after, Bashir was in the England squad.\nAnother difference between my time as an international cricketer and now is England's attitude towards franchise cricket, particularly the Indian Premier League (IPL).\nNow there is an acceptance players hold a lot of power and cannot be denied lucrative franchise opportunities. Who can blame the players for this? After all, it can be a short career. \nThis is in contrast to when I wanted to put my name forward for the 2013 IPL auction. I thought I had a good chance of being picked up. I was bowling quickly, had bowled nicely in a white-ball series in India, getting good players out, and had just had a good T20 World Cup.\nAt the end of 2012, we were on the famous Test tour of India, when we won 2-1. I had to ask permission from the England and Wales Cricket Board to enter the auction and, within five minutes of submitting my forms, received an email telling me I wasn't allowed but that Andy Flower, the head coach, would explain why.\nThat evening, I was having room service in the bedroom of Kevin Pietersen (who was the first England player to spot the might of the IPL), along with Eoin Morgan. I was summoned to see Flower and, as I was on the way out of the door, KP told me to tell Flower I was entering the auction whether he liked it or not.\nIt was a short meeting with Flower. He told me I had to be playing county cricket at the beginning of the following summer in order to back-up performances and be in contention to play Test cricket at the beginning of a double Ashes year. I did as I was told. To me, Test cricket was the pinnacle and I would have done anything to get a spot in that England team.\nTimes have changed. How exciting it must be to be a player now with the potential to succeed in international cricket.\nEvery time you walk on to the pitch you feel like you have the opportunity to put your name forward, to be the subject of the next clip in the England management WhatsApp group, with Key and his cohorts thinking 'we can't ignore this, can we?'",

        "article_text": "In Armenia tech education starts early.\nIn a typical three-storey state school in the suburbs of Yerevan, the Armenian capital, nine-year old Slavik is demonstrating his invention - a box with three LED lights.\n\"He has learned how to control it, and the programming language. You can see the code is written by him,\" says Maria, the 21-year-old tech coach leading the class.\nNext to them, 14-year-old Eric and Narek are showing their smart greenhouse model that monitors temperature and controls fans automatically through a mobile app.\nOther children are enthusiastically showcasing their inventions: games, robots, apps and smart home projects.\nEleven-year-old Arakel is holding his cardboard model of a house with a retractable clothesline.\n\"I have made my mother's work easy, one part of the device is set on the roof, and another is a motor,\" he says. \"When it rains the line goes under the roof to keep the clothes dry.\"\nThese young inventors have been attending engineering lab classes where they learn programming, robotics, coding, 3D modelling and more.\nThe programme started in 2014, and is called Armath, which translates into English as \"root\". Today there are 650 Armath labs in schools across Armenia.\nThe initiative was established by a business organisation called the Union of Advanced Technology Enterprises (UATE), which represents more than 200 high-tech Armenian companies.\n\"The vision is that we want to see Armenia becoming a tech centre powerhouse that delivers utmost values to Armenia and to the world,\" says Sarkis Karapetyan, the chief executive of UATE.\nIn his spacious, open-plan office in Yerevan he says that there are now around 4,000 tech companies in Armenia.\nArmath is part of the UATE's education and workforce development programme. Mr Karapetyan says the programme is the most successful public-private partnership in the country.\n\"We raise capital expenditure from the private sector, we go to the schools and establish Armath labs, we donate the equipment,\" he says. \"And the government, the education ministry gives us a budget of $2m (\u00a31.5m) annually to pay the salaries of the coaches.\"\nThere are now more than 600 coaches, and 17,000 active students.\n\"The goal is to have 5,000 of the most talented kids decide to become engineers every year,\" says Mr Karapetyan.\nArmenia is a landlocked country of 2.7 million people, the smallest in the South Caucasus region, and its borders with neighbouring Azerbaijan and Turkey have been shut for decades due to unresolved territorial disputes.\nUnlike its neighbours, Armenia does not have natural resources or access to the sea. But throughout the Soviet era it had been a centre of mathematics and computer science.\nIn 1956 the Yerevan Scientific Research Institute of Mathematical Machines was established in Armenia and by 1960 it had developed two first generation computers.\nToday, the country is tapping into its legacy with the ambition to transform itself into the tech powerhouse of the Caucasus.\nAnd there has been some success already. Picsart, a AI-powered photo and video editing website and app, was launched in Armenia in 2011. Today the company of the same name, which has dual headquarters in Yerevan and Miami, is valued at $1.5bn.\nKrisp, which makes audio-processing software, and Service Titan, which provides business software, are other Armenian success stories.\nMeanwhile, an annual report says that Armenia is the best country in the Caucuses region in which to launch a company, putting it in 57th place globally. This compares with Georgia in 70th position, and Azerbaijan in 80th. \nA critical factor in boosting Armenia's tech development is the nation's global diaspora \u2013 some 75% of the world's estimated Armenians, and people of Armenian descent, live elsewhere.\nThis worldwide community provides important connections, especially in the US tech industry. In the US there are as many as 1.6 million people of Armenian ancestry, centred on California.\nSamvel Khachikyan, is director of programs at SmartGate, a venture capital firm based in both California and Armenia that focuses on tech investments.\nHe says that if you look at the top 500 companies in the US, \"for sure you'll find at least one or two Armenians\" in the boardroom or one management level below.\nMr Khachikyan explains how his company helps Armenian entrepreneurs set up operations in the US.\n\"Imagine an Armenian start-up, two young people deciding to go to the US to try to operate there, they have no connections, no knowledge about the culture how it works.\n\"It's gonna be hard, very hard. We are helping them, it's like the launch of the rocket, the first couple of seconds is the hardest.\"\nSmartGate takes Armenian founders to Silicon Valley and Los Angeles for intensive networking with top US companies and investors.\nBut many Armenian start-ups first test their products in their home market.\nIrina Ghazaryan, is the founder of an app called Dr Yan that is changing how Armenians access healthcare by enabling them to more easily book appointments with doctors.\nMs Ghazaryan was previously working in product and web design when, helped by the fact she comes from a family of doctors, she identified a gap in the market. \"Patients couldn't find the right doctors, and doctors were suffering from endless calls.\"\nThe app operates on a subscription model, with doctors paying to be listed on the platform, and there are plans to expand.\n\"We are growing at least 25% revenue month by month,\" adds Ms Ghazaryan. \"We are almost break-even in Armenia and that gives us strength to start expanding to other markets, like Uzbekistan.\"\nArmenia's tech ecosystem received an unexpected boost in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Thousands of Russian IT specialists left their country, and many chose to settle in Armenia.\nMeanwhile, US chipmaking giant Nvidia moved its Russian office to Armenia.\nVasily is a Russian IT consultant who relocated to Armenia in 2023. \"Armenia was the most friendly to people from Russia in order to help them move, adapt and so on,\" he says.\nHe estimates that that the Russian IT community in Armenia now totals 5,000 to 8,000 people. This influx has said to have filled crucial skill gaps in Armenia's tech sector, in areas such as data processing, cybersecurity, and financial technologies.\nYet Vasily says that Armenia can be expensive and the country needs to reduce the tax burden on IT firms if it wants them to stay in the country.\nHowever, overall optimism remains high about Armenia's tech future. Samvel Khachikyan expects the sector to boom. He points to Service Titan, which floated on the New York Stock Exchange last December, and is now worth more than $10bn.",

        "article_text": "As Romania's bear population grows, so do the opportunities for travellers to come face to face with the predators in a responsible way.\nRomania is home to the largest population of wild brown bears in Europe outside of Russia, with as many as 13,000 bears living in and around the largely untouched forests of the Carpathian Mountains. But while bear-spotting has long been a tourist attraction in Romania, it historically didn't involve venturing into the forest.\n\"It wasn't that long ago that it was commonplace to see a bear kept in a cage outside of businesses here to attract customers,\" host Reece Parkinson explained in a recent episode of BBC's The Travel Show.\nWhen Romania joined the European Union in 2007, the country began to adhere to the EU Zoos Directive, which issues guidelines for how captive animals are to be treated. In the past 18 years, the country has turned to more humane and sustainable ways to show off one of Europe's last truly wild corners and the brown bears who thrive here.\nBrown bears have roamed the woods and mountains of Europe for millions of years. However, their numbers dwindled significantly as human civilisation expanded. Today, it's estimated that roughly 36,000 bears live in the European part of Russia, but new research conducted by Romania's Forestry Research Institute reveals that the nation's brown bear population is much higher than previously estimated \u2013 a fact that has brought both opportunity and challenges to surrounding communities.\nOn one hand, sustainable bear tourism in Romania is growing. Numerous tour operators like\u00a0Outdoor Holidays\u00a0and\u00a0Much Better Adventures\u00a0now offer visitors guided \"bear-sighting\" hiking trips into the forests where brown bears live. This, in turn, also brings economic opportunities to the country's more rural communities and encourages continued conservation of the animals' habitat.\nThere's even a dedicated safe haven:\u00a0Libearty Bear Sanctuary,\u00a0nestled in the southern Carpathian Mountains in the town of Zarnesti, is the world's largest brown bear sanctuary. It not only rescues and provides medical care to formerly captive bears who can't be released into the wild, but also offers public tours, allowing visitors them to see the bears in a 69-hectare expanse of oak forests and grasslands.\u00a0\n\"In the last 20 years, Cristina Lapis and her team [at Libearty Bear Sanctuary] have given a home to over 130 bears here in Transylvania,\" said Parkinson.\nUnfortunately, not everyone is enthusiastic about their furry neighbours. As the bear population flourishes, so do dangerous encounters with humans.\nSome local farmers, many of whom have lost livestock to the bears, have lobbied for culling Romania's brown bear population. Visitors have also had conflicts with the animals, often because of unexpected encounters while hiking the mountains \u2013\u00a0several of which have\u00a0turned deadly. Still Lapis, who runs the sanctuary, insists that such encounters are not the norm.\u00a0\n\"I know hundreds of thousands of cases where people who are used to the forest saw a bear and nothing happened. So [there] must be something special that an accident happened,\" said Lapis. \"When you go in the forest\u2026 it's important to make noise. If you make noise the animal knows you're coming and goes away.\"\nEfforts are underway to try to find a happy medium that protects the bears and keeps visitors and livestock as safe as possible. The animals are protected under Romanian law, and reforestation and educational efforts are underway to prevent the bears from entering into human territory to feed and to teach humans what to do when they encounter a bear in the woods.\u00a0 \u00a0\nMost life-threatening encounters with bears are due to human error, usually when a human startles a bear or interacts inappropriately with cubs, making mother bears defensive. Therefore, when hiking in bear country \u2013 whether in Romania or elsewhere \u2013 it's important to talk loudly or clap your hands to give the animals time to avoid you. If you come upon a bear accidentally, make yourself as large as possible and back away. \u00a0\u00a0\n\"We cannot live alone [in the wilderness],\" Lapis said. \"We have to learn to share.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0\u00a0",

        "article_text": "A commercial expedition is planning to take clients up the tallest mountain in the world in record time with the help of xenon gas. But some in the climbing and medical world worry whether the strategy is an unnecessary gamble.\nWhen Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary\u00a0made their first successful ascent of Mount Everest in 1953, it took more than two months of effort to reach the summit. In order to adjust to the extreme thin air at high altitude, the team spent several weeks acclimatising, working their way slowly upwards. After reaching Base Camp, they spent seven weeks making brief forays up and down the mountain to set ropes, lay ladders and establish ever higher camps before their assault on the summit. In short, they laid siege to the mountain.\nToday, the miles of fixed ropes put along the route by teams of Sherpas and the slick logistics perfected by commercial guiding companies allow hundreds of climbers to summit Everest every year. But the time it takes for most to climb Mount Everest hasn't changed dramatically since that first ascent.\nMany expeditions still recommend allowing around two months to reach the top with extensive acclimatisation, although this depends on a range of factors including the weather, traffic on the mountain and the fitness of the climber. It can take up to a week to trek to Base Camp, but once there most people need, on average, around 40 days to reach the summit. But some companies even offer fast-track expeditions that claim to get clients there in as little as two weeks.\nThis season, however, one guiding company has promised to slash the time even further by taking its clients to the top of the world in just one week, starting from an airport in London. They will fly to Kathmandu in Nepal, take a helicopter to Everest base camp and climb the mountain in only a few days. This way, they will skip the usual painstaking three weeks of acclimatisation in the mountains \u2013 all for around \u20ac150,000 (\u00a3127,000/$170,000) per person. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe offer, which raised more than a few eyebrows in the climbing community, came from Austrian guide Lukas Furtenbach, who will rely on an unexpected new strategy \u2013 inhaling xenon, a noble gas that is sometimes used as an anaesthetic.\nThe logic behind the idea is relatively simple. Around 10 years ago, it became apparent that xenon has one interesting side effect \u2013 it increases production of a protein called erythropoietin. Known for short as EPO, erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that our kidneys produce as reaction to insufficient oxygen levels. EPO fights hypoxia \u2013 a condition that occurs when the body can't get enough oxygen \u2013 by increasing the number of red blood cells and the crucial protein they carry, haemoglobin, which transports oxygen around the body. At high altitudes, this process will naturally happen after multiple rounds of going up and down the mountain \u2013 acclimatisation in other words \u2013 to slowly adapt the body to lower oxygen levels.\nBut xenon, it is claimed, could potentially offer a shortcut. By inhaling carefully controlled doses of the gas shortly before the expedition, it may be possible to accelerate the effects of acclimatisation. Furtenbach says he successfully tested xenon himself on previous expeditions. There is, however, little published scientific evidence showing the strategy works. One recent systematic review of the scientific research, for example, found no conclusive evidence that inhaling xenon had a positive effect on the action of EPO in the human body.\n\"Increase in erythropoietin does nothing on its own,\" says Andrew Peacock, an honorary professor specialising in altitude medicine at the University of Glasgow in the UK. \"The question in this case is, does it really stimulate production of red blood cells in such a short period?\"\nFor Furtenbach, the main goal of this strategy is to allow climbers to summit faster and so reduce the risk of being caught in bad weather, avalanches or getting sick.\n\"The less time you spend on the mountain, the safer the expedition becomes,\" he says.\u00a0\nMore like this:\u00a0\n\u2022 How tall will Mount Everest get before it stops growing\n\u2022 Death in the clouds: The problem with Everest's bodies\n\u2022 Scientists in Antarctica began developing their own accent\nFurtenbach has a reputation for pushing the limits of what is possible on Everest. He has specialised in offering \"flash\" three-week expeditions, where mountaineers pre-acclimatise at home before making their trip. In the Everest climbing season of 2025, he is planning to use the xenon approach to help four British clients reach the summit in early May.\nMany in the mountaineering community, however, have reacted to his plans with a mix of scepticism and condemnation.\nThe medical commission at the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA) \u2013 the umbrella group for mountaineering organisations around the world \u2013 issued a cautionary statement after Furtenbach revealed his plans. It warned of the absence of clinical research or scientific proof about the safety and efficiency of using xenon at high altitudes. A previous assessment by the same body also warned that drugs designed to induce EPO could potentially increase the risk of blood clots capable of triggering strokes or pulmonary embolisms.\nSome climbers have also\u00a0pointed\u00a0out that substances that artificially increase the amount of EPO in the blood \u2013 including xenon \u2013 are\u00a0banned\u00a0by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) in competitive sport.\n\"Why would we use substances in mountaineering that are banned in all other sports,\" says Adrian Ballinger, an American climber and owner of rival guiding company Alpenglow Expeditions. His own company guided climber Roxanne Vogel to the summit of Everest in just 14 days in 2019, where she used an \"altitude chamber\" at the gym and work to help her pre-acclimatise before the expedition.\nBut in the world of commercial guided mountaineering, where anti-doping rules don't apply, clients are largely unconcerned about the style of ascent. Some in the climbing community are simply curious to see how this will unfold.\n\"It would be great if this is true, and we could use xenon in the future to make the work of Sherpas safer,\" says Dawa Steven Sherpa, owner of Nepal-based guiding company Asia Trekking.\nAfter all, it won't be the first time humans have enlisted the help of drugs to survive on the tallest mountains \u2013 one of the harshest environments on Earth.\nAs climbers ascend to high altitude, they experience a drop in atmospheric pressure that reduces the amount of oxygen they inhale. This is because the number of air molecules in the atmosphere falls the higher you get. At 5,500m (18,045ft) \u2013 slightly above the Everest base camp \u2013 there is roughly only half as much oxygen available for us to breathe compared with at sea level. On the summit at 8,850m (29,035ft), this drops to one-third of the usual oxygen. The weather on any given day can also have an effect, leading to dramatic swings in atmospheric pressure to such an extent that it would be equivalent to climbing an additional 700m (2,297ft), according to one study.\nAll of this means that climbers are able to get less oxygen into their blood stream and into their bodies. Researchers who have studied blood oxygen levels of climbers on Everest have recorded some of the lowest levels ever seen in humans.\nIf exposed suddenly to these conditions, people can become severely hypoxic, a state that is normally only seen in critically ill patients being treated in hospitals or during serious incidents while under anaesthetic. From altitudes as low as 4,500m (14,764ft) \u2013 brain function starts to become impaired in ways that affect decision-making and problem-solving tasks.\nThe human body, however, is able to adapt to hypobaric hypoxia (hypoxia caused by low air pressure) and reacts with a range of different responses, explains Martin Burtscher, a long-time researcher in the field of high-altitude medicine and professor at University of Innsbruck in Austria. We start to hyperventilate and consequently exhale more carbon dioxide, which helps counteract oxygen desaturation. Kidney and bladder function also change to increase the concentration of blood cells, while an increase in heart rate drives more oxygen around the body, says Burtscher.\nErythropoiesis, a process that increases red blood cell production in response to the presence of EPO, is one of the most important adaptations. After weeks of acclimatisation, erythropoiesis increases total blood volume and oxygen transportation capacity.\nSometimes, however, these adaptive responses can fail.\n\"If hypoxia becomes too severe, acute mountain sickness or life-threatening pulmonary or brain oedema develop,\" says Burtscher.\nIn those cases, capillaries of the lung and the brain lose their ability to retain fluids, which leaks out between the cells into brain or lung tissue, explains Andrew Peacock. The consequence is loss of brain or lung function, both potentially fatal.\nIt is why most climbers on the world's highest mountains use supplementary oxygen, delivered from canisters through breathing apparatus, with a constant flow of the gas coming from high-pressure cylinders that mountaineers carry in their backpacks.\n\"It makes a huge difference,\" says Peacock. \"You are basically mimicking a lower altitude. It makes you less breathless, and it improves the function of the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver and muscles.\" \u00a0\u00a0\nBoth Hillary and Norgay used supplementary oxygen in 1953 and that approach continues today. Of 7,269 people known to have reached the summit of Mount Everest, only 230 have done it without the aid of supplemental oxygen.\nThere are some in the mountaineering community, however, who believe supplemental oxygen could also be considered as doping. It is a highly charged debate, balancing climber safety against ideals of a more \"pure\" style of mountaineering. The Piolet d'Or, the most prestigious annual award in mountaineering, tends to celebrate ascents achieved without supplemental oxygen, for example.\nEager to mitigate the effects of altitude further, some mountaineers and doctors have been willing to experiment with other remedies too, from existing prescription drugs to sketchy stimulants.\nIn 1953, the legendary Austrian alpinist Hermann Buhl achieved one the greatest feats in the history of mountaineering, summiting alone on the 8,126m (26,660ft) Himalayan peak Nanga Parbat. It remains the only time anyone has managed a \"solo\" first ascent of an 8,000m (26,247ft) peak. Buhl's feat is considered even more impressive as he did it without supplemental oxygen. During the gruesome descent, he was famously forced to spend the night at 7,900m (25,919ft), standing on a narrow ledge while leaning against a rock. At that time, Buhl was already known as a hard-core, pioneering alpinist. Still, it was unthinkable that somebody could survive this ordeal.\nAs he later described in his autobiography, he did, however, have a little help in his backpack in form of pervitin, methamphetamine pills that had been widely used by Nazi troops during World War Two.\nAnother stimulant, amphetamine, is often rumoured to be occasionally used by climbers on high-altitude mountain slopes. One study from 1993 analysed urine samples taken from 253 male mountaineers after a successful ascent to different mountains. Amphetamines traces were found in 7.1% of samples from those climbing above 3,300m (10,827ft).\nBy far the most popular prescription drug among mountaineers is acetazolamide, better known as Diamox. This carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, used in the treatment of many conditions, from glaucoma to epilepsy, also happens to be quite useful at high altitudes.\n\"It accelerates acclimatisation and improves sleep,\" says Burtscher.\nDexamethasone, a powerful corticosteroid, is still considered as the number one life-saving medicine for cerebral oedema and acute mountain sickness since it buys some time for the sick person to descend. Some research has indicated that dexamethasone could also be useful as a prophylactic treatment to stave off acute mountain sickness, although medical experts warn that it can result in potentially serious side effects and do not recommend it for this use.\nThere were hopes that sildenafil, commonly known as Viagra, could also help to protect against high-altitude pulmonary oedema, but trials did not shown it to be effective.\nThe search for other drugs that can help give climbers a boost in performance and acclimatisation at high altitude never stopped. A team of doctors in Willemstad, Cura\u00e7ao, for example, recently published details about a test of a drug normally used to treat anaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Two climbers took the drug, which stimulates EPO production, as they ascended Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.\nBut even with all this help, Everest is a treacherous place and there is no guarantee of survival. Although there is little research on how long someone can remain at very high altitudes, experts agree that even with acclimatisation, the body will eventually start to deteriorate. Extremes of cold and wind exposure, the strain placed on the lungs and heart, deterioration of the tissues and organs, dehydration and weight loss all make spending any prolonged visit to the so called \"Death Zone\" \u2013 generally considered to be above 8,000m (26,247ft) \u2013 increasingly dangerous.\nSo, cutting down the time spent on the mountain is always beneficial.\nThis is where xenon could make a real difference, at least according to Michael Fries, head of the department of anaesthesiology at St Vincenz Krankenhaus Limburg in Germany, who came up with the idea and suggested it to Furtenbach. \u00a0\nXenon has been used in a wide range of products, from car headlights to ion propulsion engines and ballistic missiles. It could also serve as an anaesthetic, which is something Fries spent years researching while working at University Hospital Aachen in Germany.\n\"It is an almost ideal anaesthetic since it has a very rapid effect, quickly leaves the body and doesn't interact with other drugs,\" says Fries.\nUsing xenon for anaesthesia, however, proved to be challenging for multiple reasons. This extremely expensive gas must make up 70% of the anaesthetic mixture and it requires special equipment for administration.\nThen, in 2014, Fries and his colleagues heard claims that some Russian athletes had used xenon at the 2014 Winter Olympics to improve performance, so the group from University Hospital Aachen did their own study on 24 healthy volunteers. The results confirmed that a single inhalation of 30% xenon for 45 minutes significantly increased EPO level eight hours after exposure. According to Fries, the main effect of EPO production should be strongest within the first few days and last up to 14 days.\nCurious if this advantage could be used in the hypoxia-inducing world of high-altitude mountaineering, Fries contacted Furtenbach.\nPreviously, Furtenbach had managed to shorten the Everest expedition time to two weeks by using so-called hypoxic pre-acclimatisation. However, sleeping at home for eight weeks in tents with a lower percentage of oxygen or repeatedly breathing reduced amounts of air through a mask was never a strategy that found much favour among his clients.\nKeen to try the xenon idea, Furtenbach did a test run on Aconcagua, 6,961m (22,838ft) high mountain in Argentina. He received a low dose of xenon shortly before the expedition in 2020.\n\"I reached the summit within a week, without any prior acclimatisation. I felt strong and fast,\" says Furtenbach.\nHe claims his red blood cell count went up by 10% while measurements of his blood oxygen saturation on the summit showed it was 89%.\nIf true, academics say, this would be remarkable. \u00a0At sea level, normal blood oxygen saturation is between 96-100%. Measurements taken from nine climbers during an expedition to Everest in 1993 showed that blood oxygen saturation of climbers fell below 90% at around 4,700m (15,420ft), while at 8,000m (26,247ft) climbers had only 70% saturation without supplementary oxygen. Even with supplementary oxygen, this increased only to 80%. Measurements taken during a research expedition to Everest in 2007 showed an even starker reduction in blood oxygen saturation in four climbers at an altitude of 8,400m (27,559ft), measuring some of the lowest levels ever recorded in humans who are not already close to death.\n\"I'm quite sceptical,\" says Mike Grocott, professor of anaesthesia and critical care at University of Southampton who led the research team during the 2007 expedition and has summited Everest himself. \"Xenon has a number of biological mechanisms, including boosting EPO, but the effect on red blood cells and oxygen transport is questionable.\"\nIn 2022, Furtenbach and two fellow guides did another xenon test \u2013 this time on Everest. The results, he says, were the same as on Aconcagua, except this time the group prepared at home with hypoxic pre-acclimatisation, where their bodies were slowly introduced to lower levels of oxygen by sleeping in a hypoxic tent at home.\n\"In each of these cases, we could see the effects on the endurance and the physical abilities,\" says Fries, who was involved in analysing the data gathered during the tests. \"They all had high oxygen saturations without the long acclimatisation periods and increase in haemoglobin levels.\"\nBut he acknowledges there is still a lack of peer-reviewed scientific research on this and says he hopes to publish findings in the future.\nFries also refutes concerns that xenon, when administered in small doses, could reduce decision-making ability on the mountain. The UIAA medical committee, for example, warned that using an anaesthetic gas in an unmonitored setting could affect brain function, stating \"even slight sedation is detrimental in the potentially dangerous setting of high-altitude mountaineering\". Fries says that in small doses, xenon only results in a short period of dizziness immediately after administration. \u00a0\nThree medical experts the BBC contacted for this story \u2013 all veterans of high-altitude research \u2013 are not entirely convinced about the strategy as a way to summit the highest mountain on Earth. They argue there is insufficient scientific proof that xenon actually does enhance performance at high altitude.\nBurtschner and Grocott both point to a study which confirmed that xenon did increase EPO concentration, but failed to \"stimulate increases in plasma volume or erythropoiesis, leaving cardiorespiratory fitness and athletic performance unchanged\".\nXenon, Grocott says, would need to have an \"extraordinary\" effect to enable someone to climb to the summit in just one week. \"That would have to be a very dramatic change. And I haven't seen any data suggesting that's true.\"\nIn the meantime, Furtenbach is proceeding with the plan to send four clients up Everest with the help of xenon gas. All four are in good physical shape, he says. They will climb with guides and bottled oxygen. Once new fixed ropes are in place, all the team will need is seven days of good weather.\u00a0\nThe rest of the world, meanwhile, will be watching.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Munira Wilson, Liberal Democrat MP for Twickenham, told BBC London: \"We welcome all initiatives that Heathrow and any other organisation takes to improve biodiversity and encourage people to take an interest in nature.

        "article_text": "At least 11 people were killed after a suspected car ramming attack in the Canadian city of Vancouver on Saturday. \nThe incident, which took place at the annual Lapu Lapu festival which celebrates Filipino culture, also left dozens of people injured. \nA 30-year-old male suspect has been taken into custody. \nAn investigation into the attack has been launched. \nHere's what we know so far. \nThe attack took place at approximately 20:14 local time on Saturday (03:14 GMT on Sunday) at an event marking Lapu Lapu Day, which is celebrated every year on 27 April. \nPolice later said that tens of thousands of people had been in attendance at the festival. \nFestival-goers said a single vehicle was involved in the attack, which took place on East 43rd Avenue and Fraser in the south of Vancouver. \nWitnesses later reported that the vehicle struck pedestrians at the event, at least some of whom were in an area that was being used by food trucks. \nThe driver of the vehicle was apprehended by bystanders, and then taken into custody by police officers. \nThe Lapu Lapu Festival in Vancouver, and similar festivals in the Philippines and around the world, take place every year to commemorate Lapu-Lapu, a national hero who resisted Spanish colonisation in the 1500s.\nAlso known as Lapulapu, Lapu Lapu was an indigenous chief of Mactan, an island in the Philippines.\nIn 1521, he and his men defeated Spanish forces led by Ferdinand Magellan and some of his native allies at the battle of Mactan, delaying Spanish occupation of the region for over 40 years. \nHe is considered a hero in the modern-day  Philippines, and monuments in his honour are common around the country. \nSeveral Filipino government organisations - such as the national police service - use his image on their seals. \nLapu Lapu Day was officially recognised by the government of British Columbia in 2023. Filipinos form one of the largest immigrant groups in the province. \nSo far, very little is known about the identity of those were were killed and wounded in the attack. \nIn a brief news conference on Saturday, acting Vancouver police chief Steve Rai said that men, women and young people were among the victims. \nTheir ages range from five to 65, he added.\nThe attack has deeply affected Vancouver's tight-knit Filipino community. \nRJ Aquino, the head of the Filipino BC organisation, said that \"last night was extremely difficult and the community will feel this for a long time.\"\n\"We know that there's a lot of questions floating about and we don't have all the answers, but we want to tell everybody that we're grieving,\" he added.\nPolice have not yet named the suspect, who they identified only as a 30-year-old resident of the Vancouver area. \nWhile investigators have not confirmed a motive, Rai said that police are confident \"that the evidence in this case does not lead us to believe this was an act of terrorism.\" \nThe suspect, he added, has \"a significant history of interactions with police and healthcare professionals related to mental health\".\nVancouver's mayor, Ken Sim, similarly said that \"mental health appears to be the underlying issue here.\" \nNo further details have been provided on the previous interactions for police, what they entailed or when they took place. \nRai said only that there had not been any interaction with officers in the \"immediate\" lead-up to the attack ",

We are currently researching the next steps for the treatment of the painting\", the museum spokesperson told the BBC. \n\"We expect that the work will be able to be shown again in the future,\" they added.\nSophie McAloone, the conservation manager at the Fine Art Restoration Company, said that \"modern unvarnished\" paintings like Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 are \"particularly susceptible to damage\".\nThis is \"owing to a combination of their complex modern materials, lack of a traditional coating layer, and intensity of flat colour fields, which make even the smallest areas of damage instantly perceptible,\" she said.\n\"In this case, scratching of the upper paint layers can have a significant impact on the viewing experience of the piece,\" Ms McAloone said.\nThe Rothko painting was hanging in the museum's Depot \u2013 a publicly accessible storage facility beside the main museum \u2013 as part of an exhibition displaying a selection of \"public favourites\" from the gallery's collection.\nJonny Helm, a marketing manager at the art restoration service Plowden & Smith, said the incident had implications for UK institutions such as V&A East and the British Museum, which are considering \"opening up the display of things that would otherwise be obscured in archives.\"\n\"How will this event affect other UK institutions who are opening up their archives in the same way?\" Mr Helm said. \nRestoring a Rothko painting is a difficult task because \"Rothko's mixture of pigments and resins and glues were quite complex\", Mr Helm said.\nHe said the fact the painting is unvarnished \u2013 meaning it is \"open to the environment\" \u2013 will pose an additional challenge to conservators.\nConservators working to restore the painting will now likely be in the process of documenting the extent of the damage and researching \"historic successful treatments\" of Rothko paintings.\n\"Rothko works seem to have terrible luck \u2013 this isn't the first damaged Rothko we've heard about,\" Mr Helm said.\nRothko's 1958 work, Black on Maroon, was deliberately vandalised by Wlodzimierz Umaniec at London's Tate Modern gallery in October 2012.\nUmaniec was sent to prison for two years and subsequently apologised for his actions.\nDuring his trial, prosecuting barrister Gregor McKinley said the cost of repairing the work would be about \u00a3200,000. It took conservators 18 months to repair the painting.\nRachel Myrtle, Head of Specie and Fine Arts at Aon, a company that offers insurance broking to its clients, said fine art insurance policies typically cover \"all risks associated with physical loss and damage to artwork\".\nThis includes \"accidental damage caused by children or visitors, albeit with certain exclusions\", she said.\nShe said that when an artwork is damaged, a gallery's insurer will appoint a specialist fine art loss adjuster to visit the museum. \nThe loss adjustor typically \"reviews the damage to the artwork, examines any CCTV footage to determine the exact cause of the loss, and assesses conservation options\", Ms Myrtle said.\nThe museum did not comment on who will be held liable for the damage to the 1960 painting, which the gallery reportedly bought in the 1970s.\nThe Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen has previously billed visitors who have caused damage to artworks on display.\nIn 2011, the museum asked an unsuspecting tourist who stepped on Wim T. Schippers' peanut butter floor artwork, called Pindakaasvloer, to pay for repairs to the work.\nSharon Cohen, a spokesperson for the museum at the time, was quoted by AD as saying: \"It is normal procedure for people to pay if they damage art.\"\nThe Rothko painting is described by the museum as an example of colour field painting, a term used to describe art characterised by large blocks of flat, solid colour spread across a canvas.\nRothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 painting is one of several works of modern art that have been damaged in the Netherlands in recent years.\nIn November 2024, multiple screen prints by the US pop artist Andy Warhol were damaged by thieves during an attempted robbery of the MPV art gallery in the town of Oisterwijk.\nIn another incident, a Dutch town hall admitted it \"most likely\" disposed of 46 artworks by accident \u2013 including an Andy Warhol print of the former Dutch queen \u2013 during renovation works last year.\nMuseums have different policies when responding to damage caused by children.\nIn August last year, a four-year-old boy accidentally smashed a 3,500-year-old jar into pieces at the Hecht Museum in Israel.\nAt the time, Hecht Museum worker Lihi Laszlo told the BBC the museum would not treat the incident \"with severity\" because \"the jar was accidentally damaged by a young child\".\nThe family were invited back to the exhibition with his family for an organised tour shortly after the incident occurred.",

        "article_text": "The world's rainforests are often referred to as the \"lungs of the earth\".\nThey store billions of tonnes of carbon and in doing so help to reduce the impacts of climate change.\nBut with more than one and half trillion trees, measuring exactly how much carbon they store has been virtually impossible, until now.\nOn Tuesday, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched a first-of-a-kind satellite which uses a special radar system to reveal what lies beneath the canopy.\nIt is hoped it will help scientists better understand the importance of rainforests in storing carbon and the impact of deforestation.\nThe rocket took off from ESA's Kourou station in French Guiana and flying over the Amazon, one of the rainforests it will study.\nThe satellite on board has been affectionately named \"space brolly\" for its giant 12m diameter antenna which will send out signals.\n\"We really want to interrogate these forests. We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.\nHe said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".\nThe antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.\n\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.\n\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.\nThe 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.\nIt is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.\nCurrently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.\n\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics. \n\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\" \nOn the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back. \nThe satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"\nDespite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch. \n\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.\nAirbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.\nL3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.\nThe team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.\nThese annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.\n\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney. \nAnother advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.\nIt is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.\n\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\" \nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

His dad coming on the floor and showing me a towel with his [son's] face on it, [saying] 'This is what we do. We do this.' I feel like that's very, very disrespectful.\"\nHaliburton, who says he was unaware of his father's actions at the time, has apologised to Antetokounmpo.\n\"I had no idea it happened until I got back to the locker room and they showed me the video of my pops,\" said Haliburton.\n\"We had a little talk about it. I don't agree with what transpired there. \n\"Basketball is basketball. Let's keep it on the court. I think he just got excited.\"\nThe Indiana Pacers have never won an NBA Championship \nThe defeat means the Bucks' hopes of a first Championship since 2021 are over.\nThey held a seven-point lead with 40 seconds remaining in game five but the Pacers forced two crucial turnovers in the final 17 seconds. \nHaliburton's winning lay-up was the end of an uninterrupted eight-point run which swung the game in the Pacers' favour. \nThey will face the Cleveland Cavaliers in the semi-finals.\nJayson Tatum is a six-time NBA All-Star\nDefending champions the Boston Celtics sealed a 4-1 series win with a comfortable 120-89 win against the Orlando Magic.\nJayson Tatum top scored with 35 points, as well as 10 assists and eight rebounds.\nThe game turned in the third quarter when Magic forward Paolo Banchero was forced to sit out following his fifth foul, when the Magic held a four-point lead.\n\"It definitely swung the series.

        "article_text": "Pollock has scored six tries in six Champions Cup games this season\nInvestec Champions Cup semi-final: Leinster v Northampton\nDate: Saturday 3 May Venue: Aviva Stadium, Dublin Kick-off: 17:30 BST\nCoverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra and BBC Radio Northampton\nCourtney Lawes called him a \"cocky little\" something.\nLewis Ludlam's description, external is similarly difficult to print.\nMaro Itoje opted for \"absolutely annoying\" and \"a pest\".\nAnd they are Henry Pollock's team-mates.\nTommy Freeman, who plays alongside Pollock for England and Northampton, smiles at the inevitable question.\n\"What's Henry really like? You can probably guess what he is like...\"\nA lot of people have been asking. Because a lot of people have been watching.\nIt is not just what Pollock has done in the past 12 months - winning the Under-20 World Cup, scoring two tries on his senior England debut, being nominated for the Champions Cup player of the year, preparing to line up against Leinster in Saturday's semi-final and butting into the Lions selection conversation.\nIt is the way he has done it.\nThe 20-year-old back row has swagger and self-possession, and a side order of skulduggery.\nThere has been no dutiful trade-learning and spur-earning.\nInstead, just prodigious talent, Tigger-ish energy, galloping pace and a presumption that the world is his for the taking.\nIt gets people talking. And has done for a while.\nEighteen months ago a video circulated among Bedford's players.\nThey had been told that Pollock, then only 18, was joining them in the Championship on loan.\n\"He came with a little bit of a reputation as he was very well thought of by Saints' academy,\" says Bedford's Alex Woolford.\n\"This viral clip of him did the rounds among us. He was being interviewed after an England Under-18 win over South Africa and swore three times in about 10 seconds.\n\"We knew he was going to be very enthusiastic.\"\nHe was.\n\"We were pretty poor in the first half against Ampthill,\" adds Woolford, remembering Pollock's first start.\n\"Henry tried to give us the hairdryer treatment. He was effing and blinding and telling us we were not good enough and I remember thinking 'bloody hell, what is this kid doing?'\n\"But you have to give him credit.\n\"In rugby environments it is very easy to get confidence confused with arrogance. For all the stick he gets, I don't actually think he is an arrogant person.\"\nPollock spent part of the 2023-24 season on loan at Championship side Bedford\nStill, that perception persists.\nFreeman and Woolford say Pollock is a different, calmer character off the pitch, and his Northampton team-mates assured the rest of the England camp that the incoming youngster wasn't the \"idiot\" they were expecting., external \nTheir PR work was duly undermined by Pollock gleefully ripping the ball from Ollie Chessum when tasked with holding a tackle shield in an early training drill.\n\"Probably some of the boys were quite shocked with how I was when I first joined up with England,\" Pollock told BBC's Rugby Union Weekly.\n\"But I guess over time they realised this is just him.\n\"I am quite loud, someone that just brings a different type of energy to other types of players. Whether that is good or bad energy depends who you are talking to.\"\nPollock scored two tries when he made his senior England debut off the bench against Wales in Cardiff in March\nThere are plenty of fans.\nAt Franklin's Gardens kids wear his distinctive black head tape and make cardboard signs asking for Pollock's boots.\nThey love his celebrations. A basketball-style finger-roll lob in the direction of a beaten defender against Castres and an extravagant swallow dive against Bristol were two recent efforts. \nThey love his cunning. Pollock cheekily pulling the sock of Wales prop Gareth Thomas to milk a penalty gained social media traction during the Six Nations.\nAnd they love his abrasive style as he goes nose-to-nose with the opposition, raising tempers and the stakes.\n\"I want to entertain and get the crowd as close as possible to the team,\" he told BBC Radio Northampton's Saints Show.\n\"When I was growing up there, there was a lack of a idols. There were one or two that stick in my mind - Courtney Lawes, Michael Hooper, Richie McCaw - but not many.\n\"For this game to grow and this sport to get bigger, we need more characters, more players the fans want to come and watch.\n\"If you look to the football world, fans very much have their players and the personalities they like.\"\nThis video can not be played\nPollock ruffling feathers!\nPollock is harder to warm to when you are up against him.\nWoolford, Pollock's Bedford team-mate, also faced him in the Blues' annual pre-season fixture against Saints.\n\"On the pitch he is very loud, very confrontational, very in-your-face,\" Woolford remembers.\n\"He just exhausts you, as much mentally and emotionally as physically. But he has backed it up at every level he has stepped up to.\"\nIn the teams' most recent match, one Bedford player attempted to sledge back at Pollock, suggesting he would be back with the Blues on loan by October.\nInstead, by then, Pollock was a Premiership regular.\n\"Being annoying is part of my game,\" Pollock agrees.\n\"I want to wind the opposition up; I want to get under their skin. It is something I relish.\"\nThis weekend he will be digging into Leinster in a re-run of last season's Champions Cup semi-final.\nThe Irish giants could field back-row trio Caelan Doris, Josh van der Flier and Jack Conan.\n\"It is probably one of the best back rows there is,\" says Pollock. \"I am just excited to be able to say I played against them. To share the field with them is special.\"\nBut the deference won't last past the first whistle.\n\"They are beatable,\" he adds. \"We definitely see parts of their game we can attack and go after and hopefully ruffle a few feathers.\"\nIf Pollock's streak of success extends to the Aviva Stadium and his final and toughest Lions audition, he could well make the squad cut five days later.\n\"I have heard the rumours and stuff, but as a player you can't control that,\" he says.\n\"I just have to keep playing well, and if it happens, it happens.\"\nSo far in his career, things invariably do.\nPollock played in England A's win over an Australia second string at the start of this season before being promoted into the senior side",

Aztec legend has it that the creature is a god in salamander form - the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl, disguised as a salamander.\n\"If we can restore this [wetland] habitat and restore the axolotl's population in a city of more than 20 million people,\" Dr Zambrano continued, \"I feel that we have hope for humanity.\"\nTo lay the foundations for releasing the animals, the researchers worked with local farmers and a team of volunteers to create wetland \"refuges\" for the axolotls. They installed natural filtering systems to clean the water,  \nThe scientists released their captive-bred animals at two sites - one in Xochimilco and one at a disused quarry that, over decades, has turned into what they called an \"artificial wetland\".  \nEvery animal was tagged with a radio tracking device. \n\"The amazing news is that they all survived,\" Dr Ramos told BBC News. \"And not only that, but the ones that we recaptured had gained weight - so they're hunting.\"\nThe monitoring also revealed intriguing insights into axolotl behaviour. \"We found that some spend most of their time with one other individual -  like they make these little friendships,\" Dr Ramos explained. \nSomewhat ironically, these charismatic salamanders are found in the world's laboratories and pet aquariums in their hundreds of thousands. The species is biologically fascinating - it has the remarkable ability to regrow any part of its body that is damaged or lost. So there is research underway to understand whether that ability could be harnessed medically. \nBut in the murky wetlands of Mexico City, there is still a great deal of work to do to clean up and restore the habitat, and to give the wild axolotl a chance to recover. \n\"Many animals are losing their habitat around the world,\" said Dr Ramos. \"And restoration projects are not easy, but they can be done -  they just need a lot of people. \n\"You don't need to be a scientist to get involved - everybody in the world can help out.\"",

        "article_text": "Shahida's face crumpled with grief every time she thought about the choice in front of her: Stay for love or go back to her siblings?\nShahida Adrees, now 61, moved to India from Pakistan in 2002, when she married her maternal cousin Adrees Khan, a resident of Punjab state (marriage between cousins is practised in some communities in South Asia).\nThe couple lived a peaceful, predictable life - Khan working as a driver and Shahida looking after their home and child.\nEvery few years, Shahida, who is staying in India on a long-term visa, would obtain a travel permit and make a trip to Pakistan to meet her family.\nBut that sense of routine was shattered last week when India suspended almost all visas for Pakistani citizens as part of its response to the brutal attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 people. Pakistan, which denies any involvement, has hit back with tit-for-tat measures and also cancelled most visas for Indians.\nWhen Shahida heard the news, she knew what it meant; she could either go back to her siblings and other family members in Pakistan now, or stay and risk never seeing them again.\nShe chose to stay. Earlier this week, she cancelled her plans of going to Pakistan to see an ailing aunt. \"If I had gone, I wouldn't have been let back into India. But now that I am here, I don't know if I'll ever see my brothers and sisters again,\" she says.\nShahida's family is among hundreds in India and Pakistan who, with members on both sides of the borders, now face the risk of separation.\nDespite neighbours India and Pakistan sharing a hostile relationship, love stories and marriages between its citizens are not uncommon. That's because of the deeply intertwined cultural history of the countries which were partitioned along religious lines in 1947, forcing millions to leave their homes and migrate to the other side.\nThe border between the nations runs not just through the ground, but also through families - many Indians have relatives and their hometowns in Pakistan, and vice versa.\nSome, like Shahida's family, have tried to stay in touch with their roots through marriages with relatives across the border. In recent years, many couples have also met online, often overcoming insurmountable odds to stay together. \nMany of them apply for long-term visas that need to be renewed periodically while others apply for citizenship of the respective countries - but the process can take years.\nThis week, as the visa restrictions took effect, heart-breaking visuals of people - young and old couples, desperate sons and daughters, and elderly parents - pleading with authorities for help were splashed across television screens and on social media.\nThe BBC has contacted the Indian foreign ministry for comment. \n\"I came here with my mother. Now they are asking us to leave without her. How can I do that?\" mumbled a tearful Mohammed Ayat, 17.\nA Pakistani national, Ayat came to India last month to meet his maternal relatives. His mother is an Indian citizen who was living in Pakistan on a visa that is pending renewal.\nBut even as her children returned to Pakistan, she had to stay in India as she wasn't sure whether she would be allowed into the country.\n\"They can punish them [the militants], but what is our fault?\" Ayat told ANI news agency.\nThe exact number of people leaving both countries due to the latest tensions is not clear - but is estimated to run into hundreds. \nSitting in a bus that was taking her to the Attari-Wagah border, Parveen (who uses only one name), told reporters that she had lived in India for 41 years.\n\"I have no mother, brothers or sisters in Pakistan. I have nowhere to go there. I am completely helpless,\" she said.\nFamilies say the abruptness of the visa suspensions and the resulting chaos have left them feeling uncertain.\nThe restrictions imposed by Delhi exempt those like Shahida, who have been living in India on a long-term visa which needs to be renewed every few years. Valid for up to five years, these visas are given to women of Pakistani and Bangladeshi nationalities who are married to Indian citizens. \nUnder Indian rules, all long-term visa holders are allowed to visit their home country after obtaining a second permit, called the No Objection to Return to India (NORI) visa.\nBut in the days following the attack, there have been reports of NORI visa holders also being stopped from crossing the border into India, as officials waited for clarity.\nShahida says that in her case, Indian authorities have assured her that NORI visa-holders would be exempted from the restrictions. \nBut she is not willing to take the risk of leaving India.\nShe wondered if things would've been better if she had got an Indian citizenship.\n\"I did apply for it in 2009, but the file never moved. I never received a response,\" she said.\nFor Tahira Ahmed, even becoming an Indian citizen has not been enough to allay her anxieties. A Pakistani by birth, Ms Ahmed moved to Punjab state in 2003 after marrying Maqbool Ahmed, an Indian . In 2016, Tahira was granted Indian citizenship, 13 years after her marriage.\nBut she is still fearful about the prospect of being separated from her family and sent to Pakistan.\n\"Whenever tensions escalate between the two countries, our lives get caught up in the middle,\" she said. \"My own wedding was postponed for two years in 2001 when the border was closed after an attack on India's parliament.\"\nWhile they wait for answers, some couples are desperate.\nEarlier this week, BBC Punjabi met Maria Masih, a Pakistani citizen who moved to India in 2024 to marry her lover Sonu.\nThe two met through social media and knew each other for many years before they decided to get married. According to Sonu, the couple applied for a long-term visa for Maria immediately after their wedding. But their application is still under process. Maria is now seven months pregnant.\n\"I want to live here. I don't want to go back. Please give me a visa and let me stay,\" a forlorn Maria told reporters earlier this week.\nThe couple has since reportedly been absconding and an investigation is under way.\nMiles away, Ms Ahmed wonders if one can really blame them or anyone for trying to escape.\n\"What is their fault anyway? They came here for love,\" she said.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "As Mark Carney settles into the role of Canada's prime minister, he will not only have to take on US President Donald Trump, but also wider divisions within his own country.\nAmong those is a generational divide, with young voters who are concerned about housing unaffordability, crime and the cost of living coalescing around the Conservatives. \nIt's a reversal from 2015, when youth voted in record numbers, helping sweep Carney's predecessor Justin Trudeau to power. \nBut this election, \"baby boomers\" - those over the age of 60 - \"were an essential component to the Liberal success\", pollster David Coletto of Abacus Data told the BBC.\nMeanwhile, younger Canadians, particularly young men, rallied behind the Conservatives.\nOne of them is Connor from Toronto. The 28-year-old told the BBC that he was drawn to the party because of its focus on housing and the cost of living. \n\"We're getting stuck in a system right now that doesn't seem to be working,\" he said. \"It worked for our parents, but not for us.\"\nHe added that he has grown \"tired of the same Liberal policies for the last 10 years\".\nAhead of the election, support for the Conservatives outpaced the Liberals by 44% to 31.2% among 18 to 34 year olds, a Nanos poll on 25 April indicated. \nThe issues that resonated with Canadians depended on age, too. Carney campaigned heavily on standing up to Trump, while affordability and a broken \"Canadian promise\" were central to Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre's message. \nAbacus Data polling indicated about 18% of 18 to 29 year olds were worried about Trump. That jumped to 45% for voters over 60, suggesting a diversion on key issues between generations.\nA big challenge for Carney and the Liberals will be how they can win back the confidence of  those younger voters, Mr Coletto said, who \"feel really let down and frustrated\".\nIn Monday's election, the Liberals managed to gain more than a dozen seats in a historic comeback election. \nBut the rival Conservatives also made significant gains - enough to block the Liberals from forming a decisive majority government.\nThe Liberals won 169 seats, three shy of a majority, and captured 43% of the popular vote. The Conservatives won 144 seats - 25 more than the previous 2021 election - and 41% of the popular vote.\nSmaller parties, namely the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP), suffered significant losses as voters migrated to the two larger parties.\nCarney's platform did feature proposals on how to tackle affordability, including a pledge to build 500,000 homes annually and a small income tax cut for some Canadians.\nLaura Stephenson, chair of the political science department at Western University, noted the two platforms were not too different on cost of living issues.\n\"It is a question of differences in degree, rather than completely different approaches,\" Prof Stephenson said.\nIn his victory speech, Carney preached a message of unity as he acknowledged the millions of Canadians who cast ballots for other parties.\n\"My message to every Canadian is this: no matter where you live, no matter what language you speak, no matter how you voted, I will always do my best to represent everyone who calls Canada home,\" he said.\nCarney will also face a restive western Canada, where there is a festering sense of alienation from the power centre in Ottawa. \nThose tensions were on display quickly after the election. In a post congratulating Carney, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said Poilievre's vision \"inspired millions\", while the Liberals had \"demonized and demeaned\" her oil-rich province.\nShe called on Carney to \"reset the relationship between Ottawa and Alberta with meaningful action rather than hollow rhetoric\".\nWithout a majority, Carney will also have to work with other party leaders to get legislation passed. The Liberals could try to convince members of the NDP - and even the Conservatives - to cross the aisle, which could turn their strong minority to a majority.\nForming an effective government, as well binding regional and demographic fractures in Canada, is now one of the many items on Carney's to-do list. \nAdditional reporting by Jessica Murphy and Ali Abbas Ahmadi in Toronto.",

But it has also left businesses scrambling to respond. \nAhead of the latest announcement, General Motors and other carmakers said they welcomed the plans to soften the impact of the measures. \n\"We're grateful to President Trump for his support of the US automotive industry and the millions of Americans who depend on us,\" GM chief executive Mary Barra said in an emailed statement.\n\"We appreciate the productive conversations with the President and his Administration and look forward to continuing to work together.\"\nGeneral Motors, which reported its quarterly performance to investors on Tuesday, also said on Tuesday that it needed to rework its forecast for the year and pulled its prior guidance. \nIn an unusual move, it also postponed the call with analysts that had been set to discuss the results. \nTariffs on foreign-made cars - which accounted for nearly half of US sales last year - went into effect last month.\nThe duties on parts were expected to come into force on 3 May. \nUnder the modified plan, carmakers will be able to claim an \"offset\" for what they pay in tariffs on car parts, worth up to 3.75% of the suggested retail price of all the cars they assemble in the US. \nThat share would fall to 2.5% in the second year.\nThe White House said the rules were designed so that a car with 85% of its parts made in the US - or in Canada or Mexico under the terms of an existing free trade deal - would not face any tariffs, a threshold that rises to 90% in the second year. \nThe adjustment is a recognition of the global nature of the industry's current supply networks, where even cars that promote themselves as American-made often source a significant share of their parts from abroad.\nIn remarks to reporters ahead of the signing, Trump downplayed the easing, saying they applied to a \"very, very small part of the car\" and while noting he did not want to penalise companies with factories in the US.\n\"We just wanted to help them during this little transition, short-term,\" he said.  \nLast week, a coalition of US motor industry groups called on the president to not impose the measures on parts. \nA letter to his administration from groups representing companies including GM, Toyota and Volkswagen said the levies would \"lead to higher auto prices for consumers, lower sales at dealerships and will make servicing and repairing vehicles both more expensive\".\nFord said it appreciated Trump's decision, which it said would \"help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers\".\n\"We will continue to work closely with the administration in support of the president's vision for a healthy and growing auto industry in America,\" a statement added.\nThe car maker said policies that encouraged exports and ensured affordable supply chains to promote more domestic growth were \"essential\".\n\"It will be important for the major vehicle importers to match Ford's commitment to building in America,\" the company said, adding that if they did, the US would see a \"windfall of new assembly and supplier factories and hundreds of thousands of new jobs\".\nStellantis chairman John Elkann echoed the sentiments of his rival carmakers in response to the tariff reliefs. \n\"We look forward to our continued collaboration with the US administration to strengthen a competitive American auto industry and stimulate exports,\" he added.",

        "article_text": "Vaibhav Suryavanshi has the highest strike-rate of all batters in this year's IPL\nWhy hit a single when you can hit the ball for a six?\nThat was the very question posed by 14-year-old batting sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi to one of his first coaches in professional cricket.\n\"Vaibhav was hitting sixes and fours off almost every ball,\" recalls Manish Ojha, a former first-class cricketer for Jharkhand.\n\"After the session, I said: 'Vaibhav, why are you only hitting boundaries? The state matches are a four-day format and we will need you to take more singles.' He replied: 'Sir, if I can hit a ball for six, why would I take a single off it?' That's when I realised he was ready for the next level.\"\nThat six-hitting lit up the most glamourous of cricketing stages on Monday when the teenager became the youngest player to score a century in men's T20 cricket.\nBatting for Rajasthan Royals against Gujarat Titans, he took down some of the world's best bowlers in a scintillating 38-ball innings that included 11 sixes and seven fours.\nExperienced international bowlers Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Washington Sundar and Rashid Khan were treated with the same disdain as those unlucky 12-year-olds who netted with Suryavanshi a couple of years earlier.\n14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi stuns the IPL\n'Remember the name' - cricket world reacts to Suryavanshi century\nVaibhav's entry to the IPL has been dramatic. He started his career with a six off the first ball he faced and went on to score a hundred in just his third appearance.\nBorn in Samastipur, a small district in India's Bihar, he quickly showed promise. Vaibhav's father, Sanjeev Suryavanshi, himself a club-level cricketer, saw a spark in his son. But there were no proper academies around the district, so he started his training at home from the age of five.\nSanjeev, who used to run a small shop, began to realise his son needed a proper coach. So when Vaibhav turned eight, his father decided to take him to Patna city, a three-hour journey away.\n\"Many people would tell him: 'What are you doing?' But he was the first person to believe in Vaibhav's abilities,\" said Robin Singh, a coach from Bihar.\n\"To ensure his son trained well and got to use the best facilities, his father had to sell a plot of land. His mother had to make a lot of sacrifices too. She would wake up at three in the morning to prepare breakfast for him and would even send food for the coaches.\"\nVaibhav impressed his new coaches in no time.\n\"When I started working with him, I found him quite different from others. You would give him a demo of a technique or a shot, and he would pick it up in no time,\" Ojha said.\n\"Most of the players adopt things easily in practice, but when it comes to playing matches, they fail. But the unique feature about Vaibhav was that he would execute things perfectly even during high-pressure matches.\"\nVaibhav was always ahead of his age group. From his strokeplay to game awareness, he would stand out.\n\"Within 10 days of playing alongside the kids of his age, we realised we were wasting his time. So, we started making him practise with senior players,\" Singh recalled.\nVaibhav would practise daily from 7.30am to 4pm, facing 450 balls each day. By the time he was 12, his coaches were confident enough to let him pursue cricket professionally.\nHe played for the Bihar under-19s team and amassed consistent runs, prompting selectors to name him in the India Under-19s team. Aged just 13, he smashed a 58-ball hundred in a youth Test against Australia.\nHe was soon drafted into Bihar's squad for the Ranji Trophy (India's premier first-class tournament) before becoming the youngest player to get a contract at the IPL auction as Rajasthan signed him for \u00a3103,789 (1.1 crore rupees) in December 2024.\n\"Vaibhav's role model is Brian Lara, so his game is aggressive, and he plays the ball on merit without any fear at all,\" Ojha added.\n\"We expected him to get an IPL contract, and our joy doubled the moment Rajasthan Royals got him because they have [India legend] Rahul Dravid on their coaching staff.\"\nSingh added: \"When he became the youngest to debut in first-class cricket, I told him: 'Anyone can become the youngest. I'll be happy when you become the youngest centurion.' So yesterday he called me up after scoring the century and said: 'Sir, youngest centurion.' And I couldn't be prouder.\"\nAlmost half of the runs Suryavanshi has scored in the IPL (46%) have come through the mid-wicket and long-on region. He is particularly savage against pace bowling, scoring more than 100 runs at a strike-rate of 243 in this season's IPL against the quicker men\nSuryavanshi has already been nicknamed Boss Baby in cricketing circles by those who see comparisons with Chris Gayle, aka The Universe Boss.\nWest Indian Gayle still holds the record for the fastest IPL century, having taken just 30 balls in 2013, but nobody else has scored one quicker in the competition, while he easily beat the record of 18 years and 118 days for the fastest T20 century which was previously held by Maharashtra's Vijay Zol.\nSachin Tendulkar - the greatest run-scorer of all time - made his India debut aged just 16, and Suryavanshi's former coach believe he will soon follow The Little Master into the national team.\n\"A guy from a small village in Bihar has made it to the IPL. The whole world is talking about him. So, he knows how to open doors. Don't be surprised if he makes it to international level soon,\" Singh said.\nBefore then, Suryavanshi, who has been gifted almost \u00a39,000 by his state government following his IPL century, has his sights set on title-chasing Mumbai Indians on Thursday, where he comes face-to-face with Jasprit Bumrah, the world's best bowler.\nListen to live commentary on Rajasthan Royals v Mumbai Indians on Thursday, live on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app\nSuryavanshi's century has made the front pages of the newspapers in India \n1 of 3\nIPL auction: Vaibhav Suryavanshi and Rishabh Pant make history\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

We have had a poor season, especially in the league. We've been very good in Europe, but the league season has been unacceptable.\n\"He's my manager, he's my gaffer and I respect him an awful amount. The narrative [of Postecoglou's job being under threat] is something we players are trying to keep away from because it's not healthy.\n\"I just know that I come into work every day and see the lads listening and taking on the messages on how he wants us to play and doing the best for this club and we are in a real good position in Europe, where we can still have a special season under his management.\n\"I will continue to do that until the day he isn't here.\"\nSpurs will be without captain Son Heung-min, who is unavailable with a foot injury, against Bodo/Glimt but Maddison says the club are going to \"relish the challenge\" of reaching a first European final since they were beaten by Liverpool in the 2019 Champions League showpiece.\n\"It's huge,\" the England midfielder added. \n\"When you get to the end of your career and you look back, there's not many times a player has been in European semi-finals. Maybe once or twice if you are lucky.\n\"We need to use that. We are in the final four in a massive competition in Europe and use that to have a great tie on Thursday and in Bodo as well.\n\"We've got a real special opportunity. There's obviously been a lot of talk about form and being a poor season, but we have the opportunity to do something very special. \n\"We've earned it and we deserve to be here. It is a challenge we are going to relish.\"\nBodo/Glimt chiefs calm on Knutsen future amid Leeds links\nChelsea keen on Rogers - Wednesday's gossip\nAnge Postecoglou signed James Maddison from Leicester City in June 2023\nBodo/Glimt reached the semi-finals with victory over Lazio on penalties in the last round and Postecoglou has dismissed his side's tag as favourites.\n\"Bodo are there on merit,\" said the Australian manager.\n\"They are there because they are a good football team. It doesn't matter where you come from. I come from the other side of the world where football is the fourth sport, so I don't underestimate anyone.\n\"You say they are a small club and we are big club, it doesn't matter. We are two clubs in the semi-final of a European competition and they have earned the right to be there.\n\"They have done very well to get there and we are going to treat them with the respect they deserve. At the same time, make sure we go in there and give it our best performance.\"\nThe 59-year-old also says Tottenham's success in Europe is being \"diminished\" by some people amid the backdrop of their league form.\nHe added: \"I am really strong at the moment on the parallel worlds we are trying to traverse and I have sensed, which is not surprising because this is the way this club is perceived, people are almost trying to diminish it in some respects.\n\"I have seen some people saying it is the equivalent of Manchester United winning the FA Cup, no. Not on any planet is it equivalent. That is suggesting that maybe we are not worthy of Champions League.\n\"Things are there that are designed to diminish what is ahead of us, which is an unbelievable opportunity. Irrespective of how this season has gone, we have generations of fans who want this more than anything else - to share this with the people that they love, a special moment supporting their football club.\n\"We could be flying in the league, but it wouldn't make this opportunity any different.

We've been very good in Europe, but the league season has been unacceptable. \"Spurs will be without captain Son Heung-min, who is unavailable with a foot injury, against Bodo/Glimt but Maddison says the club are going to \"relish the challenge\" of reaching a first European final since they were beaten by Liverpool in the 2019 Champions League showpiece. \"The 59-year-old also says Tottenham's success in Europe is being \"diminished\" by some people amid the backdrop of their league form.He added: \"I am really strong at the moment on the parallel worlds we are trying to traverse and I have sensed, which is not surprising because this is the way this club is perceived, people are almost trying to diminish it in some respects.",

        "article_text": "BBC's North America team asked for your questions to mark US President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office.\nHere is a selection of those answered by our staff writers and correspondents.  \nThey have aimed to explain the context and facts behind several of the biggest topics in the Trump administration, including the economy and how Trump would handle a war.\nA UK-based reader asks how the UK economy might be impacted by tariffs.\nThe decisions made thousands of miles away will affect the UK economy. Most directly affected are those exporters selling into America, contending with that 10% extra charge (or even more in some cases) being applied to their goods: Do they try to compensate for that by cutting costs elsewhere \u2013 or risk a blow to sales?\nAnd complex supply chains mean that disruption to other economies could be felt here. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey last week referred to a \"growth shock\" \u2013 many economists have cut their forecasts. No one yet is clear on how this trade war will play out, the uncertainty itself is damaging.\nBut the impact on inflation could work the other way. Countries such as China may be tempted to divert goods here instead, given the barriers they face in America. And the drop in oil and other commodity prices, amid market turmoil, could also bode well for keeping bills down.\nSo many economists reckon that with a weaker growth and inflation outlook, interest rates could fall faster than previously thought. A cut of 0.25 percentage points is widely expected next week, another could follow in June.\nAnother reader asks how Trump's immigration policy is likely to affect Canadian-American relations, especially for dual citizens or people with mixed-status families.\nIf the first 100 days are anything to go by, relations between Canada and the US are almost certainly going to continue to be tense - both as a result of tariffs and Trump's repeated, and near constant calls for Canada to become part of the US.\nWe had a taste of that just this week, when - as Canadians headed to the polls in their general election - Trump took to Truth Social to call on Canadians to elect him, seemingly referring to himself as a candidate, to reap the benefits of being the \"cherished\" 51st state.\n\"America can no longer subsidise Canada with the hundreds of billions a year that we have been spending in the past,\" he said. \"It makes no sense unless Canada is a state\".\nHow that impacts dual citizens or mixed-status families is a bit harder to answer.\nBut we're seen a newfound sense of nationalism among many Canadians in response to Trump's rhetoric and policies, and some Americans in Canada have even reportedly given up their citizenship.\nWhile cross-border ties are very unlikely to ground to a standstill, many Canadian citizens - even those with US families - are likely to be more cautious when crossing the border, particularly after high-profile cases of Canadians being detained at the border.\nIn one case, an actress named Jasmine Moody was detained by ICE for about two weeks, later writing about her experience in a viral article in the Guardian.\nA reader asks what Trump's first 100 days tell us about how he'd handle a major international crisis, like another pandemic or a war.\nIt's hard to say how exactly Trump would handle a major international crisis, but we have had glimpses that may provide a few clues.\nTrump's first crisis came just over a week into his administration on 29 January, when a US Army helicopter collided with a passenger aircraft over the Potomac river in Washington DC, killing 67 people.\nLater that morning, I sat in the White House briefing room as Trump - with no evidence - alleged that the diversity, equity and inclusion policies at the Federal Aviation Administration may have led to the crash.\nThis suggests that in the event of a crisis, Trump is later to \"fire from the hip\", sometimes speaking before all the facts are established. Many will remember Trump's initial dismissal of the Covid-19 pandemic in his first administration, sometimes downplaying it as something that would soon \"disappear\".\nMore so than other presidents, Trump also leans heavily on the power of the executive branch, making decisions from the Oval Office that have real-world implications, sometimes bypassing any discussion on Capitol Hill.\nThose close to Trump are quick to say that he listens intently to his advisors, often letting discussions play out amongst them before his eyes. This is, for example, largely what happened with the tariffs issue.\nUltimately, however, he is the one who decides the government's course of action, even if he lets his inner circle - which is perhaps more loyal and disciplined than in the last administration - carry out the details.\nArafin in Bangladesh wants to know how developing countries can navigate this evolving trade landscape and mitigate the risks.\nThere is just no way poorer countries could ever eliminate their trade surplus with the United States.\nThe world envisioned by Donald Trump - where citizens of developing countries buy as many American products as are sold the other way - is simply not possible.\nThe average Bangladeshi citizen, for example, is 32 times poorer than the average American.\nIn this case, the best Bangladeshi officials could do is promise Washington they will reduce some non-tariff barriers that are in place that make it hard for American companies to do business there.\nFor example, they could scrap quotas on imports, cut red tape or tackle corruption more effectively.\nThese small concessions - along with the assumption that American consumers won't put up with rocketing prices - may lead to a softening or removal of Trump's tariffs.\nAfter all, if countries with large and cheap workforces can't sell Americans affordable goods, then who will?\nOne other thing that developing countries will want to consider closely is the role of China in all of this.\nIf you're a worker in a clothing factory in Bangladesh, a 37% US tax might seem a crippling blow to your livelihood - but it's still better than the 125% tariff that Chinese manufacturers are facing.\nAs a Malaysian rubber glove manufacturer told me recently: \"We're not exactly jumping with joy, but this may well benefit us\".\nLimiting dealings with China has been suggested as a way for developing countries to get a better trade deal with the White House. But that isn't very realistic.\nBeijing is by far and away the number one investor in the developing world. If you live in Africa, Asia or South America - it's probably China building your railways, factories and power plants, not the United States.\nThe American consumer market is still the richest in the world and developing countries will want to fight tooth and nail to maintain access to it - but equally there is no way they can side with the US over China.\n\nChris in County Durham, UK, asks if Donald Trump is making millions of dollars on the US stock market by initiating a slump in share values, buying heavy, then reversing his policies to watch his share prices rocket up.\nCritics are accusing President Trump of manipulating the stock market. White House officials have denied the allegations, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling it part of Trump's \"art of the deal\".\nHere's what we know so far:\nOn 9 April, Trump posted on Truth Social, in all caps: \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY! DJT.\" Shortly after, he announced he was pausing the toughest tariffs for 90 days. In between, options traders placed big bets on a market rebound, which ended up being spot on.\nThis led to accusations of market manipulation and insider trading, with Democrats like Senator Adam Schiff calling for an investigation.\nHowever, these cases are hard to prove \u2013 and even harder when you're talking about the president. Legal experts say it would be a \"high\" bar to prove Trump did something illegal in this case. Plus he posted the information publicly.\nClaims of insider trading might have some merit under the STOCK Act, which restricts public officials from profiting off non-public information. Although the White House could argue that the President can't \"gain\" information about policy changes if he \"created\" them.\nSo, it's still up in the air \u2013 but probably not something he needs to lose sleep over.\nJean-Claude asks if there any way within the US Constitution by which Congress could stop Trump's tariffs and take away his freedom to issue Executive Orders at will.\nDonald Trump has been pushing the boundaries of presidential authority with both his tariff declarations and more than 130 executive orders.\nTo do so, he has been asserting that Congress has given him the power to take these actions. To answer your question simply, then - any power that Congress gives, Congress can take back.\nTraditionally, executive orders are a presidential interpretation of how laws should be implemented. Congress could step in and tell the White House that those interpretations are wrong.\nTrump has been citing a 1977 law that grants him power to enact tariffs in cases of national emergency. Congress could amend that law or pass legislation that says no such emergency exists. There has already been a bipartisan proposal in the Senate to do exactly that.\nThe challenge for Trump's opponents is finding a majority in the two chambers of Congress, both narrowly controlled by Republicans, to do so. The House of Representatives, in particular, is full of Republicans who are marching in lockstep with the president. The House recently adopted a provision that would make it much harder to rescind Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, for instance.\nEven if Congress was able to reach agreement on curtailing presidential power, Trump could decide to exercise his veto to block it from becoming law \u2013 something he's already threated to do with the Senate tariff bill. And if he did that, it would take two-thirds of both chambers to override the president.\nSo Congress does have the ability to stop Trump, but perhaps not the interest or will to do so \u2013 at least not unless and until next year's midterm elections shift the balance of power in the legislature toward the Democrats.\nRachel in Canada wonders if we can comment on what the real threat of annexation is for Canada with Trump in office. Should we be worried?\nA lot depends on what the US president means when he talks about making Canada the 51st state.\nIt's unlikely that both the US and Canada would agree to it through formal means - the bar is high.\nIt would need to be approved by both chambers in the US Congress, including at least 60 votes in support in the Senate, which has 100 seats.\nIt would also likely require amending the Canadian constitution, which would likely require unanimous provincial consent - no easy task - as well as Parliament's approval.\nIt's also highly unlikely that the US would invade Canada militarily.\nTrump has spoken about forcing the issue through economic pressure - with Canada sending roughly 75% of its good south of the border, he does have some leverage.\nCanada has already been hit with tariffs from the US, including the blanket tariffs on goods, though there is currently an exception for products covered by the USMCA trade deal. Those US tariffs are already being felt in some sectors.\nHowever, Trump also appears willing to come to the negotiating table. He has said he is ready to start talks with Canada's prime minister after the federal election.\nKevin in Stockport has two questions for James Lansdale, BBC News diplomatic correspondent: Not long ago President Trump said that if Russia didn't agree to take serious steps towards ending the war he would apply massive sanctions. Russia has shown no desire to reach a peace settlement. So why is Trump not going to apply these threatened sanctions before considering ending the peace initiative?\nDonald Trump is becoming increasingly frustrated at the refusal of Vladimir Putin to agree an immediate unconditional ceasefire. Recently, after his talks with President Zelensky at the Vatican, Mr Trump questioned whether Mr Putin really wanted peace and wondered if the Russian leader was leading him on. He also once again threatened \"banking\" or \"secondary\" sanctions. \nThe latter refers to sanctions on countries that are still trading with Moscow, especially those countries \u2013 like China and India \u2013 that are fuelling the Russian war machine by buying cheap Russian energy. But imposing those sanctions would be a big step with serious economic and geostrategic consequences. So for now, Mr Trump appears to want to threaten these sanctions rather than impose them.\nWhat is the hold that Putin has over Trump?\nAnalysts say that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin developed a genuinely warm personal relationship during his first term in the White House. They say Mr Trump sees in Mr Putin an equal on the world stage whom he respects. \nThe US president also made clear he wants a rapprochement between the US and Russia, one that will reset the relationship and boost trade. Strategists say the White House is also currying favour with the Kremlin because it wants to divide Moscow from Beijing, with many US policymakers seeing China as the greater threat. As to whether Mr Putin has some kind of \"hold\" over Mr Trump, there have been many allegations about the close business links the President had over the years with Russian figures who helped his investments. \nThere were also many claims of secret Kompromat about the President held in Kremlin archives. The FBI investigated. But there was always more speculation than hard fact. So Mr Trump's relationship with Mr Putin remains something of a mystery.\nRay in the UK asks: As a convicted felon, Donald Trump isn't allowed in the UK, so how can he address Parliament?\nIt is a bit more complicated than that.\nGovernment guidance \u2013 which you can read here \u2013 spells out where it is mandatory that someone is refused entry and where it is discretionary.\nIn reality, the elected leader of an ally, in particular an ally as important as the United States, is always likely to be invited, because a government is likely to conclude that this is in the UK's national interest.\nThat is the conclusion of Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 and hence the state visit being offered to President Trump.\nThe opportunity, or not, to address Parliament is a separate question and something some are arguing should be blocked.\nOne reader, Ray, asks our BBC Security correspondent Frank Gardner: Is Trump going to give Europe the time to step in, if he decides to ditch Ukraine? \nThe transatlantic alliance - the strategic partnership between Europe and North America based on shared values - is now under more strain than at any time since the Suez Crisis of 1956.\nWithin his first 100 days President Trump has completely upended the policy of the previous US administrations. For most of the time since taking office, he has appeared to favour relations with Moscow over those with Kyiv. He has also gone against the wishes of most of Europe by vowing to end Russia's isolation and talked of lifting sanctions.\nWhereas the prevailing attitude in Europe towards Ukraine is to keep supporting its war effort 'for as long as it takes', Trump has been in a hurry to end the war and normalise relations with President Putin.\nTrump's oft-repeated intent to 'get' Greenland and make it a part of the US has appalled Denmark, of which it is a self-governing part and it has rattled Scandinavian governments. Denmark lost 257 soldiers killed and wounded in the US-led campaign in Afghanistan.  It had the highest per capita death toll of all America's allies in that war.\nTrump has, however, galvanised Europe into finally doing more for its own defence.  \nAfter the US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told NATO in February that Europe should no longer take US strategic protection for granted, budgets are being revised and Germany has now lifted its longstanding restrictions on defence spending.",

        "summary": "Although the White House could argue that the President can't \"gain\" information about policy changes if he \"created\" them.So, it's still up in the air \u2013 but probably not something he needs to lose sleep over.Jean-Claude asks if there any way within the US Constitution by which Congress could stop Trump's tariffs and take away his freedom to issue Executive Orders at will.Donald Trump has been pushing the boundaries of presidential authority with both his tariff declarations and more than 130 executive orders.To do so, he has been asserting that Congress has given him the power to take these actions. So for now, Mr Trump appears to want to threaten these sanctions rather than impose them.What is the hold that Putin has over Trump?Analysts say that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin developed a genuinely warm personal relationship during his first term in the White House. Should we be worried?A lot depends on what the US president means when he talks about making Canada the 51st state.It's unlikely that both the US and Canada would agree to it through formal means - the bar is high.It would need to be approved by both chambers in the US Congress, including at least 60 votes in support in the Senate, which has 100 seats.It would also likely require amending the Canadian constitution, which would likely require unanimous provincial consent - no easy task - as well as Parliament's approval.It's also highly unlikely that the US would invade Canada militarily.Trump has spoken about forcing the issue through economic pressure - with Canada sending roughly 75% of its good south of the border, he does have some leverage.Canada has already been hit with tariffs from the US, including the blanket tariffs on goods, though there is currently an exception for products covered by the USMCA trade deal. This is, for example, largely what happened with the tariffs issue.Ultimately, however, he is the one who decides the government's course of action, even if he lets his inner circle - which is perhaps more loyal and disciplined than in the last administration - carry out the details.Arafin in Bangladesh wants to know how developing countries can navigate this evolving trade landscape and mitigate the risks.There is just no way poorer countries could ever eliminate their trade surplus with the United States.The world envisioned by Donald Trump - where citizens of developing countries buy as many American products as are sold the other way - is simply not possible.The average Bangladeshi citizen, for example, is 32 times poorer than the average American.In this case, the best Bangladeshi officials could do is promise Washington they will reduce some non-tariff barriers that are in place that make it hard for American companies to do business there.For example, they could scrap quotas on imports, cut red tape or tackle corruption more effectively.These small concessions - along with the assumption that American consumers won't put up with rocketing prices - may lead to a softening or removal of Trump's tariffs.After all, if countries with large and cheap workforces can't sell Americans affordable goods, then who will?One other thing that developing countries will want to consider closely is the role of China in all of this.If you're a worker in a clothing factory in Bangladesh, a 37% US tax might seem a crippling blow to your livelihood - but it's still better than the 125% tariff that Chinese manufacturers are facing.As a Malaysian rubber glove manufacturer told me recently: \"We're not exactly jumping with joy, but this may well benefit us\".Limiting dealings with China has been suggested as a way for developing countries to get a better trade deal with the White House. The House recently adopted a provision that would make it much harder to rescind Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, for instance.Even if Congress was able to reach agreement on curtailing presidential power, Trump could decide to exercise his veto to block it from becoming law \u2013 something he's already threated to do with the Senate tariff bill.",

        "article_text": "In Armenia tech education starts early.\nIn a typical three-storey state school in the suburbs of Yerevan, the Armenian capital, nine-year old Slavik is demonstrating his invention - a box with three LED lights.\n\"He has learned how to control it, and the programming language. You can see the code is written by him,\" says Maria, the 21-year-old tech coach leading the class.\nNext to them, 14-year-old Eric and Narek are showing their smart greenhouse model that monitors temperature and controls fans automatically through a mobile app.\nOther children are enthusiastically showcasing their inventions: games, robots, apps and smart home projects.\nEleven-year-old Arakel is holding his cardboard model of a house with a retractable clothesline.\n\"I have made my mother's work easy, one part of the device is set on the roof, and another is a motor,\" he says. \"When it rains the line goes under the roof to keep the clothes dry.\"\nThese young inventors have been attending engineering lab classes where they learn programming, robotics, coding, 3D modelling and more.\nThe programme started in 2014, and is called Armath, which translates into English as \"root\". Today there are 650 Armath labs in schools across Armenia.\nThe initiative was established by a business organisation called the Union of Advanced Technology Enterprises (UATE), which represents more than 200 high-tech Armenian companies.\n\"The vision is that we want to see Armenia becoming a tech centre powerhouse that delivers utmost values to Armenia and to the world,\" says Sarkis Karapetyan, the chief executive of UATE.\nIn his spacious, open-plan office in Yerevan he says that there are now around 4,000 tech companies in Armenia.\nArmath is part of the UATE's education and workforce development programme. Mr Karapetyan says the programme is the most successful public-private partnership in the country.\n\"We raise capital expenditure from the private sector, we go to the schools and establish Armath labs, we donate the equipment,\" he says. \"And the government, the education ministry gives us a budget of $2m (\u00a31.5m) annually to pay the salaries of the coaches.\"\nThere are now more than 600 coaches, and 17,000 active students.\n\"The goal is to have 5,000 of the most talented kids decide to become engineers every year,\" says Mr Karapetyan.\nArmenia is a landlocked country of 2.7 million people, the smallest in the South Caucasus region, and its borders with neighbouring Azerbaijan and Turkey have been shut for decades due to unresolved territorial disputes.\nUnlike its neighbours, Armenia does not have natural resources or access to the sea. But throughout the Soviet era it had been a centre of mathematics and computer science.\nIn 1956 the Yerevan Scientific Research Institute of Mathematical Machines was established in Armenia and by 1960 it had developed two first generation computers.\nToday, the country is tapping into its legacy with the ambition to transform itself into the tech powerhouse of the Caucasus.\nAnd there has been some success already. Picsart, a AI-powered photo and video editing website and app, was launched in Armenia in 2011. Today the company of the same name, which has dual headquarters in Yerevan and Miami, is valued at $1.5bn.\nKrisp, which makes audio-processing software, and Service Titan, which provides business software, are other Armenian success stories.\nMeanwhile, an annual report says that Armenia is the best country in the Caucuses region in which to launch a company, putting it in 57th place globally. This compares with Georgia in 70th position, and Azerbaijan in 80th. \nA critical factor in boosting Armenia's tech development is the nation's global diaspora \u2013 some 75% of the world's estimated Armenians, and people of Armenian descent, live elsewhere.\nThis worldwide community provides important connections, especially in the US tech industry.

We are helping them, it's like the launch of the rocket, the first couple of seconds is the hardest.\"\nSmartGate takes Armenian founders to Silicon Valley and Los Angeles for intensive networking with top US companies and investors.\nBut many Armenian start-ups first test their products in their home market.\nIrina Ghazaryan, is the founder of an app called Dr Yan that is changing how Armenians access healthcare by enabling them to more easily book appointments with doctors.\nMs Ghazaryan was previously working in product and web design when, helped by the fact she comes from a family of doctors, she identified a gap in the market. \"Patients couldn't find the right doctors, and doctors were suffering from endless calls.\"\nThe app operates on a subscription model, with doctors paying to be listed on the platform, and there are plans to expand.\n\"We are growing at least 25% revenue month by month,\" adds Ms Ghazaryan. \"We are almost break-even in Armenia and that gives us strength to start expanding to other markets, like Uzbekistan.\"\nArmenia's tech ecosystem received an unexpected boost in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Thousands of Russian IT specialists left their country, and many chose to settle in Armenia.\nMeanwhile, US chipmaking giant Nvidia moved its Russian office to Armenia.\nVasily is a Russian IT consultant who relocated to Armenia in 2023. \"Armenia was the most friendly to people from Russia in order to help them move, adapt and so on,\" he says.\nHe estimates that that the Russian IT community in Armenia now totals 5,000 to 8,000 people. This influx has said to have filled crucial skill gaps in Armenia's tech sector, in areas such as data processing, cybersecurity, and financial technologies.\nYet Vasily says that Armenia can be expensive and the country needs to reduce the tax burden on IT firms if it wants them to stay in the country.\nHowever, overall optimism remains high about Armenia's tech future.

        "article_text": "For years, conservationists have been working to bring native trees back to the spectacular Glen Rosa on the Isle of Arran.\nBut a decade of effort was wiped out in days when a wildfire ripped across the valley earlier this month.\n\"It was years of our work going up in flames,\" Kate Sampson, the National Trust for Scotland's senior ranger on Arran, told BBC Scotland News. \n\"We just have to start again.\n\"We've lost 10 years of conservation work and effort but we just have to pick ourselves up.\"\nThe blaze began on Thursday 10 April and was not fully extinguished until the following Sunday.\nBy the time the fire was out it had destroyed 27,000 trees as well as killing hundreds of reptiles.\nMuch of the Glen Rosa valley was left looking like a charred and blackened moonscape, with little sign of the years of work from the National Trust for Scotland, which is responsible for the area.\nAccording to the trust, thousands of years ago the glen would have been a native woodland but it was left bare by human intervention such as grazing sheep and deer.\nIt has been trying to restore the woodlands by introducing downy birch, sessile oak, hazel, willow, aspen and alder as well as endangered tree species such as Arran whitebeam.\nThen, two weeks ago, Ms Sampson could do nothing but watch as years of effort were destroyed.\nShe was at the scene within minutes of the blaze starting on grassland at the bottom of the valley. \n\"It was shooting up the hill really fast because of the dry conditions and the wind,\" she told BBC Scotland News. \n\"From then on in, it was disaster management.\"\nAs well as firefighters, local volunteers worked around the clock to try to keep the wildfire under control.\nMs Sampson said: \"The moorland was so tinder-dry and we had so much dead bracken and Molinia grass, so it just spread really fast across the moorland. \n\"There wasn't much we could do to stop it.\"\nIn the days after the fire, Ms Sampson and a group of naturalists surveyed the land to assess the potential impact of the wildlife.\n\"It's quite tough to see, it's not just the trees that are gone, all the wildlife in the glen has been devastated too,\" she said.  \n\"We had a group come and we monitored the glen but instead of monitoring live animals we had to record dead bodies. \n\"We had 72 dead slow worms, 25 dead adders, countless frogs and lizards, all dead as well.\"\nAs we walked through the valley, Ms Sampson discovered a live frog and long worm in among the scorched grass. \nIn the two weeks since the fire, she's only come across a handful of reptiles still alive.\n\"It's hard to know the long-term impacts but the ecology has been totally disrupted and it's going to take a long time for that to recover,\" she said.\nInitial investigations have suggested the fire could have started when dry ground was ignited when sun shone through a discarded glass bottle but the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) has not confirmed a cause.\nThe SFRS had put a wildfire warning in place covering all of Scotland a week before the Glen Rosa blaze.\nRicky Donachie, the SFRS station commander for Arran, told the BBC the blaze was classed as a \"significant wildfire\". \n\"Over the wildfire warning period, which lasted from 3 - 9 April, our control rooms received over 5,000 calls,\" he said. \n\"Over 1,000 of them were for grassland and wildfire callouts, with 19 of them in the significant category. It shows the importance of heeding any warnings.\"\nMr Donachie warned against lighting fires and barbeques in the countryside.\nDespite the devastation to the conservation work in Glen Rosa, Ms Sampson remains positive.\n\"If we can get it restarted then we might be able to make this land more resilient to fire,\" she said. \n\"If we can establish really good woodlands here, it will not only have great benefits for wildlife and biodiversity but the woodland itself can act as a firebreak.\"\nWork to replant trees in the Glen Rosa valley has already begun and a fundraising appeal to help revitalise the area has so far raised \u00a312,000.\nThis weekend, a group of almost 100 volunteers helped plant 6,000 trees.\nBeside the beauty spot of the blue pool at Glen Rosa, a shoot from one of the newly-planted trees stands out on the blackened hillside.\n\"It's an Arran whitebeam plant.\" Ms Sampson says. \n\"It's one of the rarest trees in the world and we only have them here on Arran.

Judges all the way up to the US Supreme Court have ruled that this was done in error, and that Trump's team should help \"facilitate\" his return.\nTrump had previously denied having the power to bring Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda back to his home in Maryland. Pressed by an interviewer from ABC News on Tuesday, he conceded he \"could\" change the situation if he wanted to. \nHowever, he argued that Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda had been rightfully deported.\nTrump also said that a government lawyer who had previously made the admission that Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda had been deported in error \"should not have said that\".\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was among more than 250 Venezuelans and Salvadorans deported under Trump to a mega-prison in El Salvador in March, as part of what the White House portrayed as a crackdown on foreign criminals. Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was then moved to a different facility. \nSalvadoran President Nayib Bukele has similarly said he will not send Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda back to the US.\nIn the ABC sit-down, broadcast on Tuesday, interviewer Terry Moran pointed out that Trump could change things with a simple phone call. \n\"I could,\" responded the US president, before going on to say: \"And if he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that.\"\nTrump insisted that the deportee was not \"innocent\", but instead a member of the notorious Salvadoran gang MS-13. Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda has denied this.\nIn a testy exchange, Trump also restated his claim that Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda had MS-13 tattooed on his knuckles. \nThis appeared to be a reference to an image of Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's hand that has been digitally labelled, and promoted by the White House, to try to explain the meaning of several symbols inked on the man's fingers.\nExperts who previously spoke to BBC Verify have cast doubt on the claim that these tattoos mean what Trump and his team allege. \nThe M, S, 1 and 3 appear to have been added to the image previously displayed by Trump - as they do not appear on other images of Mr Abrego Garcia's hands.\nChallenged by ABC over whether his administration was complying with the Supreme Court's order to facilitate Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's return, Trump pointed out that he had entered the US illegally in the first place.\nMr Abrego Garcia has acknowledged entering the US illegally from El Salvador in 2012, according to court documents. But he was granted an order in 2019 that prevented the US government from sending him back.\nTrump also referred to an allegation of physical abuse made against Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda by his wife. Howver, earlier this month, Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's wife said she had not followed a court process against her husband, and appealed for him to be brought home.\nThe interview marked 100 days of his second term in the White House, which was also celebrated by Trump in a major speech in Michigan on Tuesday night.\nSpeaking to ABC, Trump defended his broader stance towards immigration and stood by his plan for wide-ranging trade tariffs which have caused turbulence in the global financial markets.\nHe insisted his plan for taxes on imports of goods to the US would yield \"great times\" rather than hard times, while saying he had braced Americans for a \"transition period\".\nHe also stressed that he had faith in his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, after reports detailing Hegseth's use of group chats on the Signal app to discuss sensitive military operations. He stopped short, however, of saying it was absolute.\nAsked if he had 100% confidence in his official, he said: \"I don't have 100% confidence in anything.\" He went on to call it a \"stupid question\".",

        "article_text": "One of Prince Andrew's prized business assets was administered for two years by a company controlled by the controversial millionaire Doug Barrowman, the BBC can reveal. \nAfter the prince's disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019, legal ownership of his Dragons' Den-style start-up competition, Pitch@Palace Global, was transferred to a Barrowman-linked firm, Knox House Trustees (UK).\nBarrowman and his wife, lingerie boss Baroness Michelle Mone, hit the headlines when she admitted they had lied about their links to a company that won large government contracts during the Covid pandemic after she recommended it to ministers.\nA lawyer for Mr Barrowman said he \"at no time... had any business or personal involvement with the duke\".\nPitch@Palace Global remained the prince's company, under his control. But in line with longstanding royal practice, it was owned under the names of other people or companies, acting on his behalf as so-called \"nominees\". \nDocuments filed at Companies House show that from 2021, the nominee owner was Knox House Trustees (UK), which was controlled and ultimately owned by Mr Barrowman until 2023.\nPrince Andrew's finances have been under intense scrutiny, with questions about how he can afford to live in his Royal Lodge mansion in Windsor after he was cut off financially by his brother, King Charles.\nThe prince's choice of business associates has long been controversial. In December, he said he \"ceased all contact\" with Yang Tengbo, who led the Chinese arm of Pitch@Palace, after receiving advice from the UK government which alleged that he was a spy.\nMr Yang has denied being a spy or doing anything unlawful.\nMr Barrowman has attracted plenty of controversy too. In 2017, HMRC began an investigation into one of his companies, AML Tax (UK), which it said \"aggressively promoted\" tax avoidance schemes. It was fined \u00a3150,000 in 2022.\nIn January that year, the Guardian newspaper first reported links between Mr Barrowman, Baroness Mone and PPE Medpro. The pair denied involvement until December 2023, when she admitted in a BBC interview that they had lied about their links with the company. \nThe National Crime Agency is now investigating suspected criminal offences at the firm. Mr Barrowman and Baroness Mone both deny any wrongdoing.\nAuthor Andrew Lownie, who is writing a biography of the prince, said: \"Andrew has a long history of associating with dubious business figures and disguising his business activities behind nominee and offshore accounts.

In a court witness statement from 2023, Mr Yang wrote that the duke had needed money \"and saw the relationships with China through Pitch as one possible source of funding\".\nEarlier this year a Dutch company said it was in talks to buy it, saying it saw \"immense value\" in the network, even though it had suspended operations. \nHowever, Prince Andrew has never held the company in his own name.\nFounded in 2017, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd was initially held in the name of Amanda Thirsk, the prince's private secretary, in an arrangement often used by the Royal Family.\nBut early in 2021, the legal ownership was transferred to Knox House Trustees (UK) Limited.\nThis company had been set up the year before, and Mr Barrowman was named as having \"significant influence and control\" over it. \nCorporate filings in the Isle of Man show Knox House Trustees (UK) was ultimately owned by Knox Limited, whose sole shareholder is Mr Barrowman. \nIn 2023, ownership of Knox House Trustees (UK) Ltd \u2013 which still owned Pitch@Palace Global - was transferred to Arthur Lancaster, an accountant who has a longstanding working relationship with both the prince and Mr Barrowman.

In the past this has served to keep details of their holdings private, though not in this case.

        "article_text": "The latest in the superhero franchise \"is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun\", with a \"charismatic\" Florence Pugh at its centre, writes Nicholas Barber.\nEver since Avengers: Endgame came out in 2019, the subtitle has felt a lot more appropriate than the studio might have liked. It's not that Marvel hasn't had any hits in the 2020s, but it is no longer releasing an unbroken chain of talked-about blockbusters, nor is it keeping audiences invested in a story that threads through all of them. That particular game has come to an end.\nThe Marvel films that have worked best since Endgame are the ones that have moved furthest away from the pattern set by the so-called \"Infinity Saga\" \u2013 the first 22 instalments in the franchise, which pivoted around a fight against uber-villain Thanos. Last year's R-rated Deadpool & Wolverine used almost no characters from the main Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU); the postmodern Spider-Man: No Way Home paid tribute to the Spider-Man films which weren't made by Marvel Studios; and the latest Marvel film, Thunderbolts*, has its own distinct identity, too. That's not to suggest that it isn't a part of the MCU. In fact, one of its clever touches is that it specifically addresses how gloomy people feel in a world where Iron Man, Thor and Captain America are no longer around. But the director, Jake Shreier, and the screenwriters, Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo, have come up with an unruly take on the superhero genre which makes it the most refreshing MCU offering in years.\nThe key is that, rather than trying to be as glossy and expansive as the Infinity Saga films, Thunderbolts* is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun. It isn't the epic tale of indestructible titans saving the Universe, let alone the multiverse; it's a comedy-tinged caper about bungling secret agents who are deemed a liability by the very company that used to employ them. It's not a new scenario: after The Bourne Identity, there were countless action films in which disavowed spies dodged their erstwhile handlers. But Thunderbolts* stands out because it has a whole group of such spies: a ragtag bunch of depressive, dysfunctional loners who must work together and can't stop grumbling about it. What's especially unusual about the film, in Marvel terms, is that its premise would be viable even if the characters weren't super-powered. And, indeed, they aren't all that super-powered compared to the aforementioned Captain America and Thor. Part of their appeal is that they can be killed by bullets and trapped in rooms with locked doors, which makes them a lot easier to relate to than Norse gods.\nThere's a lesson there that the makers of such disappointments as Eternals and The Marvels should have learnt. It's not the characters' powers that count; it's their personalities. In Thunderbolts*, those characters are Yelena (Florence Pugh), a Russian assassin who was the adoptive sister of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and is now deeply miserable about all the mindless violence in her life; her adoptive father, Red Guardian (David Harbour), a washed-up slob who is nostalgic for his days as a national hero; the bionic-armed Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who was Captain America's sidekick in World War Two, and still seems uncomfortable in the 21st Century; John Walker (Wyatt Russell), an embittered super-soldier who was supposed to be the new Captain America, but wasn't up to the job; the confused, conflicted Bob (Lewis Pullman), another flawed attempt to create a Captain America substitute; and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), who is a science experiment gone wrong \u2013 but who, unlike the other characters, isn't very well defined beyond that. In various ways, they are all connected to one of Marvel's most memorably slippery villains, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a businesswoman with all the brittle, condescending confidence that you might expect from the reliably excellent star of Seinfeld and Veep.\nDe Fontaine, it seems, has been behind several superhero-related black ops. Now that her political opponents are closing in on her, she decides to destroy all the evidence of her shady undertakings, including the people who carried them out. And so it is that Yelena and the others switch from trying to kill each other to trying to keep each other alive. They become a sort-of team, but they aren't sure whether or not to call themselves the Thunderbolts, so the asterisk in the title signifies that it's just a placeholder name until they can think of something better.\nThunderbolts*\nDirector: Jake Schreier\nCast: Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, Olga Kurylenko, Lewis Pullman, Geraldine Viswanathan, Chris Bauer, Wendell Pierce, David Harbour, Hannah John-Kamen, Julia Louis-Dreyfus\nRuntime: 2hr 16min\nOne small snag is that most of the characters' back stories are in other films, and in a TV series, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, rather than in Thunderbolts* itself. Another snag is that the gang's pursuit by De Fontaine's troops accounts for the majority of the film's running time, so there aren't many set pieces that haven't been in the trailers already. On the other hand, superhero films are rarely so tightly focused, and rarely progress so seamlessly from scene to scene, with no pausing for breath, and no sudden jumps to different ends of the Earth. Captain America: Brave New World, which came out in February, was similar to Thunderbolts* in that it revolved around Washington DC politics, and followed on from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. But that film was a messy sprawl, whereas this one is so neatly plotted that you can get the gist and enjoy the ride whether you're a Marvel nerd or not.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A combat epic that 'does what film does best'\n\u2022 Disney's Snow White has a major 'identity crisis'\n\u2022 Mickey 17 is a 'disappointment' \nThe underlying issues in Thunderbolts* are just as focused as the narrative. The characters all have to deal with the shame and trauma of their troubled pasts \u2013 and this theme is there from the opening scene to the requisite Final Battle, which is slightly rushed, but stylishly surreal enough to recall two mind-bending films written by Charlie Kaufman, Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In between, the characters' guilt is explored in some touching and surprisingly brutal sequences, as well as in some sharply-scripted, briskly-edited and skilfully-performed comic scenes.\u00a0\nAt both ends of the spectrum, Pugh delivers a performance which would win her awards if it weren't in a superhero film. She delivers her punchlines with expert timing, especially when she is bickering and bantering with Red Guardian. But she can also radiate raw emotion \u2013 and all while maintaining a decent Russian accent and cartwheeling through her acrobatic fight scenes. When it comes down to it, that's why Thunderbolts* is so much better than most of Marvel's post-Endgame films. It's not just because it's a rough-edged, big-hearted spy thriller about lovably clueless anti-heroes. It's because it has an actor as charismatic as Pugh at its centre.\u00a0\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\u00a0--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Listen to Laura read this article\n\nIf you say the name Donald Trump in the halls of wholesale markets and trade fairs in China, you'll hear a faint chuckle.\nThe US president and his 145% tariffs have not instilled fear in many Chinese traders.\nInstead, they have inspired an army of online Chinese nationalists to create mocking memes in a series of viral videos and reels \u2013 some of which include an AI-generated President Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and tech mogul Elon Musk toiling on footwear and iPhone assembly lines.\nChina is not behaving like a nation facing the prospect of economic pain and President Xi Jinping has made it clear that Beijing will not back down.\n\"For more than 70 years, China has always relied on self-reliance and hard work for development\u2026 it has never relied on anyone's gifts and is unafraid of any unreasonable suppression,\" he said this month.\nHis confidence may come in part because China is far less dependent than it was 10 years ago on exports to the US. But the truth is Trump's brinkmanship and tariff hikes are pushing on pressure points that already exist within China's own struggling economy. With a housing crisis, increasing job insecurity and an ageing population, Chinese people are simply not spending as much as their government would like.\nXi came to power in 2012 with a dream of a rejuvenated China. That is now being severely tested \u2013 and not just by US tariffs. Now, the question is whether or not Trump's tariffs will dampen Xi's economic dreams, or can he turn the obstacles that exist into opportunities?\nWith a population of 1.4 billion, China has, in theory, a huge domestic market. But there's a problem. They don't appear willing to spend money while the country's economic outlook is uncertain.\nThis has not been prompted by the trade war \u2013 but by the collapse of the housing market. Many Chinese families invested their life savings in their homes, only to watch prices plummet in the last five years.\nHousing developers continued to build even as the property market crumbled. It's thought that China's entire population would not fill all the empty apartments across the country.\nThe former deputy head of China's statistics bureau, He Keng, admitted two years ago that the most \"extreme estimate\" is that there are now enough vacant homes for 3 billion people.\nTravel round Chinese provinces and you see they are littered with empty projects \u2013 lines of towering concrete shells that have been labelled \"ghost cities\". Others have been fitted out, the gardens have been landscaped, curtains frame the windows, and they appear filled with the promise of a new home. But only at night, when you see no lights, can you tell that the apartments are empty. There just aren't enough buyers to match this level of construction.\nThe government acted five years ago to restrict the amount of money developers could borrow. But the damage to house prices and, in turn, consumer confidence in China, has been done and analysts have projected a 2.5% decline in home prices this year, according to a Reuters poll in February.\nAnd it's not just house prices that worry middle-class Chinese families.\nThey are concerned about whether the government can offer them a pension \u2013 over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. According to a 2019 estimate by the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government pension fund could run out of money by 2035.\nThere are also fears about whether their sons, daughters and grandchildren can get a job as millions of college graduates are struggling to find work. More than one in five people between the ages of 16 and 24 in urban areas are jobless in China, according to official data published in August 2023. The government has not released youth unemployment figures since then.\nThe problem is that China cannot simply flip a switch and move from selling goods to the US to selling them to local buyers.\n\"Given the downward pressure on the economy, it is unlikely domestic spending can be significantly expanded in the short term,\" says Prof Nie Huihua at Renmin University.\n\"Replacing exports with internal demand will take time.\"\nAccording to Prof Zhao Minghao, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, \"China does not have high expectations for talks with the Trump administration\u2026 The real battleground is in the adjustment of China's domestic policies, such as boosting domestic demand.\"\nTo revive a slowing economy, the government has announced billions in childcare subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave. It has also introduced a $41bn programme offering discounts on items such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) to encourage more people to spend. But Prof Zhang Jun, the Dean of Economics at Fudan University, believes this is not \"sustainable\".\n\"We need a long-term mechanism,\" he says. \"We need to start increasing residents' disposable income.\"\nThis is urgent for Xi. The dream of prosperity he sold when he took power 13 years ago has not become reality.\nXi is also aware that China has a disheartened younger generation worried about their future. That could spell bigger trouble for the Communist Party: protests or unrest.\nA report by Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor claims that protests driven by financial grievances saw a steep increase in the last few months.\nAll protests are quickly subdued and censored on social media, so it is unlikely to pose a real threat to Xi for now.\n\"Only when the country does well and the nation does well can every person do well,\" Xi said in 2012.\nThis promise was made when China's economic rise looked unstoppable. It now looks uncertain.\nWhere the country has made huge strides over the past decade is in areas such as consumer electronics, batteries, EVs and artificial intelligence as part of a pivot to advanced manufacturing.\nIt has rivalled US tech dominance with the chatbot DeepSeek and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest EV maker.\nYet Trump's tariffs threaten to throw a spanner in the works.\nThe restrictions on the sale of key chips to China, including the most recent move tightening exports from US chip giant Nvidia, for instance, are aimed at curbing Xi's ambitions for tech supremacy.\nDespite that, Xi knows that Chinese manufacturers are at a decades-long advantage, so that US manufacturers are struggling to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.\nPresident Xi is also trying to use this crisis as a catalyst for further change and to find more new markets for China.\n\"In the short term, some Chinese exporters will be greatly impacted,\" says Prof Zhang. \"But Chinese companies will take the initiative to adjust the destination of exports to overcome difficulties. Exporters are waiting and looking for new customers.\"\nDonald Trump's first term in office was China's cue to look elsewhere for buyers. It has expanded its ties across South East Asia, Latin America and Africa \u2013 and a Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative shored up ties with the so-called Global South.\nChina is reaping the rewards from that diversification. More than 145 countries do more trade with China than they do with the US, according to the Lowy Institute.\nIn 2001, only 30 countries chose Beijing as their lead trade partner over Washington.\nAs Trump targets both friend and foe, some believe Xi can further upend the current US-led world order and portray his country as a stable, alternative global trade partner and leader.\nThe Chinese leader chose South East Asia for his first trip abroad after the tariff announcement, sensing his neighbours would be getting jittery about Trump's tariffs.\nAround a quarter of Chinese exports are now manufactured or shipped through a second country including Vietnam and Cambodia.\nRecent US actions may also present a chance for Xi to positively shape China's role in the world.\n\"Trump's coercive tariff policy is an opportunity for Chinese diplomacy,\" says Prof Zhang.\nChina will have to tread carefully. Some countries will be nervous that products being manufactured for the US could end up flooding into their markets.\nTrump's tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers.\nAccording to Prof Huihua, \"about 20% of China's exports go to the US - if these exports were to flood any regional market or country, it could lead to dumping and vicious competition, thereby triggering new trade frictions\".\nThere are barriers to Xi presenting himself as the arbiter of free trade in the world.\nChina has subjected other nations to trade restrictions in recent years.\nIn 2020, after the Australian government called for a global inquiry into the origins and early handling of the Covid pandemic, which Beijing argued was a political manoeuvre against them, China placed tariffs on Australian wine and barley and imposed biosecurity measures on some beef and timber and bans on coal, cotton and lobster. Some Australian exports of certain goods to China fell to nearly zero.\nAustralia's Defence Minister Richard Marles said earlier this month that his nation will not be \"holding China's hand\" as Washington escalated its trade war with Beijing.\nChina's past actions may impede Xi's current global outreach and many countries may be unwilling to choose between Beijing and Washington.\nEven with all the various difficulties, Xi is betting that Beijing will be able to withstand any economic pain longer than Washington in this great power competition.\nAnd it does appear that Trump has blinked first, last week hinting at a potential U-turn on tariffs, saying that the taxes he has so far imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".\nMeanwhile, Chinese social media is back in action.\n\"Trump has chickened out,\" was one of the top trending search topics on the Chinese social media platform Weibo after the US president softened his approach to tariffs.\nEven if or when talks do happen, China is playing a longer game.\nThe last trade war forced it to diversify its export market away from the US towards other markets \u2013 especially in the Global South.\nThis trade war has China looking in the mirror to see its own flaws \u2013 and whether it can fix them will be up to policies made in Beijing, not Washington.\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

It now looks uncertain.Getty ImagesPolitical unrest caused by financial grievances is on the rise in China, according to a new reportWhere the country has made huge strides over the past decade is in areas such as consumer electronics, batteries, EVs and artificial intelligence as part of a pivot to advanced manufacturing.It has rivalled US tech dominance with the chatbot DeepSeek and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest EV maker.Yet Trump's tariffs threaten to throw a spanner in the works.The restrictions on the sale of key chips to China, including the most recent move tightening exports from US chip giant Nvidia, for instance, are aimed at curbing Xi's ambitions for tech supremacy.Despite that, Xi knows that Chinese manufacturers are at a decades-long advantage, so that US manufacturers are struggling to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.Turning a challenge into an opportunityPresident Xi is also trying to use this crisis as a catalyst for further change and to find more new markets for China. \"Trump has chickened out,\" was one of the top trending search topics on the Chinese social media platform Weibo after the US president softened his approach to tariffs.Even if or when talks do happen, China is playing a longer game.The last trade war forced it to diversify its export market away from the US towards other markets \u2013 especially in the Global South.This trade war has China looking in the mirror to see its own flaws \u2013 and whether it can fix them will be up to policies made in Beijing, not Washington.More from InDepthTrump's chips strategy: The US will struggle to take on AsiaTrump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabblingSyrians have more freedom after Assad, but could they soon lose it?Top picture credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.",

Luna Droubi, one of his lawyers, argued that the arrest was \"in direct retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians and because of his identity as a Palestinian\".\nVermont District Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered the release of Mohsen Mahdawi from prison on bail on Wednesday, pending the court's ruling on the habeas petition challenging his detention, according to a statement by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which is part of his legal representation.\nThe judge denied a request from government lawyers to delay his release by seven days. \nIn the statement, Ms Droubi said the claims against him are \"baseless\" and a \"disgrace to the US Constitution\". She said she was \"relieved\" that Mr Mahdawi had been released, and vowed to \"keep fighting until Mohsen is free for good\". \nMr Mahdawi thanked supporters outside the courtroom, saying, \"We are pro-peace and anti-war\". \n\"To my people in Palestine: I feel your pain, I see your suffering; and I see freedom and it is very very soon.\"\nOne day before his arrest, Mr Mahdawi had told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that he believed the citizenship interview could be a setup.\n\"It's the first feeling of like, I've been waiting for this for more than a year,\" Mr Mahdawi said. \"And the other feeling is like, wait a minute.

        "article_text": "Nat Sciver-Brunt has represented England 259 times across formats\nEngland have appointed all-rounder Nat Sciver-Brunt as their new captain.\nSciver-Brunt, 32, replaces Heather Knight who spent nine years in the role.\nShe becomes just the fourth permanent England women's captain since 2000.\nKnight was sacked in March as a result of a review into the humiliating 16-0 Ashes defeat earlier in the year.\nHead coach Jon Lewis was also removed from his position and has been replaced by legendary former captain Charlotte Edwards.\n\"I'm really proud to take on the role of captain and it's an honour to have been asked by Charlotte, someone I've always looked up to,\" said Sciver-Brunt.\n\"Ever since I made my England debut back in 2013, all I have wanted to do is help the team in every way that I can. I will try my best to lead this team to success, while empowering them to be the best version of themselves.\n\"We have a really talented group, and we have a group that's united. It's a team I believe in and a team that can have a lot of success together.\"\nSciver-Brunt was the most likely candidate to take over, having been Knight's vice-captain, and is one of England's most experienced all-format cricketers.\nDuring the Ashes, she had stated her desire to fulfil the role when Knight's future remained uncertain, and has previously led England in 11 T20s and once in one-day internationals, with nine of those being wins.\nBut Sciver-Brunt's appointment also felt inevitable considering England's lack of other leadership options, having failed to implement a proper succession plan despite the considerable length of Knight's tenure.\nSpinners Charlie Dean, 24, and Sophie Ecclestone, 25, were other potential candidates but are lacking in captaincy experience.\nEngland's home summer consists of white-ball series against West Indies and India, starting in May, while Sciver-Brunt's first major assignment will be the 50-over World Cup, which takes place in India in September.\nEngland to be 'accountable' for fitness - Edwards\nWhat next for England after Lewis' sacking?\nWhile Sciver-Brunt's record when stepping in as captain is positive, two of the three defeats have come in highly pressurised situations, again highlighting England's lack of structure without Knight. \nEngland failed to win a medal at the Commonwealth Games in 2022 when Knight missed the tournament with a hip injury, and the team's fielding imploded against West Indies during the T20 World Cup in 2024, where they went out at the group stage.\nBut Sciver-Brunt could benefit from the opportunity to lead in her own style rather than simply stepping into Knight's shoes for a brief time, while the partnership with Edwards is likely to be a significant boost. \nThe pair have worked together for Mumbai Indians in the Women's Premier League, where they won the title for the second time last month. \nSciver-Brunt played a starring role as the tournament's leading run-scorer with 523 runs in 10 innings at an average of 65.37, and also took 12 wickets. \nBut there will be concerns around her workload when taking on the captaincy, as England's most important batter and one of their most experienced bowlers.\nSciver-Brunt also recently welcomed her first child, a boy named Theodore, with her wife and former England seamer Katherine. \nAnalysis by Chief cricket reporter Stephan Shemilt\nFor all the talk of Charlie Dean, Sophie Ecclestone, or even an outsider like Grace Scrivens taking on the England captaincy, it would have been a shock had anyone other than Nat Sciver-Brunt been given the job.\nThe all-rounder was the previous vice-captain, England's best player and said she wanted the job. When added to her existing relationship with head coach Charlotte Edwards, who herself said she wanted a three-format regular in charge, there was only one candidate.\nThere will be concerns about adding extra responsibility to such a vital player, but there were similar worries when Ben Stokes was made men's captain, and that has proved a masterstroke.\nPerhaps a greater worry is how well leadership will sit with Sciver-Brunt, who took a break from cricket in 2022 to focus on her mental health after standing in as captain for the Commonwealth Games.\nThis is where Edwards will come in. It seems likely that the new coach will do a lot of heavy lifting in terms of leadership, tactics and team culture, while Sciver-Brunt will set the example on the field. Their personalities should complement each other nicely.\nIf the appointment of Sciver-Brunt held little mystery, then the squad for the series against West Indies next month should provide more intrigue, especially with England due to appoint a national selector for the first time.\nEdwards, so knowledgeable when it comes to the domestic game here and abroad, will have her own ideas, while those close to the England team have privately spoken about the need for personnel change.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\nRobert Sanchez (Chelsea): He's been pretty poor all season and the general consensus is that Chelsea are going to have to change their goalkeeper, but he was very good against Everton. He made three or four decent saves and then was in a position where he could command his box much better than he has done for most of the season.\nKieran Trippier (Newcastle): He was excellent, assured, calm and quality on the ball. At the ripe old age of 34, he is still showing that it's necessary to have experience in the side. He helped Newcastle to manage the game when they went 2-0 up. He showed quality for two of the goals - standing a cross up for Dan Burn and also his corner for Newcastle's third was magnificent.\nCarlos Baleba (Brighton): Brighton will do well to keep hold of Baleba. There are so many levels to go up in his armoury - he is just frightening. He's tall and powerful and his celebration after his last-minute winner wasn't too bad either.\nDan Burn (Newcastle): Burn is the magic man of Newcastle, he just keeps on going. Every time you think his story is doing to drop off, he just keeps getting better. Burn had a real ding-dong with Liam Delap but had the Ipswich forward in his back pocket and then also scored a goal.\nRayan Ait-Nouri (Wolves): It looks to me like he is playing for a move, he looks focused and has the right mindset. His assist for the goal was fantastic but he just continually gets up and down the field. There are only a couple of games left and he still has that burning desire to have an impact.\nAlexis Mac Allister (Liverpool): He has been Liverpool's most consistent midfielder this season. It was a great finish from him, he just looked so calm. The best bit wasn't the goal but it was that he was the standard-setter throughout.\nYasin Ayari (Brighton): He was good and solid but it's all about his goal. What a hit and what a show of technical ability to use Lucas Paqueta who was running at him and just bend it round him.\nMatheus Cunha (Wolves): I'm running out of ways to praise him. He is just at home at Wolves - we know he is leaving but he just looks so comfortable in that side. Wolves know the offer is coming and he just wants to sign off on a positive. He is known as a bit of a maverick and has a wild side but at the moment he has his head screwed on.\nMohamed Salah (Liverpool): He just continues to score goals and had a very decent celebration - a selfie in front the Kop. It's at a time when you think he isn't playing at his full potential too and on a weekend when Liverpool secure the title.\nAntoine Semenyo (Bournemouth): I'm so impressesed every time I watch him. I played against him at Bristol City and didn't think he would be able to go on and do what he's doing in the Premier League, but he is going from strength to strength. Manchester United need to be looking at him - he is powerful and drives, that's what they need.\nAlexander Isak (Newcastle): He could have scored four on the day. His movement and link-up play is excellent. This guy is the complete striker in world football.\nArne Slot (Liverpool): Could it be anyone else on the weekend that he delivers Liverpool a 20th league title? He has come in and only bought Federico Chiesa and turned Liverpool into a title winning team. He's excellent as a manager, excellent in every interview and handles any adversity in the right kind of way.\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has taken action to ease the impact of new tariffs on the car making industry, which had sparked warnings about higher prices and the potential for significant hits to sales and production. \nThe change will allow companies with US factories to reduce the amount they pay in import taxes on foreign parts, using a formula tied to how many cars they sell and the price.\nThe provision is intended to provide relief to businesses for two years as they rework their supply chains, the White House said.\nOfficials also moved to shield car firms from facing mounting tariffs on the same items.\nThey said businesses that have to pay tariffs on cars and parts would not be charged other duties the administration has imposed on steel, aluminium and goods from Canada and Mexico.\nThe changes came as Trump visited Michigan on Tuesday for a rally to mark his first 100 days in office.\nThe state is home to the so-called Detroit Three carmakers - Ford, General Motors (GM) and Stellantis - and a network of more than 1,000 major suppliers to the industry.\nThose firms and the wider industry have been plunged into uncertainty since Trump announced new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts in March, saying he wanted to expand domestic car manufacturing - an industry the White House sees as key to national security. \nTrump's tariff announcement drove a spike in sales, as consumers rushed to get ahead of the tariffs. But it has also left businesses scrambling to respond. \nAhead of the latest announcement, General Motors and other carmakers said they welcomed the plans to soften the impact of the measures. \n\"We're grateful to President Trump for his support of the US automotive industry and the millions of Americans who depend on us,\" GM chief executive Mary Barra said in an emailed statement.\n\"We appreciate the productive conversations with the President and his Administration and look forward to continuing to work together.\"\nGeneral Motors, which reported its quarterly performance to investors on Tuesday, also said on Tuesday that it needed to rework its forecast for the year and pulled its prior guidance. \nIn an unusual move, it also postponed the call with analysts that had been set to discuss the results. \nTariffs on foreign-made cars - which accounted for nearly half of US sales last year - went into effect last month.\nThe duties on parts were expected to come into force on 3 May. \nUnder the modified plan, carmakers will be able to claim an \"offset\" for what they pay in tariffs on car parts, worth up to 3.75% of the suggested retail price of all the cars they assemble in the US. \nThat share would fall to 2.5% in the second year.\nThe White House said the rules were designed so that a car with 85% of its parts made in the US - or in Canada or Mexico under the terms of an existing free trade deal - would not face any tariffs, a threshold that rises to 90% in the second year. \nThe adjustment is a recognition of the global nature of the industry's current supply networks, where even cars that promote themselves as American-made often source a significant share of their parts from abroad.\nIn remarks to reporters ahead of the signing, Trump downplayed the easing, saying they applied to a \"very, very small part of the car\" and while noting he did not want to penalise companies with factories in the US.\n\"We just wanted to help them during this little transition, short-term,\" he said.  \nLast week, a coalition of US motor industry groups called on the president to not impose the measures on parts. \nA letter to his administration from groups representing companies including GM, Toyota and Volkswagen said the levies would \"lead to higher auto prices for consumers, lower sales at dealerships and will make servicing and repairing vehicles both more expensive\".\nFord said it appreciated Trump's decision, which it said would \"help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers\".\n\"We will continue to work closely with the administration in support of the president's vision for a healthy and growing auto industry in America,\" a statement added.\nThe car maker said policies that encouraged exports and ensured affordable supply chains to promote more domestic growth were \"essential\".\n\"It will be important for the major vehicle importers to match Ford's commitment to building in America,\" the company said, adding that if they did, the US would see a \"windfall of new assembly and supplier factories and hundreds of thousands of new jobs\".\nStellantis chairman John Elkann echoed the sentiments of his rival carmakers in response to the tariff reliefs. \n\"We look forward to our continued collaboration with the US administration to strengthen a competitive American auto industry and stimulate exports,\" he added.",

The counter-plan makes no mention of giving Russia power.\nIn an interview with Time magazine this week, Trump once again blamed Kyiv for starting the war, citing its ambitions of joining Nato.\nThe US president also told Time: \"Crimea will stay with Russia.\"\nOn Sunday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged Russia and Ukraine to move forward to secure a peace deal. \n\"It needs to happen soon,\" Rubio told NBC. \"We cannot continue to dedicate time and resources to this effort if it's not going to come to fruition.\"\nThe US has recently warned it would walk away from negotiations if progress was not made. \nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Moscow currently controls almost 20% of Ukrainian territory.",

Shared Perspectives (21 June-27 August).\nPerth Museum serves as the new home of the Stone of Destiny, one of Scotland's most cherished treasures, which has returned to Perthshire after more than 700 years.\nThe civic museum opened last year following a \u00a327 million development at the former Perth City Hall, by Dutch architects Mecanoo, enabling it to tell the story of Scottish history.\nThe Stone of Destiny experience uses immersive modern technology to frame the contested object within the story of the medieval boy king of Scotland, Alexander III.\nA new exhibition exploring the history and legacy of Macbeth is now underway (25 April-31 August 2025).\nThe museum has been building partnerships with 10 primary schools, helping students, teachers and communities to connect with their heritage.\nSince its opening, Perth Museum has attracted around 250,000 visitors, boosting the local economy.\nThe Art Fund is the national charity for museums and galleries.\nThe last time its main prize shortlist totally overlooked London - where many of the nation's biggest museums were historically located - was in 2021, when the award was ultimately won by Firstsite in Colchester, Essex.\nWaldman added she hoped this year's award would \"inspire\" people to visit some \"remarkable places\" in their local region and help them \"discover the powerful role they can play in our lives.\"\nWhichever one of the five museums wins will succeed last year's winner, the Young V&A in London.",

        "article_text": "Farmers in Hampshire and West Sussex have successfully restored populations of lapwings that are facing extinction.\nThey are encouraging the bird species, which is synonymous with farmland, to nest by keeping patches of fields uncultivated and protected from predators.\nBut some are concerned about the future of such projects, after the government suddenly closed the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) green funding scheme. \nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it would give details of a new and improved scheme following a spending review.\nSimon Butler, an arable farmer near Selborne in East Hampshire, said his grandad and great-grandad came to the farm in 1930.\n\"There were lapwings then and they'd have been there long before that,\" he said.\nBut lapwing numbers have fallen dramatically since the 1980s and they are now listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.\nHabitat loss and degradation due to changes in agricultural practice have reduced the availability of high-quality foraging habitat.\n\"They're a beautiful bird. It would be a travesty if we lost them.\"\nMr Butler is one of a number of farmers trying to encourage the birds back. He has fenced off three one-hectare plots in his fields, with cereals planted around them. \n\"There is a bit of extra work and hassle and cost,\" he said. \"But it's well worth it if you can get the results. \n\"I'm proud of what we've achieved. We want the best crop of wheat, best crop of barley, but as farmers we want the most lapwings too.\"\nHe receives about \u00a32,000 a year from government grants to offset the loss of crops and to maintain the habitat. \nBut he said he worried about the future of schemes like this following the government's decision to stop accepting new SFI applications last month.\n\"To take away environmental payments would be very risky and foolhardy,\" he said.\n\"Lots of farmers I know are seriously considering cutting back on environmental schemes because of funding cuts.\"\n\"We want to be planning long term.

        "article_text": "The Liberal Party has won a fourth successive term in Canada, staging an unexpected comeback in the final weeks of the campaign.\nIn his victory speech, Prime Minister Mark Carney vowed to stand up to the US, which he accused of trying to \"break\" Canada.\nCarney is a relative political newcomer, having replaced Justin Trudeau as leader of the Liberals two months ago.\nSo what happens next?\nShortly after 22:00 EDT (03:00 BST), Canada's public broadcaster CBC News projected that Mark Carney's Liberal Party was on its way to win enough seats in the House of Commons to form a government.\nIt's not yet clear if they have secured a majority and the counting of ballots is ongoing. It's likely we'll know how many seats each party has won in the coming hours. \nFederal election officials are required to count ballots by hand in front of witnesses. Ballots are tallied only after polls close in each location where the votes were cast. \nThese projections are based on initial results from Elections Canada, which runs the country's federal elections.\nOfficials double-check vote totals after the election. \nLiberal leader Mark Carney does not need to be sworn in again. Instead, he will continue doing his job, as do his Cabinet ministers.\nShould Carney decide to reshuffle his Cabinet, there will be a ceremony with the governor general, but until then, the ministers stay in their posts. \nCarney may indeed choose to shuffle his Cabinet after bringing in a leaner team when he became prime minister last month.\nWhen Parliament opens after an election, expect the swearing-in of members and the election of the Speaker. \nOne of his priorities is to navigate the relationship with US President Donald Trump.\nWhen the pair spoke in late March, Carney and Trump agreed they would begin  negotiations about a new economic and security relationship right after the election.\nWhen Parliament returns, it's possible we see the Liberals quickly introduce legislation focused on securing Canada's economy in the face of US tariff headwinds.\nThat could include a promised tax cut for middle-class Canadians, and moving ahead with a \"one project, one review\" process to speed up approval for key energy and mining proposals. \nThe Liberals have said they want to make Canada a \"clean and conventional energy\" superpower. \nThey have also committed to putting C$5bn into a trade diversification fund. \nThe Liberals may fall short of the 172 required for a majority in the House of Commons. \nThe most likely scenario if this happens is that they form a minority government with Carney as prime minister, where they strike deals with the other parties to survive no-confidence votes and pass legislation in Parliament.\nThe Conservatives are on track to once again form the Official Opposition. \nConservative leader Pierre Poilievre is on track to make significant inroads with the party's vote share, securing roughly 41% of the vote, according to Election Canada.\nThat would be the highest the party has in decades. \nThey are currently projected to have won 144 seats - that's up from 120 at dissolution, when the election was called.\nBut there are some bitter pills to swallow - Poilievre himself is projected to have lost his seat in Ontario.\nAnd with voters switching from NDP to the Liberals, those expanded Conservative numbers weren't enough to win. \nThis will be a tough loss for them, being in such a strong position only a few months ago when they had a clear path to victory.\nThey will now need to figure out a way forward after a series of electoral defeats.\nAnd it is hard to see Poilievre staying on at the helm, which would mean a fourth leader since the Liberals swept the 2015 election.",
