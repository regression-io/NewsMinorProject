        "article_text": "The new law to tackle goalkeeper time-wasting was approved by the International Football Association Board in Belfast\nFrom this summer onwards, goalkeepers will be allowed eight seconds from catching the ball to releasing it, in the latest attempt to cut down on time-wasting.\nPositive results in trials across England, Italy and Malta have prompted the games rule-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), to change the law for the start of the 2025-26 season.\nThis rule will be implemented worldwide by 1 July, at all levels of the game from elite to amateur.\nIt will also be in place for the Club World Cup, which runs from 15 June to 13 July.\nReferees will punish goalkeepers holding on to the ball for more than eight seconds by awarding a corner to the opposition. \nGoalkeepers will be warned by the referee when they have five seconds remaining to get rid of the ball. The referee will raise their arm and start a visual countdown with their hand.\nYes. Well, kind of, as it was rarely enforced. The current law states if a goalkeeper holds on to a ball for six seconds, then an indirect free-kick is awarded to the opposition. \nDuring trials, Ifab said there had only been four instances where goalkeepers have been penalised in hundreds of matches, even with the rule being strictly applied.\nIfab technical director and former Premier League referee David Elleray told The Times: \"Good law changes are where you have a very strong deterrent which everybody implements and then the problem effectively disappears.\n\"If it speeds up the game, if it's more positive, it means that it could be one of those very effective deterrents.\"\nThe Club World Cup features Manchester City and Chelsea, so Premier League fans will be able to see how Ederson, Stefan Ortega, Robert Sanchez or Filip Jorgensen cope with that countdown for the first time.\nMore corners, at least at the start of the season. Set-piece coaches will start receiving even more air-time.\nEarly casualties. We already know how strictly rules are enforced when they are first brought in - just ask Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard, who both got handed second yellow cards early this season for delaying the restart.\nThe sound of the crowd sarcastically counting down when the opposition goalkeeper picks up the ball.\nExpect players to get involved, too. If a team is trailing in the dying minutes of a game and a goalkeeper has the ball, there will be players who tell the referee to count quicker... or even count for them.\nUnfortunately, there are no Opta statistics available for this particular 'dark art' metric - but you only have to watch football semi-regularly to spot a goalkeeper catching and diving to the ground in elaborate stages.\nElleray gave an example involving Brighton stopper Jason Steele from their 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford in September 2023.\nSteele held on to the ball for an average of 14.8 seconds, compared to Andre Onana's average of 4.8 seconds.\nExploring the 'dark arts' in Man City v Arsenal\nWhat impact has longer added time had on matches?\nDoes football need a 60-minute 'stop-clock'?\nFormer England and West Ham goalkeeper Rob Green: \nBack in the day there was the six-second rule and that has slowly faded away \u2013 I don't know why \u2013 I think that was enough of a deterrent. Maybe they are thinking the punishment being a bit more lenient may get things going. It seems a strange one to reintroduce, but if we can get more football in the 90 minutes then I'm all for it.\nAs a percentage there's only around a 4% chance of scoring from a corner so it isn't that much of a threat but at the end of the game, the last thing your team-mates want to do is defend a set-piece if you're winning.\nI think we see it every year, they will implement it right from the start but in a couple of years' time we may be having this same conversation.\nFormer England and Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson:\nThese rules are being made by people that have clearly never played the game. They are giving corners? \nGoalkeepers used to have six seconds \u2013 then that went out the game so goalkeepers have started game management and timewasting. Now they are giving an extra two and it's eight.\nShamoon Hafez:\nIt feels like a rule that may be strictly enforced when first implemented, before it gets forgotten about.\nJust think back to how much injury time was being played when officials decided to clamp down on time-wasting and how much is added on now.\nIt also feels like there could be a pantomime scenario during matches, with players and the crowd counting the seconds when the keeper has ball in hand.\nBurnley striker Ashley Barnes was signalling seconds on his fingers in Saturday's FA Cup game against Preston as Freddie Woodman held on to the ball. How many other players will we see attempting to pressure the referee into enforcing the new rule?\nAlex Howell:\nIt will be interesting to see what impact the eight-second rule has on the way teams think about their build-up play.\nIt could also then have a knock-on effect on the way teams press. The trend with a lot of teams is to press high to keep the opposition under pressure, but maybe now knowing the ball has to be released in eight seconds could push sides even further forward and impact the speed of games everywhere.\nConor McNamara:\nI have quite a bit of sympathy for the referees who are going to have to implement this.\nIn essence, the law was to be a deterrent to stop excessive holding on to the ball for 20 seconds and more. But in this highly-analytical world we now live in, any new 'measurable initiatives' will be given the full 'offside by a toe-nail' treatment.\nThe conspiracy theorists will love it all.\nAlso, to implement this to the letter of the law, the poor referees will have to start shouting five-second countdowns each and every time a goalkeeper has had the ball in their hands for three seconds. \nSemi-automated offsides may divert some of the personal insults away from the officials, but implementing this new law will see the individual referees catch plenty of slack again.\nAlistair Bruce-Ball:\nOne thing's for certain - goalkeepers would be wise not to hang on to the ball against Arsenal next season given their prowess from corners.\nAnything that prevents players from time-wasting is obviously to be applauded but I can already foresee arguments about the consistency in the application of this law.\nI also wonder if it's something the referees will be very hot on in the first couple of weeks before it gets forgotten, not deliberately but subconsciously, and the time allowed starts slipping.\nNick Mashiter: \nNottingham Forest's Matz Sels will be on red alert with the new eight-second rule.\nThe goalkeeper has been booked twice for time-wasting this season, while Jose Sa at Wolves has also been known to slow the game down to his side's advantage.\nThe Premier League is already played at a frantic pace and this will only help maintain that speed, but the focus could be better served improving the video assistant referee and avoiding prolonged delays - including the eight-minute wait to rule out Milos Kerkez's goal for Bournemouth against Wolves on Saturday - which only frustrate fans and slow the game down further.\nJohn Murray:\nAn interesting move but how often we will see it implemented, I wonder?\nI suspect it is simply another tool to try and increase the amount of playing time, which the authorities have been working on for some while. \nAnd the likelihood is it will be used only very much as a last resort and more as a warning to make it clear to goalkeepers that they need to get on with it.",

        "article_text": "Sir Keir Starmer will not be \"derailed\" in working to end the war in Ukraine after the US paused military aid to the country, the deputy prime minister has said. \nAngela Rayner said the prime minister was \"laser focussed on getting peace\" and would continue \"dialogue\" with both President Donald Trump and Europe.\nShe said this was \"a very serious moment\" in the war and stressed the UK, along with its European allies, were focused on supporting Ukraine.\nThe US president made the decision to freeze US military support for Ukraine on Monday, after a meeting with members of his top team. \nThe US is by far the biggest individual donor of military aid to Ukraine, providing weapons, equipment and financial support.\nThe US has committed about $66bn (\u00a352bn) in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in 2022. The UK has committed \u00a37.8bn in military support during the same period.\nThe US decision to pause military aid came hours after Trump criticised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for saying the end of the war with Russia is \"very, very far away\".\nThe pair had an explosive spat in the Oval Office last Friday, with Trump telling Zelensky he was \"gambling with World War Three\" by refusing to consider a ceasefire without US security guarantees.\nZelensky left the White House before a proposed deal on sharing Ukrainian minerals with American companies could be signed.\nOn Monday, the White House announced it was \"reviewing\" the delivery of ammunition and other equipment to Ukraine to \"ensure that it is contributing to a solution\".\nThe order to pause all current American military aid to Ukraine takes effect immediately, and includes all US military equipment not currently in Ukraine, including weapons in transit and at depots in Poland.\nThe pause will affect more than $1bn (\u00a3790m) in arms and ammunition, including rockets, anti-tank weapons, and armoured vehicles of the kind Ukraine has relied on in its effort to repel Russian forces.\nThe pause in aid will heap more pressure on Zelensky to sign the minerals deal and agree to peace talks without the US security guarantees he has been seeking.\nRussia has tentatively welcomed the pause in US aid to Ukraine, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov calling it a \"solution which could really push the Kyiv regime to a peace process\".\nFedir Venislavsky, a member of  the Ukrainian Parliament's defence committee, said his country had a weapons stockpile that would last six months \"without consistent help from the US\".\nIn an interview with Fox News, US Vice-President JD Vance said the door was open for Ukraine to return to negotiations if Zelensky was \"willing to seriously talk peace\".\nVance also drew criticism for saying that giving the US an \"economic upside in the future of Ukraine\" through the minerals deal was a better security guarantee for the country than \"20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\". \nSo far only the UK and France have publicly committed troops towards policing any eventual peace deal in Ukraine, although Sir Keir has previously said a \"number of countries\" have agreed to commit troops.\nVance did not specify which country he was referring to, but later insisted he did not \"mention the UK or France in the clip, both of whom have fought bravely alongside the US over the last 20 years, and beyond\".\nConservative shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge had earlier accused Vance of ignoring the \"sacrifice\" of British and French troops, calling the comments \"deeply disrespectful\". \nReacting to the decision, Rayner told the BBC the Trump administration wanted Europe to step up and had been clear about its intentions to end the war in Ukraine.\nRayner said the prime minister was also \"laser-focused on getting peace\".\n\"He won't be derailed by announcements,\" Rayner told Radio 4's Today programme.\n\"He will continue that dialogue with our oldest and strongest ally, the US, and with European partners and with Ukraine.\"\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the UK and Europe must \"rearm faster\" following the US announcement.\nShe said: \"The news overnight that America is halting military aid to Ukraine is profoundly worrying.\"\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage said the pause in aid between the US and Ukraine only helped Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nHe posted: \"I hope that Keir Starmer can use his new role to bring the two together and soon.\"\nLast week, Sir Keir met Trump at the White House, as the prime minister attempted the shape the American approach to ending the war in Ukraine.\nOver the weekend, Sir Keir hosted a summit of western leaders, as they scramble to shape peace negotiations and smooth over fractured relations between Trump and Zelensky.\nThe UK and France are taking a leading role and have both committed to send soldiers to Ukraine, under one proposal.\nBut apart from increasing spending on defence, there appears to be no consensus on a plan to end the war among European leaders.\nOn Tuesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen presented a five-part plan to mobilise some \u20ac800bn (\u00a3660m) for Europe's defence and help provide \"immediate\" military support for Ukraine.\n\"This is a moment for Europe, and we are ready to step up,\" von der Leyen said.\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"We remain absolutely committed to securing a lasting peace in Ukraine and are engaging with key allies in support of this effort. \n\"It is the right thing to do, and is in our interest to do so.\" ",

The UK has committed \u00a37.8bn in military support during the same period.The US decision to pause military aid came hours after Trump criticised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for saying the end of the war with Russia is \"very, very far away\".The pair had an explosive spat in the Oval Office last Friday, with Trump telling Zelensky he was \"gambling with World War Three\" by refusing to consider a ceasefire without US security guarantees.Zelensky left the White House before a proposed deal on sharing Ukrainian minerals with American companies could be signed.On Monday, the White House announced it was \"reviewing\" the delivery of ammunition and other equipment to Ukraine to \"ensure that it is contributing to a solution\".The order to pause all current American military aid to Ukraine takes effect immediately, and includes all US military equipment not currently in Ukraine, including weapons in transit and at depots in Poland.The pause will affect more than $1bn (\u00a3790m) in arms and ammunition, including rockets, anti-tank weapons, and armoured vehicles of the kind Ukraine has relied on in its effort to repel Russian forces.The pause in aid will heap more pressure on Zelensky to sign the minerals deal and agree to peace talks without the US security guarantees he has been seeking.Russia has tentatively welcomed the pause in US aid to Ukraine, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov calling it a \"solution which could really push the Kyiv regime to a peace process\".Fedir Venislavsky, a member of  the Ukrainian Parliament's defence committee, said his country had a weapons stockpile that would last six months \"without consistent help from the US\".In an interview with Fox News, US Vice-President JD Vance said the door was open for Ukraine to return to negotiations if Zelensky was \"willing to seriously talk peace\".Vance also drew criticism for saying that giving the US an \"economic upside in the future of Ukraine\" through the minerals deal was a better security guarantee for the country than \"20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\". 'Profoundly worrying'Reacting to the decision, Rayner told the BBC the Trump administration wanted Europe to step up and had been clear about its intentions to end the war in Ukraine.Rayner said the prime minister was also \"laser-focused on getting peace\". \"Last week, Sir Keir met Trump at the White House, as the prime minister attempted the shape the American approach to ending the war in Ukraine.Over the weekend, Sir Keir hosted a summit of western leaders, as they scramble to shape peace negotiations and smooth over fractured relations between Trump and Zelensky.The UK and France are taking a leading role and have both committed to send soldiers to Ukraine, under one proposal.But apart from increasing spending on defence, there appears to be no consensus on a plan to end the war among European leaders.On Tuesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen presented a five-part plan to mobilise some \u20ac800bn (\u00a3660m) for Europe's defence and help provide \"immediate\" military support for Ukraine.",

        "article_text": "The number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.\nFigures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.\nExperts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.\nBut the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.\nA Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.\n\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"\nMost UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases. \nWith home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.\nHeat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.\nAbout half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support. \nOne of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.\nEd Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.\n\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.\nIn its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.\nMr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive. \n\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.\nHe also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.\n\nDespite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.\nBut Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.\n\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.\nMadeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.\n\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.\nThis explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.\nMs Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.\nIn a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills. \n\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said.\nAdditional reporting by Justin Rowlatt.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "The new law to tackle goalkeeper time-wasting was approved by the International Football Association Board in Belfast\nFrom this summer onwards, goalkeepers will be allowed eight seconds from catching the ball to releasing it, in the latest attempt to cut down on time-wasting.\nPositive results in trials across England, Italy and Malta have prompted the games rule-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), to change the law for the start of the 2025-26 season.\nThis rule will be implemented worldwide by 1 July, at all levels of the game from elite to amateur.\nIt will also be in place for the Club World Cup, which runs from 15 June to 13 July.\nReferees will punish goalkeepers holding on to the ball for more than eight seconds by awarding a corner to the opposition. \nGoalkeepers will be warned by the referee when they have five seconds remaining to get rid of the ball. The referee will raise their arm and start a visual countdown with their hand.\nYes. Well, kind of, as it was rarely enforced. The current law states if a goalkeeper holds on to a ball for six seconds, then an indirect free-kick is awarded to the opposition. \nDuring trials, Ifab said there had only been four instances where goalkeepers have been penalised in hundreds of matches, even with the rule being strictly applied.\nIfab technical director and former Premier League referee David Elleray told The Times: \"Good law changes are where you have a very strong deterrent which everybody implements and then the problem effectively disappears.\n\"If it speeds up the game, if it's more positive, it means that it could be one of those very effective deterrents.\"\nThe Club World Cup features Manchester City and Chelsea, so Premier League fans will be able to see how Ederson, Stefan Ortega, Robert Sanchez or Filip Jorgensen cope with that countdown for the first time.\nMore corners, at least at the start of the season. Set-piece coaches will start receiving even more air-time.\nEarly casualties. We already know how strictly rules are enforced when they are first brought in - just ask Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard, who both got handed second yellow cards early this season for delaying the restart.\nThe sound of the crowd sarcastically counting down when the opposition goalkeeper picks up the ball.\nExpect players to get involved, too. If a team is trailing in the dying minutes of a game and a goalkeeper has the ball, there will be players who tell the referee to count quicker... or even count for them.\nUnfortunately, there are no Opta statistics available for this particular 'dark art' metric - but you only have to watch football semi-regularly to spot a goalkeeper catching and diving to the ground in elaborate stages.\nElleray gave an example involving Brighton stopper Jason Steele from their 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford in September 2023.\nSteele held on to the ball for an average of 14.8 seconds, compared to Andre Onana's average of 4.8 seconds.\nExploring the 'dark arts' in Man City v Arsenal\nWhat impact has longer added time had on matches?\nDoes football need a 60-minute 'stop-clock'?\nFormer England and West Ham goalkeeper Rob Green: \nBack in the day there was the six-second rule and that has slowly faded away \u2013 I don't know why \u2013 I think that was enough of a deterrent. Maybe they are thinking the punishment being a bit more lenient may get things going. It seems a strange one to reintroduce, but if we can get more football in the 90 minutes then I'm all for it.\nAs a percentage there's only around a 4% chance of scoring from a corner so it isn't that much of a threat but at the end of the game, the last thing your team-mates want to do is defend a set-piece if you're winning.\nI think we see it every year, they will implement it right from the start but in a couple of years' time we may be having this same conversation.\nFormer England and Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson:\nThese rules are being made by people that have clearly never played the game. They are giving corners? \nGoalkeepers used to have six seconds \u2013 then that went out the game so goalkeepers have started game management and timewasting. Now they are giving an extra two and it's eight.\nShamoon Hafez:\nIt feels like a rule that may be strictly enforced when first implemented, before it gets forgotten about.\nJust think back to how much injury time was being played when officials decided to clamp down on time-wasting and how much is added on now.\nIt also feels like there could be a pantomime scenario during matches, with players and the crowd counting the seconds when the keeper has ball in hand.\nBurnley striker Ashley Barnes was signalling seconds on his fingers in Saturday's FA Cup game against Preston as Freddie Woodman held on to the ball. How many other players will we see attempting to pressure the referee into enforcing the new rule?\nAlex Howell:\nIt will be interesting to see what impact the eight-second rule has on the way teams think about their build-up play.\nIt could also then have a knock-on effect on the way teams press. The trend with a lot of teams is to press high to keep the opposition under pressure, but maybe now knowing the ball has to be released in eight seconds could push sides even further forward and impact the speed of games everywhere.\nConor McNamara:\nI have quite a bit of sympathy for the referees who are going to have to implement this.\nIn essence, the law was to be a deterrent to stop excessive holding on to the ball for 20 seconds and more. But in this highly-analytical world we now live in, any new 'measurable initiatives' will be given the full 'offside by a toe-nail' treatment.\nThe conspiracy theorists will love it all.\nAlso, to implement this to the letter of the law, the poor referees will have to start shouting five-second countdowns each and every time a goalkeeper has had the ball in their hands for three seconds. \nSemi-automated offsides may divert some of the personal insults away from the officials, but implementing this new law will see the individual referees catch plenty of slack again.\nAlistair Bruce-Ball:\nOne thing's for certain - goalkeepers would be wise not to hang on to the ball against Arsenal next season given their prowess from corners.\nAnything that prevents players from time-wasting is obviously to be applauded but I can already foresee arguments about the consistency in the application of this law.\nI also wonder if it's something the referees will be very hot on in the first couple of weeks before it gets forgotten, not deliberately but subconsciously, and the time allowed starts slipping.\nNick Mashiter: \nNottingham Forest's Matz Sels will be on red alert with the new eight-second rule.\nThe goalkeeper has been booked twice for time-wasting this season, while Jose Sa at Wolves has also been known to slow the game down to his side's advantage.\nThe Premier League is already played at a frantic pace and this will only help maintain that speed, but the focus could be better served improving the video assistant referee and avoiding prolonged delays - including the eight-minute wait to rule out Milos Kerkez's goal for Bournemouth against Wolves on Saturday - which only frustrate fans and slow the game down further.\nJohn Murray:\nAn interesting move but how often we will see it implemented, I wonder?\nI suspect it is simply another tool to try and increase the amount of playing time, which the authorities have been working on for some while. \nAnd the likelihood is it will be used only very much as a last resort and more as a warning to make it clear to goalkeepers that they need to get on with it.",

While Mr Anderson is the first UK citizen accused of fighting for Ukraine to be captured and convicted by Russia, two British captives were sentenced to death in Russia-occupied Donetsk - however, they were later released in a prisoner exchange.War in UkraineRussiaUkraine Video footage released by the Kursk court showed Mr Anderson being led into court in handcuffs wearing a winter hat and jacket that appeared to be prison uniform.Reports of Mr Anderson's capture first came to light after a video circulated online showing a man identifying himself while being captured. \"We demand that Russia respect these obligations, including those under the Geneva Conventions, and stop using prisoners of war for political and propaganda purposes. \"Under international law, prisoners of war cannot be prosecuted for participating in hostilities.",

What was that?\"\nWilliams repeated his question and McManus, from Glasgow, can be heard starting to cry.\n\"Is this a joke?\" she said. \"For goodness sake, yes!\"\n\"Let's do it,\" said Williams. \"We'll sort out what song later.\"\nThe singer is set to perform some of his most popular songs on tour including Angels and She's the One, as well as new songs from his recent biopic.\nHe has previously performed duets with the likes of Kylie Minogue, Nicole Kidman and Taylor Swift.\nBetter Man tells the story of Robbie Williams and his rise to fame - but he is portrayed by an anthropomorphic chimpanzee. \nThe film was released in December and depicts the early days of Take That as well as his struggles with drug addiction and mental health.\nMcManus told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme that she assumed Williams was going to ask her for food recommendations in Edinburgh.\n\"At no point ever in my wildest dreams did I think he was about to ask me what he did,\" she said.\n\"I cried a lot after it happened. It's the enormity of being onstage in Murrayfield in front of about 70,000 people with Robbie Williams.\n\"But it's also the magnitude of the kindness. Robbie has been so incredibly kind to me on so many different occasions even though he's such a megastar.\"\nMcManus said she got to know Williams in the early 2000s after she won Pop Idol.\n\"Robbie had just done Knebworth and he was absolutely huge with a solo career,\" she said.\n\"He was getting a lot of really horrible stuff written about him in the press. As soon as Pop Idol came along, I got a lot of that as well.\n\"It was so intense at the time about how unattractive I was, about how overweight I was. He was a huge fan of reality TV and noticed that we were both getting a lot of column inches.\"\nMcManus said Williams reached out to her after her time on Pop Idol with some advice on dealing with the negativity.\nShe added: \"I cried a lot with him at the time and it never left me because he gave me some great advice and it really helped me get through that initial period.\"\nWhen asked what she would like to sing with him, McManus said: \"That man could hand me the phone book and I'd sing it for him, I don't care because it's Robbie Williams.\n\"Obviously I want to Lulu it right up - but I don't think he'll do Relight My Fire because why would he? With the back catalogue that man's got, I'm not going to ask him to whip out a Take That number.\n\"I'll give it my best shot. He knows I'm a big belter.\"\nShe told BBC Scotland that it was especially meaningful to sing in front of a Scottish crowd with someone who has been \"really important to me throughout all of my career\".\nIn 2014, McManus was invited to sing with Rod Stewart at the Hydro in Glasgow to celebrate 50 years of the Lisbon Lions - the Celtic team that won the European Cup in Portugal in 1967.\nShe also performed alongside Susan Boyle for Pope Benedict XVI during his visit to Glasgow in 2010.\nBut she added: \"To get to this point 22 years after I won the competition, this is probably the biggest thing I've been asked to do. \n\"I'm still in shock.

Osborne, 23, has played on the wing for Leinster, but this will be his first time in the position at Test level.\nRonan Kelleher (neck) remains sidelined, so Rob Herring is set to make his first appearance of the tournament as replacement hooker with Dan Sheehan starting.\nGarry Ringrose's suspension means Bundee Aki returns to partner Robbie Henshaw in midfield, the latter switching to outside centre. \nFinlay Bealham returns at tight-head prop and Thomas Clarkson drops to the bench. Tadhg Furlong is still ruled out despite stepping up his rehabilitation from calf and hamstring injuries.\nLike Doris, Bealham and Jack Conan are set to win their 50th caps. Conan is one of six forwards named on the bench as Ireland opt to go for a 6-2 split for the first time this year.\n\"The team has worked hard again this week and the preparation has been positive for what we know will be a huge test against France,\" said Ireland interim head coach Simon Easterby.\n\"There's great respect and rivalry between the two teams and it should be a cracking contest.\"\nNtamack and Penaud return as France retain 7-1 bench\nSix Nations fixtures, standings, try-scorers & coverage\nSeven-one bench split would 'spook' Ireland - Fogarty\nAfter announcing they will retire from Test rugby at the end of the tournament, Peter O'Mahony, Cian Healy and Conor Murray will play in their final home match.\nMunster flanker O'Mahony retains his place after starting against Scotland and Wales, while Healy and Murray are named on the bench.\n\"This weekend gives the Irish public the chance to mark the final home international appearances for Peter, Cian and Conor \u2013 three stalwarts of Irish rugby who help drive the highest standards in our camp,\" added Easterby.\nHerring, Healy, Clarkson, Conan, James Ryan and Ryan Baird provide the forwards cover with Murray and Jack Crowley named as the two replacement backs.\nIt is the first time Ireland have opted for a 6-2 split on the bench since last year's loss in England - a result which ended Irish hopes of back-to-back Grand Slams.\nIreland did, however, use a 6-2 split in last year's resounding victory over France in Marseille.\nFrance, who named their team earlier on Thursday, have retained a 7-1 split on the bench having used the tactic against Italy last time out.\nIreland: Keenan; Osborne, Henshaw, Aki, Lowe; Prendergast, Gibson-Park; Porter, Sheehan, Bealham; McCarthy, Beirne; O'Mahony, Van der Flier, Doris (capt). \nReplacements: Herring, Healy, Clarkson, Ryan, Conan, Baird, Murray, Crowley.\nFrance: Ramos; Penaud, Barassi, Moefana, Bielle-Biarrey; Ntamack, Dupont (capt); Gros, Mauvaka, Atonio; Flament, Guillard; Cros, Boudehent, Alldritt.\nReplacements: Marchand, Baille, Aldegheri, Meafou, Auradou, Jegou, Jelonch, Lucu.\nThis video can not be played\nKidnapping their dads, crazy tattoos & hairy shoulders",

        "article_text": "Blue skies, picture-perfect flowers, intricately-prepared cakes and Californian sunshine streams through the windows. Oh, and another celeb turns up in the kitchen.\nIs that like your home too? Of course not. And that's the point really. The new Netflix series, With Love, Meghan is about escapism and aspiration, it's a glass of something sparkling on a grey day.\nWe see her standing in a kitchen, albeit not in her own home in Montecito, gathering fruit and herbs in the garden and chatting with friends as she makes food such as focaccia, doughnuts and Korean fried chicken.\nIt's also putting on show food products that are being launched by Meghan's new brand - so there's a lot of raspberry jam on display (on sale with \"keepsake packaging\").\nWhat you won't see are references to her former life as a working royal, her children Archie and Lilibet aren't on camera and there's only a fleeting glimpse of Prince Harry.\n\"I love feeding people, it's probably my love language,\" says Meghan, as she shows her culinary skills.\nShe makes different types of pasta, crudit\u00e9s, focaccia, frittata, baked fish. And with advice on how to make guests feel extra special, she shows how to arrange flowers and make DIY bath salts.\nThere are occasional sprinkles of references to her famous connections. We don't get to see Prince Harry until the final episode, but we hear he enjoys bacon and likes a lot of salt. \n\"Well I have a family, a husband, who no matter what meal is put in front of him before he tastes it puts salt on,\" Meghan explains. \"So I try to under salt.\"\nFriends drop in. There's the movie star Mindy Kaling, who jokes about the weight of Le Creuset saucepans. Celebrity chef Roy Choi is there. There's designer Tracy Robbins and Victoria Jackson who ran a cosmetics business.\nIt's an eight-part ode to optimism, relentlessly upbeat and feelgood, where parents, rather than clinging to glasses of Friday night white, are standing proudly behind a huge fruit platter beautifully presented in a rainbow design.\nIt's all presented in lush colours, with dramatic shots of the beautiful California coast and mountains.\nWhether you love or hate the TV series will almost certainly depend on what you think about Meghan. And there will be strong opinions on both sides.\nIt's in an entirely different genre from the previous Netflix documentary from Meghan and Prince Harry, which raked over their angry departure from royal life.\nInstead we're into a zone of gleaming smiles in polished kitchens, with a soundtrack of positive music pulsing away. \"Love is in the detail, gang,\" she says. And \"it's time to pop a bottle\" for a glass of champagne.\nMeghan dominates every moment of the 33-minute episodes of this lifestyle TV series, whether it's cooking, gardening, chatting, dancing. Or, as the series begins, beekeeping, as we see Meghan out harvesting honey, dressed in a beekeepers' outfit.\nAnd of course there's jam. That was trailed as the first product of her lifestyle brand that has been renamed As Ever. In the show a guest says \"Oh my God\" as he tries the raspberry jam, with the jam appearing through the series.\nIt's also appearing for sale as \"raspberry spread\" in the As Ever food range, which so far doesn't have prices published alongside.\nMeghan is shown picking blackberries from rows of bushes: \"This is sort of what inspired my jam and preserve making,\" with picking fruit a \"daily task\".\nThe hard work of those bees also seems to be heading for the shops, with \"Wildflower honey with honeycomb\" going on sale.\nWe see a range of teas in the show and As Ever is releasing hibiscus, peppermint and lemon ginger varieties. Shortbread cookies, a crepe mix and flower \"sprinkles\" are also part of the new range.\nMindy Kaling jokes about way the jams were first promoted, where celebrities were sent numbered jars by Meghan.\n\"When I received that in the mail, a box of your preserves it was probably one of the most glamorous moments of my life,\" said Kaling.\n\"But then I looked at the label, and it said they were something like 50. And then I of course, as a very hierarchical person, was like 'who are these other 50? Does having a lower number make me more special...\"'\nMeghan reveals she saved the number one jar for her mother, Doria Ragland as \"it felt like the right thing to do\".\nWe learn about Meghan's fashion style. She likes \"high low\" fashion, mixing up high street fashions with expensive designers.\nThere's also clarification that her name is Sussex now and not Markle, when she challenges Mindy Kaling over using her maiden name.\n\"I didn't know how meaningful it would be to me, but it just means so much to go 'this is our family name, our little family name',\" says Meghan.\nThere are occasional glimpses of another life. She mentions: \"I was a latchkey kid, so I grew up with a lot of fast food and TV tray meals.\" Even a domestic goddess had to grow up somewhere.\nShe's shown wrapping a gift and says: \"I used to teach a gift-wrapping class when I was an auditioning actress.\"\nAs a viewer, you want to pause and find out more about that. But the show rushes on. There's a toughness here. \nIn the final episode we see Prince Harry briefly, congratulating her on launching her As Ever business. And she raises a toast to this \"new chapter\" which is \"part of that creativity that I've missed so much\".\nDoes this series also mark a final departure from any prospect of a return to palace life? The whole breezy, commercial charm of the show is a world away from the royals. This feels like looking forwards to a new future, without any more haggling over the past.\nEverything that Meghan does gets intense attention. That's partly because of how she polarises opinion. People who think she's wonderful and people who can't stand her are all interested in watching more.\nThis series will inevitably get attention because of Meghan's involvement. But will there be enough for either her fans or her detractors to get their teeth into? How strongly can you feel about a cake with a few raspberries on top? Opinions will be divided.

        "article_text": "US stock markets have tumbled over concerns that President Donald Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China will lead to a wider trade war and hurt the economy.\nThe S&P 500 index, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US, fell for a second day, ending at its lowest level since November when Trump won the election.\nThe president has followed through on a threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 20% levy on China.\nThe move drew swift retaliation, including from Canada, where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned Trump his decision to target the US neighbour and close trade partner was a \"very dumb thing to do\".\nTrump fired back, writing on social media: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"\nUS Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested that Trump could be ready to do a deal with Canada and Mexico. \"I think he's going to work something out with them,\" he told Fox News.\nSaying it would not be a \"pause\", he added: \"I think he's going to figure out, 'You do more and I'll meet you in the middle some way', and we're going to probably be announcing that tomorrow.\"\nIt is not clear if Trump will announce a new deal but markets will be closely watching the president's address to Congress on Tuesday.\nGoods worth several billions of dollars cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and their economies are deeply integrated.\nStock markets in the US and globally have fallen since Trump announced on Monday that the tariffs would go ahead.\nCanada and China have already announced retaliatory import taxes on US goods. \nMexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said the country would announce a response on Sunday that would include \"tariff and non-tariff measures\".\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.5%, while the Nasdaq, where many technology companies' shares are listed, fell 0.35%. The S&P 500 closed 1.2% lower.\nAmerican retailers and carmakers were among the hardest hit, with electronics chain Best Buy's share price closing more than 13% lower.\nThe company had warned earlier on Tuesday that the tariffs would lead to higher prices for its shoppers. \n\"The giant wildcard obviously is how the consumers are going to react to the price increases in light of a lot of price increases potentially throughout the year,\" said Best Buy's chief financial officer Matt Bilunas.\nTrump said he was imposing the tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China in response to what he said was the unacceptable flow of illegal drugs and illegal immigrants into the US.\nTrudeau called that justification \"completely bogus\" and warned that Canada's retaliatory measures would hurt. \nHe said Canada would first hit $30bn worth of products, and target the remaining $125bn over 21 days.\nAny fresh duties Canada imposes will be in place \"until the US trade action is withdrawn\", he said.\n\"Canadians are reasonable and we are polite, but we will not back down from a fight, not when our country and the wellbeing of every one in it is at stake,\" he said.\nAddressing Trump directly, he added: \"Donald, you're a very smart guy. But this is a very dumb thing to do.\"\nChina also swiftly announced its own counter-measures, which include 10-15% tariffs on some US agricultural goods including wheat, corn, beef and soybeans. China is the US's biggest buyer of these goods.\n\"If the United States... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end,\" foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.\nTrump said he would respond to retaliation with a plan, due in April, for \"reciprocal\" tariffs. \nThese would be tailor-made to each country and take into account areas such as the trade balance with the US and other taxes, such as VAT.\nTrump has also threatened to impose 25% tariffs on the EU, recently claiming that the bloc had been \"formed to screw the United States\".\nEurope has pledged to hit back, but no tariffs have been implemented yet.\nTrump is hoping that imposing tariffs on the goods that the US buys will force foreign companies to invest in America, boost tax revenues and grow the economy.\nHe has argued the tariffs - which are a tax paid by the business importing the product - will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs as foreign companies switch to production in America. \nBut tariffs also tend to trigger retaliation from targeted countries, disadvantaging domestic businesses looking to export goods, meaning the measures can ultimately hold back trade.\nAnalysts have warned that tariffs could lead to economic recessions, push up prices for US households and could also have a knock-on effect on consumers across the world, including in the UK.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said that regardless of whether the UK avoids tariffs, they will have a knock-on effect.\n\"I don't think it serves anyone well,\" she said. \"And it's absolutely the case that even if tariffs aren't applied to the UK, we will be affected by slowing global trade, by a slower [economic] growth and by higher inflation than otherwise would be the case.\"\nIf inflation rises, it could affect the pace at which interest rates are cut.\nCompanies could choose to absorb the cost of the extra tax. Chipotle said that the restaurant chain would take that route - for now.\n\"It is our intent today to hold pricing constant because we don't know if the tariffs are transitory, if they're going to be permanent, or how they will impact our business in the future,\" said Laurie Schalow, Chipotle's corporate affairs chief.\nBut, like Best Buy, other US retailers warned that prices would rise. \nTarget's boss Brian Cornell said shoppers were likely to see increases over the next couple of days for foods such as avocados, bananas and strawberries.\nMexican avocados make up nearly 90% of the US market each year.\nWalmart said it would try to keep prices \"as low as possible\".\n\"In the meantime, we encourage all parties to work towards finding common ground that will protect consumers from price hikes and continue to grow our economy,\" it said.\nCarmakers are also bracing for a hit.\nFord chief executive Jim Farley warned last month the business \"could handle two weeks of tariffs\".\nHe told Bloomberg: \"We could see billions of billions of dollars of pressure on the industry, lost jobs, lots of impacts to communities.\"",

        "article_text": "A private US company says it has landed a spacecraft close to the Moon's South Pole, carrying scientific instruments including a hopping robot and the first lunar mobile communications antenna.\nBut Intuitive Machines said it had yet to confirm the \"orientation\" of the spacecraft, called Athena, and was working to confirm its condition.\nThe company is partnering with US space agency Nasa to look for evidence of water and ice on the lunar surface.\nLunar landings are very difficult, and the company will be hoping the touchdown was smooth after its first craft landed on its side last year.\nThe spacecraft Athena landed shortly after 1730GMT (1230EST).\nA picture should soon be released showing Athena about 100 miles (160km) from the South Pole in an area of the lunar highlands called Mons Mouton.\nIf the landing has been successful, the craft will have 10 days to complete scientific observations and measurements.\nThe instruments on board include a jumping robot called Micro Nova Hopper or Grace, which is designed to leap and fly across the Moon's surface to reach a large crater that is in permanent shade. \nThe hopper should be released from the main spacecraft in coming days and fly up to 100m in altitude.\nIt will travel up to 1.2 miles (2km) and after five leaps, it should land inside the crater with a camera to take the first images of the interior.\nThe crater is in permanent shadow from the Sun's rays, so it has very low temperatures and is considered an ideal place to look for ice. \nIntuitive Machines, which made the hopper, say it can travel to places that other machines, like robots with wheels, can't reach or would take a very long time to get to.\n\"These hoppers are really suited to the lunar environment because there's no atmosphere there, practically speaking, so doing a series of controlled leaps is a great way to move around,\" says Prof Simeon Barber, a lunar scientist with the Open University. \nThe IM-2 mission is also carrying three scientific instruments made by Nasa.\nA drill called Trident will churn up rocks to reach the surface under the Moon to see if there is evidence of ice.\nThen an instrument called a mass spectrometer will analyse any gases that are released.\n\nAnd a type of antenna mast developed with Nokia should also be planted on the Moon that uses the same 4G cellular technology as on Earth.\nThe mission is part of Nasa's long-term goal to take humans back to the lunar surface, as the agency hopes to send astronauts in 2027 with the Artemis programme.\n\"This is another step towards assessing the viability of the lunar South Pole as a place to go and set up future bases for humans,\" says Prof Barber.\nExperts want to explore options for building settlements and find out if there are reserves of water that could provide drinking water and potentially be turned into oxygen.\n\"A lot of planning of future exploration is being predicated on the presence of water ice, but if you want to use it, you need to know where it is and how much there is,\" says Prof Barber.\nNasa is partnering with a range of private companies that transport spacecraft and instruments to the Moon.

        "article_text": "Most of the world found itself confined to their homes in March 2020 as Covid-19 spread at a blistering pace. Some countries didn't impose any lockdown restrictions \u2013 so was their decision the right one?\nIn March 2020, billions of people stared out through their windows at a world they no longer recognised. Suddenly confined to their homes, their lives had shrunk abruptly to four walls and computer screens.\nAround the world, national leaders appeared on television, telling them to stay put \u2013 only leave the house to buy essential supplies or for once-daily exercise, maybe. It was a last-ditch attempt to curb the spread of a terrifying virus that had already killed many thousands of people worldwide.\nIn London, theatre worker Tony Beckingham and his partner decided to use their daily exercise to cycle into the centre of the city one evening. \"We thought it'd be really fun to see no-one around,\" he says. It wasn't. Places the pair knew well, like Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square, perennially abuzz with people, were chillingly quiet. \"It was really upsetting \u2013 instantly,\" says Beckingham.\nThis deletion of the public from city streets, venues and businesses first began in China, where Covid-19 emerged. Quarantine orders were soon replicated in other countries after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. At no prior point in human history have people faced restrictions like this on such a scale.\nBut a handful of countries did things differently. Sweden, Taiwan, Uruguay, Iceland and a few others never enacted a lockdown that involved severe restrictions on the movement of people, such as legally binding stay-at-home orders applied across large swathes of the population. Those countries instead chose other measures, such as restrictions on large gatherings of people, extensive testing and quarantining infected people or travel restrictions.\nFive years later, the scientific studies and data have piled up, offering a detailed, long-term assessment of whether these countries were right to reject this most drastic of public health interventions.\nThe Swedish city of Gothenburg is a haven for dog-lovers, says HR administrator and blogger Anna Mc Manus, \"We have a very dog-friendly city here,\" she says. \"We even have a dog-friendly cinema.\" As countries around the world, including Sweden's neighbours Norway, Finland and Denmark, ushered in national lockdowns in March 2020, Mc Manus was aware that her own government had decided to buck the trend.\nShe heard how dog owners in some nations couldn't even take their pets out for walks because of lockdown rules. South Africa was one such country. This struck Mc Manus as terrible. At the time, she wrote a blog post in which she said, \"I am convinced that my government is acting in a secure and correct way\". However, she also expressed concern that her fellow Swedes were not always following the official public health guidelines around social distancing, such as limiting the number of people who could meet together in a group.\nMc Manus remembers taking frequent walks in beauty spots, but also that she and her colleagues continually wore masks to help prevent Covid-19 transmission at the veterinary hospital where she worked in 2020. Plus, she and her partner avoided restaurants and meeting up with lots of other people. Even now, Mc Manus says she is not sure what to make of Sweden's official strategy.\n\"I want to base it on facts \u2013 like how many people died,\" she says. \"Could we have saved a lot more people if we had had a lockdown?\"\nScientists have tried to answer that question. Ingeborg Forthun at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and researchers in other countries including Sweden published a study in May 2024 that compared excess deaths in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland during the first years of the pandemic.\nWhile Sweden avoided strict government imposed controls, instead relying mainly on voluntary behavioural changes from is citizens, the other three nations imposed strict lockdowns in the early stages of the pandemic. Norway, Finland and Denmark closed schools and most other aspects of public life while also asking people to work from home, but they stopped short of confining people to their homes in the way other countries such as the UK did.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the researchers found a noticeable spike in excess deaths in Sweden during the initial waves of the pandemic during the spring and winter of 2020, when Covid-19 was able to spread more freely than in neighbouring nations. But while excess mortality fell in the three other countries in 2020, it rose compared to Sweden in 2021 and 2022.\n\"The four countries have a comparable number of excess deaths when you account for the fact that population sizes differ,\" says Forthun. What lockdowns did affect, in part, was the timing of when spikes in excess deaths occurred. Of Norway's approach, Forthun adds: \"We probably kept some older and vulnerable people alive for a longer period.\" Whereas authorities in Sweden were criticised in 2020 over high numbers of deaths at care homes.\nSome economists have combined similar data with comparisons of economic performance indicators between the same four Nordic countries to argue that, overall, Sweden's approach was justified due to the relatively low economic costs. But such arguments are controversial and the lack of a lockdown in Sweden remains an area for heated debate among some.\nAnother study by a group of German economists \u2013 who modelled how a lockdown could have affected pandemic outcomes in Sweden \u2013 suggests that the substantial voluntary restraints enacted by people in the country appear to have replicated some of the effects of a lockdown anyway.\nOne Swedish epidemiologist, Nele Brusselaers, of the Karolinska Institute, has criticised her country's Covid-19 strategy. She moved to Belgium during the pandemic.\n\"I'm a medical doctor so of course I care about lives,\" she says. \"We want to save every single life.\" She says many of her fellow Swedes are \"still in denial\" about Covid-19 though some have come to question the lack of lockdown in recent years.\nBrusselaers, who lived in Sweden in 2020, notes how her posts about Covid-19 on social media resulted in fierce pushback from some who disagreed with her stance on lockdown as an appropriate strategy. \"You get so much hatred,\" she says. \"That's not something I was used to.\"\nEven today, some people find it hard to move past the hostility they faced on the topic of lockdowns. One university researcher approached by the BBC for this article said they were so traumatised by the abuse they received online in 2020 that they never intended to comment on Covid-19 control measures, or lockdowns, publicly again.\nFurthermore, some people who lived in countries without lockdowns, and who disagreed with their government's approach, are still reeling from the experience. Tanzania never had any Covid-19 lockdowns. The country's former President, John Magufuli, who dismissed lockdowns and other public health interventions, died in 2021. Magufuli's approach to the pandemic was \"unscientific\", says history lecturer Fadhili Mtani at the Muslim University of Morogoro in Tanzania. \"He advocated for traditional herbs and later he rejected vaccines.\"\nBut Mtani recalls visiting hospitals where members of his own family had passed away of an illness. \"I saw people suffocating in the hospitals,\" he says. \"The hospital said we should not say it's Covid.\" Official figures suggest around 840 people have died of Covid-19 in Tanzania since the start of the pandemic. Mtani says that the government has not made accurate statistics available, however. An international collaboration aimed at estimating the global excess deaths during the first two years of the pandemic has put the total number of deaths in Tanzania at somewhere between 102,000-188,000.\nMtani argues that Tanzania should have enforced a lockdown, though without placing excessive restrictions on the movement of workers. \"The majority of people are poor. To deny movement for them is to deny their existence,\" Mtani explains.\nMany scientists emphasise that lockdowns were crucial for saving lives in the early part of the pandemic, before vaccines were available, and also for limiting the pressure on health services. By March 2020, this pressure was already severe in the UK, says Adam Kucharski, professor of infectious disease epidemiology, at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. \"The NHS was overwhelmed,\" Kucharski explains, referring to the emotional testimony of doctors who have spoken to the UK's public inquiry into the government\u2019s Covid-19 response. \"It's ridiculous to suggest [the NHS] wasn't under effectively breaking pressure by that point,\" adds Kucharski.\nKucharski also says that, because of the UK's global connections and the large number of young people who live together or with their parents compared to Sweden, for example, it might have been much harder for the UK to control Covid-19 transmission without imposing a lockdown.\nHe also points to a 2021 study that attempted to quantify the effect of specific government interventions on the spread of Covid-19, using data from 41 countries. It reveals that certain aspects of national lockdowns might have been more impactful than others. The researchers found, for example, that banning gatherings of more than 10 people or closing schools and universities was especially effective, reducing transmission by more than 35% on average. Shutting restaurants and bars seemed to make slightly less difference to transmission, however.\nWhat's more, the researchers suggest that adding a strict stay-at-home order on top of such measures \"only had a small additional effect\" in terms of slowing down Covid-19 \u2013 estimated at below 17.5% on average.\nCountries that chose not to lock down severely may also have had more time to prepare for the arrival of Covid-19, or social and structural reasons as to why the Sars-CoV-2 virus was less likely to spread quickly there versus other nations. Even then, there are surprising comparisons to be made. Take Iceland and New Zealand, for instance. Both are wealthy island nations with relatively small populations but while New Zealand introduced a strict lockdown on 25 March 2020, Iceland never did.\n\"They [Iceland] had more of a mitigation strategy,\" says Leah Grout, a research data analyst specialising in public health at the Southern California University of Health Sciences. Grout was lead author on a research paper about the contrasting Covid-19 strategies and outcomes of these two countries. Iceland introduced a test and trace programme, in which infections and contacts between people were monitored so that individuals \u2013 rather than entire populations \u2013 were asked to observe quarantine for a time. This measure was also used in many countries that also applied lockdowns, when those lockdowns were lifted. Iceland had some restrictions on social gatherings and it did close its borders to some travellers, briefly.\n\"New Zealand had one of the lowest mortality rates globally with their approach,\" says Grout. \"Iceland also fared pretty well.\" Plus, the economic impacts on both countries were limited, she adds. Other researchers have made similar findings regarding New Zealand and Iceland.\nMore like this:\nMuch was written in 2020 about various countries' efforts to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. But, in retrospect, that seems much too early to come to any real conclusions. Uruguay was lauded at the time for apparently managing to keep Covid-19 at bay, despite never enacting a strict lockdown. The country's government enforced some forms of social distancing, including the closure of some gyms, and Uruguay's borders were also closed to certain travellers, for instance. But ports remained open and there was no stay-at-home order affecting the entire population.\nA study published in 2024 found that, while excess deaths were low in Uruguay during 2020, they actually rose substantially in 2021 and 2022. Excess deaths in 2021, for example, were nearly 19% above the expected figure, based on historical trends. The study's authors put this down mostly to the spread of Covid-19 but add that impacts from the pandemic on the ability to provide healthcare in other ways probably also played a role.\nSimilarly, Japan was able to keep mortality from Covid-19 to a relatively low level in the early part of the pandemic. By the summer of 2022, Covid-19 deaths had reached 36,200. Today, they stand at 130,000.\nSo, what happened in the interim? The Omicron variant. New, mutated forms of the early Sars-CoV-2 virus that spread worldwide in 2022 and 2023.\nSome researchers argue that Japan\u2019s approach proved to be the right one overall. \"Even without lockdown, suppression of epidemic curves has been largely successful,\" argues Hiroshi Nishiura, a professor in the graduate school of medicine at Kyoto University.\nHowever, as in other countries where legally binding lockdowns did not come into force, there is evidence that people in Japan changed their behaviour significantly anyway. One study of people's movements based on mobile phone data suggests that, when the Japanese government declared a nationwide state of emergency in April 2020, people in Tokyo reduced their outings from home roughly as much as people in the US who, conversely, faced legally binding lockdowns.\nDespite this, Yasuharu Tokuda, a clinical epidemiologist and director of the Muribushi Okinawa Center for Teaching Hospitals in Okinawa, Japan, argues that a tougher approach might have been beneficial. \"Some patients could not be admitted to the hospital because of the lack of available beds,\" he says. \"If we have a strong viral pandemic, then we need to have a stricter lockdown in Japan.\" Research suggests that there might be resistance to such an idea among members of the public in Japan, however.\nIt is important to reflect on just how drastic a measure lockdown really is. Kucharski, for one, calls it a \"blunt\" tool. \"We should never have got to that point where we were in so much trouble, with so little visibility of what the pandemic was doing,\" he says. It was due to a lack of certainty over what would happen next, and a dearth of other interventions on the table, that the UK was more or less forced into lockdown, he suggests.\nMany have still not got over the effects of lockdown. In March 2020, Bill Allison, a former civil servant in Scotland, was in his mid-60s. He had many plans for his retirement \u2013 he wanted to see the world. Back then, Allison was also an avid pub-goer who frequently met up with his friends for a pint. Lockdown stopped him in his tracks. He says he followed the rules at all times but this left him feeling a profound sense of loneliness and isolation.\n\"I gathered up all the scraps of wood that I had and decided to see if I could make them into an electric guitar,\" he says. \"I would work late at night. There was nothing else to do, really.\" He found a guitar-making group online, through which he met people with similar interests. \"I made quite a lot of new friends.\"\nBut when the world gradually began to open up again, Allison was struck by a strong sense of what he had been missing and was hard to regain.\n\"The pub near me, it's nothing like as busy as it was before Covid,\" he says. \"I became quite introverted and now I find I don't want to interact with people as much as I did before. I was discussing it with a few of my friends. [\u2026] We all feel very unhappy.\"\nSoon to turn 72, Allison says his pre-pandemic travel plans remain on hold. \"I'm kind of getting to the age where I don't really want to do a nine-hour flight to the other side of the world anymore. It's kind of knocked me back.\"\nCountless studies show that social isolation and loneliness affected thousands of people during the pandemic, and that this was a particularly acute problem during national lockdowns. There were negative impacts on single parents, also, who found it harder to earn an income while looking after their children. There were also concerns that the sudden loss of social interaction and access to education effected the development of young children, with some evidence pointing to an impact on their language skills. More than one billion children and students found themselves shut off from their usual methods of learning. Recently published research using data from 72 countries suggests that the closure of schools during the pandemic may have led to a decline in mathematics scores by an average of 14% \u2013 equivalent to seven months of learning.\nIn countries including the UK, lockdown was associated with a rise in domestic abuse. And, what's more, lockdowns had a huge impact on access to healthcare. Many people found their cancer screenings and treatments were cancelled or delayed, for example.\nAs for potential benefits of lockdowns not related to Covid-19 transmission, much was made of temporary reductions in air pollution and carbon emissions as a result of the restrictions imposed during the early stages of the pandemic. These turned out to be a temporary blip as greenhouse gas emissions resurged and air quality dipped once people emerged from their confinement.\nAuthorities in some countries that attempted to enforce strict lockdowns and a \"zero Covid\" policy were greeted with violent protests from members of the public. Some widely publicised cases of this emerged in China during 2022.\nThere is no getting away from the fact that a sweeping stay-at-home order is an extreme intervention, and one that comes with heaps of negative consequences. Governments in 2020 had to weigh up whether they could successfully enforce such a measure, and whether it was really worth it.\nUnless, of course, they had an alternative. The government in Taiwan, for example, never imposed a lockdown and instead relied on near-universal mask-wearing, border restrictions and intensive contact tracing, which involved access to lots of personal data. This included commuters' smart card information and mobile phone location data. Some of this monitoring was exhaustive.\n\"[Taiwan Centers for Disease Control] also set up a smartphone-based real-time locating system to track contacts' phone signals and alert local authorities if anyone left their designated location or switched off their phone. Authorities would contact or visit those who triggered an alert within 15 minutes in person,\" one paper notes.\nEssentially, Taiwan (and later South Korea, which to some extent mirrored Taiwan's approach) avoided lockdown through fine-grained monitoring and control of an entire population. Even in Taiwan, however, Covid-19 outbreaks caused problems. Initially, in the first half of 2021 and then again in 2022, cases surged as some preventative measures in the country, and the population itself, started to relax. Researchers note, though, that Covid-19 deaths became less common over time, as Taiwan's health authorities rolled out vaccines to the population.\nWhile these case studies of various countries show that it was clearly possible to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic without resorting to national lockdowns, the end results seem to depend on the attributes of specific countries, their populations, and their healthcare systems. Ultimately, the vast majority of nations did enact lockdowns at some point during 2020 or 2021 and it would be hard to suggest that they are all significantly worse off because of that intervention, specifically.\nStill, five years later, the harshness of lockdowns and their effects on millions if not billions of people has become clearer. Even some researchers who have found evidence that lockdowns saved lives have cautioned against turning to this measure in haste in the future. The longer-term effects on children, education and economies are still playing out and will likely not be fully understood for many years to come.\nWhatever governments decide to do, having a plan that they communicate in advance of any new pandemic will likely improve public acceptance of and adherence to any strict mitigations, says Grout. \"It needs to be super clear.\" That means everyone could know ahead of time what circumstances would trigger a lockdown.\nIn Gothenburg, Mc Manus remembers the debates she once had with her fellow Swedes over whether her country was doing the right thing in 2020. And how some people seemed cavalier or uninterested in observing social distancing guidelines at the time.\n\"You don't even talk about it anymore,\" she says, \"Thinking back, I feel like, as a society, did we really learn anything from this?\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "summary": "Those countries instead chose other measures, such as restrictions on large gatherings of people, extensive testing and quarantining infected people or travel restrictions.Five years later, the scientific studies and data have piled up, offering a detailed, long-term assessment of whether these countries were right to reject this most drastic of public health interventions.AlamyFor billions of people around the world, the lockdown measures imposed during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic were intensely lonely (Credit: Alamy)The Swedish city of Gothenburg is a haven for dog-lovers, says HR administrator and blogger Anna Mc Manus, \"We have a very dog-friendly city here,\" she says. Norway, Finland and Denmark closed schools and most other aspects of public life while also asking people to work from home, but they stopped short of confining people to their homes in the way other countries such as the UK did.We probably kept some older and vulnerable people alive for a longer period \u2013 Ingeborg ForthunPerhaps unsurprisingly, the researchers found a noticeable spike in excess deaths in Sweden during the initial waves of the pandemic during the spring and winter of 2020, when Covid-19 was able to spread more freely than in neighbouring nations. As countries around the world, including Sweden's neighbours Norway, Finland and Denmark, ushered in national lockdowns in March 2020, Mc Manus was aware that her own government had decided to buck the trend.She heard how dog owners in some nations couldn't even take their pets out for walks because of lockdown rules. \"It's ridiculous to suggest [the NHS] wasn't under effectively breaking pressure by that point,\" adds Kucharski.Kucharski also says that, because of the UK's global connections and the large number of young people who live together or with their parents compared to Sweden, for example, it might have been much harder for the UK to control Covid-19 transmission without imposing a lockdown.He also points to a 2021 study that attempted to quantify the effect of specific government interventions on the spread of Covid-19, using data from 41 countries. Ingeborg Forthun at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and researchers in other countries including Sweden published a study in May 2024 that compared excess deaths in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland during the first years of the pandemic.While Sweden avoided strict government imposed controls, instead relying mainly on voluntary behavioural changes from is citizens, the other three nations imposed strict lockdowns in the early stages of the pandemic.",

        "article_text": "Scottish painter Jack Vettriano, best known for his painting The Singing Butler, has died at the age of 73.\nHis publicist said the artist was found dead at his apartment in Nice, in the south of France, on Saturday.\nIt is understood there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.\nVettriano was a self-taught artist whose most famous work became the UK's best-selling art print and set a Scottish record when it was auctioned in 2004.\nHe was born Jack Hoggan on 17 November 1951 in Methil, Fife, and left school at 15 to become a mining engineer. He later moved into personnel management.\nFor his 21st birthday, he was given a set of watercolour paints and then spent much of his spare time teaching himself to paint.\nHe drew inspiration from works at Kirkcaldy Galleries, studying paintings from artists such as Samuel Peploe and William McTaggart so intently that he feared arousing the suspicions of gallery staff.\nHis breakthrough came in 1989 when he submitted two paintings to the Royal Scottish Academy's annual show and both sold on the first day, inspiring him to become a full-time artist.\nHis works garnered international acclaim, leading to exhibitions in cities including London, Hong Kong, Johannesburg and New York.\nVettriano was often dismissed by critics, who variously described his work as \"brainless erotica\", \"mere wallpaper\" and \"crass male fantasy\".\nBut in an interview with the Radio Times, he responded: \"They don't like an artist who is as popular as me because it takes away part of their authority. If they want to ignore me, let them.\n\"I have what I want and that is the support of the public.\n\"That means far more to me than the approval of a bunch of well-educated art buffs.\"\nHe was appointed an OBE for services to visual arts in 2003.\nHis best-known work, The Singing Butler, depicts an elegant couple dancing on a storm-swept beach accompanied by their butler and maid.\nIt sold at auction in 2004 for \u00a3744,800 - a Scottish record at the time - and reproductions of the painting were the best-selling art print in the UK.\nIt was reimagined by Banksy for Crude Oil (Vettriano) - a painting now owned by Blink-182 star Mark Hoppus and expected to fetch between \u00a33m and \u00a35m at auction in London on Tuesday.\nDespite being shunned by galleries earlier in his career, Vettriano's self-portrait The Weight went on long-term display in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery when it reopened after a renovation in 2011.\nThe first major retrospective of his work was held in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow in 2013.\nIt attracted more than 136,000 visitors during its five-month run and was said at the time to be the most successful commercial exhibition ever staged in Glasgow.\nA further retrospective was held at Kirkcaldy Galleries in 2022, focusing on his formative years and early career.\nVettriano created a portrait for one of three giant murals of Billy Connolly installed in Glasgow in 2017 as part of a BBC programme marking the comedian's 75th birthday.\nAmong those who acquired Vettriano paintings were Jack Nicholson, Sir Alex Ferguson, Sir Tim Rice and Robbie Coltrane.\nHe has spoken publicly about his struggles with his mental health and his dependence on alcohol and drugs.\nVettriano's publicist said that his passing \"marks the end of an era for contemporary Scottish art.\n\"His evocative and timeless works will continue to captivate and inspire future generations.\"\nFirst Minister John Swinney paid tribute to the artist and offered his condolences to his family.\n\"I am very sorry to hear the news that Jack Vettriano has died,\" he wrote in a post on X. \n\"He made a unique and evocative contribution to artistic life in Scotland in such compelling style.\"\nThere are few artists who have such instant recognition outside the world of art or who are loved and loathed in equal measures.\nFrom the moment Jack Hoggan invented Jack Vettriano, submitted two paintings to the Royal Scottish Academy and sold both in a day, he set in motion the commercial pull and establishment disdain which would follow him throughout his career.\nThe commercial success and record prices only further antagonised the critics who dismissed his work as \"colouring in\".\nThe first major retrospective of his work in Kelvingrove Art Gallery in 2013 had not just a separate room with a warning for his more explicit paintings but a gift shop which did a roaring trade in spin-off merchandise.\nWould he have traded some of that success for a fairer review of his work?\nI think he would.\nWhen I first met him 25 years ago, he was keen to dismiss any criticism as art establishment snobbery. What ordinary people thought of his work was all that mattered.\nEach time I met him, more and more people had made that clear by attending his exhibitions in their thousands or buying prints and postcards.\nThe last time \u2013 on home turf at Kirkcaldy Art Galleries where he'd once studied the colourists \u2013 was especially emotional.\n\"I'm not just happy, I'm proud,\" he told me, \"to have done that without any tuition and be back here where it all started.\"\nSelf-made, self-starting, Jack Vettriano gave a large section of the public what they wanted and the world is a little less colourful for his passing.",

And for us, if we choose to stay, we need to pay \u00a33,000 to the UK government. Can you see the difference?\"\n\"The one thing stopping more students coming here is recent changes in the visa,\" says Mohammed Abdullah Sayyed, 21, from India. \nStudent visa restrictions took effect in January 2024, meaning postgraduates lost the right to bring dependant family members to the UK and new students were prevented from switching to a work visa before the end of their courses.\nThere was an 85% drop in the number of sponsored study visas for dependants, from 143,276 in 2023 to 21,978 in 2024.\nMohammed says another factor is international students pay more than UK ones.\nCoventry University says tuition fees can vary depending on the course - but as of September 2024, most courses cost approximately \u00a316,800 \u2013 \u00a320,050 per year for international students. \nThat's compared to \u00a39,250 for domestic students, which will rise to \u00a39,535 in September.\nCoventry University says Brexit has had \"a profound impact\" on UK universities' ability to attract EU students. \nThe House of Commons Library states the number of EU students fell sharply after changes to visa requirements and funding rules in 2021-22. \nSince August 2021, new students from the EU generally have had to pay international fees and do not qualify for tuition fee loans.\nLaura Alonso is studying international relations at Coventry University. \nThe 21-year-old from Spain says: \"There's a lot of international people and international students, especially in Coventry, so you always feel welcome\".\nBut she believes the UK's withdrawal from the Erasmus+ programme put lots of Spanish students off studying there. \nThe Turing Scheme, which replaced it, funds UK participants to study or work abroad - but does not fund international students coming to the UK. \nWhilst the number of international visas has fallen by almost a third, the number of international students applying to study in the UK via The University and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) has increased.\nUCAS saw a 2.7% rise in international undergraduate applicants between 2024 and 2025\nHowever this does not represent the full picture, as UCAS figures do not account for students applying directly through colleges and universities, or postgraduate courses.\nThe overall fall in international students is impacting Coventry University's finances. It recently put hundreds of staff at risk of redundancy.\nSo it is little surprise the change is also being felt in the city's wider economy.\nCoventry University's analysis of Higher Education Policy Institute and Kaplan International's figures suggests international students generate about \u00a3651m a year for the city's economy.\nOne sign of a drop in overseas students is that several purpose-built student accommodation blocks are the subject of change-of-use planning proposals to convert them for residential use.\nThe volume of student accommodation being approved has attracted debate, with some residents objecting to planning applications. \nEstate agents report landlords selling up due to falling international student numbers.\n\nCoventry University says it is proud to widen accessibility to education: \"It would be odd to constrain our mission and values within national borders.\n\"Our long-term strategy of diversifying income to help counter the fact UK tuition fees have been frozen for several years has been successful and remains the right thing to do.\n\"The sustained growth in student numbers over a number of years allowed us to create many jobs and increased economic and social benefits. We are now having to rebalance the organisation based on changes outside of our control.\"\nThe government says its Immigration White Paper will set out \"a comprehensive plan to restore order to our broken immigration system, linking immigration, skills and visa systems to grow our domestic workforce, end reliance on overseas labour and boost economic growth.\"\nVivienne Stern, CEO of Universities UK, says funding issues mean universities are reducing students' options - and the drop in international students is hurting communities.\n\"There are people in all sorts of walks of life who benefit from the fact that universities bring students in who spend money in shops and cafes - local businesses, getting their hair cut, taking taxis. \n\"It really contributes to economies right across the UK, and I think that's really special.\"\nAdditional reporting by Jonathan Fagg and Miguel Roca-Terry.",

        "article_text": "The new law to tackle goalkeeper time-wasting was approved by the International Football Association Board in Belfast\nFrom this summer onwards, goalkeepers will be allowed eight seconds from catching the ball to releasing it, in the latest attempt to cut down on time-wasting.\nPositive results in trials across England, Italy and Malta have prompted the games rule-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), to change the law for the start of the 2025-26 season.\nThis rule will be implemented worldwide by 1 July, at all levels of the game from elite to amateur.\nIt will also be in place for the Club World Cup, which runs from 15 June to 13 July.\nReferees will punish goalkeepers holding on to the ball for more than eight seconds by awarding a corner to the opposition. \nGoalkeepers will be warned by the referee when they have five seconds remaining to get rid of the ball. The referee will raise their arm and start a visual countdown with their hand.\nYes. Well, kind of, as it was rarely enforced. The current law states if a goalkeeper holds on to a ball for six seconds, then an indirect free-kick is awarded to the opposition. \nDuring trials, Ifab said there had only been four instances where goalkeepers have been penalised in hundreds of matches, even with the rule being strictly applied.\nIfab technical director and former Premier League referee David Elleray told The Times: \"Good law changes are where you have a very strong deterrent which everybody implements and then the problem effectively disappears.\n\"If it speeds up the game, if it's more positive, it means that it could be one of those very effective deterrents.\"\nThe Club World Cup features Manchester City and Chelsea, so Premier League fans will be able to see how Ederson, Stefan Ortega, Robert Sanchez or Filip Jorgensen cope with that countdown for the first time.\nMore corners, at least at the start of the season. Set-piece coaches will start receiving even more air-time.\nEarly casualties. We already know how strictly rules are enforced when they are first brought in - just ask Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard, who both got handed second yellow cards early this season for delaying the restart.\nThe sound of the crowd sarcastically counting down when the opposition goalkeeper picks up the ball.\nExpect players to get involved, too. If a team is trailing in the dying minutes of a game and a goalkeeper has the ball, there will be players who tell the referee to count quicker... or even count for them.\nUnfortunately, there are no Opta statistics available for this particular 'dark art' metric - but you only have to watch football semi-regularly to spot a goalkeeper catching and diving to the ground in elaborate stages.\nElleray gave an example involving Brighton stopper Jason Steele from their 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford in September 2023.\nSteele held on to the ball for an average of 14.8 seconds, compared to Andre Onana's average of 4.8 seconds.\nExploring the 'dark arts' in Man City v Arsenal\nWhat impact has longer added time had on matches?\nDoes football need a 60-minute 'stop-clock'?\nFormer England and West Ham goalkeeper Rob Green: \nBack in the day there was the six-second rule and that has slowly faded away \u2013 I don't know why \u2013 I think that was enough of a deterrent. Maybe they are thinking the punishment being a bit more lenient may get things going. It seems a strange one to reintroduce, but if we can get more football in the 90 minutes then I'm all for it.\nAs a percentage there's only around a 4% chance of scoring from a corner so it isn't that much of a threat but at the end of the game, the last thing your team-mates want to do is defend a set-piece if you're winning.\nI think we see it every year, they will implement it right from the start but in a couple of years' time we may be having this same conversation.\nFormer England and Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson:\nThese rules are being made by people that have clearly never played the game. They are giving corners? \nGoalkeepers used to have six seconds \u2013 then that went out the game so goalkeepers have started game management and timewasting. Now they are giving an extra two and it's eight.\nShamoon Hafez:\nIt feels like a rule that may be strictly enforced when first implemented, before it gets forgotten about.\nJust think back to how much injury time was being played when officials decided to clamp down on time-wasting and how much is added on now.\nIt also feels like there could be a pantomime scenario during matches, with players and the crowd counting the seconds when the keeper has ball in hand.\nBurnley striker Ashley Barnes was signalling seconds on his fingers in Saturday's FA Cup game against Preston as Freddie Woodman held on to the ball. How many other players will we see attempting to pressure the referee into enforcing the new rule?\nAlex Howell:\nIt will be interesting to see what impact the eight-second rule has on the way teams think about their build-up play.\nIt could also then have a knock-on effect on the way teams press. The trend with a lot of teams is to press high to keep the opposition under pressure, but maybe now knowing the ball has to be released in eight seconds could push sides even further forward and impact the speed of games everywhere.\nConor McNamara:\nI have quite a bit of sympathy for the referees who are going to have to implement this.\nIn essence, the law was to be a deterrent to stop excessive holding on to the ball for 20 seconds and more. But in this highly-analytical world we now live in, any new 'measurable initiatives' will be given the full 'offside by a toe-nail' treatment.\nThe conspiracy theorists will love it all.\nAlso, to implement this to the letter of the law, the poor referees will have to start shouting five-second countdowns each and every time a goalkeeper has had the ball in their hands for three seconds. \nSemi-automated offsides may divert some of the personal insults away from the officials, but implementing this new law will see the individual referees catch plenty of slack again.\nAlistair Bruce-Ball:\nOne thing's for certain - goalkeepers would be wise not to hang on to the ball against Arsenal next season given their prowess from corners.\nAnything that prevents players from time-wasting is obviously to be applauded but I can already foresee arguments about the consistency in the application of this law.\nI also wonder if it's something the referees will be very hot on in the first couple of weeks before it gets forgotten, not deliberately but subconsciously, and the time allowed starts slipping.\nNick Mashiter: \nNottingham Forest's Matz Sels will be on red alert with the new eight-second rule.\nThe goalkeeper has been booked twice for time-wasting this season, while Jose Sa at Wolves has also been known to slow the game down to his side's advantage.\nThe Premier League is already played at a frantic pace and this will only help maintain that speed, but the focus could be better served improving the video assistant referee and avoiding prolonged delays - including the eight-minute wait to rule out Milos Kerkez's goal for Bournemouth against Wolves on Saturday - which only frustrate fans and slow the game down further.\nJohn Murray:\nAn interesting move but how often we will see it implemented, I wonder?\nI suspect it is simply another tool to try and increase the amount of playing time, which the authorities have been working on for some while. \nAnd the likelihood is it will be used only very much as a last resort and more as a warning to make it clear to goalkeepers that they need to get on with it.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has hit China with a second tariff in as many months, which means imports from there now face a levy of at least 20%.\nThis is his latest salvo against Beijing, which already faces steep US tariffs, from 100% on Chinese-made electric vehicles to 15% on clothes and shoes. \nTrump's tariffs strike at the heart of China's manufacturing juggernaut - a web of factories, assembly lines and supply chains that manufacture and ship just about everything, from fast fashion and toys to solar panels and electric cars.\nChina's trade surplus with the world rose to a record $1tn (\u00a3788bn) in 2024, on the back of strong exports ($3.5tn), which surpassed its import bill ($2.5tn).\nIt has long been the world's factory - it has thrived because of cheap labour and state investment in infrastructure ever since it opened its economy to global business in the late 1970s. \nSo how badly could Trump's trade war hurt China's manufacturing success?\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.\nMost tariffs are set as a percentage of the value of the goods, and it's generally the importer who pays them.\nSo, a 10% tariff means a product imported to the US from China worth $4 would face an additional $0.40 charge applied to it.\nIncreasing the price of imported goods is meant to encourage consumers to buy cheaper domestic products instead, thus helping to boost their own economy's growth.\nTrump sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue. But economic studies of the impact of tariffs which Trump imposed during his first term in office, suggest the measures ultimately raised prices for US consumers.\nTrump has said his most recent tariffs are aimed at pressuring China to do more to stop the flow of the opioid fentanyl to the US. \nHe also imposed 25% tariffs on America's neighbours Mexico and Canada, saying its leaders were not doing enough to crack down on the cross-border illegal drug trade.\nYes, analysts say. \nExports have been the \"saving grace\" of China's economy and if the taxes linger,  exports to the US could drop by a quarter to a third, Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist at Moody's analytics, told the BBC. \nThe sheer value of China's exports - which account for a fifth of the country's earnings - means that a 20% tariff could weaken demand from overseas and shrink the trade surplus. \n\"The tariffs will hurt China,\" Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong, told the BBC. \"They really need to do much more. They need to do what Xi Jinping has already said - boost domestic demand.\"\nThat is a tall task in an economy where the property market is slumping and disillusioned youth are struggling to find high-paying jobs. \nChinese people have not been spending enough to recharge the economy - and Beijing has just announced a slew of stimulus measures to boost consumption.\nWhile tariffs can slow Chinese manufacturing, they cannot stop or replace it that easily, analysts say.\n\"Not only is China the big exporter, it is sometimes the only exporter like for solar panels. If you want solar panels you can only go to China,\" Ms Garcia-Herrero said.\nChina had begun pivoting from making garments and shoes to advanced tech such  as robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) long before Trump became president. And that has given China an \"early mover\" advantage, not to mention the scale of production in the world's second-largest economy.\nChinese factories can produce high-end tech in large quantities at a low cost, said Shuang Ding, chief China economist at Standard Chartered.\n\"It's really difficult to find a replacement... China's status as a market leader is very difficult to topple.\"\nChina has responded with counter tariffs of 10-15% on US agricultural goods, coal, liquefied natural gas, pick-up trucks, and some sports cars.\nAnd it has targeted US firms in aviation, defence and tech with export restrictions and announced an anti-monopoly investigation against Google.\nChina has also spent years adapting to tariffs from Trump's first term. Some Chinese manufacturers have moved factories out of the country, for instance. And supply chains have come to rely more on Vietnam and Mexico by exporting from there to bypass the tariffs.         \nAnd yet, Trump's recent  tariffs on Mexico would not hurt China too much because  Vietnam is a bigger backdoor for Chinese goods, Ms Garcia-Herrero said.\n\"Vietnam is the key here. If tariffs are imposed on Vietnam, I think it will be very tough,\" she said.\nWhat concerns China more than tariffs, analysts says, is US restrictions on advanced chips. \nThese restrictions have been a major sticking point between the two countries but they have also fuelled China's determination to invest in homegrown tech that is independent of the West.  \nIt's why Chinese AI firm DeepSeek shocked Silicon Valley and unnerved Washington when it released a chatbot that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT. The firm had reportedly stockpiled Nvidia chips before the US began cutting off China's access to the most advanced ones.  \nAlthough this could \"impact China's competitiveness, I don't think that would affect China's status as a manufacturing power,\" Mr Ding of Standard Chartered said.\nOn the other hand, any ground China gains in advanced tech manufacturing will  boost its high-value exports. \nIt happened because of state support, an unrivalled supply chain and cheap labour, analysts say.\n\"The combination of globalisation, as well as China's pro-business policies and market potential, helped to attract the initial wave of foreign investors,\" Chim Lee, an analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told the BBC.\nThe government then doubled down, investing heavily in building a sprawling network of roads and ports to bring in raw materials and take Chinese-made goods to the world. What also helped was a stable exchange rate between the Chinese yuan and the US dollar.   \nA shift in recent years towards advanced tech has made sure that it will continue to be relevant and ahead of its competitors, analysts say.\nChina already has plenty of economic clout from being a manufacturing powerhouse. But there is also a political opportunity as Trump's tariffs upend America's relationship with the world. \n\"The door is ajar for China to position itself as an advocate of free trade and a stable global force,\" said Mr Cruise of Moody's.\nBut that is not easy, given Beijing has been accused of flouting international trade norms, such as imposing a tariff of more than 200% on imports of Australian wine in 2020.\nAnalysts say China must also look beyond the US, which is still the top destination for its exports. China is the third-biggest market for US exports, after Canada and Mexico. \nChinese trade with Europe, South East Asia and Latin America has been growing, but it's hard to imagine that the world's two biggest economies can stop relying on each other.

        "article_text": "The business of the North American Toy Fair, an annual showcase of the latest in silly putty, monster trucks and board games, is fun. But this year at the convention center in New York City, tariffs were killing the vibe.\nIn February, US President Donald Trump raised tariffs on products made in China by 10%. Then last week, with little warning, he announced an additional 10% border tax, which has now come into force on Tuesday, along with tariffs on Mexico and Canada. \nIn the toy industry, which estimates that about 80% of toys sold in the US are made in China, the rapid-fire announcements have stunned businesses, leaving them scrambling to figure out how to swallow a sudden 20% rise in cost.\nThe moves are the first of what Trump has threatened will be far wider action, making it a preview of the upheaval that could be coming for companies around the world.\n\"It's the first thing we talk about and the last thing we talk about,\" toymaker Jay Foreman said this weekend from his booth at the trade show, where classic hits such as Lincoln Logs, Tonka Trucks and K'Nex were on display.\nHis business, Basic Fun!, makes 90% of its products in China and had been planning to counter the cost of the initial 10% tariff with a mix of higher prices for customers and lower profits, both for his firm and for his manufacturing partners. \nHe presented the strategy to his board on Wednesday, ahead of the toy show, only to have to rip it up the next day, after Trump's later announcement. \nHe will have to shoulder the tariff costs for products headed to stores this spring, he said, but is now expecting to raise prices for many items by at least 10% later in the year. \n\"The reality is that tariffs will raise the cost of toys for consumers,\" he said. \"If a customer says, 'Then I can't buy it', then I can't sell it, because I can't produce to lose money.\"\nTariffs are a tax on imports collected by the government at the border and paid for by the companies bringing in the goods.\nDuring Trump's first term, China was the main target of the measures, with more than $360bn worth of products sent to the US getting hit by the measures.\nAt the time, toys and many other consumer products were spared.\nBut Trump has now applied the duties across the board, hitting almost 15% of the imports into the US each year.\nHis actions have been overshadowed by tariffs on products made in Mexico and Canada - America's top two trade partners, which have long operated under a free trade agreement with the US. \nAnd they fall short of the \"up to 60%\" tariff that Trump called for on the campaign trail last year. \nBut with the latest move, businesses say the costs are getting too big to ignore.\nThe average effective tariff rate on imports from China now stands at roughly 34%, with recent actions amounting to a rise roughly twice as large as the increase during Trump's first four-year term as president, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs.\n\"10% - it's something we can somehow live with. 20% is a different ball game,\" said Yaron Barlev, chief operating officer of Clixo, a Brooklyn-based maker of magnetic building toys which started about five years ago and signed a deal last year to start selling its toys at Target later in 2025.\nWith manufacturing in China now under way to satisfy that order, his firm, which employs 18 people in the US, is expecting to have to shoulder the costs of the border duties, scrambling its plans for profits.  \nHe said he hoped Trump would offer some kind of reprieve for toys but was not feeling especially optimistic.\n\"It's much less predictable now than he used to be so I really don't know.\"\nTrump has said his actions will help boost manufacturing in the US, by making it less cost-effective to make products overseas. \nBut toymakers like Clixo, which had hoped to do its manufacturing in the US, say high costs and limited manufacturing capacity in the US make that idea unrealistic.\nMeanwhile, a string of weaker economic data has raised concerns that the uncertainty due to the tariff talk is starting to cause wider economic paralysis. \nBasic Fun!, which employs about 165 people and does roughly $200m in sales each year, had been looking to grow. But with the threat of tariffs bearing down, Mr Foreman recently put plans for acquisitions on hold, unsure how to calculate what a business would be worth in such a changeable environment. \n\"[A tariff] sounds good - 'Let's stick it to them!' But the ripple effect is unbelievable,\" Mr Foreman said.\nThe Toy Association, a business lobby group, says it is trying to make the case to the White House and Congress that toys should be exempt from tariffs, as they were before, warning that higher prices won't go unnoticed by a public already upset by the jump in prices in recent years.  \nPresident Greg Ahearn said his members are largely small businesses with profit margins barely as large as the tariffs that are getting under way. \n\"We think we have a very strong point to make and we're hoping they're going to be open to listening,\" he said. \nThe Toy Fair is his organisation's marquee event, drawing businesses from around the world who line New York's convention center with cheerful displays of blocks, high-contrast baby books and spiky coloured balls. But worry about tariffs pulsed through the gathering this year.\n\"It's killing our mojo,\" said Mr Ahearn, noting that it was his members' top concern.  \nFrom their booths, toymakers greeted questions about Trump's moves with head shakes, grimaces and disbelief. \n\"20% is a lot,\" said Ada Luo, sales director for Wonderful Party, a manufacturer in Shenzhen, China, which makes Christmas light necklaces, leis and New Year's hats. \"10% maybe... between the supplier and the buyer we can share, but 20%? We don't have a clue.\"",

        "article_text": "The cake is a sublime art form, involving numerous colours and flavours commingling into an oh-so-soft and delicious cake that hides a kaleidoscope of intricate geometric patterns.\nThe rich, buttery aroma of kek lapis (layer cake) greets me when I walk into Seri's (short for Sharifah Zainon) small baking studio at her home near Kuala Lumpur. The alluring aroma is not surprising, given that Malaysia is gearing up to celebrate Raya, which is short for Hari Raya (the Day of Celebration in Malay), and refers to the festive occasion marking the end of Ramadan. Kek lapis is an integral part of these festivities.\nSeri puts her academic training as an engineer to good use in her current career as a baker. Watching her hands spreading the batter evenly on the pan, I think that baking a kek lapis is a bit like conducting a scientific experiment. Preparing this multi-layered Malaysian cake with colourful and complex patterns not only requires knowledge and skill, but also oodles of patience, an eye for precision and a steady hand.\nA degree in the sciences seems to come in handy for kek lapis bakers, seeing the elaborate designs that Karen Chai, another engineer turned baker, creates at her baking studio in a quiet Kuala Lumpur suburb. When Chai returned to Malaysia after studying pastry arts at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, she decided to focus on kek lapis, using her mother's recipe as a starting point. \"Learning about the science of baking has been very useful in making kek lapis,\" she said.\nThis layer cake first came to Malaysia from neighbouring Indonesia through the state of Sarawak on the island of Borneo. In the mid-19th Century, Dutch colonisers introduced the plain European spit cake \u2013 made with layers of dough deposited one by one onto a cylindrical rotating spit \u2013 to the nation then known as Batavia (now Jakarta). Indonesians added local spices such as cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg and turned it into the lapis legit, often known as the thousand-layer cake.\nUpon its arrival in neighbouring Malaysia in the 1970s, Sarawakians elevated the cake to a sublime art form, involving multiple layers and numerous colours and flavours commingling into the oh-so-soft and delicious kek lapis. While the classic kek lapis often looks like a plain loaf on the outside, cutting it reveals a kaleidoscope of intricate geometric patterns.\nAlso called the Sarawak layer cake, kek lapis typically has a minimum of 12 layers. The cake is created by carefully adding one thin layer of batter after another onto a baking pan every few minutes, broiling (or grilling) each layer in the oven to ensure the lower layers are never burnt. The plain version alternates light and dark strips of cake batter, whereas the coloured cakes have geometric patterns that, depending on the final pattern, can involve 20 or more layers.\nThe final cake is cooled and then cut into strips, with different pieces reassembled using thick jam or condensed milk as adhesive. Often, multiple cakes have to be baked, and pieces from each of them are assembled to create a complex pattern. This is then wrapped up in a thin cake layer of a single colour, or arranged between two sets of plain (ie, with no colours or patterns) multi-layered cakes.\nIf all this sounds confusing, then imagine what it is like for the baker. Even the most experienced of them first draws these patterns on paper, clearly marking out sizes and colours, after which they get to work with the batter. A complex design can take up to eight hours to complete, with several chances for error at every step in the assembly process.\nChai explains that as opposed to other complex layered cakes, it is particularly tough with kek lapis, since the error often becomes apparent only after the baker has finished assembling the pieces, \"so all the hard work goes down the drain\".\nShe then shows me photos of her mother's signature 16-piece design that was born out of an error in calculation. \"She baked a few extra layers by mistake and didn't want to throw those pieces away. She just cut that up and tried to form another block, and this design came out. So this is not something that you will find from other bakers,\" she said.\nBoth Seri and Chai say that the long and laborious baking process is worth the reward of seeing a perfectly executed design. \"But there are no short cuts,\" Chai warned. Indeed, seeing Seri at work, cutting and sticking these long strips together with a generous lashing of raspberry jam, brings to mind a complicated jigsaw puzzle slowly taking shape. \"It's like therapy, [but] it's also fun and creative\" she said.\nWhen I visited in mid-February, the bakers had been working non-stop for weeks, fulfilling Raya orders received through their social media channels. Back in their hometowns in Sarawak, kek lapis is part of every holiday celebration, including Chinese New Year, Raya, Christmas and the midyear harvest festival of Gawai Dayak, cutting across communal and religious boundaries.\nSeri's long-term client and self-professed cake lover, Farazaila Wahet, said, \"This is an anytime cake for me, but of course for Raya, it is a must.\" The Sarawak native, who moved to Kuala Lumpur more than 10 years ago, said that the satisfaction she gets from kek lapis is unparalleled, because \"the texture is heavier and the taste is richer compared to any other cake.\"\nKek lapis is available in many flavours, such as chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, red velvet and pandan (a tropical plant with a strong aroma, commonly used in Southeast Asian cooking). Even popular malted drinks like Horlicks and Milo are used for flavouring. And now, artisanal bakers like Seri and Chai are trying to modernise this traditional cake to make it relevant to younger generations, while also staying true to the original recipe.\nSeri, for instance, makes exquisite chocolate batik art on the top layer to make her cakes even more attractive. \"Batik is traditional to Malaysia, so is kek lapis, and I love to combine the two to create this new version,\" she said.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0A multi-layered cake from India\n\u2022\u00a0Norway's best cake\n\u2022\u00a0The centuries-old baba made with 96 egg yolks\nChai keeps experimenting not just with more complicated patterns, but also new ingredients and flavour pairings. In the past, she has created gluten-free kek lapis using coconut flour with peanut butter topping, and another unique version with fig, apricot and cinnamon.\nBaking a good kek lapis requires a lot of time and high-quality ingredients, which means that they are also expensive, with prices going up to RM300 (roughly \u00a350) or more for a square, one-kilogram cake. But thankfully for the small-batch bakers, this traditional cake is constantly in demand from individual clients and it's also gaining in popularity as corporate gifts and wedding favours.\nThese bakers are on a mission to maintain this Sarawak culinary tradition, despite all the long hours and thin margins. As Seri said, \"Every time I make a kek lapis, it feels like a piece of home to me.\"\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n---\u00a0\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",

Ages like a fine wine. A happy fighter is a dangerous fighter. Natasha Jonas' career lends itself to plenty of overused boxing cliches.\nA pioneer of women's boxing for more than a decade, the 40-year-old headlines an all-female card at London's iconic Royal Albert Hall on Friday.\nJonas will put her WBC and IBF welterweight titles on the line against Wales' WBA champion Lauren Price.\nPrice, 30, is the unbeaten Olympic golden girl brimming with confidence. To use another stock sporting phrase, she predicts a passing of the torch.\nLet's not write Liverpool's history-maker off just yet, though.\nToxteth-born Jonas was the first British female to ever box at an Olympic Games. She has overcome injuries, disappointing defeats and juggled boxing with motherhood.\nThrough stellar punditry work or as the first black woman to obtain a British Boxing Board of Control manager's licence, Jonas continues to make waves outside the ring too.\nBut her life could easily have panned out very differently. Speaking to BBC Sport, Jonas reflects on the 'sliding doors' moments which led to her becoming a two-weight world champion.\nJonas v Price - All you need to know\nBelfast, New York & plenty of controversy\nJonas caught the sporting bug as a four-year-old watching the Seoul 1988 Olympics. \nAlthough her memory of those Games is somewhat patchy, she remembers \"being overwhelmed and excited by all the sport that was happening\". \nTwo decades later she was nicknamed 'Miss GB' for her own Olympic appearance.\nWhen Jonas qualified for London 2012 at an event in China, she shared a heartwarming moment with her mother. \n\"That's when Mum told me at the airport how proud she was and that when I was a little girl, watching the Olympics on TV, I told her one day I wanted to be there,\" Jonas adds.\n\"Sometimes kids have big ideas. Sometimes life and the world gets in the way. But after 24 years and trying hundreds of sports, I got there.\n\"So looking back, I could say the '88 Games was the most pivotal event of my career.\"\nThis video can not be played\nIQ, speed & accuracy - why Jonas is confident for Price bout\nAs a teenager, Jonas dreamed of representing her country on the global stage, but not as a pugilist.\n\"I watched Rachel Yankey and Mia Hamm and always thought 'I'm a well better footballer',\" she says.\nJonas is \"not the most academic\" but buckled down to earn a football scholarship at St Peter's College in New Jersey.\n\"America was the place to be,\" she says, with only a handful of English women's football teams operating at a professional level at the time. \nBut a budding football career was cut devastatingly short when Jonas tore her cruciate ligament while in the States. \n\"If my injury hadn't have happened I definitely wouldn't be getting punched in the face for a living. It was a big turning point,\" Jonas adds.\nHer sister, Nikita Parris, has 72 caps for England and was part of the 2022 Euros winning squad.\nAsked if she would swap her career for a major trophy, Jonas replies: \"I'd rather go on to become an undisputed boxing world champion than a football World Cup winner.\"\nJonas is trained by Joe Gallagher, who has trained six world champions, including Liam Smith\nWhen Jonas returned to England she lost friendship groups made through football and, with her knee in a brace, began to put on weight.\nShe briefly worked in call centres but was sacked from all seven jobs.\n\"Now looking back as an adult, I recognise that I was depressed,\" Jonas says. \"I lost my identity. Everyone said I was going to play for Liverpool and England but now I was no longer 'Tasha the footballer' but just Tasha.\"\nIn a bid to regain her fitness, Jonas, aged 21, stepped into the legendary Rotunda Amateur Boxing Gym.\n\"All the lads were like 'who is she?'. They weren't used to having a girl in their gym,\" she recalls.\n\"After a warm-up, the coach asked us to get into pairs to do bags. I thought I'd be the little girl who is last to be picked, like when I used to play football with my cousins.\"\nInstead, Jonas was greeted by the kindness of future light-middleweight world champion Liam Smith - one of the popular boys in the gym. When he saw a deflated Jonas put her head down, he offered to partner up.\n\"I don't know if I would or wouldn't have stuck it out if he hadn't done that, but one little gesture from Liam made such a difference - there was no more awkwardness in the gym after that,\" Jonas adds.\nJonas beat American Quanitta Underwood at London 2012 but missed out on a medal after losing to Katie Taylor in the quarter-finals\nJonas called time on her amateur career in 2014 with a record of 57 wins and 26 defeats. She gave birth to her daughter, Mila, and was happy to never box again.\nThat soon changed after the pro debut of a trailblazing Irishwoman and a phone call from a former Team GB team-mate.\n\"I did some punditry work for Katie Taylor's debut and Tom Stalker phoned me afterwards,\" Jonas explains.\n\"He said there will be a lot of opportunity for pro females now and asked if I'd ever think of coming back? I said 'shut up, Tom'.\"\nJonas says she was \"happy with her routine\". Mila had turned two and was in nursery and the media work was keeping her busy.\nBut Stalker's words kept ringing in her ear. After speaking to her immediate family, Jonas realised the boxing fire was still burning.\n\"I phoned two cousins, my mum and dad,\" Jonas adds. \"I trusted their judgement and they knew the good and bad side to boxing. \n\"They were there for me when I cried for two days, after losing to Katie in the amateurs. \n\"But they all gave me their support and said I had nothing to worry about, especially as far as the baby is concerned.\"\nTurning pro was a decision that paid off. In February 2022, Jonas stopped Chris Namus to become light-middleweight world champion and has since won all five world-title level fights.\n\"If I could go back and talk to myself in some of those hardest moments earlier in life, I'd say 'chin up, kid, it all works out in the end',\" she says.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

He is joined in the back row by skipper Jac Morgan and Taulupe Faletau, who this week said he had not given up hope of a fourth tour with the British and Irish Lions this summer.\nGareth Anscombe has recovered from a head knock suffered against Ireland to partner Tomos Williams in the half-backs, with Max Llewellyn and Ben Thomas in the centre.\nWith Josh Adams ruled out with a hamstring problem, there is another opportunity for Scarlets trio Ellis Mee, Blair Murray and Tom Rogers to impress in a backline containing just 15 Test caps.\n'Pressure's on Scotland, not Wales' - coach Jones\nThomas happy to return to centre stage for Wales\nWales travel to Murrayfield propping up the Six Nations table with three defeats, while Scotland are fourth after their opening round win over Italy.\n\"This week we've challenged ourselves to keep improving,\" said Sherratt.\n\"We want to keep the same intent and bravery as we showed last time out, but making sure that we are building on our game.\n\"The fallow week was difficult as we only had 13 or 14 lads in. I'd have loved to have that week to continue the growth of the team, but it's just confirmed what I thought after the first two days, that they're just a very good group, very, very coachable. \n\"This week has been a step-up in terms of what we've produced on the training field. \n\"The challenge the group set themselves on Monday was that they're pleased with the performance but not the result, because they're all competitors, we all are. \n\"The passion and effort was first-rate. It's matching that as a minimum but trying to build our game slowly.\"\nWales: Murray; Rogers, Llewellyn, B Thomas, Mee; Anscombe, Tomos Williams; Smith, Dee, John, Rowlands, Jenkins, Morgan (capt), Reffell, Faletau.\nReplacements: D Lake, G Thomas, Assiratti, Teddy Williams, Wainwright, R Williams, J Evans, Roberts.\nThis video can not be played\nCaptain Morgan on initiation punishments and famous relatives\nThis video can not be played\nWho got a nickname from Trump?

        "article_text": "Volodymyr Zelensky says Ukraine is ready to sign a deal with the US over his country's mineral deposits, days after he was told to leave the White House following a fiery exchange with Donald Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance. \nThe deal was expected to be signed during Zelensky's visit to Washington, but was put on hold after the meeting in front of journalists and TV cameras turned into a shouting match.\nThe relationship between the two leaders showed little sign of improving in the days afterwards, with the US announcing it was pausing all military aid to Ukraine. \nHours after that announcement, Zelensky posted a lengthy message on social media expressing his gratitude for American support for Ukraine, and saying his country was ready to sign the minerals deal at \"any time and in any convenient format\".\nIn a speech to Congress, Trump said he appreciated the message from Zelensky, but it is currently unclear if or when the deal will be signed.\nMultiple sources have told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the terms of the deal have not yet been finalised and could change from a previous version, which was published by Ukrainian media before Zelensky's meeting with Trump and Vance.  \nThat version of the deal envisages that an \"investment fund\" will be set up for Ukraine's reconstruction, which Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said would be managed by Kyiv and Washington on \"equal terms\".\nAccording to the text, Ukraine will contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas to the fund, and the fund will then invest \"to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine\".\nMeanwhile, the agreement says the US government will, subject to US law, \"maintain a long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine\".\nThe US will own the maximum amount of the fund allowed under US law, the agreement says.\nIn the days before the deal was supposed to be signed, disagreement over its terms formed part of a deepening rift between Trump and Zelensky.\nThe Ukrainian president rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (\u00a3395bn) in mineral wealth, but this demand was dropped from the version published online. \n\"The US administration started with a deal that challenged Ukraine's sovereignty, then pushed an exploitative one that would bankrupt the country,\" Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister and head of Kyiv school of economics, told the BBC. \n\"Now, they've shifted to a reasonable deal with co-ownership and no direct claims on past aid. That could actually benefit Ukraine.\"\nTrump has repeatedly claimed the US has given Ukraine between $300bn (\u00a3237bn) and $350bn (\u00a3276bn) in aid, and that he wanted to \"get that money back\" through a deal. \nBut German think tank the Kiel Institute estimates the US has sent $119bn in aid to Ukraine.\nZelensky has been pushing for a deal to include a firm security guarantee from the US.\nNo such guarantee has yet been made, although the published text says the US supports \"Ukraine's efforts to obtain security guarantees to build lasting peace\".\nTrump has suggested the presence of US contractors in Ukraine would act as a security guarantee, but responsibility for Ukraine's security would now fall to Europe. \nThe prospect of a minerals deal was first proposed by Zelensky last year as a way to offer the US a tangible reason to continue supporting Ukraine.\nTrump initially said Ukraine would get \"the right to fight on\" in return for access to its minerals, but in the days after the spat in Washington he paused all US military aid to Ukraine. \nTrump had said the two would sign the deal at the meeting at the White House.\nUkrainian PM Shmyhal said the US and Ukraine had prepared a final version of the agreement, though Zelensky aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said only a framework agreement was due to be signed.\nBut nothing at all was signed during the visit, which instead descended into a heated exchange between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office.\nAt one point, a furious Trump said Zelensky was not grateful enough for the US's support during the war, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three\".\nHe said Zelensky had to \"make a deal or we're out\", adding: \"You don't have the cards.\"\nZelensky said there should be \"no compromises\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nNot long after - and well ahead of schedule - the Ukrainian president was seen leaving the White House.\nThe White House then announced the deal had not been agreed - and said Trump had decided to call off the signing ceremony himself.\nThe US president wrote on his Truth Social platform that Zelensky had \"disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office\". He added: \"He can come back when he is ready for peace.\"\nIt is currently unclear when the deal might be signed.\nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.\nThis includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine also has significant deposits of titanium and lithium. It says it has substantial amounts of the world's rare earth metals - a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world - but these claims are disputed.\nAlso, some of the country's mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nThere are warnings too that a deal allowing the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth cannot happen unless the country addresses its problem with unexploded mines. \nA quarter of Ukraine's land mass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country.\nAnother issue is it will be some time before anyone sees any material benefits from the deal.\n\"These resources aren't in a port or warehouse; they must be developed,\" says Mylovanov. \"In that sense if the US invests, it will benefit everyone.\"\nBefore the deal was supposed to be signed, Vladimir Putin told state TV he was ready to \"offer\" resources to American partners in joint projects, including mining in Russia's \"new territories\" - a reference to parts of eastern Ukraine occupied by Russia since its full-scale invasion three years ago.\nPutin said a potential US-Ukraine deal on rare minerals was not a concern and that Russia \"undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine\".\n\"As for the new territories, it's the same. We are ready to attract foreign partners to the so-called new, to our historical territories, which have returned to the Russian Federation,\" he added.",

We had to run into a store screaming that somebody was going to kill us.\"\nValkyrae, who has 3.4m followers on Instagram, said she hopes it's a \"learning for other streamers\".\n\"It only takes one person, so be careful.\"\nPosting on X, she also said what happened demonstrates the \"harsh reality women live in\" and hit out at online comments that it was staged to drive hits.\n\"Seeing accounts accusing my friends and I for faking this and blaming us instead of questioning the man's behaviour has been embarrassing to see.\n\"I've learned it doesn't matter how much I accomplish in this industry or how much I try to gain respect, some men will hate women and blame women no matter the situation.\"\nEmiru did not appear in the follow-up stream on Monday but posted on X afterwards. \n\"I wish I could say this was some kind of one-in-a-million incident, but the truth is, it is not,\" she said. \"This is what life is like for girls.\n\"I hope if anything, people see what happened and realise how much of a reality it is for women and content creators as a whole.\"\nBBC Newsbeat has contacted Pacific Park for comment. \nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has imposed\u00a0his long-threatened 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian goods, as well as a new 10% levy against China, citing the countries' failure to stop the export of chemicals used in the production of the powerful opioid fentanyl.\nThe US has long accused Chinese corporations of knowingly supplying groups involved in the creation of the drug. Beijing has hit back with tariffs of its own.\nThe White House has also accused Canada and Mexico of failing to prevent criminal gangs from smuggling fentanyl into the US.\nBeijing has hit back with a 15% tariff of its own, and Canada has announced 25% tariffs against $30bn worth of US goods, with an additional $125bn worth of products to be hit over the next 21 days. \nMexico is expected to respond later on Tuesday.\nFentanyl is a synthetic drug manufactured from a combination of chemicals. US regulators approved it for use in medical settings as a pain reliever in the 1960s, but it has since become the main drug responsible for opioid overdose deaths in the US.\nOver 74,000 Americans died in 2023 after taking drug mixtures containing fentanyl, according to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC).\nIt is frequently mixed with other illicit drugs, leading many users to be unaware that the substances they are consuming contain fentanyl.\nAs little as a two milligram dose of fentanyl - roughly the size of a pencil tip - can be fatal.\nOver the past decade, the global fentanyl supply chain has expanded, making it harder for law enforcement and policymakers to control.\nChina is the primary source of the precursor chemicals used to produce fentanyl.\nSince September, 7,793 lb (3,534kg) of fentanyl have been seized in the US, according to figures published by US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP).\nAlmost all (98%) was intercepted at the southwest border with Mexico. Less than 1% was seized across the northern US border with Canada. The remainder was from sea routes or other US checkpoints.\nAccording to the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Mexican criminal organisations - including the Sinaloa Cartel - play a key role in producing and delivering fentanyl, methamphetamine and other illicit drugs into the US.\nThe chemicals used to make fentanyl are sourced from China by traffickers and turned into the finished product in labs in Mexico before being smuggled into the US.\nAccording to the DEA, the Sinaloa Cartel uses a variety of tactics to conceal shipments coming into Mexico, such as hiding the chemicals among legitimate commercial goods, mislabelling the containers, using front companies, and shipping through third party countries.\nThe Trump administration has accused the Mexican government of colluding with the drug cartels. Mexico's President Sheinbaum says the claims are \"slander.\"\nIn December, shortly after Trump had threatened Mexico with tariffs, the country's security forces announced their largest ever seizure of fentanyl - equivalent to around 20 million doses.\nIn response to the threat of tariffs from the US, on February 5th the Mexican government launched Operation Northern Border, deploying 10,000  national guard troops along the US-Mexico border.\nIn the latest government announcement on the operation, the Mexican government said that in the month since the operation launched, 55.9kg of fentanyl have been seized.\nIn 2019, China classified fentanyl as a controlled narcotic and later added some of the chemicals used to make it to the list.\nDespite this, the trade in other chemicals involved in the manufacturing of fentanyl - some of which can have legitimate purposes - remain uncontrolled, as those involved in the trade find new ways to evade the law.\nA review of several US indictments, which include details of undercover agents communicating with Chinese manufacturers, suggests that some chemical companies in China have been selling chemicals - including controlled ones - in the knowledge that they are intended to make fentanyl.\nDozens of indictments reviewed by BBC Verify detail instances where Chinese manufacturers have provided instructions on how to make fentanyl from products they sell, through encrypted platforms and cryptocurrency payments.\n\"So you have these massive loopholes where criminals engage in selling legal products, but they knowingly sell them to criminal entities,\" says Vanda Felbab-Brown, senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institute.\nIn a statement, China said it had some of the strictest drugs laws in the world and had conducted joint operations with the US in the past.\n\"The US needs to view and solve its own fentanyl issue,\" it said.\nAnd while China remains the main source of the chemicals used to make fentanyl, the DEA has also identified India as an emerging major source for these chemicals.\nIn a US indictment from January 2025, two chemical companies in India were charged with supplying the chemicals used to make fentanyl to the US and Mexico.\nPresident Trump has accused Canada - alongside Mexico - of allowing \"vast numbers of people to come in and fentanyl to come in\" to the US.\nAccording to data from the US Customs and Border Patrol, only about 0.2% of all seizures of fentanyl entering the US are made at the Canadian border, almost all the rest is confiscated at the US border with Mexico.\nBut in January, Canada's financial intelligence agency reported that organised criminal groups in Canada are increasingly involved in the production of fentanyl by importing chemicals used to make it and lab equipment from China.\nThe trade in fentanyl takes place in both directions. \nIn the first 10 months of 2024, the Canadian border service reported seizing 10.8lb (4.9kg) of fentanyl entering from the US, while US Border Patrol intercepted 32.1lb (14.6kg) of fentanyl coming from Canada.\nIn December, the country pledged C$1.3bn ($900m; \u00a3700m) for combating fentanyl and enhancing border security.\nAnd on February 11th, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the appointment\u00a0 Kevin Brosseau, as Canada's fentanyl czar. \nAdditional reporting by Lucy Gilder. \nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

        "article_text": "On Wednesday, in a series of high-stakes diplomatic episodes around the globe, Trump's free-wheeling attitude toward foreign policy was on full display, playing out in real time through posts on his Truth Social account.\nFor his supporters, it was the president's \"art of the deal\" in action, using every negotiating tool and tactic at his disposal.\nFor critics, it was another day of disruption for its own sake \u2013 with little apparent concern for the risks involved or the potential consequences.\nWednesday began with news that the US is directly negotiating with Hamas leaders for the release of American hostages still in Gaza. Contacting a group designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the US since 1997 represents a dramatic shift away from decades of US policy.\nThe Biden administration relied on intermediaries during its attempts to end the Gaza war. And Trump previously condemned Hamas for committing \"atrocities against humanity\" during its 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, calling its members \"vicious and violent\".\nBut for Trump, it seems, the old playbook wasn't working \u2013 and he was willing to risk appearing hypocritical, of bypassing US ally Israel, and of sitting down with a designated terror group to advance his deal-making goals.\nIsrael Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office responded with a terse statement, saying only that it had \"expressed its position\" on the talks.\nBy the end of the day, after meeting in the Oval Office with some previously released American hostages, Trump again turned up the heat on the group. He took to Truth Social to call it \"sick and twisted\" and issue a \"last warning\" that if members didn't release all the hostages there would be \"hell to pay\".\n\"I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job,\" he wrote, \"not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don't do as I say.\"\nLaura Blumenfeld, a former senior Israeli-Palestinian policy adviser to the US state department, told the BBC that Trump's message to Hamas was an ultimatum.\n\"The deal, though, with these ultimatums is you have to deliver,\" she said, \"and we saw last month when Trump said you've got a high noon deadline on Saturday, release the hostages, or else, there was no or else.\n\"And Hamas called them out.

        "article_text": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau slammed Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on Canada, calling it a \"very dumb thing to do\" and vowed to conduct a \"relentless fight\" to protect its economy.\nTrump has imposed 25% tariffs on products entering the US from Canada and Mexico, and has increased a levy on goods coming from China.\nThe Canadian prime minister announced retaliatory tariffs on US exports and warned that a trade war would be costly for both countries.\nBut Trump pushed even further in a post on Truth Social, saying: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"\nTrudeau accused the US president of planning \"a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us\". \n\"That is never going to happen. We will never be the 51st state,\" he told reporters on Tuesday.\n\"This is a time to hit back hard and to demonstrate that a fight with Canada will have no winners.\"\nHe said that Canada's main goal remains to get the tariffs lifted so that they \"don't last a second longer than necessary\".\nTrump said he is protecting US jobs and manufacturing, and trying to prevent illegal migration and drug trafficking. The US president said his goal is to clamp down on the powerful opioid fentanyl; he has variously blamed the other countries for the drug's arrival in the US.\nResponding to the accusations, Trudeau said on Tuesday there was \"no justification\" for the new tariffs, because less than 1% of the fentanyl intercepted at the US border comes from Canada. \nTrudeau's words were echoed by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who said there was \"no motive, no reason, no justification\" for Trump's move. Speaking on Tuesday, she too vowed to issue her own \"tariff and non-tariff measures\" - but said further details would be given on Sunday.\nTrump's tariffs are likely to push up prices for consumers in the US and abroad, said John Rogers, an economics professor at American International University.\nThe items most likely to be affected the soonest are food - the fruits, vegetables and other produce the US imports from Mexico - followed by the large amounts of oil and gas imported from Canada, Prof Rogers said.\n\"Prices could go up pretty soon\", Prof Rogers warned, though he was reluctant to say by exactly how much or how quickly. \n\"We are in pretty uncharted territory,\" he told the BBC.\nThe bigger concern for prof Rogers was the potential damage he said was being done to America's longstanding trade partners.\n\"This is kind of sticking your finger in the eye of your neighbour,\" he said, adding that, in a potential US-Canada-Mexico trade war, \"everybody is a loser\".\nThe three countries targeted are America's top trading partners, and the tit-for-tat measures also prompted fears of that very trade war. \n\"There's no way you can win a trade war. Everybody suffers, because everybody's just going to wind up paying higher prices and sacrificing quality,\" Prof Rogers said. \nTariffs are a tax on imports from other countries, designed to protect against cheaper competition from elsewhere, and boost businesses and jobs at home.\nCanada's retaliatory measures include a 25% reciprocal tariff that will be imposed on C$155bn (US$107bn; \u00a384bn) of American goods:\nCanada's Immigration Minister Marc Miller warned that as many as a million jobs in Canada were at risk if the tariffs were implemented, given how intertwined trade was between the two countries.\n\"We can't replace an economy that is responsible for 80% of our trade overnight and it's going to hurt,\" he said on Monday.\nSpeaking to the AFP news agency, a car manufacturing employee in the Canadian province of Ontario said people were indeed \"pretty scared\" of being laid off. \"I just bought my first house,\" Joel Soleski said. \"I might have to look for work elsewhere.\"\nThe sector is one that could be badly affected by the new tariffs regime in North America. Car parts may cross US-Canada border several times during the manufacturing process, and so might be taxed on multiple occasions.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford, whose province is home to Canada's auto manufacturing industry, told reporters on Tuesday that he anticipates assembly plants will \"shut down on both sides of the border\" as a result of the tariffs.\nThe tariffs were called \"reckless\" by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, whose president Candace Laing cautioned that the move would force both Canada and the US towards \"recession, job losses and economic disaster\".\nMs Laing warned they would also increase prices for Americans, and force US businesses to find alternate suppliers that she said \"are less reliable than Canadian ones\".\nCanadian provincial leaders have vowed their own responses. \nFord of Ontario mooted the possibility of cutting off Canadian electricity supplies and exports of high-grade nickel to the US, as well as putting an export levy of 25% on electricity sent to power homes in Michigan, New York and Minnesota.\nCanada exports enough electricity to power some six million American homes.\nOntario and other provinces have also moved to remove US-made liquor off their shelves. In Nova Scotia, Premier Tim Houston said his province will ban American companies from bidding on provincial contracts, as will Ontario. \nFord also announced that a C$100m ($68m; \u00a355.1) contract with Elon Musk's satellite internet company Starlink will be cancelled.\nMeanwhile China - which now faces tariffs of 20% after Trump doubled an earlier levy - has vowed to fight any trade war to the \"bitter end\". It has announced its own counter-measures - including tariffs on a range of US agricultural and food products.",

        "article_text": "The new law to tackle goalkeeper time-wasting was approved by the International Football Association Board in Belfast\nFrom this summer onwards, goalkeepers will be allowed eight seconds from catching the ball to releasing it, in the latest attempt to cut down on time-wasting.\nPositive results in trials across England, Italy and Malta have prompted the games rule-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), to change the law for the start of the 2025-26 season.\nThis rule will be implemented worldwide by 1 July, at all levels of the game from elite to amateur.\nIt will also be in place for the Club World Cup, which runs from 15 June to 13 July.\nReferees will punish goalkeepers holding on to the ball for more than eight seconds by awarding a corner to the opposition. \nGoalkeepers will be warned by the referee when they have five seconds remaining to get rid of the ball. The referee will raise their arm and start a visual countdown with their hand.\nYes. Well, kind of, as it was rarely enforced. The current law states if a goalkeeper holds on to a ball for six seconds, then an indirect free-kick is awarded to the opposition. \nDuring trials, Ifab said there had only been four instances where goalkeepers have been penalised in hundreds of matches, even with the rule being strictly applied.\nIfab technical director and former Premier League referee David Elleray told The Times: \"Good law changes are where you have a very strong deterrent which everybody implements and then the problem effectively disappears.\n\"If it speeds up the game, if it's more positive, it means that it could be one of those very effective deterrents.\"\nThe Club World Cup features Manchester City and Chelsea, so Premier League fans will be able to see how Ederson, Stefan Ortega, Robert Sanchez or Filip Jorgensen cope with that countdown for the first time.\nMore corners, at least at the start of the season. Set-piece coaches will start receiving even more air-time.\nEarly casualties. We already know how strictly rules are enforced when they are first brought in - just ask Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard, who both got handed second yellow cards early this season for delaying the restart.\nThe sound of the crowd sarcastically counting down when the opposition goalkeeper picks up the ball.\nExpect players to get involved, too. If a team is trailing in the dying minutes of a game and a goalkeeper has the ball, there will be players who tell the referee to count quicker... or even count for them.\nUnfortunately, there are no Opta statistics available for this particular 'dark art' metric - but you only have to watch football semi-regularly to spot a goalkeeper catching and diving to the ground in elaborate stages.\nElleray gave an example involving Brighton stopper Jason Steele from their 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford in September 2023.\nSteele held on to the ball for an average of 14.8 seconds, compared to Andre Onana's average of 4.8 seconds.\nExploring the 'dark arts' in Man City v Arsenal\nWhat impact has longer added time had on matches?\nDoes football need a 60-minute 'stop-clock'?\nFormer England and West Ham goalkeeper Rob Green: \nBack in the day there was the six-second rule and that has slowly faded away \u2013 I don't know why \u2013 I think that was enough of a deterrent. Maybe they are thinking the punishment being a bit more lenient may get things going. It seems a strange one to reintroduce, but if we can get more football in the 90 minutes then I'm all for it.\nAs a percentage there's only around a 4% chance of scoring from a corner so it isn't that much of a threat but at the end of the game, the last thing your team-mates want to do is defend a set-piece if you're winning.\nI think we see it every year, they will implement it right from the start but in a couple of years' time we may be having this same conversation.\nFormer England and Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson:\nThese rules are being made by people that have clearly never played the game. They are giving corners? \nGoalkeepers used to have six seconds \u2013 then that went out the game so goalkeepers have started game management and timewasting. Now they are giving an extra two and it's eight.\nShamoon Hafez:\nIt feels like a rule that may be strictly enforced when first implemented, before it gets forgotten about.\nJust think back to how much injury time was being played when officials decided to clamp down on time-wasting and how much is added on now.\nIt also feels like there could be a pantomime scenario during matches, with players and the crowd counting the seconds when the keeper has ball in hand.\nBurnley striker Ashley Barnes was signalling seconds on his fingers in Saturday's FA Cup game against Preston as Freddie Woodman held on to the ball. How many other players will we see attempting to pressure the referee into enforcing the new rule?\nAlex Howell:\nIt will be interesting to see what impact the eight-second rule has on the way teams think about their build-up play.\nIt could also then have a knock-on effect on the way teams press. The trend with a lot of teams is to press high to keep the opposition under pressure, but maybe now knowing the ball has to be released in eight seconds could push sides even further forward and impact the speed of games everywhere.\nConor McNamara:\nI have quite a bit of sympathy for the referees who are going to have to implement this.\nIn essence, the law was to be a deterrent to stop excessive holding on to the ball for 20 seconds and more. But in this highly-analytical world we now live in, any new 'measurable initiatives' will be given the full 'offside by a toe-nail' treatment.\nThe conspiracy theorists will love it all.\nAlso, to implement this to the letter of the law, the poor referees will have to start shouting five-second countdowns each and every time a goalkeeper has had the ball in their hands for three seconds. \nSemi-automated offsides may divert some of the personal insults away from the officials, but implementing this new law will see the individual referees catch plenty of slack again.\nAlistair Bruce-Ball:\nOne thing's for certain - goalkeepers would be wise not to hang on to the ball against Arsenal next season given their prowess from corners.\nAnything that prevents players from time-wasting is obviously to be applauded but I can already foresee arguments about the consistency in the application of this law.\nI also wonder if it's something the referees will be very hot on in the first couple of weeks before it gets forgotten, not deliberately but subconsciously, and the time allowed starts slipping.\nNick Mashiter: \nNottingham Forest's Matz Sels will be on red alert with the new eight-second rule.\nThe goalkeeper has been booked twice for time-wasting this season, while Jose Sa at Wolves has also been known to slow the game down to his side's advantage.\nThe Premier League is already played at a frantic pace and this will only help maintain that speed, but the focus could be better served improving the video assistant referee and avoiding prolonged delays - including the eight-minute wait to rule out Milos Kerkez's goal for Bournemouth against Wolves on Saturday - which only frustrate fans and slow the game down further.\nJohn Murray:\nAn interesting move but how often we will see it implemented, I wonder?\nI suspect it is simply another tool to try and increase the amount of playing time, which the authorities have been working on for some while. \nAnd the likelihood is it will be used only very much as a last resort and more as a warning to make it clear to goalkeepers that they need to get on with it.",

        "article_text": "Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie says the writer's block she experienced after becoming pregnant with her first child was \"terrifying\".\n\"It's a really frightening place to be, because writing is the thing that gives me meaning,\" the acclaimed Nigerian author, 47, tells the BBC's Emma Barnett.\n\"I'm not sure that it was just entirely physiological but something changed, and I just could not get back into that magical place where I can write fiction.\"\nAdichie had her first child, a daughter, in 2016. Last year, she had twin boys, now 11 months old.\nWhile she was pregnant, she had a \"very foggy feeling\" and \"couldn't think as clearly,\" she says.\n\"I'm a person for whom thinking clearly is so important, and so to be in that kind of place emotionally is very frightening,\" she says.\nAdichie is now releasing her first novel in more than a decade, Dream Count.\nThe book tells the story of four women navigating lives that aren't going to plan.\n\"I couldn't write for a while, and then I started writing again,\" she says.\nAdichie is known for work that explores themes including feminism, gender and immigration. The novelist's 2012 Ted Talk We Should All Be Feminists helped push her to greater prominence, and was even sampled by Beyonc\u00e9 on her 2013 song Flawless.\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the BBC, she speaks about topics including parenthood, grief and artificial intelligence (AI).\nAdichie's beliefs about gender have led her to reflect on how she'd like to bring up her sons. \"I'm determined to raise good men,\" she says.\n\"I want to raise my boys to be emotionally comfortable, to be in touch with emotion, to not be afraid of emotion, and also to not be afraid of fear,\" she continues.\nCompared to girls, Adichie believes boys don't have many \"wholesome\" role models. \"This space is just occupied by noxious characters and ideas,\" she says.\nThe writer adds that she wants her sons to be \"the kind of boys that never start a fight but if you bring a fight to them, they will beat you up\".\nAs well as having her three children, since writing her last novel, Adichie has also lost both of her parents.\n\"Grief recedes but only in waves and then, at some point, it comes back,\" she says.\nAdichie was surprised by how physical grief felt. \"Your heart really is very heavy, you feel as though your body is somehow no longer able to carry the weight of your heart,\" she says.\nThe novelist says that grieving for her mother, who died suddenly on her father's birthday in 2021, had a role in shaping her new novel.\nWhen she started writing the book - after her mother died - \"I did not think I was writing about my mother,\" she says. But when she had nearly finished, she reread the manuscript and realised there was \"so much about mothers and daughters\" in it, even though she hadn't been conscious of this while writing.\n\"I felt very strongly that, in some ways, my mother had opened the door for me to get back into this magical place that means that I can write fiction,\" Adichie says. \"I kind of thought that she's comforting me, and it was actually deeply emotional for me to make that realisation.\"\nAs someone with a deep emotional connection to the creative process, it is perhaps unsurprising that when the conversation turns to AI, Adichie has a strong stance.\nThe author says that we should not refer to any written content produced by generative AI produces as stories and that the technology is going to make all of us, if we embrace it widely, \"increasingly stupid\".\nShe argues that AI could limit human creativity, something she says \"we should never think that we can somehow replace\".\nEven using AI for tasks like summarising work emails can be damaging, she says. \n\"The ability to summarise is something that requires a certain level of creativity and imagination and intelligence, and it just seems to me that if you're ceding that to something else, what are we going to let our brains do for us?\"\nWatch the full interview on BBC iPlayer - Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie: The Interview with Emma Barnett",

        "article_text": "Antonelli is set to become the third-youngest driver in F1 history at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix from 14-16 March, behind Max Verstappen and Lance Stroll\nMercedes' rookie Formula 1 driver Andrea Kimi Antonelli rejects the idea that he is a replacement at the team for Lewis Hamilton.\nThe 18-year-old Italian is literally that - Mercedes chose Antonelli to make his debut this season after the seven-time champion informed them of his desire to move to Ferrari for 2025 before last season had even started.\nBut Antonelli's point is that he wants to make his own mark in F1.\n\"I don't feel like his replacement,\" Antonelli told BBC Sport. \"I just feel like a Mercedes F1 driver.\n\"But it's such a great opportunity. I am really grateful for the trust and opportunity Mercedes gave me. But at the same time, it is a big responsibility as well, because I am racing for Mercedes, top team, and so they've got some expectations as well, of course. I am just going to try to make the best out of this.\"\nStepping into the car vacated by the most successful F1 driver of all time, for a record-breaking team, appears daunting on paper. No pressure, as they might say.\nBut so far Antonelli seems to be taking it in his stride. He is, as his team-mate George Russell says, remarkably mature for an 18-year-old.\n\"I really want to start with a nice rhythm and build from there and be consistent,\" he says. \"And what I don't want to do is, like, big mistake. Because when you do a big mistake, you do a few steps back and then to recover it takes a little time.\"\nAntonelli is a name that has been doing the rounds in F1 for a while. He has for some time been regarded as one of the most prodigious talents in motorsport.\nHe joined Mercedes' youth programme at the age of 11 and was promoted to F1 after just one season in Formula 2.\nPeople who have worked with him have spoken in awed tones about the level of his talent, about how he could be the next big thing.\nAs such, the expectation was that he would make it to F1 before too long. But even he has been surprised by how quickly he has been parachuted into a top team.\n\"If you had asked me this four years ago, I would have said, 'this is crazy, not happening',\" he says. \"Maybe a bit later. If you think, not even four years ago, three and a half years ago, I was still in karting. Of course F1 was always my big dream but I wouldn't have imagined I would get here so quickly but I am super-happy and it is a dream come true.\"\nThis video can not be played\nAntonelli was 'really nervous' ahead of driving test\nHis promotion is a consequence of Hamilton's decision to leave Mercedes, which forced the hand of team principal Toto Wolff.\nWolff could still have farmed Antonelli out to another team to gain experience for a couple of years, as he did with Russell at Williams from 2019-21.\nIn the end, Wolff preferred to simply throw Antonelli in at the deep end, prepare him well with thousands of kilometres of testing in old cars, and trust his talent.\nWolff has said he expects mistakes, and that it is Mercedes' job to help Antonelli develop. And the driver - who crashed heavily on his second flying lap when given an outing in practice at last year's Italian Grand Prix - is aware of the responsibility.\n\"I want to have a clean run, nice rhythm, consistent,\" he says. \"But the mindset is going to be the same, going on track and try to win, try to be as fast as possible, try to get as best result as possible.\"\nAntonelli's talent is not the only reason he has stood out. There is also his name.\nHe is known universally in F1 as \"Kimi\", probably because his middle name carries obviously heavy resonance.\nBut although there is motorsport in the family - father Marco is a sports car racer - Antonelli says he was not named after Finnish 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen.\n\"Basically, my parents wanted to give me a second name that would fit well with the first name and the surname, but they didn't want a second Italian name,\" he says. \"They wanted something di\ufb00erent.\n\"A really good friend of ours, his name is Enrico Bertaggia, he has a background of racing. (Bertaggia was entered in eight grands prix for back-of-the-grid teams between 1989-92). He decided to name me Kimi. My parents said: 'Yeah, it sounds great.' And so I got named.\"\nAntonelli says he understands why everyone calls him Kimi, rather than his actual first name.\n\"It is more natural,\" he says. \"It is nice and short. Especially in the world of racing, it is such an iconic name.\n\"My best friends, my close friends, they all call me Andrea. Also my family.\"\nRemarkably, Antonelli was born five years after Fernando Alonso made his debut in F1 in 2001, and the two will be on the same grid as each other this year.\nAntonelli says it is \"a privilege\" to share the F1 grid with drivers such as Hamilton and Alonso.\nAnd there are other historical resonances about Antonelli. He says his hero growing up was three-time world champion Ayrton Senna, and coincidentally there is something of the legendary Brazilian in Antonelli's looks.\n\"Yeah, (people) told me that,\" he says. \"I don't really like being compared because I think you know every person has his own personality but he is my idol, he is my reference, so it would be cool just to achieve even little part of what he achieved in his whole career.\"\nWho will win F1 drivers' title?

        "article_text": "The rise of online auction app Vinted and people eager to find bargains has seen a rocketing rise in fashion sustainability - but one textile waste sorting centre said it has seen more garments than ever being discarded. \nSome 15,500 tonnes of clothing came through the doors at SWD Clothing site in Bolton, Greater Manchester, last year. \nThe estimated 60 million clothes come in from charity shops and local authority textile bins across the region, but there are fears a growing amount cannot be recycled.\nThe reason is thought to be the rise of so-called fast fashion, the mass production and sale of low quality and cheaply-made clothing closely following the latest trends.\nSWD Clothing said fast fashion is having a major impact on business because these garments are not designed to last as long as regular items and, by the same token, are not designed to be recycled.\nSo what happens to the clothes and what can we do to help promote better habits?\nMany people imagine most old clothes being recycled in the same way we recycle plastic but SWD said it is not that simple. Clothes listed as \"recycled polyester\" in the shops are most likely made up of recycled plastic bottles rather than old clothing.\nPeter Page, head of recycling and sustainability, said: \"It's very difficult because clothing is not designed to be recycled. It's designed to be bought, to be worn and then to be thrown away.\"\nHe explained that for textile recycling you mostly rely on single fibre materials but the use of synthetic materials in most fast fashion items makes that difficult.\nWorkers grade the clothing by quality, category and colour and the clothes need to be clean and dry to get reused or recycled.\nMr Page said that 75 per cent of the clothing that comes through the centre can be reused and is sold to wholesalers across the world.\nClothes that get sent for recycling are also used for carpet underlay, noise insulation or wiping cloths for the oil and gas industry, while new ideas are always being explored.\nThen, about three per cent of the clothes that are not fit for reuse or recycling are sent for incineration.\nSWD is getting busier every year, Mr Page said, but the quality of the clothes coming in makes it harder for them to reuse. \nQuite a lot. Among them, Valery Touchet started free classes to teach people how to sew and repurpose old clothes instead of throwing them out.\nMs Touchet said she had noticed the tradition of hand-me-down clothes she grew up with had changed to a culture of simply \"buying and throwing\".\n\"I just thought if I could educate people on how to reuse what they have already instead of buying new, that would help,\" she said.\nThe classes have brought together women from all different backgrounds, many who said they valued the \"sisterhood\" they had built as well as the new skills they have learned.\nMeanwhile, the Manchester Fashion Movement is helping to educate people about sustainable fashion by going into schools, hosting panel talks and organising pop-up exhibitions and fashion shows with an educational message.\nAlison Carlin said she wanted to \"champion local northern talent\" and send people away from her events \"with knowledge they can go on to discuss\". \nThrowing clothes into household waste bins means they are likely to end up in landfill.\nDisposing of clothes in a local authority textile bin located at recycling centres across the region or taking them to charity shops is the best way to prevent this.\nHowever, Dr Patsy Perry, reader in fashion marketing at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) acknowledged how hard it is to be sustainable amid the temptation to buy new clothes advertised more vividly than ever online.\n\"The best thing we can do is wear what we already own,\" she said.\n\"Don't buy new things if you are only going to wear them once, and there are other solutions like charity shopping or even luxury resellers to explore.\"\nMs Touchet agreed, adding: \"Look through your wardrobe, there is always something [to recycle].\"\n\"If you don't know how to go about it, that's where I come in, to help you refashion, reuse them and repurpose. \n\"If it was a dress before we can turn it into a blouse, or a top and a skirt.\"\nA project by MMU has been collecting surplus clothing from across Greater Manchester, looking at whether the textiles are reusable, reusable but low quality, or non-reusable.\nMore than half the textiles in the sample were categorised as high-quality reusable, a small proportion were low quality but reusable, and less than a third were non reusable.\nAs part of the project, textiles that come through the Bolton sorting centre are being scanned to find out the material composition.\nThe hope is that the results will work out how many of the garments could be recycled into new textiles or other uses - in order to ensure fewer clothes go to waste.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.",

        "summary": "Agency workers to get paid if shift cancelled at short notice2 days agoShareSaveZoe ConwayEmployment correspondent, BBC NewsShareSaveGetty ImagesAgency workers who choose to be on zero-hour contracts will be eligible for compensation if their shifts are cancelled or changed at short notice, the BBC understands.There are around one million agency staff in the UK, working across areas such as warehouses, in hospitality and within the NHS.The policy comes as part of some 250 additions to the Employment Rights Bill which are set to be outlined, although the amendment on compensation will not spell out what \"short notice\" means.New rules under the bill will also mean that agency workers will have to be offered a contract guaranteeing a minimum number of hours each week.While unions welcomed the inclusion of agency workers in the ban, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), which represents the sector, said the change should not \"undermine\" the \"flexibility\" that zero-hour contracts offer some workers.The Labour government pledged last year to ban \"exploitative zero-hours contracts\" as part of the Employment Rights Bill.The minimum hours offered in a contract to agency workers will be calculated according to the average number of hours they normally work.The BBC understands that the government is yet to decide whether this will be based on a 12-week reference period or longer.Trade unions have been campaigning for agency workers to be included in the legislative changes to prevent employers getting round the proposed zero hours rules by hiring agency staff. Paul Novak, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the government was right to close this \"loophole\".He said agency workers \"make up a significant proportion of the zero-hours workforce and need protections from bad working practices too\".But the REC said it was concerned about the change.Its deputy chief executive, Kate Shoesmith, said people choose agency work \"for the flexibility it provides at a time and stage in their life\" and that the new rules must not undermine that.She added that time should be given \"to ensure any legislative changes do not conflict with existing and hard-won protections for agency workers\". 'Fire and rehire'Other amendments being tabled are expected to include the doubling of the penalty imposed on companies that engage in so-called \"fire and rehire'' practices.This means that if they fail to properly consult employees before dismissing and then rehiring them on less favourable terms, they could be forced to pay the worker 180 days' worth of pay in compensation up from the current 90-day penalty payment.The amendments also contain a commitment to extend sick pay to workers earning under \u00a3123 a week from the first day of their illness.They will be entitled to 80% of their average weekly earnings or statutory sick pay - which is currently \u00a3116.75 per week \u2013 whichever is lowest.Currently, to qualify for statutory sick pay, a worker must have been ill for three days in a row.There will also be changes to rules around trade union recognition and the ability of unions to take industrial action.The government is proposing that workers will have to give their employers 10 days' warning of any strike action \u2013 rather than the existing 14 days' notice.Currently, there can be a ballot for union recognition if 10% of the workforce is a member of a union.The government had been consulting on lowering it to 2% but the proposed amendment will not state a figure and will simply give the secretary of state the power to lower the 10% threshold.Mr Novak said the changes were about ''creating a modern economy that works for workers and business alike'' and that driving up standards \"will stop good employers from being undercut by the bad, and will mean more workers benefit from a union voice\".Several business groups have been critical of the government for not providing more detail about how the legislation will work in practice.They are unlikely to be satisfied by what is in the amendments.Martin McTague, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the majority of the trade association's members were \"very concerned\" about the Employment Rights Bill.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nNo-one can predict the score - Arteta\nEindhoven has been packed with carnival-goers in recent days but on Tuesday it was Arsenal enjoying their own party in the city, getting over their goalscoring crisis and setting a Champions League record in the process.\nMikel Arteta's side became the first team in Champions League history to score seven goals away from home in the knockout stages of the competition as they romped to a 7-1 win over PSV Eindhoven.\nIt was the most goals the Gunners have scored in a single game since beating Newcastle 7-3 in the Premier League 13 years ago.\nThe Arsenal manager said the win had given his players \"joy and confidence and belief\", but was not getting carried away when questions were put to him about the records that his team had broken.\n\"For sure, it's something that hasn't been done, so great to be part of that,\" Arteta said. \"But as a team we want to achieve many other things that are far more important than that.\n\"The happiest thing is we are in a very strong position to go to the next round, which is where we want to be.\n\"But there's still a job to do in London in a week's time.\"\nAfter failing to score in their past two games, a 0-0 draw at Nottingham Forest and 1-0 defeat by West Ham, Arteta may not have seen a victory like this coming. \n\"This will give them great confidence for the rest of the season. Right from the start Arsenal had control of the game,\" said Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Arsenal were ruthless with their finishing, some of the combination play in the final third was sensational.\n\"Martin Odegaard looked back to his best. To a man they were really strong and that centre-back pairing [Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba] is phenomenal.\n\"Arsenal will take some stopping in this competition.\"\nEngland and Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice was one of the players singled out for his performance during the game and said that the Gunners have got the reward for their hard work in recent weeks.\nRice, who had a goal ruled out for offside, said Arsenal were \"fluid\" and possessed the \"enthusiasm, drive and hunger\" that the knockout stages demand.\n\"But we've been playing like this all season,\" he added. \"We feel we've been playing well as a team. Sometimes we score five, sometimes two, sometimes we don't score but [on Tuesday] we did well. It all clicked.\"\nArsenal's lack of a recognised striker has been well documented, with Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz both injured. But six different players contributed to the rout on Tuesday - Odegaard scored twice, along with goals for Jurrien Timber, Mikel Merino, Ethan Nwaneri, Leandro Trossard and Riccardo Calafiori.\nThe emphatic win means that Arsenal can start planning for a trip to Madrid, as they are set to take on the winner of the tie between Real and Atletico, which finished 2-1 to Carlo Ancelotti's side. Next week's second leg takes place at Atletico.\nEthan Nwaneri scored his eighth goal of the season\nArsenal's excellent 17-year-old Nwaneri again showed why there is so much hype and excitement about his future in the game.\nThe academy graduate has been given the task of filling in for Bukayo Saka on the right hand side of Arsenal's attack while the England international is out injured. The teenager has repaid that faith in him with eight goals in 28 games in all competitions.\nThat goal return puts him alongside some of England's most iconic young players.\nMichael Owen and Wayne Rooney scored nine goals each in all competitions when they were aged 17 or younger and Nwaneri now has 16 days before his 18th birthday to try to match or beat that record.\n\"I don't think that he needs any pushing. You see every time what the intention is,\" Arteta said. \"If it comes, it comes and it's great.\n\"I'm really impressed with the way he behaved and the way he played. It's about consistency and now doing it again three days later in another big stadium.\" \nNwaneri also became the third youngest player to score a goal in a knockout stage match in the Champions League after Bojan in April 2008 (17 and 217 days) and Jude Bellingham in April 2021 (17 and 289 days).\n\"He's 17 years old and he's on the biggest stage,\" Rice said.\n\"We've taken [the youngsters] under our wing and they deserve to be playing. You should see them train they way they have no fear and want to perform.\n\"Even if Saka was here Ethan would be still getting minutes because he's that good and works so hard in training. We have so many top young players.\"\nThis video can not be played\nDevastating Arsenal can win Champions League - Sutton\nNwaneri was joined in the starting XI by his team-mate from the academy Myles Lewis-Skelly and the 18-year-old also impressed despite being withdrawn in the first half to avoid him getting sent off.\nLewis-Skelly, who had been booked earlier, put in a late tackle on Richard Ledezma and although he was unpunished, Arteta substituted him moments later.\n\"They play like they have been here for many years,\" captain Odegaard said.\n\"So much quality and confidence, they're ready for it. I'm not worried about them, we enjoy having them in the team and they have a great attitude.\"\nOdegaard, who himself started playing senior football at 15 years old, believes that Lewis-Skelly can use his early withdrawal as a learning experience.\n\"He took that really well,\" he added. \"He knew it was a tricky position to be in. He was on a yellow and had a tough challenge too. He took it well  and we're all there to support and I'm sure he will learn from that too.\"\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\nGet Arsenal news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nJonas turned professional in 2017 and has won 16 fights, lost two and drawn one \nNatasha Jonas v Lauren Price\nVenue: Royal Albert Hall, London Date: Friday, 7 March\nCoverage: Follow live text commentary from 20:00 GMT and radio coverage from 21:00 on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Sounds, BBC Sport website & app\nSetbacks lead to comebacks. Ages like a fine wine. A happy fighter is a dangerous fighter. Natasha Jonas' career lends itself to plenty of overused boxing cliches.\nA pioneer of women's boxing for more than a decade, the 40-year-old headlines an all-female card at London's iconic Royal Albert Hall on Friday.\nJonas will put her WBC and IBF welterweight titles on the line against Wales' WBA champion Lauren Price.\nPrice, 30, is the unbeaten Olympic golden girl brimming with confidence. To use another stock sporting phrase, she predicts a passing of the torch.\nLet's not write Liverpool's history-maker off just yet, though.\nToxteth-born Jonas was the first British female to ever box at an Olympic Games. She has overcome injuries, disappointing defeats and juggled boxing with motherhood.\nThrough stellar punditry work or as the first black woman to obtain a British Boxing Board of Control manager's licence, Jonas continues to make waves outside the ring too.\nBut her life could easily have panned out very differently. Speaking to BBC Sport, Jonas reflects on the 'sliding doors' moments which led to her becoming a two-weight world champion.\nJonas v Price - All you need to know\nBelfast, New York & plenty of controversy\nJonas caught the sporting bug as a four-year-old watching the Seoul 1988 Olympics. \nAlthough her memory of those Games is somewhat patchy, she remembers \"being overwhelmed and excited by all the sport that was happening\". \nTwo decades later she was nicknamed 'Miss GB' for her own Olympic appearance.\nWhen Jonas qualified for London 2012 at an event in China, she shared a heartwarming moment with her mother. \n\"That's when Mum told me at the airport how proud she was and that when I was a little girl, watching the Olympics on TV, I told her one day I wanted to be there,\" Jonas adds.\n\"Sometimes kids have big ideas. Sometimes life and the world gets in the way. But after 24 years and trying hundreds of sports, I got there.\n\"So looking back, I could say the '88 Games was the most pivotal event of my career.\"\nThis video can not be played\nIQ, speed & accuracy - why Jonas is confident for Price bout\nAs a teenager, Jonas dreamed of representing her country on the global stage, but not as a pugilist.\n\"I watched Rachel Yankey and Mia Hamm and always thought 'I'm a well better footballer',\" she says.\nJonas is \"not the most academic\" but buckled down to earn a football scholarship at St Peter's College in New Jersey.\n\"America was the place to be,\" she says, with only a handful of English women's football teams operating at a professional level at the time. \nBut a budding football career was cut devastatingly short when Jonas tore her cruciate ligament while in the States. \n\"If my injury hadn't have happened I definitely wouldn't be getting punched in the face for a living. It was a big turning point,\" Jonas adds.\nHer sister, Nikita Parris, has 72 caps for England and was part of the 2022 Euros winning squad.\nAsked if she would swap her career for a major trophy, Jonas replies: \"I'd rather go on to become an undisputed boxing world champion than a football World Cup winner.\"\nJonas is trained by Joe Gallagher, who has trained six world champions, including Liam Smith\nWhen Jonas returned to England she lost friendship groups made through football and, with her knee in a brace, began to put on weight.\nShe briefly worked in call centres but was sacked from all seven jobs.\n\"Now looking back as an adult, I recognise that I was depressed,\" Jonas says. \"I lost my identity. Everyone said I was going to play for Liverpool and England but now I was no longer 'Tasha the footballer' but just Tasha.\"\nIn a bid to regain her fitness, Jonas, aged 21, stepped into the legendary Rotunda Amateur Boxing Gym.\n\"All the lads were like 'who is she?'. They weren't used to having a girl in their gym,\" she recalls.\n\"After a warm-up, the coach asked us to get into pairs to do bags. I thought I'd be the little girl who is last to be picked, like when I used to play football with my cousins.\"\nInstead, Jonas was greeted by the kindness of future light-middleweight world champion Liam Smith - one of the popular boys in the gym. When he saw a deflated Jonas put her head down, he offered to partner up.\n\"I don't know if I would or wouldn't have stuck it out if he hadn't done that, but one little gesture from Liam made such a difference - there was no more awkwardness in the gym after that,\" Jonas adds.\nJonas beat American Quanitta Underwood at London 2012 but missed out on a medal after losing to Katie Taylor in the quarter-finals\nJonas called time on her amateur career in 2014 with a record of 57 wins and 26 defeats. She gave birth to her daughter, Mila, and was happy to never box again.\nThat soon changed after the pro debut of a trailblazing Irishwoman and a phone call from a former Team GB team-mate.\n\"I did some punditry work for Katie Taylor's debut and Tom Stalker phoned me afterwards,\" Jonas explains.\n\"He said there will be a lot of opportunity for pro females now and asked if I'd ever think of coming back? I said 'shut up, Tom'.\"\nJonas says she was \"happy with her routine\". Mila had turned two and was in nursery and the media work was keeping her busy.\nBut Stalker's words kept ringing in her ear. After speaking to her immediate family, Jonas realised the boxing fire was still burning.\n\"I phoned two cousins, my mum and dad,\" Jonas adds. \"I trusted their judgement and they knew the good and bad side to boxing. \n\"They were there for me when I cried for two days, after losing to Katie in the amateurs. \n\"But they all gave me their support and said I had nothing to worry about, especially as far as the baby is concerned.\"\nTurning pro was a decision that paid off. In February 2022, Jonas stopped Chris Namus to become light-middleweight world champion and has since won all five world-title level fights.\n\"If I could go back and talk to myself in some of those hardest moments earlier in life, I'd say 'chin up, kid, it all works out in the end',\" she says.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "China has set an economic growth target for this year of \"around 5%\" and pledged to pump billions of dollars into its ailing economy, which is now facing a trade war with the US.\nIts leaders unveiled the plan as thousands of delegates attend the National People's Congress, a rubber-stamp parliament, which passes decisions already made behind closed doors.\nBut the week-long gathering is closely watched for clues on Beijing's policy changes - and this year is more significant than most.\nPresident Xi Jinping had already been battling persistently low consumption, a property crisis and unemployment, before Donald Trump's new 10% levy on Chinese imports came into effect on Tuesday.\nThis follows the 10% tariff imposed in early February, taking the total US levy to 20%. And it hits what has been a rare bright spot for the Chinese economy: exports. \nBeijing hit back almost immediately on Tuesday, just as it did last month. It announced retaliatory action that included 10%-15% tariffs on certain agriculture imports from the US. This is key because China is the biggest market for these goods, such as American corn, wheat and soybeans.\nAt the opening of this week's meeting, known as Two Sessions, China vowed to make domestic demand the \"main engine and anchor\" of its economic growth.\nBeijing was able to meet its 5% target for the last two years but growth was driven by strong exports, which resulted in a nearly trillion-dollar record trade surplus. \nRepeating that is going to be much harder this year. \n\"If the tariffs linger, Chinese exports to the US could drop by a quarter to a third,\" said Harry Murphy Cruise, head of China economics at Moody's Analytics. \nBeijing is going to have to rely more than ever on domestic spending to achieve 5% growth - but that has been one of its biggest challenges. \nOn Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said consumption has been sluggish and pledged to \"vigorously boost\" household demand.\n\"Domestically, the foundation for China's sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough.\"\n\"Internationally, changes unseen in a century are unfolding across the world at a faster pace,\" Li said, as he noted the rise of protectionism around the world.\nBeijing has already rolled out schemes to encourage its people to spend more, including allowing them to trade in and replace consumer goods like kitchen appliances, cars, phones and electronic devices. \nThe government now aims to put more money into ordinary Chinese people's pockets and help cut the country's reliance on exports and investment.\nBeijing's plans include issuing 1.3 trillion yuan ($179bn; \u00a3140bn) in special treasury bonds this year to help fund its stimulus measures. Local governments will also be allowed to increase the amount of money they borrow to 4.4 trillion yuan, up from 3.9 trillion yuan, according to the annual \"Work Report\". \nIn a rare move, Beijing raised its fiscal deficit - the difference between the government's spending and revenue - by one percentage point to 4% of gross domestic product (GDP), the highest level in decades.\nThe hike signals Beijing's commitment to increase spending to shore up growth. It has long sought to keep the deficit at or below 3% of GDP to demonstrate fiscal discipline. \nIt also announced plans to create more than 12 million jobs in cities, setting a target for urban unemployment at around 5.5% for 2025. The figure stood at 5.1% last year.\nThe government also pledged to provide more support to high-tech industries, restore stability in the property market, and expand elderly care programmes for its ageing population.\nWhether these measures will be enough to boost consumption is the key question.\nHarsh pandemic-era restrictions along with a prolonged real estate crisis and a government crackdown on tech and finance companies have fuelled pessimism among Chinese people. And a weak social safety net means savings have become especially crucial in case of unexpected out-of-pocket expenses.   \nBut China's leadership is optimistic. CPCC spokesman Liu Jieyi told reporters ahead of the session that while the economy was facing challenges such as low demand, it was \"important to recognise that China's economic fundamentals are stable, there are many advantages, resilience is strong, and potential is significant\".\nInvestment in what President Xi calls \"high-quality development\", which covers high-tech industries from renewables to artificial intelligence (AI), is also expected to be a major focus.\nThe world's second-largest economy, China has long vied to become a global leader in tech, partly to reduce its reliance on the West.\nState media has already touted recent examples like DeepSeek and Unitree Robotics, both of which have caught global attention, as examples of China's \"technological progress\". \nThe success of DeepSeek in particular saw an AI-driven stock rally, with analysts noting renewed interest in China among foreign investors. \nA commentary in the state-run Xinhua newspaper said \"China's new energy industries and overall green transition, driven by its cutting-edge technologies, will continue to be important growth drivers\". \nBut the new US levies - which come on top of tariffs from Trump's first term - could  stymie these plans, not least because they could dampen investor sentiment.\n\"The chaos that tariffs leave in their wake is kryptonite for investment,\" Mr Murphy Cruise says. \"Tariffs are set to deliver a one-two punch to China's economy, landing blows to both exports and investment.\"\nAlso on Wednesday, China announced a 7.2% increase in its national defence budget, the same rate of growth as last year.\nAdditional reporting by Jo\u00e3o da Silva",

        "article_text": "When Luna Sofia Miranda approached Sean Baker in a strip club in New York in 2022, she tried her best to charm him.\nBut he \"very clearly did not want to buy a lap dance,\" she says.\nMiranda, who was 23 at the time, started asking why he and his wife were there.\n\"I'm very nosy,\" she says. \"So I kept asking them questions and I finally got it out of them. They were making a film about strippers.\"\nShe told them she had studied acting, and - after a successful audition - got a call on her 24th birthday, to offer her a part in the film.\nThat film, Anora, is now seen as one of the frontrunners heading into the Oscars on Sunday.\nIt's directed by Baker, and stars Mikey Madison, who plays a New York stripper.\nSince publication of this article, Anora won best picture at the Oscars and Madison won best actress.\nMadison, 25, relied on real-life strippers to help her perfect the part.\nWhen she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.\n\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.\nThey \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.\nWe've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.\nSome praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".\nEdie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.\nTurquet, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.\nShe got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.\n\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.\n\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"\nTurquet points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.\n\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"\nBut when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.\n\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"\nBaker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.\nShe says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.\nThey connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.\nIn the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nMiranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.\n\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.\nOne of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"\nThis section contains spoilers for Anora\nMiranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.\n\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.\n\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"\nTurquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.\n\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.\n\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"\nBut overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.\n\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.\n\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"\nShe said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".\n\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"\n\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"\nFor Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.\n\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\" \nFor Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.\nIn the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.\nWe also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.\n\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.\n\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"\nWhen Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.\nFootage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.\n\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.\nNow, all eyes are on the Oscars.\nMiranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.\n\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"\nShe said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.\n\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.\n\"If this film wins an Oscar, I want to see that.\"",

        "article_text": "\"China will fight to the bitter end of any trade war,\" the foreign ministry spokesperson in Beijing declared, after China announced tit-for-tat tariffs on agricultural imports from the US.\nThis came within minutes of a new 10% US levy on Chinese imports that came into effect on Tuesday - which adds to existing tariffs both from Trump's first term and those announced last month.\nBut China's latest retaliatory measures are an opening swing, not a direct punch.\nIt shows some strength, and it has the potential to sting parts of the United States, but also leaves room to negotiate or escalate if necessary.\n\"We advise the US to put away its bullying face and return to the right track of dialogue and co-operation before it is too late,\" foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian added.\nThis is the second round of tariffs the two countries have imposed on each other since February. But this time China is hitting Donald Trump where it has the potential to hurt - by targeting farmers, who are some of his core supporters.\nAlmost 78% of farming-dependent counties in the US endorsed Mr Trump in 2024.\nChina is one of their biggest customers for produce such as chicken, beef, pork and soybeans and now all those products will face a 10-15% tax which will come into effect on 10 March.\n\"The tariffs are broadly negative for US agricultural markets. It is going to have a bearish influence on prices. There are enough corn and soybean supplies in the world for China to make a switch, it is more of an issue for the US, because 30% of US soybeans still go to China,\" Ole Houe, of Ikon commodities, told Reuters news agency.\nBeijing may hope that this will apply some pressure on the Trump administration ahead of any potential negotiations.\nThe latest announcements raise the prospect of an all-out trade war between the world's top two economies and in various ministry statements, China is making two things very clear.\nFirstly, it is prepared to continue to fight.\n\"Pressure, coercion and threats are not the right way to deal with the Chinese side,\" said Mr Lin.\nBut secondly, it is also willing to talk.\nBeijing is not ramping up the rhetoric or the tariffs in the same way it did in 2018, during the last Trump administration. Back then it imposed a tariff of 25% on US soybeans.\n\"China's tariffs impact a limited number of US products, and remain below the 20% level. This is by design. China's government is signalling that they do not want to escalate, they want to de-escalate,\" according to Even Pay, an analyst with Trivium China.\nThe prospect of talks was raised last month. The White House said there would be a call between President Xi and Donald Trump. That never happened.\nSo will these talks take place and who will make the first move?\nChina is unlikely to want to go first. It will not want to be seen kowtowing to Washington.\nAnd in contrast to Canada and Mexico, Beijing has not announced new measures to target the flow of fentanyl. It simply repeated past statements that fentanyl is a \"US problem\" and that China has the strictest drug policies in the world.\nOn Tuesday, the State Council released a White Paper titled \"Controlling Fentanyl-related substances - China's contribution\".\nIt outlines the measures Beijing says it has already made to crack down on Fentanyl-related crimes and the precursor chemicals used to make the drug. It adds that it is \"diligently fulfilling international drug control obligations\".\nSo, while China hasn't picked up the phone to Washington, this document forms part of the country's message which appears to be saying - we are already doing what we can on fentanyl.\nDespite stating that China \"will not yield\", these latest tariffs are bound to sting.\nThe cumulative 20% tax on all Chinese goods comes on top of a slew of tariffs Trump imposed in his first term on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports. And China's population is already concerned about a sluggish economy.\nThousands of delegates are gathering in the capital this week to take part in an annual parliamentary session, most of which will focus on the economy.\nHouse prices are still falling, and youth unemployment remains stubbornly high. A potential trade war with the US could prompt more money worries for businesses and consumers across the country at a time when the Communist Party wants people to spend to help the economy to grow.\nBut Beijing will also see an opportunity as Donald Trump sows uncertainty among his international allies. \nIt can partly place the blame for any further economic woes at Washington's door and state that it's the fault of the US for starting a trade war.\nThe state media outlet Xinhua has in recent days released a series of parodies poking fun at a United States that is prepared to tax its allies and neighbours. The skits portray Washington as a bully echoing the words coming from the leaders of Canada and Mexico.\nAt the same time, China's Commerce Ministry has reiterated that it is prepared to work with other countries around the world to combat Mr Trump's tariffs.\nBeijing appears to be looking for potential allies in this trade war while also trying to cast Washington as a troublemaker who is prepared to target friends and foes alike.\nAll at a time when Donald Trump's \"America First\" doctrine has many in Europe and the UK wondering if the US-led world order is already in doubt.",

But this time China is hitting Donald Trump where it has the potential to hurt - by targeting farmers, who are some of his core supporters.Almost 78% of farming-dependent counties in the US endorsed Mr Trump in 2024.China is one of their biggest customers for produce such as chicken, beef, pork and soybeans and now all those products will face a 10-15% tax which will come into effect on 10 March.ReutersWill talks take place between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping? There are enough corn and soybean supplies in the world for China to make a switch, it is more of an issue for the US, because 30% of US soybeans still go to China,\" Ole Houe, of Ikon commodities, told Reuters news agency.Beijing may hope that this will apply some pressure on the Trump administration ahead of any potential negotiations.China eyes 5% growth target as it reels from Trump tariffsWhat are tariffs and why is Trump using them?The latest announcements raise the prospect of an all-out trade war between the world's top two economies and in various ministry statements, China is making two things very clear.Firstly, it is prepared to continue to fight. It adds that it is \"diligently fulfilling international drug control obligations\".So, while China hasn't picked up the phone to Washington, this document forms part of the country's message which appears to be saying - we are already doing what we can on fentanyl.Money worriesDespite stating that China \"will not yield\", these latest tariffs are bound to sting.The cumulative 20% tax on all Chinese goods comes on top of a slew of tariffs Trump imposed in his first term on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports. The skits portray Washington as a bully echoing the words coming from the leaders of Canada and Mexico.At the same time, China's Commerce Ministry has reiterated that it is prepared to work with other countries around the world to combat Mr Trump's tariffs.Beijing appears to be looking for potential allies in this trade war while also trying to cast Washington as a troublemaker who is prepared to target friends and foes alike.All at a time when Donald Trump's \"America First\" doctrine has many in Europe and the UK wondering if the US-led world order is already in doubt.AsiaTrump tariffsChinaDonald Trump",

And, so far in the Six Nations, he has been one of England's big plus points.\nStuart and his front-row colleagues are in profit in the tournament, winning five scrum penalties and conceded three across their face-offs with Ireland, France and Scotland - a stat few would have predicted after their struggles in New Zealand.\n\"We have taken a step forward from last summer,\" he adds.\n\"We came into the autumn, we were very clean, good on our own ball, we were trying to be square and rock solid.\n\"Now there is a big onus on trying to take another step forward - to being dominant.\"\nStuart has been helped by the lingering effects of a 2022 elbow dislocation finally dissipating.\nBut that scrum supremacy is also closer thanks to a more collaborative approach in training.\nThis video can not be played\nSinging Adele & cracking jokes - Joe Marler\u2019s hilarious BBC Sport debut\nThe focus has shifted from scrapping for starting spots to laying waste to England's opponents.\n\"When you come in this environment you are competing with other lads to try to play,\" Stuart says.\n\"Scrums are very competitive, combative places and it can end up being messy and a bit of a 'man test', with stuff going on the floor. That is not really how you want to train.\n\"You want to train so that everyone gets better \u2013 keeping scrums off the deck and not wasting any reps. It was something that Coley [Dan Cole] spoke about in the summer. Ever since then we have been training very purposefully,\n\"It is still competitive, but you realise there is no point collapsing in a scrum in training when you are about to get sent backwards. It is about taking your medicine, keeping it up, being clean.\n\"It feels like the group has all bought into it. It feels like a big shift in that regard.\"\nIt is perhaps not a surprise this collective approach has brought the best out of Stuart.\nA 2022 elbow dislocation, suffered the week after scoring two tries against New Zealand, set back Stuart's international progress\nThere have been some big characters among England's biggest men in recent years, with Joe Marler, who retired in the autumn, the most notable. Vice-captain Ellis Genge speaks his mind to those inside and outside the camp, while former skipper Jamie George is still a key leader. Even Cole has his own podcast.\nStuart, who will end the Six Nations on 50 caps if he plays against Italy and Wales, prefers a lower profile.\n\"I am pretty awful,\" he smiles. \"How can I put this? I am not the most sociable person, I am a bit of a hermit.\n\"I live in a little village outside of Bath and it is very quiet, which is my set-up and how I like it.\"\nIt is getting difficult for him to escape the hubbub though.\nHis form, and Ireland tight-head Tadhg Furlong's injury run, has put him firmly into Lions contention.\nStuart would be a first-time tourist - his Lions memories don't stretch as far back as his books.\nHe remembers watching the 2013 trip to Australia at school and then, after turning professional, hearing Bath team-mate Jamie Roberts recount his experiences on repeat.\n\"He was always reminding everyone that he was the Lions man of the tour in 2009, he wouldn't stop going on about it,\" Stuart jokes. \"I think he made us watch his clips.\n\"I haven't really thought about it. After the last summer I just needed to knuckle down, game by game, and play well. I am just trying to stay along those lines.\"\nReading up on the past, while not reading too far into the future, has kept him well on course so far.",

Clothes listed as \"recycled polyester\" in the shops are most likely made up of recycled plastic bottles rather than old clothing.\nPeter Page, head of recycling and sustainability, said: \"It's very difficult because clothing is not designed to be recycled. It's designed to be bought, to be worn and then to be thrown away.\"\nHe explained that for textile recycling you mostly rely on single fibre materials but the use of synthetic materials in most fast fashion items makes that difficult.\nWorkers grade the clothing by quality, category and colour and the clothes need to be clean and dry to get reused or recycled.\nMr Page said that 75 per cent of the clothing that comes through the centre can be reused and is sold to wholesalers across the world.\nClothes that get sent for recycling are also used for carpet underlay, noise insulation or wiping cloths for the oil and gas industry, while new ideas are always being explored.\nThen, about three per cent of the clothes that are not fit for reuse or recycling are sent for incineration.\nSWD is getting busier every year, Mr Page said, but the quality of the clothes coming in makes it harder for them to reuse. \nQuite a lot. Among them, Valery Touchet started free classes to teach people how to sew and repurpose old clothes instead of throwing them out.\nMs Touchet said she had noticed the tradition of hand-me-down clothes she grew up with had changed to a culture of simply \"buying and throwing\".\n\"I just thought if I could educate people on how to reuse what they have already instead of buying new, that would help,\" she said.\nThe classes have brought together women from all different backgrounds, many who said they valued the \"sisterhood\" they had built as well as the new skills they have learned.\nMeanwhile, the Manchester Fashion Movement is helping to educate people about sustainable fashion by going into schools, hosting panel talks and organising pop-up exhibitions and fashion shows with an educational message.\nAlison Carlin said she wanted to \"champion local northern talent\" and send people away from her events \"with knowledge they can go on to discuss\". \nThrowing clothes into household waste bins means they are likely to end up in landfill.\nDisposing of clothes in a local authority textile bin located at recycling centres across the region or taking them to charity shops is the best way to prevent this.\nHowever, Dr Patsy Perry, reader in fashion marketing at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) acknowledged how hard it is to be sustainable amid the temptation to buy new clothes advertised more vividly than ever online.\n\"The best thing we can do is wear what we already own,\" she said.\n\"Don't buy new things if you are only going to wear them once, and there are other solutions like charity shopping or even luxury resellers to explore.\"\nMs Touchet agreed, adding: \"Look through your wardrobe, there is always something [to recycle].\"\n\"If you don't know how to go about it, that's where I come in, to help you refashion, reuse them and repurpose. \n\"If it was a dress before we can turn it into a blouse, or a top and a skirt.\"\nA project by MMU has been collecting surplus clothing from across Greater Manchester, looking at whether the textiles are reusable, reusable but low quality, or non-reusable.\nMore than half the textiles in the sample were categorised as high-quality reusable, a small proportion were low quality but reusable, and less than a third were non reusable.\nAs part of the project, textiles that come through the Bolton sorting centre are being scanned to find out the material composition.\nThe hope is that the results will work out how many of the garments could be recycled into new textiles or other uses - in order to ensure fewer clothes go to waste.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.",

        "article_text": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky travelled to Washington at the end of February expecting to sign a major deal with the US on the joint development of his country's mineral deposits. \nInstead, after an angry meeting with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance, Zelensky was told to leave and the deal was left unsigned.\nThe Ukrainian president has since said he is still willing to sign it, and Trump has also indicated the deal could still be on the table. \nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine. \nThis includes some 19m tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine has 7% of Europe's supplies of titanium, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations.\nIt is also home to a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries. \nOther elements found in Ukraine include beryllium and uranium, which are both crucial for nuclear weapons and reactors.\nDeposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt and manganese are also significant.\nFurther, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.\nSome of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nIn 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, as well as half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.\nDr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access to revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.\nCritical minerals \"are the foundation of the 21st Century economy\", Dr Muggah explained. They are key to renewable energy, military applications and industrial infrastructure and play \"a growing strategic role in geopolitics and geoeconomics\", he said.\nAdditionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine's mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group.\nIn December, China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year.\nSome commentators have described the US offer as \"colonial\", but Kyiv is interested in joint exploration of its resources.\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, Ukraine has about 20,000 mineral deposits covering 116 types, but only about 15% of sites were being actively exploited at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.\nFor instance, the country's sizeable lithium deposits are still largely untapped. Likewise, rare earth deposits are known to exist, but none of them have yet been mined, because of a lack of investment.\nDeveloping these mineral resources is extremely difficult and expensive, according to Iryna Suprun, chief executive of the Geological Investment Group, a mining advisory firm based in Ukraine. \nShe argues that if Ukraine can attract US investors to help develop its natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.\n\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\"\nTrump has also suggested the presence of US contractors in Ukraine would act as a security guarantee to deter Russian aggression in the future, but Ukraine and European leaders have insisted that would not be enough.

        "article_text": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau slammed Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on Canada, calling it a \"very dumb thing to do\" and vowed to conduct a \"relentless fight\" to protect its economy.\nTrump has imposed 25% tariffs on products entering the US from Canada and Mexico, and has increased a levy on goods coming from China.\nThe Canadian prime minister announced retaliatory tariffs on US exports and warned that a trade war would be costly for both countries.\nBut Trump pushed even further in a post on Truth Social, saying: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"\nTrudeau accused the US president of planning \"a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us\". \n\"That is never going to happen. We will never be the 51st state,\" he told reporters on Tuesday.\n\"This is a time to hit back hard and to demonstrate that a fight with Canada will have no winners.\"\nHe said that Canada's main goal remains to get the tariffs lifted so that they \"don't last a second longer than necessary\".\nTrump said he is protecting US jobs and manufacturing, and trying to prevent illegal migration and drug trafficking. The US president said his goal is to clamp down on the powerful opioid fentanyl; he has variously blamed the other countries for the drug's arrival in the US.\nResponding to the accusations, Trudeau said on Tuesday there was \"no justification\" for the new tariffs, because less than 1% of the fentanyl intercepted at the US border comes from Canada. \nTrudeau's words were echoed by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who said there was \"no motive, no reason, no justification\" for Trump's move. Speaking on Tuesday, she too vowed to issue her own \"tariff and non-tariff measures\" - but said further details would be given on Sunday.\nTrump's tariffs are likely to push up prices for consumers in the US and abroad, said John Rogers, an economics professor at American International University.\nThe items most likely to be affected the soonest are food - the fruits, vegetables and other produce the US imports from Mexico - followed by the large amounts of oil and gas imported from Canada, Prof Rogers said.\n\"Prices could go up pretty soon\", Prof Rogers warned, though he was reluctant to say by exactly how much or how quickly. \n\"We are in pretty uncharted territory,\" he told the BBC.\nThe bigger concern for prof Rogers was the potential damage he said was being done to America's longstanding trade partners.\n\"This is kind of sticking your finger in the eye of your neighbour,\" he said, adding that, in a potential US-Canada-Mexico trade war, \"everybody is a loser\".\nThe three countries targeted are America's top trading partners, and the tit-for-tat measures also prompted fears of that very trade war. \n\"There's no way you can win a trade war. Everybody suffers, because everybody's just going to wind up paying higher prices and sacrificing quality,\" Prof Rogers said. \nTariffs are a tax on imports from other countries, designed to protect against cheaper competition from elsewhere, and boost businesses and jobs at home.\nCanada's retaliatory measures include a 25% reciprocal tariff that will be imposed on C$155bn (US$107bn; \u00a384bn) of American goods:\nCanada's Immigration Minister Marc Miller warned that as many as a million jobs in Canada were at risk if the tariffs were implemented, given how intertwined trade was between the two countries.\n\"We can't replace an economy that is responsible for 80% of our trade overnight and it's going to hurt,\" he said on Monday.\nSpeaking to the AFP news agency, a car manufacturing employee in the Canadian province of Ontario said people were indeed \"pretty scared\" of being laid off. \"I just bought my first house,\" Joel Soleski said. \"I might have to look for work elsewhere.\"\nThe sector is one that could be badly affected by the new tariffs regime in North America. Car parts may cross US-Canada border several times during the manufacturing process, and so might be taxed on multiple occasions.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford, whose province is home to Canada's auto manufacturing industry, told reporters on Tuesday that he anticipates assembly plants will \"shut down on both sides of the border\" as a result of the tariffs.\nThe tariffs were called \"reckless\" by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, whose president Candace Laing cautioned that the move would force both Canada and the US towards \"recession, job losses and economic disaster\".\nMs Laing warned they would also increase prices for Americans, and force US businesses to find alternate suppliers that she said \"are less reliable than Canadian ones\".\nCanadian provincial leaders have vowed their own responses. \nFord of Ontario mooted the possibility of cutting off Canadian electricity supplies and exports of high-grade nickel to the US, as well as putting an export levy of 25% on electricity sent to power homes in Michigan, New York and Minnesota.\nCanada exports enough electricity to power some six million American homes.\nOntario and other provinces have also moved to remove US-made liquor off their shelves. In Nova Scotia, Premier Tim Houston said his province will ban American companies from bidding on provincial contracts, as will Ontario. \nFord also announced that a C$100m ($68m; \u00a355.1) contract with Elon Musk's satellite internet company Starlink will be cancelled.\nMeanwhile China - which now faces tariffs of 20% after Trump doubled an earlier levy - has vowed to fight any trade war to the \"bitter end\". It has announced its own counter-measures - including tariffs on a range of US agricultural and food products.",

I didn't want to tread on any toes.\"\nGeorge says he consulted his father, uncle and wife on his decision, and not all of them thought he should continue his international career.\nLISTEN: Jamie George speaks to Rugby Union Weekly\n\"But ultimately it was 'what is your gut feel?\" George added. \"Initially I didn't know if I could go back, but I watched the Ireland game [this year's Six Nations opener which he missed through injury] and all I wanted to do was be back on that field because I missed it.\"\nUnder George, England finished third in the 2024 Six Nations, but then suffered a run of five successive defeats in matches against New Zealand, Australia and South Africa across the summer and autumn.\nEngland won five of 12 Tests under his stewardship.\nGeorge, who has picked up three Six Nations titles and played in the 2019 World Cup final, said head coach Steve Borthwick broke the news to him over coffee in a \"pretty to-the-point\" conversation in St Albans.\n\"I think he was surprised by me questioning myself,\" added George. \"I think it would hit anyone hard.

It was a surprise.\"\nCarling questions quality of England coaches\nQuiet renaissance puts Stuart in Lions frame\nSix Nations fixtures, standings, try-scorers & coverage\nEngland vice-captains Ellis Genge and Jamie George lifted the Calcutta Cup with skipper Maro Itoje last month\nGeorge added that he would have preferred to have given more time to digest the news privately, with his conversation with Borthwick coming only a day before Itoje's promotion was made public.\nUpon his appointment, Itoje described George as \"a great friend and leader\" who had led the team \"brilliantly\", while Borthwick explained that having a skipper who was on the pitch for 80 minutes, rather than, like most front rows, replaced midway through the second half, was one factor in his decision.\nGeorge said he is now taking inspiration from cricketer Joe Root, who was in a similar situation in 2022 when the England Test captaincy was passed to Ben Stokes.\n\"His batting improved significantly off the back of not being captain any more and he looked freed up and enjoying himself and still contributing a huge amount and them valuing his leadership,\" said George.\n\"I am not saying I am the Joe Root of the England rugby team, but I have taken inspiration from that.\"\nGeorge, who said the captaincy going to Itoje \"eased me a lot as I know how good Maro is\", is poised to win his 100th England cap in Sunday's match against Italy.\nThe Saracen replaced Luke Cowan-Dickie off the bench to help his team to nail-biting wins over France and Scotland in their past two matches.\nGeorge still has big ambitions in the sport and wants to go on a third British and Irish Lions tour this summer and represent England at the 2027 World Cup, both of which are in Australia.\nHe, along with fellow front row Ellis Genge, is now an England vice-captain.\nYou will be able to hear the whole interview on the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast with Chris Jones and Chris Ashton, which will be available to download from BBC Sounds first thing on Wednesday morning.\nThis video can not be played\nJamie George scores twice against Italy in February 2022\nGeorge made his England debut as a replacement for Tom Youngs in a 25-20 defeat by France before the 2015 World Cup.\nHe helped England win a Six Nations Grand Slam in 2016 and retain their title in 2017 as Eddie Jones' team went on a run of 18 successive Test victories - but all his appearances came from the bench as then captain Dylan Hartley dominated the number two shirt.\nInstead, George's first Test start came for the British and Irish Lions on their tour of New Zealand in the summer of 2017. George started all three matches against the All Blacks in a drawn series, before finally making his first England start against Samoa at Twickenham in November that year.\nGeorge made his England debut against France in 2015\n\"I never thought I would be here, ever, in a million years,\" he said. \"Genuinely it is surreal. I am blown away by it all.\n\"The whole journey has not been straightforward, but you sort of learn and you get your head down. I learnt pretty early on that I had to be resilient and toughen up a bit. I feel that I have done that well. \n\"I am as ambitious now as I was when I was 25 and I first came into the team.\"\nGeorge is poised to become the seventh male player to win 100 England caps after Ben Youngs (127), Dan Cole (118), Jason Leonard (114), Owen Farrell (112), Courtney Lawes (105) and Danny Care (101).",

Osborne, 23, has played on the wing for Leinster, but this will be his first time in the position at Test level.\nRonan Kelleher (neck) remains sidelined, so Rob Herring is set to make his first appearance of the tournament as replacement hooker with Dan Sheehan starting.\nGarry Ringrose's suspension means Bundee Aki returns to partner Robbie Henshaw in midfield, the latter switching to outside centre. \nFinlay Bealham returns at tight-head prop and Thomas Clarkson drops to the bench. Tadhg Furlong is still ruled out despite stepping up his rehabilitation from calf and hamstring injuries.\nLike Doris, Bealham and Jack Conan are set to win their 50th caps. Conan is one of six forwards named on the bench as Ireland opt to go for a 6-2 split for the first time this year.\n\"Caelan has done incredibly well to get back to full fitness,\" said Ireland interim boss Simon Easterby.\n\"It says a lot about him that he has done as many other players might not have been able to do that in such a short space of time.\"\nNtamack and Penaud return as France retain 7-1 bench\nSix Nations fixtures, standings, try-scorers & coverage\nEasterby backs 'fabulous' Osborne for wing role\nAfter announcing they will retire from Test rugby at the end of the tournament, Peter O'Mahony, Cian Healy and Conor Murray will play in their final home match.\nMunster flanker O'Mahony retains his place after starting against Scotland and Wales, while Healy and Murray are named on the bench.\n\"This weekend gives the Irish public the chance to mark the final home international appearances for Peter, Cian and Conor \u2013 three stalwarts of Irish rugby who help drive the highest standards in our camp,\" added Easterby.\nHerring, Healy, Clarkson, Conan, James Ryan and Ryan Baird provide the forwards cover with Murray and Jack Crowley named as the two replacement backs.\nIt is the first time Ireland have opted for a 6-2 split on the bench since last year's loss in England - a result which ended Irish hopes of back-to-back Grand Slams.\nIreland did, however, use a 6-2 split in last year's resounding victory over France in Marseille.\nFrance, who named their team earlier on Thursday, have retained a 7-1 split on the bench having used the tactic against Italy last time out.\nIreland: Keenan; Osborne, Henshaw, Aki, Lowe; Prendergast, Gibson-Park; Porter, Sheehan, Bealham; McCarthy, Beirne; O'Mahony, Van der Flier, Doris (capt). \nReplacements: Herring, Healy, Clarkson, Ryan, Conan, Baird, Murray, Crowley.\nFrance: Ramos; Penaud, Barassi, Moefana, Bielle-Biarrey; Ntamack, Dupont (capt); Gros, Mauvaka, Atonio; Flament, Guillard; Cros, Boudehent, Alldritt.\nReplacements: Marchand, Baille, Aldegheri, Meafou, Auradou, Jegou, Jelonch, Lucu.\nThis video can not be played\nKidnapping their dads, crazy tattoos & hairy shoulders",

But I don't have any evidence,\" she told the BBC in January, when she also talked about the shock of being shown those pictures by police for the first time. \nThe heated courtroom exchanges between Ms Darian and her father were some of the most dramatic in the 16-week trial that shocked France and the world. \"I never touched you, never,\" Pelicot pleaded to his daughter during one session. \"You are lying!\" Ms Darian shouted back.\nMs Darian has previously said she felt she was the trial's \"forgotten victim\" as, unlike in her mother's case, there was no record of the abuse she is convinced was inflicted upon her.\nShe told Elle France earlier this week that the charges she is pressing against her father were \"symbolic\" but \"in line with what I have said since the start: that I am a victim of chemical submission [drug-facilitated assault] but was never recognised as such\".\nShe has hired lawyer Florence Rault to represent her.\nFor many years, Ms Rault has been fighting for justice for two women who were the victims of violent ordeals in the 1990s. \nOne, a young property agent known by the pseudonym Marion, was the victim of an attempted rape in 1999, to which Pelicot has admitted. \nThe other - also an estate agent in her 20s - was raped and murdered in 1991. Pelicot is currently being investigated over that case, but has always denied any involvement.\nMs Darian said she saw similarities between her and Marion. \"We look strangely alike. She is blonde, her hair is bobbed, we were born the same year... I wanted to meet her lawyer and hear all the details,\" she told Elle France.\nIn her police complaint, which was quoted by French media, Ms Rault lamented that Ms Darian had never been offered gynecological examinations nor had she been tested for the drugs Pelicot used on his wife. \nMs Rault said the investigation had only focused on Gis\u00e8le Pelicot and that her client had been treated as a \"peripheral victim\". She asked the authorities to launch a fresh \"serious and in-depth\" inquiry.\nB\u00e9atrice Zavarro, Dominique Pelicot's lawyer, told French media that Ms Darian's decision to press charges was \"unsurprising given her statements and beliefs during the Avignon trial\".\nShe also said that the prosecutors in Avignon, in south-eastern France, said there were insufficient \"objective elements\" to accuse Pelicot of raping and using chemical submission on his daughter.\n\nForty-nine men were sentenced in December alongside Dominque Pelicot. All were found guilty of at least one charge - rape or sexual assault - against Gis\u00e8le Pelicot. \nSeventeen initially said they would appeal the charges against them, but seven of those have since changed their minds. \nThose who decide to press ahead with their appeals will go on trial at the end of the year in N\u00eemes, southern France.\nThe first trial - which lasted from September to December 2024 - garnered worldwide attention thanks to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's decision to waive her anonymity and open the trial to the public and the media.",

        "article_text": "Martin Odegaard scored two of Arsenal's seven goals against PSV Eindhoven\nEindhoven has been packed with carnival-goers in recent days but on Tuesday it was Arsenal enjoying their own party in the city, getting over their goalscoring crisis and setting a Champions League record in the process.\nMikel Arteta's side became the first team in Champions League history to score seven goals away from home in the knockout stages of the competition as they romped to a 7-1 win over PSV Eindhoven.\nIt was the most goals the Gunners have scored in a single game since beating Newcastle 7-3 in the Premier League 13 years ago.\nThe Arsenal manager said the win had given his players \"joy and confidence and belief\", but was not getting carried away when questions were put to him about the records that his team had broken.\n\"For sure, it's something that hasn't been done, so great to be part of that,\" Arteta said. \"But as a team we want to achieve many other things that are far more important than that.\n\"The happiest thing is we are in a very strong position to go to the next round, which is where we want to be.\n\"But there's still a job to do in London in a week's time.\"\nAfter failing to score in their past two games, a 0-0 draw at Nottingham Forest and 1-0 defeat by West Ham, Arteta may not have seen a victory like this coming. \n\"This will give them great confidence for the rest of the season. Right from the start Arsenal had control of the game,\" said Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Arsenal were ruthless with their finishing, some of the combination play in the final third was sensational.\n\"Martin Odegaard looked back to his best. To a man they were really strong and that centre-back pairing [Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba] is phenomenal.\n\"Arsenal will take some stopping in this competition.\"\nEngland and Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice was one of the players singled out for his performance during the game and said that the Gunners have got the reward for their hard work in recent weeks.\nRice, who had a goal ruled out for offside, said Arsenal were \"fluid\" and possessed the \"enthusiasm, drive and hunger\" that the knockout stages demand.\n\"But we've been playing like this all season,\" he added. \"We feel we've been playing well as a team. Sometimes we score five, sometimes two, sometimes we don't score but [on Tuesday] we did well. It all clicked.\"\nArsenal's lack of a recognised striker has been well documented, with Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz both injured. But six different players contributed to the rout on Tuesday - Odegaard scored twice, along with goals for Jurrien Timber, Mikel Merino, Ethan Nwaneri, Leandro Trossard and Riccardo Calafiori.\nThe emphatic win means that Arsenal can start planning for a trip to Madrid, as they are set to take on the winner of the tie between Real and Atletico, which finished 2-1 to Carlo Ancelotti's side. Next week's second leg takes place at Atletico.\nEthan Nwaneri scored his eighth goal of the season\nArsenal's excellent 17-year-old Nwaneri again showed why there is so much hype and excitement about his future in the game.\nThe academy graduate has been given the task of filling in for Bukayo Saka on the right hand side of Arsenal's attack while the England international is out injured. The teenager has repaid that faith in him with eight goals in 28 games in all competitions.\nThat goal return puts him alongside some of England's most iconic young players.\nMichael Owen and Wayne Rooney scored nine goals each in all competitions when they were aged 17 or younger and Nwaneri now has 16 days before his 18th birthday to try to match or beat that record.\n\"I don't think that he needs any pushing. You see every time what the intention is,\" Arteta said. \"If it comes, it comes and it's great.\n\"I'm really impressed with the way he behaved and the way he played. It's about consistency and now doing it again three days later in another big stadium.\" \nNwaneri also became the third youngest player to score a goal in a knockout stage match in the Champions League after Bojan in April 2008 (17 and 217 days) and Jude Bellingham in April 2021 (17 and 289 days).\n\"He's 17 years old and he's on the biggest stage,\" Rice said.\n\"We've taken [the youngsters] under our wing and they deserve to be playing. You should see them train they way they have no fear and want to perform.\n\"Even if Saka was here Ethan would be still getting minutes because he's that good and works so hard in training. We have so many top young players.\"\nNwaneri was joined in the starting XI by his team-mate from the academy Myles Lewis-Skelly and the 18-year-old also impressed despite being withdrawn in the first half to avoid him getting sent off.\nLewis-Skelly, who had been booked earlier, put in a late tackle on Richard Ledezma and although he was unpunished, Arteta substituted him moments later.\n\"They play like they have been here for many years,\" captain Odegaard said.\n\"So much quality and confidence, they're ready for it. I'm not worried about them, we enjoy having them in the team and they have a great attitude.\"\nOdegaard, who himself started playing senior football at 15 years old, believes that Lewis-Skelly can use his early withdrawal as a learning experience.\n\"He took that really well,\" he added. \"He knew it was a tricky position to be in. He was on a yellow and had a tough challenge too. He took it well  and we're all there to support and I'm sure he will learn from that too.\"\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\nGet Arsenal news sent straight to your phone",

It is also not clear whether the effect works for all cancer or just specific ones. And this is still animal research so while the scientists think this would apply in people that will still need to be confirmed.\nSome patients - with Lynch syndrome, which increases the risk of cancers - are already recommended aspirin.\nBut it will still take proper clinical trials to understand whether more patients would benefit too. \nThese are already under way. Prof Ruth Langley, from the MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London, is leading the Add-Aspirin trial to see if aspirin can stop early stage cancers from coming back. \nShe said the study's results were \"an important discovery\" as they would help to work out \"who is most likely to benefit from aspirin after a cancer diagnosis\".\nHowever, she again warned of the risks of taking aspirin and to \"always talk to your doctor before starting\".\nIn the long-run, Prof Roychoudhuri suspects new drugs would be developed that take the benefits of aspirin, but with fewer of the risky side-effects.\nThe discovery, published in the journal Nature, happened by accident as the scientists were not researching aspirin.\nThe team in Cambridge were investigating how the immune system responded to cancers when they spread.\nThey were using genetically engineered mice and found those lacking a specific set of genetic instructions were less likely to get metastatic cancer that had spread.\nFurther investigation revealed how those T-cells were being suppressed and this started to overlap with how aspirin was known to work in the body. \nDr Jie Yang, who carried out the research, said: \"It was a Eureka moment.\n\"It was an entirely unexpected finding which sent us down quite a different path of inquiry than we had anticipated.\"",

This is widely seen by Arab states, and many others, as the only lasting solution to this perpetual conflict, but it is firmly ruled out by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies.\nThis new plan proposes that Gaza would be run, temporarily, by a \"Gaza management committee under the umbrella of the Palestinian government\" comprised of qualified technocrats.\nIt glosses over the issue of what role, if any, Hamas, will play. There is a vague reference to the \"obstacle\" of militant groups and said this issue would be resolved if the causes of the conflict with Israel were removed.\nSome Arab states are known to be calling for the complete dismantling of Hamas; others believe those decisions should be left up to the Palestinians. Hamas is said to have accepted it will not play a role in running Gaza but has made it clear that disarming is a red line.\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has described President Trump's plan as \"visionary\", has repeatedly ruled out any future role for Hamas, but also for the Palestinian Authority.\nThe other sensitive issue of security was dealt with by calling on the UN Security Council to deploy international peacekeepers.\nAnd a major international conference will be held next month to raise the huge sums of money necessary for this rebuilding project.\nWealthy Gulf states appear willing to foot some of the colossal bill. But no one is ready to invest unless they are absolutely convinced buildings won't come crashing down in another war.\nA fragile ceasefire which now seems to be on the brink of collapse will only amplify that hesitation.\nThis new Arab plan to rebuild Gaza would unfold in three phases including an initial period of about six months, called the early recovery stage, to start clearing the massive amounts of rubble as well as unexploded ordinance. Two subsequent stages would last several years.\nDuring this time displaced Palestinians, said to number 1.5 million, would be housed in temporary containers. Photographs in the glossy brochure present them as well-built and designed housing units set in pretty landscaped areas.\nPresident Trump continues to wonder aloud \"Why wouldn't they want to move?\" His description of Gaza as a \"demolition site\" underlines how the territory lies in utter ruin. The UN says 90% of homes are damaged or destroyed. \nAll the basics of a life worth living, from schools and hospitals to sewage systems and electricity lines, are shredded.\nThe US President deepened the shock and anger around his ideas when he posted an AI-generated video of a golden Gaza on his Truth Social account which featured a shimmering statue of himself, his close ally Elon Musk enjoying snacks on the beach, and he and the Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu sunning themselves, shirtless. All to a catchy tune, with lines like \"Trump Gaza is finally here\".\n\"They had President Trump in mind,\" remarked one Western diplomat who attended a briefing about Egypt's plan at the foreign ministry in Cairo. \"It's very glossy and very well-prepared.\"\nCairo's proposal is said to have drawn on a wide range of expertise, from World Bank professionals on sustainability, to Dubai developers on hotels.  \nThere are also lessons learned from other ravaged cities which rose from the ruins including Hiroshima, Beirut, and Berlin. And the proposed designs are also influenced by Egypt's own experience in developing its \"New Cairo\", its grand megaproject which has seen a new administrative capital rising from the desert \u2013 at great expense.\nThe American President has said he won't \"force\" his ideas on anyone but still insists his plan is the one \"that really works\".\nNow it is up to the Arab states and their allies to prove that their plan is the only plan.",

        "article_text": "Tyrone Mings helped Aston Villa secure a sixth win in the Champions League this season\nWhen Tyrone Mings inexplicably gifted Club Brugge a penalty in the Champions League group phase in November, Aston Villa manager Unai Emery labelled it \"the biggest mistake I have witnessed in my career\".\nOn a night of redemption for the England defender, Mings returned to the scene of his howler - and helped Villa take a huge step towards the quarter-finals of European football's most prestigious competition.\n\"I was more than happy to come back here and play in this stadium again because I think we had unfinished business,\" Mings said after Villa's impressive 3-1 win at Club Brugge in the last-16 first leg in Belgium.\n\"I am very proud of what we have done tonight. I really enjoyed this game. We played against them [in the league phase] and knew a bit of what to expect. \n\"The game was exactly as we anticipated. We can be proud of both our defensive and attacking play.\"\nWill Villa finish the job in Birmingham on 12 March, and book a last-eight showdown with Liverpool or Paris St-Germain?\nOne thing is for sure - Mings looks to be back in form after putting the events of four months ago firmly behind him.\n\nLate goals give Villa first-leg advantage over Club Brugge\nMings plots time to 'stop thinking about' his injury\nVilla goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez nudged the ball out of the six-yard area and Mings, thinking the goal-kick had not been taken, picked up the ball.\nGerman referee Tobias Stieler awarded a penalty for handball, and Club Brugge captain Hans Vanaken stepped up to score the only goal of the game.\nIt was a horrible moment for Mings, who was substituted soon afterwards on his European debut and his second game back after 14 months out with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.\n\"His mistake is completely strange,\" added Emery after that game.\n\"It's only happened one time in all my life.\"\nTyrone Mings was making his third appearance in this season's Champions League\nOn Tuesday, Mings - who has come a long way since playing for Yate Town and Chippenham Town in non-league football - provided a headed assist for Leon Bailey to open the scoring in the third minute.\nAt 1-1, Brugge skipper Vanaken produced a header which was on target and heading for the back of the net before Mings managed to get a vital touch which took it wide. \n\"Tyrone Mings was incredible there,\" said former Scotland winger Pat Nevin, who was in the Jan Breydel Stadium for BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"He stopped it diverting into the inside of the post and that surely prevented a goal.\"\nMings made seven clearances  - more than anyone else - as Villa notched their sixth win in nine Champions League games this season to leave their 1,500 travelling fans celebrating wildly at the end.\nWhen asked about Mings' performance, Emery said: \"The first experience he had here was not good. But today he reacted fantastic, playing focused, serious, saving one action that was a goal.\n\"Of course I know the difficulties in football and how we can have experiences and how we can get better and analyse everything deeply and try and correct it - that is my only target with the players.\n\"We corrected something from the match we played here.\"\nThis was Villa's first knockout tie in European football's premier competition since the 1982-83 quarter-finals - and Emery's side are certainly making up for lost time. \nClub Brugge, who wasted at least two good chances, will feel they did not deserve to lose 3-1, but Villa have given themselves a golden chance to go through to the last eight.\nEmery, however, is not getting carried away.\n\"We are not in the quarter-finals,\" the Spaniard was quick to point out.\n\"There's still 90 minutes to play.

The family gave it a separate burial.\nThe UN says at least 14,500 children are reported to have been killed and many more badly wounded in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which began after Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing around 1,200 people. \nMedical evacuations from Gaza are critical, it says, because the healthcare system there has been devastated. Only 20 of the territory's 35 hospitals are partially functional and there are shortages of essential medicines and equipment.\nAn estimated 30,000 Gazans \u2013 like Rami and Abdul Salam \u2013 have been left with life-changing injuries which will require years of rehabilitation, according to the World Health Organization. \nIt has helped facilitate the evacuation of hundreds of patients since 1 February when the Rafah crossing with Egypt reopened for them. But it says that between 12,000 and 14,000 people \u2013 among them 4,500 children \u2013 still need to be brought out for treatment.\n\"The war has exacted a horrific toll on Gaza's children,\" the UN Children's Fund (Unicef) said when a ceasefire deal was announced in January.\nRami endured several surgical procedures without painkillers, anaesthesia or antibiotics, his mother told the BBC. His wounds became so infected that they were crawling with maggots. Doctors did not think his legs could be saved.\n\"Rami was in such pain, he was screaming 'God, you've taken my brother, now take me too!'\" Islam says.\nAnd then, in January, a rare chance came up - for Rami and his mother to be evacuated to Jordan for treatment at a specialised hospital for reconstructive surgery, run by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) in Jordan's capital, Amman.\nIt is currently treating 13 children from Gaza, but has the capacity to take in dozens more.\n\"It's the only hospital I know of providing physical and mental rehabilitation for victims of war,\" says Marc Schakal, MSF programme manager for Jordan, Syria and Yemen. \"It's multi-disciplinary care, not just surgery.\"\nRami has a psychologist, surgeon and physiotherapist. He is also being fed, clothed, and taught at MSF's small \"School of the Future\", a bright prefabricated building in the grounds of the hospital. After missing so much education, he is a keen learner.\nBut he has also been missing his father Mohammed and his brother, Abdul Salam - who needs a prosthetic leg but wasn't able to leave Gaza with him.\nThey're grateful for their treatment, but both he and his mother want to return home as soon as they can.\n\"Gaza is beautiful,\" Rami told me. \"In Gaza before the war, we used to have medical treatment, but then the aid stopped.\"\nWith the facilities and expertise at the MSF hospital, he's now making quick progress.\n\"He arrived in a wheelchair,\" says his physiotherapist, Zaid Alqaisi, who has formed a strong bond with Rami while helping him to walk again. \n\"He's very motivated. He wants to get back to his friends and his family. He wants to make his dad proud.\"\nHe also wants to swim again in the sea in Gaza.\nBut many more operations lie ahead, and Rami and his mother have no idea when they will return home.\nNot knowing if they will be allowed back into Gaza is another huge stress for all of the Palestinian patients on top of their trauma, according to psychologist Zainoun al-Sunna. \nSharing a hospital room with Rami is a withdrawn and traumatized five-year-old boy, Abdul Rahman al-Madhoun, who also needs surgery on his legs.\nHe was in his mother's arms when she was killed in an air strike in October 2023, along with his siblings. In hospital in Gaza, a nurse trying to cheer him up told him his mother had turned into a star.\n\"Since then, he looks up into the sky at night, looking for stars and talking to them,\" his aunt Sabah says. \"He doesn't talk to other people. But I hear him saying to the stars: 'Mummy I've eaten, Mummy I'm going to sleep now.'\"\nThe psychological injuries of the hospital patients are often tougher than the physical.\n\"Some will never recover,\" says hospital director Roshan Kumarasamy, who says that reconstructive surgery will be needed on patients from Gaza for years to come because of an \"unimaginably massive spectrum of injuries\".\nBut Rami is strong and determined. When he breaks down in tears thinking of Mustafa, he reassures me it's \"OK\".\nAnd when he and his mother manage to get through to his family in Gaza on a video call, Rami is eager to show them how he can now stand on his own two feet.\nHis father cheers him on, saying: \"Rami, you're a hero.\"\nAnd now his family have another reason to celebrate \u2013 Rami's brother, Abdul Salam, and his father have just been given permission by Israel to leave Gaza for Jordan as well. \nIn the weeks to come, he should be fitted with a new leg, allowing both injured boys to relearn how to walk.",

Their parents met in the UK before moving to the US.\nAfter their parents divorced, their mother moved to Luton, England. The brothers spent time in the UK, where they built their early careers.\nPolice in the UK have linked Andrew Tate to the \"quite terrifying\" radicalisation of boys and young men in a 2024 report into violence against women and girls.\nThe brothers were first arrested in Romania in 2022. They are facing separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK. Both brothers also deny the charges against them in the UK.\nThe brothers had been under a travel ban in Romania for more than two years while they were under investigation.\nSpeculation that they would leave Romania had been mounting ahead of their journey, after the pair went quiet on social media.\nThey flew from Bucharest to Florida on a private jet on 27 February.\nProsecutors said the travel ban had been lifted, and the pair's US passports had been returned to them, but investigations into their alleged crimes have not been dropped and they are expected to return to Romania. \nThe Tates have a large US following and are popular figures among some elements of the American right.\nEarlier in February, some of Andrew Tate's alleged victims said they were \"extremely concerned\" by reports that US officials had asked for his travel restrictions to be relaxed.\nIt came after US special envoy Richard Grenell raised the Tate brothers with Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at the Munich Security Conference.\nHurezeanu said he had not considered Grenell's approach as a \"form of pressure\". Grenell told the Financial Times his support for the brothers was evident.\nThe Tates have been vocal supporters of US President Donald Trump, while Trump's close adviser, Elon Musk, restored Andrew Tate's account on X after he bought the social media platform in 2022.\nIn the US, the brothers are facing a civil lawsuit from a women who alleges they coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. They strongly deny the allegations.\nIn a statement issued on 4 March, Florida's attorney general, James Uthmeier, said that he had directed his office and law enforcement partners \"to conduct a preliminary inquiry into Andrew and Tristan Tate\".\nHe added: \"Based on a thorough review of the evidence, I've directed the Office of Statewide Prosecution to execute search warrants and issue subpoenas in the now-active criminal investigation into the Tate brothers.\"\nIn response, a statement from the Tate brothers' lawyer Joseph McBride called Uthmeier's comments \"inflammatory\" and \"biased\".\n\"He publicly took a side in an ongoing Florida lawsuit where Andrew and Tristan Tate are suing a Florida woman for orchestrating a sophisticated plot to use sex as a weapon to ruin their lives,\" he added.\nThe cases against the Tate brothers in Romania are now being rewritten by prosecutors, who allowed them to leave the country on the condition that they return - possibly as early as the end of March.\nThe pair's request to leave the country was accepted, prosecutors said, but their request for the charges against them to be dropped was rejected.\nThe brothers face a number of civil and criminal legal cases.\nThey are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women in Romania.

        "article_text": "Southern California is frequently shaken by earthquakes. How they feel to people living in Los Angeles has a lot to do with the sediment-filled basin the city sits upon.\nHollywood stars were just starting to arrive at their afterparties following the Oscars when the ground suddenly jolted. There were a few screams and high-rise buildings reportedly wobbled.\u00a0\nThe magnitude 3.9 earthquake that hit North Hollywood on 2 March 2025 was the latest in a number of jolts to have hit the area. The earthquake was measured to have occurred at a depth of around 9 miles (15km), but was felt in parts of the city several miles away. Another much smaller\u00a0magnitude 1.3 earthquake was detected almost in the same location a few hours later. No damage to buildings was reported.\nIt wasn't a terribly unusual event, by California's standards. The state is the\u00a0second-most seismically active\u00a0in\u00a0the United States behind Alaska, with Southern California experiencing an\u00a0earthquake on average every three minutes. In the week leading up to the post-Oscars quake, 36 earthquakes occured in the LA area, with most being under magnitude 2.0.\u00a0While most are too small to be felt, around\u00a015-20 events exceed magnitude 4.0 each year.\nThe most recent occured a little over an hour after sunset on 6 August 2024, when a sparsely populated belt of farmland near Bakersfield, Southern California, was shaken from a restful evening. A magnitude 5.2 earthquake, followed by hundreds of smaller aftershocks, shuddered through the area as a fault near the southern end of the Central Valley ruptured \u2013 the largest earthquake to hit Southern California in three years. The epicenter was about 17 miles (27km) south of Bakersfield and people reported shaking nearly 90 miles (145km) away in portions of Los Angeles and as far away as San Diego. Then, a few days later, another jolt rattled the Los Angeles area due to a rupture on a small section of the dangerous Puente Hills fault system. The resulting magnitude 4.4 earthquake had its epicentre just four miles northeast of the city's downtown area.\nAlthough there was minimal damage caused by both quakes in August 2024 and the less severe shake in Hollywood in March 2025, they highlighted just how the geology under California's largest city can alter the effects of fault movements in the area. The relatively shallow depth of the 6 August earthquake appeared to create more intense or prolonged shaking in some parts of the city, while others felt almost nothing at all.\nThere are various reasons for why this might be \u2013 including what people were doing at the time of the earthquake \u2013 but the enormous five-mile-deep (8km), sediment-filled basin that LA is built upon plays a surprising role in the effects felt above ground.\nWhile the ground feels steadfast at the surface, deeply buried bedrock can resemble a shattered window pane. These cracks, or faults, are where earthquakes occur. Faults are put under tremendous stress by the slow and steady movement of the Earth's tectonic plates.\nIn California, the North American plate and the Pacific Plate are grinding past each other along the infamous San Andreas fault, averaging about 30-50 millimeters (1-2 inches) every year. The movement is anything but fluid. Cracked rocks are rough and wedge against each other, sometimes staying stuck for thousands of years. Over time, stress created by the slow marching tectonic plates builds up and when the fault reaches its stress limit, it \"slips\" and ruptures, causing an earthquake. \u00a0\nA rupture begins at one location and travels in one direction along the fault, stretching up to hundreds of kilometers. The longest rupture ever recorded was a 994 mile (1,600km) portion of a fault that caused the Great Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and resulting tsunami on Boxing Day 2004. \"The farther it goes, the longer [the earthquake] lasts, and the more energy that's released. So the longer the fault, the bigger the earthquake,\" explains seismologist Lucy Jones, a researcher at the California Institute of Technology and former seismologist with the US Geological Survey.\nDuring an earthquake, the stored energy saved within the sticky fault is released suddenly. Seismic waves radiate out from the rupture like the ripples created by throwing a rock into a pond, spreading in all directions through the surrounding rock and earth.\u00a0\nThe magnitude of an earthquake tells scientists about the length of the ruptured fault as well as the duration of shaking, says Jones. But the intensity of an earthquake \u2013 the ground motions we feel at a location \u2013 is shaped by how close we are to the epicenter, which direction the fault ruptured, and the geological layers under our feet.\nLos Angeles is located south of a giant a bend in the San Andreas fault where the plate boundary clearly changes direction. \"If you see it from the air, it's amazing,\" says Jones. \"It's so bizarre \u2013 you can look down and see the fault valley and then it just turns.\"\nAround the turn, the region is chock full of faults. Over millions of years, the faults churned and pushed slabs of bedrock into multiple mountain ranges and deep basins. Gravity, water and wind act like sandpaper, wearing down the mountains, and carrying debris into the basins. Over time, the basins have been filled with sediment.\nThe bowl-shaped basin of rock under Los Angeles is up to five miles (8km) deep, filled with a mixture of gravel, sand and clay. The contrast between the hard rock and softer sediment are big factors that cause some seismic weirdness for cities like Los Angeles.\nDuring an earthquake, seismic waves are modulated by geology, says John Vidale, professor of seismology at University of Southern California. \"The primary factor is just how hard is the ground and how deep is the structure that has soft [material] near the surface,\" he says. Seismic waves will move faster in denser material like rock, versus softer and less dense sediment.\nAs seismic waves travel through the basin, their behaviour changes when they encounter the loose sediment. \"[The wave] is now having to travel at a much slower speed, but it still has to carry the same amount of energy per unit time,\" said Jones. As the wave slogs through the sediment, the amplitude, or wave height, gets bigger.\nPut another way, imagine the Los Angeles basin as a giant bowl of jelly \u2013 the dense rocky mountains and underlying rock make up the bowl, while the sediment fill is represented by the gelatinous mixture. \"If you shake the bottom [of the bowl] a little bit, the top flops back and forth quite a bit,\" says Vidale. And atop this quivering mass of jelly is the megacity of Los Angeles.\nThis means the amplitude of the waves within a basin can be significantly bigger than those moving through rock. In one study, researchers using earthquake measurements in the Los Angeles region from the 1992 Landers earthquake found that seismic waves inside the Los Angeles basin were three to four times larger than sites outside the basin.\nIn addition to amplification, seismic waves can also reverberate within a sediment-filled basin. Think back to that shaking bowl of jelly and how the flopping top bounces off the sides of the bowl. Scientists from the Statewide California Earthquake Center simulated earthquakes in the Los Angeles region and found that the basin can trap seismic wave energy in a similar way. This reverberation can mean shaking can often go on for longer than the duration of the fault rupture itself, increasing the hazard for the city built on top.\nAs if that wasn't enough for Los Angeles, the close proximity of the San Bernadino and San Gabriel Basins to the Los Angeles Basins can create a funneling effect, directing seismic waves towards Los Angeles.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Will we ever be able to predict earthquakes?\n\u2022\u00a0The animals that can predict disasters\n\u2022\u00a0How your mobile phone can detect earthquakes\nEven within a basin, there can be differences in how the sediment interacts with seismic waves. \"There's variability in the shaking\u2026 there's variations in the geology,\" says Vidale. Sediment in the upper 330ft (100m) of the basin tends to be looser and less dense than the deeper, compacted sediment below. Sediment changes can also happen quickly at the surface. \"Old stream channels, for example, can be filled with a kind of wet, soft material,\" Vidale says. \"So, if you happen to be in an old stream channel, you'll get hit a lot harder than somebody even a quarter mile away that's on firmer ground.\"\nEven those in the same house can have different experiences, especially if the earthquake is on the smaller side. \"I'm in Pasadena, on the sediment in the San Gabriel Valley,\" say Jones. Despite both being in the house, she and her husband had different experiences of the earthquake on 6 August 2024. \"I felt it, my husband didn't,\" she says.\nWhile the city of Los Angeles ticks a lot of seismic hazard boxes, it is not the only urban center that needs to worry. Throughout human history, people have tended to build cities on flat ground near water bodies.\nIt just so happens that these sites tend to form above geologic basins and sometimes near faults.\u00a0\nWhile the US has a few famous cities built on basins \u2013 Seattle, Portland, and Salt Lake City \u2013 there are many others around the world that experience amplified seismic waves due to where they are situated. After the European settlers drained Lake Texcoco in the 1500s, Mexico City was built on the flat, old lake bottom. In 1985 and 2017, the city experienced significant damage from earthquakes that shook the basin sediments.\nThe desert megacity of Tehran in Iran also sits atop a geologic basin filled with river sediments, and there is growing concern about the risk of a major earthquake in the area.\nUnderstanding the earthquake risk is the first step in bolstering protection for a city against significant shaking. Enacting robust building codes can be another way to protect people and infrastructure, but it often takes a major event for stricter regulations to be implemented. After the devastating earthquake in 1985, for example, Mexico City enacted stringent building codes, and retrofitted older buildings.\u00a0\n\"The very first earthquake codes [in California] went in after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake,\" adds Jones. At that time, schools were built out of firesafe, unreinforced brick. \"Seventy schools were completely destroyed \u2013 luckily, it was at six o'clock at night,\" says Jones. The horror of collapsing schools spurred regulation, but initial codes were meagre. \"They basically just said, 'don't build unreinforced masonry in California'. \u00a0That was sort of the first basic code.\"\nToday, assessing earthquake risks is a lot more nuanced.\nIn the US, a team of seismologists, geoscientists and geophysicists have created a seismic hazard map, showing the chances of a damaging earthquake shaking in the next 100 years. In their latest version of the report, the team found that that nearly 75% of the US could experience damaging shaking. To help policymakers and engineers, the team included information on the implications for building and structural designs.\nWhile building codes can protect lives, scientists like Jones want building codes to go further. Designing buildings so they can be more easily repaired rather than needing to be demolished would cost an extra 1% in the construction phase, Jones estimates. \"We're calling it 'functional recovery',\" she says.\n\"We are trying to say that 'just not killing you' is an insufficient standard. The reality is, if your building's badly damaged and now has to be torn down after the earthquake, you've hurt your tenants, you've hurt your neighbors, you've hurt the local economy.\"\nFortunately, the buildings of Los Angeles rode out the latest quakes to rattle Southern California pretty well. But at some point, the city won't be so lucky.\n* This article was originally published on 18 August 2024.

It was the Paralympic spring Games.\"\nVirtually 100% of snow at the 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics in Beijing was artificial, which has an environmental cost itself, but temperatures in excess of 20C caused melting, external and competition schedules had to be changed.\nOn the potential of similar happening next year, Parsons said:  \"From the data we have we are not that concerned, but we are alert and we will have the measures in place to react, but also it's a sign of global warmth which is something that in sport we need to react to.\n\"I hope world leaders can address that as well, not only focusing on sport but on the future of this planet, because it's a reality and the quality of snow in sport events is just one symptom of it.\"\nThe 2026 Games will mark the 50th anniversary of the first Winter Paralympics, which were held in Ornskoldsvik, Sweden.\nAbout 600 athletes are set to descend on Italy in 12 months' time, with the action split between Cortina (Para alpine skiing, Para-snowboarding and wheelchair curling), Milan (Para-ice hockey) and Val di Fiemme (Para-cross country skiing and Para-biathlon).\nAs ticket sales open, Parsons said having the winter Games in Europe offers a \"great opportunity\" to build on \"the most successful Paralympics ever\" in Paris in 2024.",

        "article_text": "China has set an economic growth target for this year of \"around 5%\" and pledged to pump billions of dollars into its ailing economy, which is now facing a trade war with the US.\nIts leaders unveiled the plan as thousands of delegates attend the National People's Congress, a rubber-stamp parliament, which passes decisions already made behind closed doors.\nBut the week-long gathering is closely watched for clues on Beijing's policy changes - and this year is more significant than most.\nPresident Xi Jinping had already been battling persistently low consumption, a property crisis and unemployment, before Donald Trump's new 10% levy on Chinese imports came into effect on Tuesday.\nThis follows the 10% tariff imposed in early February, taking the total US levy to 20%. And it hits what has been a rare bright spot for the Chinese economy: exports. \nBeijing hit back almost immediately on Tuesday, just as it did last month. It announced retaliatory action that included 10%-15% tariffs on certain agriculture imports from the US. This is key because China is the biggest market for these goods, such as American corn, wheat and soybeans.\nAt the opening of this week's meeting, known as Two Sessions, China vowed to make domestic demand the \"main engine and anchor\" of its economic growth.\nBeijing was able to meet its 5% target for the last two years but growth was driven by strong exports, which resulted in a nearly trillion-dollar record trade surplus. \nRepeating that is going to be much harder this year. \n\"If the tariffs linger, Chinese exports to the US could drop by a quarter to a third,\" said Harry Murphy Cruise, head of China economics at Moody's Analytics. \nBeijing is going to have to rely more than ever on domestic spending to achieve 5% growth - but that has been one of its biggest challenges. \nOn Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said consumption has been sluggish and pledged to \"vigorously boost\" household demand.\n\"Domestically, the foundation for China's sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough.\"\n\"Internationally, changes unseen in a century are unfolding across the world at a faster pace,\" Li said, as he noted the rise of protectionism around the world.\nBeijing has already rolled out schemes to encourage its people to spend more, including allowing them to trade in and replace consumer goods like kitchen appliances, cars, phones and electronic devices. \nThe government now aims to put more money into ordinary Chinese people's pockets and help cut the country's reliance on exports and investment.\nBeijing's plans include issuing 1.3 trillion yuan ($179bn; \u00a3140bn) in special treasury bonds this year to help fund its stimulus measures. Local governments will also be allowed to increase the amount of money they borrow to 4.4 trillion yuan, up from 3.9 trillion yuan, according to the annual \"Work Report\". \nIn a rare move, Beijing raised its fiscal deficit - the difference between the government's spending and revenue - by one percentage point to 4% of gross domestic product (GDP), the highest level in decades.\nThe hike signals Beijing's commitment to increase spending to shore up growth. It has long sought to keep the deficit at or below 3% of GDP to demonstrate fiscal discipline. \nIt also announced plans to create more than 12 million jobs in cities, setting a target for urban unemployment at around 5.5% for 2025. The figure stood at 5.1% last year.\nThe government also pledged to provide more support to high-tech industries, restore stability in the property market, and expand elderly care programmes for its ageing population.\nWhether these measures will be enough to boost consumption is the key question.\nHarsh pandemic-era restrictions along with a prolonged real estate crisis and a government crackdown on tech and finance companies have fuelled pessimism among Chinese people. And a weak social safety net means savings have become especially crucial in case of unexpected out-of-pocket expenses.   \nBut China's leadership is optimistic. CPCC spokesman Liu Jieyi told reporters ahead of the session that while the economy was facing challenges such as low demand, it was \"important to recognise that China's economic fundamentals are stable, there are many advantages, resilience is strong, and potential is significant\".\nInvestment in what President Xi calls \"high-quality development\", which covers high-tech industries from renewables to artificial intelligence (AI), is also expected to be a major focus.\nThe world's second-largest economy, China has long vied to become a global leader in tech, partly to reduce its reliance on the West.\nState media has already touted recent examples like DeepSeek and Unitree Robotics, both of which have caught global attention, as examples of China's \"technological progress\". \nThe success of DeepSeek in particular saw an AI-driven stock rally, with analysts noting renewed interest in China among foreign investors. \nA commentary in the state-run Xinhua newspaper said \"China's new energy industries and overall green transition, driven by its cutting-edge technologies, will continue to be important growth drivers\". \nBut the new US levies - which come on top of tariffs from Trump's first term - could  stymie these plans, not least because they could dampen investor sentiment.\n\"The chaos that tariffs leave in their wake is kryptonite for investment,\" Mr Murphy Cruise says. \"Tariffs are set to deliver a one-two punch to China's economy, landing blows to both exports and investment.\"\nAlso on Wednesday, China announced a 7.2% increase in its national defence budget, the same rate of growth as last year.\nAdditional reporting by Jo\u00e3o da Silva",

        "article_text": "In his address to Congress, which ran for more than an hour and a half, President Donald Trump made a series of claims about the state of the US under his predecessor Joe Biden and the achievements of his first weeks in office.\nHe returned to key campaign themes including illegal immigration, rising prices and what he called \"appalling waste\" in government spending.\nBBC Verify has looked into the facts behind some of his key claims. \nTrump said he inherited an \"economic catastrophe\" from Biden.\nThis is misleading. The US economy was growing at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final quarter of 2024 under the previous administration. It expanded by 2.8% over 2024 as a whole according to official US statistics.\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates that the US growth rate in 2024 was faster than any other nation in the G7.\nOn rising prices, Trump added \"we suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country\".\nInflation under Biden peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 - the highest level since 1981 - so not quite as far back as Trump claimed.\nThe 2022 peak was in the context of high inflation in the rest of the world in the wake of the Covid pandemic and a global energy shock. The inflation rate had dropped to 3% by the time Trump took office.\nInflation has also been much higher than 9% at several other points in US history, including the 1940s and 1920s.\nTrump went on to blame Biden for egg prices, claiming he \"let the price of eggs get out of control\".\nPrices are high, but this has been linked to a bird flu outbreak in the US.\nEgg prices rose under Biden in 2023, and in January a dozen eggs averaged over $5, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). That is 53% above the average for the whole of 2024.\nThe USDA has said a bird flu outbreak has led to US farmers having to kill millions of chickens, creating egg shortages, and has announced a $1bn (\u00a3780m) plan to help combat the issue.\nThe outbreak started in February 2022 and last year the Biden administration allocated more than $800m to tackle it. \nThe Trump administration recently fired a number of USDA officials who worked on the government's response to bird flu as part of cost-cutting measures by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). They are now reportedly attempting to rehire some of them.\nTrump praised Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and claimed the advisory body had found \"hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud\" in federal government spending.\nNo evidence has been provided for this figure.\nOn its official website, Doge states that it has saved an estimated $105bn, from fraud detection, contract and grant cancellations, real estate lease terminations, asset sales, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings.\nHowever, that figure cannot be independently verified as, so far, Doge has only published \"receipts\" for contract, grant and real estate lease cancellations on the website. These add up to about $18.6bn. We have asked the White House for evidence of the remaining $86bn of savings.\nUS media outlets have also highlighted some accounting errors. For example, Doge initially listed its largest saving of $8bn from scrapping an immigration agency contract - it later corrected this to $8m.\nSpeaking about his actions to tackle illegal immigration, Trump said that \"as a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded\".\nThis is true.\nIn February 2025, 8,326 encounters of migrants at the south-west border with Mexico were recorded by US Border Patrol.\nThis is the lowest level since monthly records began in 2000.\nBy comparison, there were 140,641 encounters by US Border Patrol at this border in February last year under Biden. \nNumbers fell to 47,316 in December 2024.\nContinuing with illegal migration, Trump claimed: \"Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States\".\nThere is no evidence for a figure this high.\nEncounters with migrants at the borders - a measure of illegal migration - reached 10 million under Biden but this does not mean this many people stayed in the US.\nIt is impossible to know exactly how many illegal immigrants have come to the US, as many will have evaded law enforcement agencies, but several estimates put the number at around half what Trump stated.\nA report published by the Office of Homeland Security last year estimated the number of illegal immigrants living in the US, as of January 2022, at 11 million.\nIt says about a fifth of them arrived in 2010 or later but the majority arrived before this time, some as early as the 1980s.\nOn US aid to Ukraine, Trump claimed: \"We've spent perhaps $350bn\u2026 and they [Europe] have spent $100bn. What a difference that is.\"\nBBC Verify is unable to find any evidence for Trump's $350bn claim and some figures suggest Europe has spent more as whole when all aid to Ukraine is included.\nThe US is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. But Europe combined has spent more money than the US, according to the Kiel Institute think tank.\nIt calculates that between 24 January 2022 and the end of 2024, Europe as a whole spent $138.7bn on Ukraine, while the US spent $119.7bn.\nThe US Department of Defense has a higher figure of $182.8bn - taking into account a broader range of US military activity in Europe - but this is still considerably less than Trump's figure.\nWe have asked the White House where it comes from.\nCorrection: an earlier version of this article stated that migrant encounters at the south-west border fell to 96,000 at the end of 2024. While this is correct for overall encounters here, the number recorded by Border Patrol was 47,316.\nAdditional reporting by Shayan Sardarizadeh & Anthony Reuben.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

Impressively, virtually all of the new arrivals from abroad have had little issue giving post-match interviews in French.\nFew in the team encapsulate the willingness to integrate and adapt according to the team's needs better than Neves. The creative-minded midfielder, while standing out as part of a three-man block alongside the equally impressive Vitinha, has filled in more than serviceably at both right-back and left-back when called upon.\nThe Benfica academy product, who has set up nine goals in all competitions this season, has displayed a technical ease in slicing through defences and evading pressure only rivalled by his compatriot.\nHis assist for Dembele against Lille, setting up the Frenchman despite finding himself virtually face-to-face with goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier, was emblematic of his selfless, all-action displays since arriving.\nNot all of the summer recruits hit the ground running straight away.

Goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, for instance, has appeared increasingly reliable and comfortable with the ball at his feet, far from the high-profile errors of past European campaigns.\nBarring some rare lapses in concentration, the 23-year-old Pacho has adapted seamlessly to the physically demanding nature of Ligue 1 after joining from Eintracht Frankfurt.\nHis composure and workrate in particular have complemented captain Marquinhos more effectively than the more experienced centre-backs PSG have signed over the past few years.\nHaving mostly seen off domestic opposition since their upturn in form, Wednesday night's game against Premier League leaders LIverpool will be the sternest test yet.\n\"It could have been a Champions League final,\" as the PSG manager noted on Saturday.\nThe Asturian is right to view the tie as a clash of equals.",

But why not in the future? \n\"People can say the Scottish league is a league of two teams, but it is a league of passion.

I respect the emotional connection between him and his club. That is a very important thing, the connection between the fans and the coach.\n\"You can tell me he doesn't have much experience in Europe as a coach, but I prefer to go on the positive side.\n\"It will be much more difficult against him than the previous coach. The previous coach was more worried about philosophy. Ferguson will be more pragmatic. It will be hard for us but it will be hard for them.\"\n\nMourinho says Rangers fans still thank him for beating Celtic in the Uefa Cup final in 2003, when his Porto side won a thrilling game in Seville.\nIt was the Mourinho's first European final and 12 months later he led Porto to the Champions League title.\n\"It's true. Not so much here in Turkey, although maybe this week it will happen,\" he added. \n\"Especially in London, some Rangers fans come up to me. But of course that was a big final, my first European final.\n\"Part of my formation was in Scotland - I have friends blue and green. We are very happy to go to Scotland and play a Scottish team.\"\nMourinho spent time in Scotland during his formative years as a coach as he gained his B Licence and has warm memories of his time on the Ayrshire coast in particular.\n\"The Largs pubs... a disaster. I was only drinking sparkling water,\" he said.\n\"But it was fantastic. From a learning point of view and a human point of view. They were the biggest guys in Scottish football at that time. \n\"It was very good on coaching - sometimes badges are just badges, but this was different.\n\"It was amazing for me. I went there with my university degree - I was still playing, at a low level, but still playing. That coaching course and the methodology level was different.\n\"After that so many times when I am asked by young coaches, 'where would be a good first step?' I say they should go there.\"",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump said he would temporarily spare carmakers from a new 25% import tax imposed on Canada and Mexico, just a day after the tariffs came into effect.\nThe announcement by the White House came even as Trump continued to blast Canada for not doing enough to stop drugs from entering the US.\n\"Nothing has convinced me that it has stopped,\" Trump wrote on social media after a phone call with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about the economic disruption caused by new trade tariffs.\nNews of the relief helped to boost US shares, which closed higher after two days of declines that had wiped out gains the S&P 500 had seen since the presidential election in November.\nThe tariff exemption is for cars made in North America that comply with the continent's existing free trade agreement. \nThat deal, which was negotiated by Trump during his first term, sets out rules for how much of a car must be made in each country to qualify for duty-free treatment.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump had backed a one-month exemption to the tariffs for the car industry after pleas from Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which have supply chains that stretch across North America.\nThe new tariffs - which are a tax applied as goods enter the country - were poised to disrupt a third of car production in North America within a week, according to analysts at S&P Global Mobility.\nShares in Ford were up by more than 5% after the announcement, while General Motors shares rose more than 7%.

        "article_text": "China has set an economic growth target for this year of \"around 5%\" and pledged to pump billions of dollars into its ailing economy, which is now facing a trade war with the US.\nIts leaders unveiled the plan as thousands of delegates attend the National People's Congress, a rubber-stamp parliament, which passes decisions already made behind closed doors.\nBut the week-long gathering is closely watched for clues on Beijing's policy changes - and this year is more significant than most.\nPresident Xi Jinping had already been battling persistently low consumption, a property crisis and unemployment, before Donald Trump's new 10% levy on Chinese imports came into effect on Tuesday.\nThis follows the 10% tariff imposed in early February, taking the total US levy to 20%. And it hits what has been a rare bright spot for the Chinese economy: exports. \nBeijing hit back almost immediately on Tuesday, just as it did last month. It announced retaliatory action that included 10%-15% tariffs on certain agriculture imports from the US. This is key because China is the biggest market for these goods, such as American corn, wheat and soybeans.\nAt the opening of this week's meeting, known as Two Sessions, China vowed to make domestic demand the \"main engine and anchor\" of its economic growth.\nBeijing was able to meet its 5% target for the last two years but growth was driven by strong exports, which resulted in a nearly trillion-dollar record trade surplus. \nRepeating that is going to be much harder this year. \n\"If the tariffs linger, Chinese exports to the US could drop by a quarter to a third,\" said Harry Murphy Cruise, head of China economics at Moody's Analytics. \nBeijing is going to have to rely more than ever on domestic spending to achieve 5% growth - but that has been one of its biggest challenges. \nOn Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said consumption has been sluggish and pledged to \"vigorously boost\" household demand.\n\"Domestically, the foundation for China's sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough.\"\n\"Internationally, changes unseen in a century are unfolding across the world at a faster pace,\" Li said, as he noted the rise of protectionism around the world.\nBeijing has already rolled out schemes to encourage its people to spend more, including allowing them to trade in and replace consumer goods like kitchen appliances, cars, phones and electronic devices. \nThe government now aims to put more money into ordinary Chinese people's pockets and help cut the country's reliance on exports and investment.\nBeijing's plans include issuing 1.3 trillion yuan ($179bn; \u00a3140bn) in special treasury bonds this year to help fund its stimulus measures. Local governments will also be allowed to increase the amount of money they borrow to 4.4 trillion yuan, up from 3.9 trillion yuan, according to the annual \"Work Report\". \nIn a rare move, Beijing raised its fiscal deficit - the difference between the government's spending and revenue - by one percentage point to 4% of gross domestic product (GDP), the highest level in decades.\nThe hike signals Beijing's commitment to increase spending to shore up growth. It has long sought to keep the deficit at or below 3% of GDP to demonstrate fiscal discipline. \nIt also announced plans to create more than 12 million jobs in cities, setting a target for urban unemployment at around 5.5% for 2025. The figure stood at 5.1% last year.\nThe government also pledged to provide more support to high-tech industries, restore stability in the property market, and expand elderly care programmes for its ageing population.\nWhether these measures will be enough to boost consumption is the key question.\nHarsh pandemic-era restrictions along with a prolonged real estate crisis and a government crackdown on tech and finance companies have fuelled pessimism among Chinese people. And a weak social safety net means savings have become especially crucial in case of unexpected out-of-pocket expenses.   \nBut China's leadership is optimistic. CPCC spokesman Liu Jieyi told reporters ahead of the session that while the economy was facing challenges such as low demand, it was \"important to recognise that China's economic fundamentals are stable, there are many advantages, resilience is strong, and potential is significant\".\nInvestment in what President Xi calls \"high-quality development\", which covers high-tech industries from renewables to artificial intelligence (AI), is also expected to be a major focus.\nThe world's second-largest economy, China has long vied to become a global leader in tech, partly to reduce its reliance on the West.\nState media has already touted recent examples like DeepSeek and Unitree Robotics, both of which have caught global attention, as examples of China's \"technological progress\". \nThe success of DeepSeek in particular saw an AI-driven stock rally, with analysts noting renewed interest in China among foreign investors. \nA commentary in the state-run Xinhua newspaper said \"China's new energy industries and overall green transition, driven by its cutting-edge technologies, will continue to be important growth drivers\". \nBut the new US levies - which come on top of tariffs from Trump's first term - could  stymie these plans, not least because they could dampen investor sentiment.\n\"The chaos that tariffs leave in their wake is kryptonite for investment,\" Mr Murphy Cruise says. \"Tariffs are set to deliver a one-two punch to China's economy, landing blows to both exports and investment.\"\nAlso on Wednesday, China announced a 7.2% increase in its national defence budget, the same rate of growth as last year.\nAdditional reporting by Jo\u00e3o da Silva",

        "article_text": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau slammed Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on Canada, calling it a \"very dumb thing to do\" and vowed to conduct a \"relentless fight\" to protect its economy.\nTrump has imposed 25% tariffs on products entering the US from Canada and Mexico, and has increased a levy on goods coming from China.\nThe Canadian prime minister announced retaliatory tariffs on US exports and warned that a trade war would be costly for both countries.\nBut Trump pushed even further in a post on Truth Social, saying: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"\nTrudeau accused the US president of planning \"a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us\". \n\"That is never going to happen. We will never be the 51st state,\" he told reporters on Tuesday.\n\"This is a time to hit back hard and to demonstrate that a fight with Canada will have no winners.\"\nHe said that Canada's main goal remains to get the tariffs lifted so that they \"don't last a second longer than necessary\".\nTrump said he is protecting US jobs and manufacturing, and trying to prevent illegal migration and drug trafficking. The US president said his goal is to clamp down on the powerful opioid fentanyl; he has variously blamed the other countries for the drug's arrival in the US.\nResponding to the accusations, Trudeau said on Tuesday there was \"no justification\" for the new tariffs, because less than 1% of the fentanyl intercepted at the US border comes from Canada. \nTrudeau's words were echoed by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who said there was \"no motive, no reason, no justification\" for Trump's move. Speaking on Tuesday, she too vowed to issue her own \"tariff and non-tariff measures\" - but said further details would be given on Sunday.\nTrump's tariffs are likely to push up prices for consumers in the US and abroad, said John Rogers, an economics professor at American International University.\nThe items most likely to be affected the soonest are food - the fruits, vegetables and other produce the US imports from Mexico - followed by the large amounts of oil and gas imported from Canada, Prof Rogers said.\n\"Prices could go up pretty soon\", Prof Rogers warned, though he was reluctant to say by exactly how much or how quickly. \n\"We are in pretty uncharted territory,\" he told the BBC.\nThe bigger concern for prof Rogers was the potential damage he said was being done to America's longstanding trade partners.\n\"This is kind of sticking your finger in the eye of your neighbour,\" he said, adding that, in a potential US-Canada-Mexico trade war, \"everybody is a loser\".\nThe three countries targeted are America's top trading partners, and the tit-for-tat measures also prompted fears of that very trade war. \n\"There's no way you can win a trade war. Everybody suffers, because everybody's just going to wind up paying higher prices and sacrificing quality,\" Prof Rogers said. \nTariffs are a tax on imports from other countries, designed to protect against cheaper competition from elsewhere, and boost businesses and jobs at home.\nCanada's retaliatory measures include a 25% reciprocal tariff that will be imposed on C$155bn (US$107bn; \u00a384bn) of American goods:\nCanada's Immigration Minister Marc Miller warned that as many as a million jobs in Canada were at risk if the tariffs were implemented, given how intertwined trade was between the two countries.\n\"We can't replace an economy that is responsible for 80% of our trade overnight and it's going to hurt,\" he said on Monday.\nSpeaking to the AFP news agency, a car manufacturing employee in the Canadian province of Ontario said people were indeed \"pretty scared\" of being laid off. \"I just bought my first house,\" Joel Soleski said. \"I might have to look for work elsewhere.\"\nThe sector is one that could be badly affected by the new tariffs regime in North America. Car parts may cross US-Canada border several times during the manufacturing process, and so might be taxed on multiple occasions.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford, whose province is home to Canada's auto manufacturing industry, told reporters on Tuesday that he anticipates assembly plants will \"shut down on both sides of the border\" as a result of the tariffs.\nThe tariffs were called \"reckless\" by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, whose president Candace Laing cautioned that the move would force both Canada and the US towards \"recession, job losses and economic disaster\".\nMs Laing warned they would also increase prices for Americans, and force US businesses to find alternate suppliers that she said \"are less reliable than Canadian ones\".\nCanadian provincial leaders have vowed their own responses. \nFord of Ontario mooted the possibility of cutting off Canadian electricity supplies and exports of high-grade nickel to the US, as well as putting an export levy of 25% on electricity sent to power homes in Michigan, New York and Minnesota.\nCanada exports enough electricity to power some six million American homes.\nOntario and other provinces have also moved to remove US-made liquor off their shelves. In Nova Scotia, Premier Tim Houston said his province will ban American companies from bidding on provincial contracts, as will Ontario. \nFord also announced that a C$100m ($68m; \u00a355.1) contract with Elon Musk's satellite internet company Starlink will be cancelled.\nMeanwhile China - which now faces tariffs of 20% after Trump doubled an earlier levy - has vowed to fight any trade war to the \"bitter end\". It has announced its own counter-measures - including tariffs on a range of US agricultural and food products.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has imposed new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and has doubled the levy recently put on Chinese goods.\nBut the day after these began, Trump announced a month-long exemption for US carmakers, who were expected to be badly affected. \nHe previously announced tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports.\nCanada and China have retaliated with tariffs of their own against US goods, sparking fears of a global trade war and higher prices.\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.\nThe companies that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government.\nTypically, tariffs are a percentage of a product's value.  Imposing a 20% tariff on Chinese goods means a product worth $10 (\u00a37.76) would have an additional $2 charge applied to it.\nFirms may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers. \nThe US has typically charged lower tariffs on goods than other countries, which means his reciprocal plan could lead to a sudden and sharp increase in the tax rates - and to the prices people pay at checkout.\nTariffs are a central part of Trump's economic plans. He says tariffs will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, as well as raising tax revenue and growing the economy. \nGoods from China, Mexico and Canada accounted for more than 40% of imports into the US in 2024.\nWhen he first announced plans for new tariffs, the White House said the president was \"taking bold action to hold [the three countries] accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country\".\nFentanyl is linked to tens of thousands of overdose deaths in the US each year.\nThe Trump administration says the chemicals come from China, while Mexican gangs supply it illegally and run fentanyl labs in Canada. \nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country was responsible for less than 1% of fentanyl entering the US, most of which comes from Mexico. \nA 10% charge on all goods imported from China started on 4 February. \nTrump later said shipments worth less than $800 would be exempt.\nOn 10 February, China responded with its own tariffs, including a 10-15% tax on some US agricultural goods.\nBeijing has also targeted various US aviation, defence and tech firms by adding them to an \"unreliable entity list\" and imposing export controls. \nThe 10% levy doubled to 20% on 4 March. \nChina urged the US to return to dialogue with Beijing as soon as possible.\n\"If the United States... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end,\" foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian warned. \nTrump has introduced 25% tariffs on goods from both US neighbours, Canada and Mexico. These were originally due to begin on 4 February but finally started on 4 March. \nMeanwhile, Canadian energy imports face a 10% tariff. \nTrump had previously said the month-long delay would let the US see \"whether or not a final economic deal with Canada\" could be reached. \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau criticised the tariffs as a \"very dumb thing to do\", and accused Trump of planning \"a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us\".\nHe said his country would immediately target C$30bn worth of products entering from the US, and goods worth a further C$125bn in 21 days.\nCanada may also restrict US access to its energy. It is the top oil supplier to the US and also provides some electricity to 30% of the states.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said he would implement his own 25% surcharge on Canadian electricity exports to three US states: Michigan, New York and Minnesota.\nAnd he said he would consider completely cutting those states off from Canadian power if the US tariffs escalated. \nMexico also delayed retaliatory tariffs on US goods after the initial US pause. \nPresident Claudia Sheinbaum agreed to send 10,000 members of the National Guard to the US-Mexican border to \"prevent the trafficking of drugs, in particular fentanyl\".\nShe said the US had in turn agreed to increase measures to prevent the trafficking of high-powered American weapons into Mexico.\nSpeaking after Trump's tariffs came into force on 4 March, Sheinbaum said the US's decision to go ahead with 25% levies had \"no justification\" - adding that Mexico wanted respect from its northern neighbour.\nMexico will impose \"tariff and non-tariff measures\" in response, she added, and promised to set out further details on 9 March. \nThe month-long tariff exemption is for cars made in North America that comply with the continent's existing free trade agreement.\nThat deal, which was negotiated by Trump during his first term in office, sets out rules for how much of a car must be made in each country to qualify for duty-free treatment.\nThe Canadian and Mexican tariffs prompted fears of significant impacts on car manufacturing. Component parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.  \nThe average US car price could increase by $3,000 because of the import taxes, financial analyst TD Economics suggested. \nShares in Ford were up by more than 5% after the announcement, while General Motors shares rose more than 7%.\nTrump said the 25% tariff on both metals will come into effect on 12 March, with no exceptions. \nThe US is the world's largest importer of steel, with Canada, Brazil and Mexico its top three suppliers. \nCanada also provided more than 50% of the aluminium imported into the US in 2024. \nAmerican companies that use steel and aluminium to make products have warned the tariffs could push their prices up.\nThe Canadian government said the tariffs were \"totally unjustified\" and vowed swift retaliation. \nTrump previously announced tariffs of 25% on steel and 15% on aluminium in 2018, during his first term as president. However, he later negotiated exceptions for many countries including Australia, Canada and Mexico.\nDespite the exemptions, tariffs raised the average price of steel and aluminium in the US by 2.4% and 1.6% respectively, according to the US International Trade Commission.\nAll goods from China worth more than $800 are covered by the tariff. \nAll steel imports from around the world face a 25% tax. \nMexican and Canadian goods will also be subject to a 25% levy. A 10% tariff has been added to Canadian energy exports.\nGoods from Mexico that could be affected include fruit, vegetables, spirits and beer.\nIn addition to steel, Canadian goods such as timber, grains and potatoes are also likely to get more expensive. \nAn increase in the cost of Canadian oil and electricity could push up prices across the board. \nUS tariffs on imported washing machines between 2018 and 2023 increased the price of laundry equipment by 34%, according to official statistics. Prices fell once the tariffs expired.\nThe Federal Reserve of Atlanta has estimated that the Mexico and Canada tariffs, combined with adding another 10% tariff on Chinese goods, could raise prices on everyday purchases by 0.81% to 1.63%.\nSome experts suggest that Trump's new round of tariffs could prompt a wider trade war that could put prices up more generally. \nCapitol Economics said the annual rate of US inflation could increase from 2.9% to as high as 4%. \nTrump previously told the BBC the UK was \"out of line\", but suggested a solution could be \"worked out\".\nThe UK exports pharmaceutical products, cars and scientific instruments to the US. \nBusiness Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the UK should be excluded from tariffs because it buys more from the US than it sells there. \nSpeaking in Parliament after the announcement of the steel and aluminium tariffs, Trade Minister Douglas Alexander promised a \"cool and clear-headed\" response.\nDuring his 26 February cabinet meeting, Trump said he would announce sanctions on EU goods \"very soon\".\n\"It'll be 25% generally speaking and that will be on cars and all other things,\" he added.\nThe US had a trade deficit of $213bn with the EU in 2024 - something Trump has previously described as \"an atrocity\". \nIn response, the European Commission said it would react \"firmly and immediately against unjustified tariffs\".\nUS companies Harley Davidson and Jack Daniel's have previously faced EU tariffs.",

        "article_text": "US stock markets have tumbled over concerns that President Donald Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China will lead to a wider trade war and hurt the economy.\nThe S&P 500 index, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US, fell for a second day, ending at its lowest level since November when Trump won the election.\nThe president has followed through on a threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 20% levy on China.\nThe move drew swift retaliation, including from Canada, where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned Trump his decision to target the US neighbour and close trade partner was a \"very dumb thing to do\".\nTrump fired back, writing on social media: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"\nUS Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested that Trump could be ready to do a deal with Canada and Mexico. \"I think he's going to work something out with them,\" he told Fox News.\nSaying it would not be a \"pause\", he added: \"I think he's going to figure out, 'You do more and I'll meet you in the middle some way', and we're going to probably be announcing that tomorrow.\"\nIt is not clear if Trump will announce a new deal but markets will be closely watching the president's address to Congress on Tuesday.\nGoods worth some $2bn cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and their economies are deeply integrated.\nStock markets in the US and globally have fallen since Trump announced on Monday that the tariffs would go ahead.\nCanada and China have already announced retaliatory import taxes on US goods. \nMexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said the country would announce a response on Sunday that would include \"tariff and non-tariff measures\".\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.5%, while the Nasdaq, where many technology companies' shares are listed, fell 0.35%. The S&P 500 closed 1.2% lower.\nAmerican retailers and carmakers were among the hardest hit, with electronics chain Best Buy's share price closing more than 13% lower.\nThe company had warned earlier on Tuesday that the tariffs would lead to higher prices for its shoppers. \n\"The giant wildcard obviously is how the consumers are going to react to the price increases in light of a lot of price increases potentially throughout the year,\" said Best Buy's chief financial officer Matt Bilunas.\nTrump said he was imposing the tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China in response to what he said was the unacceptable flow of illegal drugs and illegal immigrants into the US.\nTrudeau called that justification \"completely bogus\" and warned that Canada's retaliatory measures would hurt. \nHe said Canada would first hit $30bn worth of products, and target the remaining $125bn over 21 days.\nAny fresh duties Canada imposes will be in place \"until the US trade action is withdrawn\", he said.\n\"Canadians are reasonable and we are polite, but we will not back down from a fight, not when our country and the wellbeing of every one in it is at stake,\" he said.\nAddressing Trump directly, he added: \"Donald, you're a very smart guy. But this is a very dumb thing to do.\"\nChina also swiftly announced its own counter-measures, which include 10-15% tariffs on some US agricultural goods including wheat, corn, beef and soybeans. China is the US's biggest buyer of these goods.\n\"If the United States... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end,\" foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.\nTrump said he would respond to retaliation with a plan, due in April, for \"reciprocal\" tariffs. \nThese would be tailor-made to each country and take into account areas such as the trade balance with the US and other taxes, such as VAT.\nTrump has also threatened to impose 25% tariffs on the EU, recently claiming that the bloc had been \"formed to screw the United States\".\nEurope has pledged to hit back, but no tariffs have been implemented yet.\nTrump is hoping that imposing tariffs on the goods that the US buys will force foreign companies to invest in America, boost tax revenues and grow the economy.\nHe has argued the tariffs - which are a tax paid by the business importing the product - will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs as foreign companies switch to production in America. \nBut tariffs also tend to trigger retaliation from targeted countries, disadvantaging domestic businesses looking to export goods, meaning the measures can ultimately hold back trade.\nAnalysts have warned that tariffs could lead to economic recessions, push up prices for US households and could also have a knock-on effect on consumers across the world, including in the UK.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said that regardless of whether the UK avoids tariffs, they will have a knock-on effect.\n\"I don't think it serves anyone well,\" she said. \"And it's absolutely the case that even if tariffs aren't applied to the UK, we will be affected by slowing global trade, by a slower [economic] growth and by higher inflation than otherwise would be the case.\"\nIf inflation rises, it could affect the pace at which interest rates are cut.\nCompanies could choose to absorb the cost of the extra tax. Chipotle said that the restaurant chain would take that route - for now.\n\"It is our intent today to hold pricing constant because we don't know if the tariffs are transitory, if they're going to be permanent, or how they will impact our business in the future,\" said Laurie Schalow, Chipotle's corporate affairs chief.\nBut, like Best Buy, other US retailers warned that prices would rise. \nTarget's boss Brian Cornell said shoppers were likely to see increases over the next couple of days for foods such as avocados, bananas and strawberries.\nMexican avocados make up nearly 90% of the US market each year.\nWalmart said it would try to keep prices \"as low as possible\".\n\"In the meantime, we encourage all parties to work towards finding common ground that will protect consumers from price hikes and continue to grow our economy,\" it said.\nCarmakers are also bracing for a hit.\nFord chief executive Jim Farley warned last month the business \"could handle two weeks of tariffs\".\nHe told Bloomberg: \"We could see billions of billions of dollars of pressure on the industry, lost jobs, lots of impacts to communities.\"",

These would be tailor-made to each country and take into account areas such as the trade balance with the US and other taxes, such as VAT.Trump has also threatened to impose 25% tariffs on the EU, recently claiming that the bloc had been \"formed to screw the United States\".Europe has pledged to hit back, but no tariffs have been implemented yet.What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?How is China hitting back against US tariffs?Rising prices Trump is hoping that imposing tariffs on the goods that the US buys will force foreign companies to invest in America, boost tax revenues and grow the economy.He has argued the tariffs - which are a tax paid by the business importing the product - will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs as foreign companies switch to production in America. \"It is not clear if Trump will announce a new deal but markets will be closely watching the president's address to Congress on Tuesday.Goods worth some $2bn cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and their economies are deeply integrated.Stock markets in the US and globally have fallen since Trump announced on Monday that the tariffs would go ahead.Canada and China have already announced retaliatory import taxes on US goods. But tariffs also tend to trigger retaliation from targeted countries, disadvantaging domestic businesses looking to export goods, meaning the measures can ultimately hold back trade.Analysts have warned that tariffs could lead to economic recessions, push up prices for US households and could also have a knock-on effect on consumers across the world, including in the UK.Chancellor Rachel Reeves said that regardless of whether the UK avoids tariffs, they will have a knock-on effect.",

        "article_text": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says he is ready to sign a deal with the US on the joint development of his country's mineral deposits at \"any time and in any convenient format\". \nIt comes days after an acrimonious visit to Washington, during which Zelensky clashed with Donald Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance in front of journalists and TV cameras. \nThe deal was supposed to be signed during that visit, but was put on hold as the Ukrainian president left the White House early.  \nDays later, in a social media statement which came hours after the US paused all military aid to Ukraine, Zelensky expressed his gratitude over American support for Ukraine and said he was ready to sign the deal. \nTrump said he appreciated the message, although it is not clear if or when the deal will be signed. \nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine. \nThis includes some 19m tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine has 7% of Europe's supplies of titanium, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations.\nIt is also home to a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries. \nOther elements found in Ukraine include beryllium and uranium, which are both crucial for nuclear weapons and reactors.\nDeposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt and manganese are also significant.\nFurther, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.\nSome of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nIn 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, as well as half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.\nDr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access to revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.\nCritical minerals \"are the foundation of the 21st Century economy\", Dr Muggah explained. They are key to renewable energy, military applications and industrial infrastructure and play \"a growing strategic role in geopolitics and geoeconomics\", he said.\nAdditionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine's mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group.\nIn December, China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year.\nSome commentators have described the US offer as \"colonial\", but Kyiv is interested in joint exploration of its resources.\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, Ukraine has about 20,000 mineral deposits covering 116 types, but only about 15% of sites were being actively exploited at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.\nFor instance, the country's sizeable lithium deposits are still largely untapped. Likewise, rare earth deposits are known to exist, but none of them have yet been mined, because of a lack of investment.\nDeveloping these mineral resources is extremely difficult and expensive, according to Iryna Suprun, chief executive of the Geological Investment Group, a mining advisory firm based in Ukraine. \nShe argues that if Ukraine can attract US investors to help develop its natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.\n\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\"\nTrump has also suggested the presence of US contractors in Ukraine would act as a security guarantee to deter Russian aggression in the future, but Ukraine and European leaders have insisted that would not be enough.

Broadly speaking, the right to protest is protected by the First Amendment of the US Constitution. \nThe Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, also known as Fire, swiftly condemned Trump's announcement. \n\"Colleges can and should respond to unlawful conduct, but the president does not have unilateral authority to revoke federal funds, even for colleges that allow 'illegal' protests,\" the statement said. \nThe group added that the move will \"cast an impermissible chill on student protests about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\". \nIn a separate announcement, the US Department of Education, General Services Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services said they would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of Columbia's federal contracts amid an ongoing investigation into compliance with Title VI, a federal law that bans discrimination based on ethnicity or ancestry. \nIn a statement, the education department said that it is considering stop work orders for $51.4m (\u00a340.19m) in contracts with the New York City-based university, and will review more than $5bn in grant commitments to the school. \n\"Americans have watched in horror for more than a year now, as Jewish students have been assaulted and harassed on elite university campuses - repeatedly overrun by antisemitic students and agitators,\" Trump's new Secretary of Education, Linda McMahon, said in a statement. \nMcMahon added that \"unlawful encampments and demonstrations have completely paralysed day-to-day campus operations, depriving Jewish students of learning opportunities to which they are entitled\". \nIn January, Trump signed an executive order that called for the removal of foreign students who participated in protests. \nThe order also directed government departments to make recommendations that could allow educational institutions to \"monitor for and report activities by alien students and staff\" and, if warranted, remove them. \nA White House fact sheet on the order specified that it seeks to \"protect law and order, quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities\". \nIn April 2024, student protests against the war in Gaza drew national attention after students at Columbia were arrested at a student encampment set up on campus. \nThousands of arrests were ultimately made at dozens of universities across the country. \nAt Columbia, the university authorised New York Police Department officers to swarm the campus, a controversial decision that led to the arrests of about 100 students who were occupying a university building.\nFour months after protests rocked the campus, Columbia president Minouche Shafik resigned. \nEarlier this week, a federal task force announced it would visit 10 prominent US universities that have been the scene of anti-semitic incidents.

        "article_text": "In his address to Congress, which ran for more than an hour and a half, President Donald Trump made a series of claims about the state of the US under his predecessor Joe Biden and the achievements of his first weeks in office.\nHe returned to key campaign themes including illegal immigration, rising prices and what he called \"appalling waste\" in government spending.\nBBC Verify has looked into the facts behind some of his key claims. \nTrump said he inherited an \"economic catastrophe\" from Biden.\nThis is misleading. The US economy was growing at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final quarter of 2024 under the previous administration. It expanded by 2.8% over 2024 as a whole according to official US statistics.\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates that the US growth rate in 2024 was faster than any other nation in the G7.\nOn rising prices, Trump added \"we suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country\".\nInflation under Biden peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 - the highest level since 1981 - so not quite as far back as Trump claimed.\nThe 2022 peak was in the context of high inflation in the rest of the world in the wake of the Covid pandemic and a global energy shock. The inflation rate had dropped to 3% by the time Trump took office.\nInflation has also been much higher than 9% at several other points in US history, including the 1940s and 1920s.\nTrump went on to blame Biden for egg prices, claiming he \"let the price of eggs get out of control\".\nPrices are high, but this has been linked to a bird flu outbreak in the US.\nEgg prices rose under Biden in 2023, and in January a dozen eggs averaged over $5, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). That is 53% above the average for the whole of 2024.\nThe USDA has said a bird flu outbreak has led to US farmers having to kill millions of chickens, creating egg shortages, and has announced a $1bn (\u00a3780m) plan to help combat the issue.\nThe outbreak started in February 2022 and last year the Biden administration allocated more than $800m to tackle it. \nThe Trump administration recently fired a number of USDA officials who worked on the government's response to bird flu as part of cost-cutting measures by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). They are now reportedly attempting to rehire some of them.\nTrump praised Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and claimed the advisory body had found \"hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud\" in federal government spending.\nNo evidence has been provided for this figure.\nOn its official website, Doge states that it has saved an estimated $105bn, from fraud detection, contract and grant cancellations, real estate lease terminations, asset sales, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings.\nHowever, that figure cannot be independently verified as, so far, Doge has only published \"receipts\" for contract, grant and real estate lease cancellations on the website. These add up to about $18.6bn. We have asked the White House for evidence of the remaining $86bn of savings.\nUS media outlets have also highlighted some accounting errors. For example, Doge initially listed its largest saving of $8bn from scrapping an immigration agency contract - it later corrected this to $8m.\nSpeaking about his actions to tackle illegal immigration, Trump said that \"as a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded\".\nThis is true.\nIn February 2025, 8,326 encounters of migrants at the south-west border with Mexico were recorded by US Border Patrol.\nThis is the lowest level since monthly records began in 2000.\nBy comparison, there were 140,641 encounters by US Border Patrol at this border in February last year under Biden. \nNumbers fell to 47,316 in December 2024.\nContinuing with illegal migration, Trump claimed: \"Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States\".\nThere is no evidence for a figure this high.\nEncounters with migrants at the borders - a measure of illegal migration - reached 10 million under Biden but this does not mean this many people stayed in the US.\nIt is impossible to know exactly how many illegal immigrants have come to the US, as many will have evaded law enforcement agencies, but several estimates put the number at around half what Trump stated.\nA report published by the Office of Homeland Security last year estimated the number of illegal immigrants living in the US, as of January 2022, at 11 million.\nIt says about a fifth of them arrived in 2010 or later but the majority arrived before this time, some as early as the 1980s.\nOn US aid to Ukraine, Trump claimed: \"We've spent perhaps $350bn\u2026 and they [Europe] have spent $100bn. What a difference that is.\"\nBBC Verify is unable to find any evidence for Trump's $350bn claim and some figures suggest Europe has spent more as whole when all aid to Ukraine is included.\nThe US is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. But Europe combined has spent more money than the US, according to the Kiel Institute think tank.\nIt calculates that between 24 January 2022 and the end of 2024, Europe as a whole spent $138.7bn on Ukraine, while the US spent $119.7bn.\nThe US Department of Defense has a higher figure of $182.8bn - taking into account a broader range of US military activity in Europe - but this is still considerably less than Trump's figure.\nWe have asked the White House where it comes from.\nCorrection: an earlier version of this article stated that migrant encounters at the south-west border fell to 96,000 at the end of 2024. While this is correct for overall encounters here, the number recorded by Border Patrol was 47,316.\nAdditional reporting by Shayan Sardarizadeh & Anthony Reuben.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

What are they thinking?\"\nHe also accused Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky of not wanting peace adding: \"America will not put up with it for much longer.\"\nFollowing a summit of western leaders over the weekend, the UK and France said they would produce a plan to stop the fighting, which would then be discussed with the US.\nAddressing MPs, Sir Keir said Britain would \"play a leading role\" in any agreed deal including, if necessary, deploying British troops in Ukraine to deter Russia from further attacks. \nTrump has so far not agreed to provide any security guarantees and has instead focused on a deal to open up Ukrainian minerals to US companies.\nHe has argued that the presence of American workers in the country would help discourage Russia from trying to encroach on Ukraine territory.\nAsked by Reform UK leader Nigel Farage if the minerals deal would provide \"enough of a security guarantee\", Sir Keir said the deal \"is not enough on its own\". \nThe prime minister received widespread backing from MPs across different parties, with Conservative former Foreign Secretary James Cleverly saying he had \"not put a foot wrong\" over the weekend. \nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she backed the PM's decision to fund an increase in defence spending by cutting the aid budget and added that she would support him to make further \"difficult choices - including on welfare\". \nSpeaking about the deployment of British troops, the prime minister said he did not take any such move \"lightly\" and promised MPs a vote if that happened. \nHe argued that backing Ukraine was not only \"the right thing to do\" but was also in British interests.\n\"If we do not achieve a lasting peace then the instability and insecurity that hits living standards of working people in Britain, that will only get worse and Putin's appetite for conflict and chaos, that will only grow.\"\nHe later said \"success was not guaranteed but I am not going to let up\". \nRussia has flatly rejected the idea of western troops being sent to Ukraine as part of any peace deal.\nSunday's summit in London came after an explosive spat between Trump and Zelensky at the White House last week.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Trump was \"no longer a reliable ally with respect to Russia\" and that it was time the UK reviewed its dependency on the US. \n\"I don't agree with him,\" replied Sir Keir, adding: \"The US and UK have the closest of relationships - our defence, security and intelligence are completely intertwined.\n\"A huge mistake at a time like this would be to suggest any weakening of that link is the way forward.\"\nLabour MP - and chairwoman of the Foreign Affairs Committee - Emily Thornberry questioned Sir Keir's decision to cut aid in order to bolster defence spending.\nShe said it was \"hard to believe\" there would be enough left in the budget to \"provide meaningful support\" and it could \"hobble\" the prime minister's attempt to show global leadership. \nAt the weekend, President Macron had suggested a partial, month-long truce between Russia and Ukraine, in which both would agree to a truce for four weeks in the air, on the sea and around energy infrastructure, but it would not cover ground fighting along the frontline in the east.\nEl\u00e9onore Caroit, a member of the French foreign affairs committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that President Macron's proposal sent a \"very strong message\" to Europe \"that if we want, we can do something\".\nBut Defence Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC it was \"not a plan that we currently recognise\".\nHe added: \"Certainly there are a number of different options being discussed privately between the UK, France and our allies\u2026 What we are certainly doing is looking at what plan would bring peace as soon as we can, and what plan creates a lasting peace.\"\nThe prime minister hosted the London summit as allies scramble to shape peace negotiations and smooth over fractured relations between Trump and Zelensky.\nAt the summit, Sir Keir announced a four-point plan to work with Ukraine to end the war and defend the country from Russia.\nThe plan involves including Ukraine in talks, continuing to supply it with military aid, boosting its defence capabilities and building a \"coalition of the willing\" to defend a deal to end the fighting.\nThe UK and France are taking a leading role and have both committed to send soldiers to Ukraine, under the proposals.\nBut apart from increasing spending on defence, there appears to be no consensus on a plan to end the war among European leaders.\nDefence Secretary John Healey will visit the US later this week to move discussions forward.\nIn other developments over the weekend:",

Right from the start Arsenal had control of the game,\" said Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Arsenal were ruthless with their finishing, some of the combination play in the final third was sensational.\n\"Martin Odegaard looked back to his best. To a man they were really strong and that centre-back pairing [Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba] is phenomenal.\n\"Arsenal will take some stopping in this competition.\"\nEngland and Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice was one of the players singled out for his performance during the game and said that the Gunners have got the reward for their hard work in recent weeks.\nRice, who had a goal ruled out for offside, said Arsenal were \"fluid\" and possessed the \"enthusiasm, drive and hunger\" that the knockout stages demand.\n\"But we've been playing like this all season,\" he added. \"We feel we've been playing well as a team. Sometimes we score five, sometimes two, sometimes we don't score but [on Tuesday] we did well. It all clicked.\"\nArsenal's lack of a recognised striker has been well documented, with Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz both injured. But six different players contributed to the rout on Tuesday - Odegaard scored twice, along with goals for Jurrien Timber, Mikel Merino, Ethan Nwaneri, Leandro Trossard and Riccardo Calafiori.\nThe emphatic win means that Arsenal can start planning for a trip to Madrid, as they are set to take on the winner of the tie between Real and Atletico, which finished 2-1 to Carlo Ancelotti's side. Next week's second leg takes place at Atletico.\nEthan Nwaneri scored his eighth goal of the season\nArsenal's excellent 17-year-old Nwaneri again showed why there is so much hype and excitement about his future in the game.\nThe academy graduate has been given the task of filling in for Bukayo Saka on the right hand side of Arsenal's attack while the England international is out injured. The teenager has repaid that faith in him with eight goals in 28 games in all competitions.\nThat goal return puts him alongside some of England's most iconic young players.\nMichael Owen and Wayne Rooney scored nine goals each in all competitions when they were aged 17 or younger and Nwaneri now has 16 days before his 18th birthday to try to match or beat that record.\n\"I don't think that he needs any pushing. You see every time what the intention is,\" Arteta said. \"If it comes, it comes and it's great.\n\"I'm really impressed with the way he behaved and the way he played. It's about consistency and now doing it again three days later in another big stadium.\" \nNwaneri also became the third youngest player to score a goal in a knockout stage match in the Champions League after Bojan in April 2008 (17 and 217 days) and Jude Bellingham in April 2021 (17 and 289 days).\n\"He's 17 years old and he's on the biggest stage,\" Rice said.\n\"We've taken [the youngsters] under our wing and they deserve to be playing. You should see them train they way they have no fear and want to perform.\n\"Even if Saka was here Ethan would be still getting minutes because he's that good and works so hard in training. We have so many top young players.\"\nThis video can not be played\nDevastating Arsenal can win Champions League - Sutton\nNwaneri was joined in the starting XI by his team-mate from the academy Myles Lewis-Skelly and the 18-year-old also impressed despite being withdrawn in the first half to avoid him getting sent off.\nLewis-Skelly, who had been booked earlier, put in a late tackle on Richard Ledezma and although he was unpunished, Arteta substituted him moments later.\n\"They play like they have been here for many years,\" captain Odegaard said.\n\"So much quality and confidence, they're ready for it. I'm not worried about them, we enjoy having them in the team and they have a great attitude.\"\nOdegaard, who himself started playing senior football at 15 years old, believes that Lewis-Skelly can use his early withdrawal as a learning experience.\n\"He took that really well,\" he added. \"He knew it was a tricky position to be in. He was on a yellow and had a tough challenge too. He took it well  and we're all there to support and I'm sure he will learn from that too.\"\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\nGet Arsenal news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has signed orders significantly expanding the goods exempted from his new tariffs on Canada and Mexico that were imposed this week.\nIt is the second time in two days that Trump has rolled back his taxes on imports from America's two biggest trade partners, measures that have raised uncertainty for businesses and worried financial markets.\nOn Wednesday, he said he would temporarily spare carmakers from 25% import levies just a day after they came into effect.\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum thanked Trump for the move, while Canada's finance minister said the country would in turn hold off on its threatened second round of retaliatory tariffs on US products.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday morning he had had a \"colourful\" conversation about tariffs in a phone call with Trump.\nThe US president used profane language more than once during Wednesday's heated exchange, according to US and Canadian media reports. \nTrudeau told reporters that a trade war between the two allies was likely for the foreseeable future, despite some targeted relief.\n\"Our goal remains to get these tariffs, all tariffs removed,\" he said.\nA first round of Canadian retaliation targeting C$30bn ($21bn, \u00a316bn) of US goods is already in effect.\nThe trade war tensions have rattled markets and raised fears of economic turbulence. \nOn Thursday afternoon, the leading US stock indexes were all lower, with the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest American companies, ending down nearly 1.8%.\nIn signing the orders, Trump dismissed the suggestion that he was walking back the measures because of concerns about the stock market. \n\"Nothing to do with the market,\" Trump said. \"I'm not even looking at the market, because long term, the United States will be very strong with what's happening.\"\nThe carveout from the duties applies to goods shipped under North America's free trade pact, the US-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA) , which Trump signed during his first term. Items that currently come into the US under the pact's rules include televisions, air conditioners, avocados and beef, according to analysis by the firm Trade Partnership Worldwide.\nA White House official said about 50% of US imports from Mexico and 62% from Canada may still face tariffs. Those proportions could change as firms change their practices in response to the order.\nThe White House has also continued to promote its plans for other tariffs, promising action on 2 April, when officials have said they will unveil recommendations for tailored, \"reciprocal\" trade duties on countries around the world.\nTrump said he agreed to grant the exemptions until 2 April after a phone call with Sheinbaum and they were aimed at helping carmakers and parts suppliers. The measures also reduced tariffs on potash - a key ingredient for fertiliser needed by US farmers - from 25% to 10%.  \nSheinbaum said on Thursday that she had had an \"excellent and respectful\" call with Trump, adding that the two countries would work together to stem the flow of the opioid fentanyl from Mexico into the US and curb the trafficking of guns going the other way.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford, who leads Canada's most populous province, said afterwards that \"a pause on some tariffs means nothing\". \nEarlier, as relief looked likely but before it was announced, he told CNN that the province still planned to go ahead with a 25% tariff on the electricity it provides to 1.5 million homes and businesses in New York, Michigan and Minnesota from Monday.\n\"Honestly, it really bothers me. We have to do this, but I don't want to do this,\" he said.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday dismissed retaliation as counter-productive for trade negotiations. \n\"If you want to be a numbskull like Justin Trudeau and say, 'Oh we're going to do this', then tariffs are probably going to go up,\" he said during a question-and-answer session after a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday. \nGoods worth billions cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and the economies of the three countries are deeply integrated after decades of free trade. \nTrump has argued introducing tariffs will protect American industry and boost manufacturing. However, many economists say tariffs could lead to prices rising for consumers in the US, while warning they could trigger severe economic downturns in Mexico and Canada. \nAbout $1bn in trade enters the US from Mexico and Canada each day that does not claim duty-free exemptions under USMCA, since it has historically enjoyed low or no tariffs, said Daniel Anthony, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide.\n\"Whether importers can or will start claiming USMCA remains to be seen, but it's a huge amount of money at stake,\" he said. \nIn the US, the economy is already starting to show the effects of the disruption from Trump's policies. \nImports spiked in January on the back of tariff fears, with America's trade deficit increasing 34% to more than $130bn (\u00a3100bn), the Commerce Department reported. \nGregory Brown, who leads BenLee, a company that makes big trailers, said he had had to adjust prices multiple times over the last five weeks as a result of Trump's policies, which have included an order, set to go into effect later this month, expanding tariffs on steel and aluminium.\nBut Mr Brown, who attended Mr Bessent's speech, said that for now, his customers are agreeing to pay the higher prices \u2013 a sign that the economy is holding up.\n\"It's a great growth economy,\" he said, noting that the economy had been strong under Biden too.  He said he saw Trump's decision to quickly offer relief from his new tariffs as a sign of a business-friendly president adjusting to the \"business reality\".\nOthers were more worried that the back-and-forth would cause economic damage.\n\"I think we're going to have a recession before whatever succeeds in the future,\" one investment manager said. \"You're going to get the bad before you get the good.\"",

        "article_text": "Florida has launched a criminal investigation into controversial British-American influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate. \nAt the end of February, the brothers flew to the US from Romania, where they face rape and human-trafficking charges - which they deny.\nAndrew Tate, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, are dual US-UK citizens who claim to have made millions from their social media empire.\nTheir online output was controversial even before their legal troubles, with the pair attracting frequent criticism over offensive statements about women.\nThe pair have an American father who worked for the US Air Force in Britain. Their parents met in the UK before moving to the US.\nAfter their parents divorced, their mother moved to Luton, England. The brothers spent time in the UK, where they built their early careers.\nPolice in the UK have linked Andrew Tate to the \"quite terrifying\" radicalisation of boys and young men in a 2024 report into violence against women and girls.\nThe brothers were first arrested in Romania in 2022. They are facing separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK. Both brothers also deny the charges against them in the UK.\nThe brothers had been under a travel ban in Romania for more than two years while they were under investigation.\nSpeculation that they would leave Romania had been mounting ahead of their journey, after the pair went quiet on social media.\nThey flew from Bucharest to Florida on a private jet on 27 February.\nProsecutors said the travel ban had been lifted, and the pair's US passports had been returned to them, but investigations into their alleged crimes have not been dropped and they are expected to return to Romania. \nThe Tates have a large US following and are popular figures among some elements of the American right.\nEarlier in February, some of Andrew Tate's alleged victims said they were \"extremely concerned\" by reports that US officials had asked for his travel restrictions to be relaxed.\nIt came after US special envoy Richard Grenell raised the Tate brothers with Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at the Munich Security Conference.\nHurezeanu said he had not considered Grenell's approach as a \"form of pressure\". Grenell told the Financial Times his support for the brothers was evident.\nThe Tates have been vocal supporters of US President Donald Trump, while Trump's close adviser, Elon Musk, restored Andrew Tate's account on X after he bought the social media platform in 2022.\nIn the US, the brothers are facing a civil lawsuit from a women who alleges they coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. They strongly deny the allegations.\nIn a statement issued on 4 March, Florida's attorney general, James Uthmeier, said that he had directed his office and law enforcement partners \"to conduct a preliminary inquiry into Andrew and Tristan Tate\".\nHe added: \"Based on a thorough review of the evidence, I've directed the Office of Statewide Prosecution to execute search warrants and issue subpoenas in the now-active criminal investigation into the Tate brothers.\"\nIn response, a statement from the Tate brothers' lawyer Joseph McBride called Uthmeier's comments \"inflammatory\" and \"biased\".\n\"He publicly took a side in an ongoing Florida lawsuit where Andrew and Tristan Tate are suing a Florida woman for orchestrating a sophisticated plot to use sex as a weapon to ruin their lives,\" he added.\nThe cases against the Tate brothers in Romania are now being rewritten by prosecutors, who allowed them to leave the country on the condition that they return - possibly as early as the end of March.\nThe pair's request to leave the country was accepted, prosecutors said, but their request for the charges against them to be dropped was rejected.\nThe brothers face a number of civil and criminal legal cases.\nThey are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women in Romania. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape. They deny the charges.\nThey face separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK, which they also deny. In March 2024, a Romanian court ruled they could be extradited to the UK after their case in Romania concluded.\nSeparately, lawyers for four women who claim they were assaulted by Andrew Tate said they were bringing a civil case at the High Court in the UK for \"damages for injuries they suffered as a result\".\nA representative for the Tate brothers said in response that they \"unequivocally deny all allegations\".\nA separate civil case in the UK, which the brothers are contesting, accuses the brothers and a third individual of being serial tax evaders.\nThe brothers have had their properties, vehicles, bank accounts and company shares returned to them by the Romanian authorities, a spokesperson for the brothers said.\nA Ferrari, a Mercedes-Benz, and an Audi A5 were among the vehicles released, the spokesperson said.\nThe assets, which were seized by the authorities in the wake of the brothers' detention in 2022, were released following a court appeal led by their lawyer Eugen Vidineac.\nSome of their assets \"remain under precautionary seizure\", the spokesperson said, but described the ruling as a \"significant step toward justice.\"\nFour women who allege they were sexually abused by Andrew Tate said they were in \"disbelief and feel re-traumatised\" by his departure from Romania.\nIn a joint statement, the four said: \"It is clear that he will now not face criminal prosecution for his alleged crimes in Romania; he will use it as an opportunity to harass further and intimidate witnesses and his accusers, and he will continue to spread his violent, misogynistic doctrine around the world.\"\nThey also urged British authorities to \"finally take action, do something about this terrifying unfolding situation and ensure he faces justice in the UK\".\nMatthew Jury, a lawyer representing the four alleged victims, told the BBC the Trump administration was \"interfering in due process\" in Romania and the UK.\nHe added he didn't think the Tate brothers would \"ever face justice in Romania now\".",

        "article_text": "Are you warm, cool or neutral? How the retro trend of \"getting your colours done\" made a comeback with personalised colour analysis on social media \u2013 and how your perfect colours can \"spark careers, conversations and connections\".\nDo you have cool or medium undertones? Does red brighten your skin or dull you down?\u00a0Questions like these, that may not have crossed your mind before, are now prominent on social media, as users try to define their colour palettes.\u00a0Colour analysis, once considered niche, has seen a surge in popularity, with appointments booked months in advance and apps including TikTok and Instagram flooded with tutorials on how to determine which colours suit you.\u00a0\n\"Before I started offering online consultations, I had people fly in from around the world to see me,\" says Canadian image consultant and colour analyst Carol Brailey.\u00a0\nSince Brailey launched her business back in 2012, and has done thousands of consultations. \"It appeals to people from all walks of life,\" she tells the BBC. \"There's everyone from 17-year-olds to those in their 70s \u2013 I find people are tired of gravitating towards black clothing.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nOn TikTok, Brailey's client transformations have gained millions of views, as has the hashtag #ColorAnalysis, which is often accompanied by filters allowing users to find their palette. But although this technology is new, the practice has been around for decades.\u00a0\u00a0\nColour analysis enjoyed a spell of popularity in the 1980s and early-90s, when \"getting your colours done\" meant visiting a professional colour consultant in person, and being assigned a particular set of hues \u2013 often based on a system of seasons \u2013 that suited you. Broadly speaking, spring meant bright and fresh colours, summer cool and light, autumn was burnt oranges and mossy greens, and winter was deep jewel tones. This surge in interest was largely thanks to the bestselling books Color Me Beautiful by Carole Jackson (which sold more than 13 million copies worldwide) and Color Me a Season by Bernice Kentner.\nHowever, it was in the early-1900s that seasonal colour theory was born in the studio of Johannes Itten, a Swiss painter and art professor. Itten noticed that some of his students' portraits looked more vibrant than others, a difference he attributed to colour. By analysing colours that \"harmonised\" well together, he developed the seasonal analysis tool still used today, grouping people into summer, autumn, winter or spring.\u00a0\nBrailey puts the modern-day revival down to how visual we have become. \"Whether it's uploading Instagram pictures, recording TikTok content, or even Zoom meetings, we have become a very visual society.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nAfter her consultations, it's not unusual to see tears, she says. \"People cry because they've never seen themselves look so vibrant. In my years of being in the industry, I have witnessed people's lives change, with promotions and new jobs, because it starts a confidence boost.\"\u00a0\nTabitha Lofts didn't cry after her colour consultation, but she did opt to have a total makeover, dyeing her hair, switching up her make-up routine, and introducing colours to her wardrobe that she hadn't previously worn.\u00a0\"I did the whole shebang\", she laughs, adding, \"I liked it, and I felt so different.\" Before her consultation, Tabitha thought she had a warm spring or summer palette, explaining, \"I was so sure that I was warm toned, because I burn in the Sun, but it was the complete opposite.\u00a0I learnt I'm cool toned, suit silver jewellery, and my favourite colours weren't my colours at all. Now I wear lots of cobalt blue, a shade I'd never worn before.\"\u00a0\nMore like this:\n- How one surprising image kick-started the 90s\n- How to transform your home with art\n- How Scandinavian dressing can make us happier\nFor Lofts, who is a nutritionist and content creator, colour analysis was a way of building confidence.\u00a0\"I was quitting fake tan, as I was addicted, and relied on it to bring my outfits together,\" she says. \"It was confidence in a bottle, but I need to find it elsewhere.\" She described getting dressed and not \"understanding\" her skin tone, which is where she got the idea for the image consultation.\u00a0\"The results really changed my mind about my pale skin. I used to think about it with negative connotations and assumed it made me look icy, but now I know I can be warm, even without warm visuals.\"\u00a0\nTo those who are dismissive of colour analysis, Lofts admits it is not the be all and end all. \"Although I got a lot from it, I still wear colours that aren't in my palette. It's not a prescription.\"\u00a0\nGrowing up in Costa Rica, fashion designer and stylist Micah Lumsden has always gravitated towards bright colours, as she finds that wearing them lifts her mood. But it was an experience while at fashion school that made her want to better understand colour theory.\u00a0\"We were studying colour analysis, and my skin tone wasn't understood by my teachers. I got several back-up consultations from other students, but there were so many misconceptions about dark skin,\" she tells the BBC. \"Comments like, 'Every black person looks good in red,' as well as the idea that 'those with darker skin look good in every colour'.\"\u00a0\nIt was this lack of awareness that prompted Lumsden to launch styling consultancy Cocoa Styling. \"I started working with painters and make-up artists, the people who really understand colour theory.\"\u00a0She now has clients around the world, and has noticed more male clients on her books. \"Guys do care about fashion,\" she says. \"I used to see one man per 10 clients, but now it's one per five.\"\u00a0\nAs a stylist, she approaches wardrobes with colour at the forefront, rather than design. \"Most people will look good in a tailored blazer and T-shirt, but the personalisation of colour gives an outfit a special touch.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nColour analysis is often expensive, but Lumsden doesn't want that to be a deterrent. She's also sceptical of online colour-analysis filters being the answer. \"It's hard to give an unbiased reading of filters, and screens also reflect light.\"\nInstead, she suggests holding up items from around the home against your face, or going to a local craft store to buy felt patches. \"You can use blankets, cushions... whatever. Hold them up against your face in the mirror, and take a selfie. Once you've got a collection of selfies, place them next to each other and ask, do I look better with blue and purples? Or yellows and oranges? If it's the latter, you have a warm palette, if it's the former, you're probably cool.\"\u00a0\nWe know fashion runs in cycles, but many believe that knowing your personal palette could be a way to break up with fast fashion. \"Trends rotate so quickly, so knowing your best colours is a great way of harnessing what suits you and eliminating everything else,\" Ellie Richards tells the BBC. She's the founder of Nuude Studio in Queenstown, New Zealand, and approaches fashion through psychology. Colour, in her opinion, is the most important tool.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"There is a science to clothes changing your mood, your behaviour and people's perception of you,\" she says. \"When you put on a colour that suits you, it's a powerful tool, because we're instantly more confident and aligned in personal identity.\"\u00a0\nThe easiest way to see colour psychology in action, she says, is in films and TV series. \"If we look at Euphoria, for example, Cassie (played by Sydney Sweeney) is often dressed in light blue to show an angel-like innocence, whereas Maddy (played by Alexa Demie) dresses in more dark maroon tones to signify her influence.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nLook at some of the trending colours of 2025, and black doesn't feature. Instead, we're seeing bold cardinal reds, striking marigolds and dusty-rose pinks. According to Richards, we've entered an era of being \"bold\".\u00a0\n\"The pandemic days of wearing grey sweats are over, and instead we've emerged seeking fun, playful looks.\" She cites social media as influencing our style, too. \"It's had a massive effect. On TikTok, creators need to stand out and they can do so by wearing bright, eye-catching colours. Those videos are seen by millions of people, and so it's normalised these bold looks.\"\nRichards is passionate about the benefits of colour analysis. \"A deep understanding of personal style and colour can spark careers, conversations and connections,\" she says, acknowledging that it can be a little daunting at first, but advising the curious to start by adding colour little by little.\u00a0\"One option is to wear muted shades of a colour, or accessories.\"\nDespite a colour consultation confirming that cobalt blue suits her best, Lofts still gravitates towards black. \"It's easy to wear,\" she says with a smile. \"But I'm trying to be more adventurous.\"\nAs a personal trainer, she sees plenty of online content pushing \"optimisation\" and \"being the best version of yourself\". She views colour analysis as part of that trend, but believes the most important thing is feeling comfortable in your own skin. \"Everyone is focused on self-improvement, and there's a vanity to it,\" she says. \"But it doesn't have to be serious. Experimenting with colour should be fun, playful, and free from judgement.\" She laughs. \"Even if you don't stick to your assigned palette.\"\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

The name is also used in the M\u0101ori version of New Zealand's national anthem, which is commonly heard before the English version. \n\"If other members do not like certain words, they don't have to use them. But it's not a matter of order, and I don't expect to have further points of order raised about it,\" he added. \nMPs are allowed to use any of the country's three official languages - English, M\u0101ori and New Zealand sign language - when speaking in Parliament. \nThe objection by Peters, who is M\u0101ori, arose last month, when Green MP Ricardo Men\u00e9ndez March used it during a parliamentary session.\n\"Why is someone who applied to come to this country in 2006 allowed to ask a question of this Parliament that changes this country's name without the referendum and sanction of the New Zealand people?\" Peters asked.\nMen\u00e9ndez March is originally from Mexico but is a New Zealand citizen, as all MPs must be. \nShane Jones, another government minister who is a member of Peters' New Zealand First party and is also M\u0101ori, questioned \"the appropriateness of recent immigrants telling M\u0101ori what the name of our country should be?\"\nAt the time, Brownlee encouraged lawmakers to use the name Aotearoa New Zealand instead in order to avoid any confusion but said it was not a requirement. \nNot all M\u0101ori have the same connection to the name Aotearoa, which was originally used to describe New Zealand's North Island only. However, it is often used by non-M\u0101ori out of respect for indigenous people. \nWinston Peters said on Tuesday that he disagreed with Brownlee's ruling, Radio New Zealand (RNZ) reported.\nHe added that he only had a problem with Aotearoa being used in Parliament, not of M\u0101ori in general, and that, if a question was addressed to him in future using the name, he would not answer. \nThe use of M\u0101ori in public has grown considerably across New Zealand in recent decades, following advocacy from indigenous leaders. \nA petition was launched in 2022 by the M\u0101ori Party, an official political party, to officially change the country's name to Aotearoa, which received more than 70,000 signatures.\n\"New Zealand is a Dutch name and has no connection to this whenua [land]. How many people in Aotearoa can even point to 'old' Zealand on a map?\" M\u0101ori Party Co-leader Rawiri Waititi said at the time. \nSince the current administration came into power in 2023, it has required that government departments prioritise their English names and communicate primarily in English, unless they are specifically related to M\u0101ori.\nAnother of the coalition's members, the Act party, is also seeking to redefine the terms of New Zealand's founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi, which has been met with fierce opposition.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump's latest move has left investors in a spin - for good reason.\nWith the stroke of a pen, the tariffs he has imposed on Canada, Mexico and China have turned back the clock 70 years, erasing decades of globalisation.\nTariffs, he says is a beautiful word, signalling jobs and riches for America.\nHowever, history tells us that those firing the opening shots in a trade war also  suffer heavy casualties. Despite the president's rhetoric, American consumers are  on the front line.\nThese extra taxes mean that Americans are facing the highest level of tariffs on goods being imported to their country since the 1930s. \nVegetables from Mexico, wheat from Canada, toys and T-shirts from China are all in the firing line. Retailers of such items can have very narrow profit margins and will raise prices quickly to cover the tariffs. \nConsumers will notice the price rises.\nGroceries may be one of Trump's favourite words, but his own electorate may not appreciate the increase in bills they could face. Assuming no further tariffs, economists suggest US inflation, already higher than expected, could rise further in the second half of this year.\nA price worth paying \"to make America great again\"? Look no further than the laundry room for a cautionary tale.\nDuring his first-term of office in 2018, Trump imposed tariffs of up to 50% on imported washing machines after American producer Whirlpool complained about cheap South Korean competition. \nThose rivals - Samsung and LG - then set up in America, creating close to 2,000 jobs.\nBut at what price? An imported washing machine cost an American shopper almost a third more at the start of 2023, just before tariffs were abolished, than five years previously.\nAdd up the costs of tariffs and one study claims each of those jobs cost Americans the equivalent of more than $800,000 (\u00a3627,000).\nThose tariffs of course meant revenue for American governments and that source has increased dramatically in recent years, following the raft of tariffs Trump also imposed in his first term on China - most of which were retained under President Joe Biden. \nHowever, the amount netted is equivalent to a tax rise on American households of up to $300. Ultimately it is they who are footing the bill - and will continue to do so.\nThen consider the impact on American manufacturers who have businesses spanning Canada, Mexico and perhaps even China. Overall, economists think we could be looking at a hit to US growth of up to 1% - not enough to prompt a recession, but unwelcome nonetheless.\nIn sheer numbers terms, the hit to the Canadian economy could be greater, economists say. It sells more than $400bn worth of goods to America every year, accounting for a fifth of its income. \nBut it has the capacity to lower interest rates, and healthy public finances, providing policy makers with scope to cushion the blow for Canadians.\nThe damage to Mexico's national income could be less severe, but its central bank has less capacity to cut interest rates making it harder to deflect the pain.\nAll of this will be anxiously watched by the European Union, likely next in line for those Trump tariffs. Germany, already in a fragile state, accounts for about a third of the goods sold by the EU to the US.\nChina, despite being the target of Trump's repeated trade blows could actually be less vulnerable. Its exports to the US account for less than 3% of national income - easily made up elsewhere. \nIronically, some of this resilience is down to the tariffs imposed by President Trump last time round. China simply looked for new markets. \nCountries like the UK could also benefit from a furthering of such trade diversion, more access to cheaper goods -  something that could  keep our own inflation down.\nA key point about trade wars is that there are winners as well as losers - particularly for those countries outside President Trump's firing line. Vietnam and Malaysia for example saw their exports grow rapidly during President Trump's last term as they scrambled to replace China in selling to America.\nIf the UK continues to escape the wrath of President Trump, we could actually benefit from closer trading links with his country and indeed from greater foreign investment, if we looked to be a more certain environment than some of our competitors. But of course, our fate remains unclear.\nAs it stands, the prospects for global growth in 2025 have dulled, but a recession appears very unlikely. However, in Trump world we have learnt very quickly to expect the unexpected - so much still depends on what happens from here.\nAnd that uncertainty itself is harming business confidence both in the US and around the world, putting off key decisions about where to invest and create jobs. \nWeaponising uncertainty too comes at a price - even on home soil.

        "article_text": "Antarctica's remote and mysterious current has a profound influence on the climate, food systems and Antarctic ecosystems. Can we stop it weakening by 2050?\nFlowing clockwise around Antarctica, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is the strongest ocean current on the planet. It's five times stronger than the Gulf Stream and more than 100 times stronger than the Amazon River.\nIt forms part of the global ocean \"conveyor belt\" connecting the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans. The system regulates Earth's climate and pumps water, heat and nutrients around the globe.\nBut fresh, cool water from melting Antarctic ice is diluting the salty water of the ocean, potentially disrupting the vital ocean current.\nOur new research suggests the Antarctic Circumpolar Current will be 20% slower by 2050 as the world warms, with far-reaching consequences for life on Earth.\nThe Antarctic Circumpolar Current is like a moat around the icy continent.\nThe current helps to keep warm water at bay, protecting vulnerable ice sheets. It also acts as a barrier to invasive species such as southern bull kelp and any animals hitching a ride on these rafts, spreading them out as they drift towards the continent. It also plays a big part in regulating the Earth's climate.\nUnlike better known ocean currents \u2013 such as the Gulf Stream along the United States' east coast, the Kuroshio Current near Japan, and the Agulhas Current off the coast of South Africa \u2013 the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is not as well understood. This is partly due to its remote location, which makes obtaining direct measurements especially difficult.\nOcean currents respond to changes in temperature, salt levels, wind patterns and sea ice extent. So the global ocean conveyor belt is vulnerable to climate change on multiple fronts.\nPrevious research suggested one vital part of this conveyor belt could be headed for a catastrophic collapse.\nTheoretically, warming water around Antarctica should speed up the current. This is because density changes and winds around Antarctica dictate the strength of the current. Warm water is less dense (or heavy) and this should be enough to speed up the current. But observations to date indicate the strength of the current has remained relatively stable over recent decades.\nThis stability persists despite melting of surrounding ice, a phenomenon that had not been fully explored in scientific discussions in the past.\nAdvances in ocean modelling allow a more thorough investigation of the potential future changes.\nWe used Australia's fastest supercomputer and climate simulator in Canberra to study the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The underlying model, Access-OM2-01, has been developed by Australian researchers from various universities as part of the Consortium for Ocean-Sea Ice Modelling in Australia.\nThe model captures features others often miss, such as eddies. So it's a far more accurate way to assess how the current's strength and behaviour will change as the world warms. It picks up the intricate interactions between ice melting and ocean circulation.\nIn this future projection, cold, fresh melt water from Antarctica migrates north, filling the deep ocean as it goes. This causes major changes to the density structure of the ocean. It counteracts the influence of ocean warming, leading to an overall slowdown in the current of as much as 20% by 2050.\nThe consequences of a weaker Antarctic Circumpolar Current are profound and far-reaching.\nAs the main current that circulates nutrient-rich waters around Antarctica, it plays a crucial role in the Antarctic ecosystem.\nWeakening of the current could reduce biodiversity and decrease the productivity of fisheries that many coastal communities rely on. It could also aid the entry of invasive species such as southern bull kelp to Antarctica, disrupting local ecosystems and food webs.\nA weaker current may also allow more warm water to penetrate southwards, exacerbating the melting of Antarctic ice shelves and contributing to global sea-level rise. Faster ice-melting could then lead to further weakening of the current, commencing a vicious spiral of current slowdown.\nThis disruption could extend to global climate patterns, reducing the ocean's ability to regulate climate change by absorbing excess heat and carbon in the atmosphere.\nWhile our findings present a bleak prognosis for the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the future is not predetermined.

Sohail (2025The Antarctic Circumpolar Current keeps Antarctica isolated from the rest of the global ocean (Credit: T. Sohail (2025), Environmental Research Letters)The Antarctic Circumpolar Current is like a moat around the icy continent.The current helps to keep warm water at bay, protecting vulnerable ice sheets. So the global ocean conveyor belt is vulnerable to climate change on multiple fronts.Previous research suggested one vital part of this conveyor belt could be headed for a catastrophic collapse.Theoretically, warming water around Antarctica should speed up the current. Can we stop it weakening by 2050?Flowing clockwise around Antarctica, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is the strongest ocean current on the planet. It could also aid the entry of invasive species such as southern bull kelp to Antarctica, disrupting local ecosystems and food webs.A weaker current may also allow more warm water to penetrate southwards, exacerbating the melting of Antarctic ice shelves and contributing to global sea-level rise.",

Their price can run up to $700 (\u00a3550), depending on size.\nDanii explains that they came up with the idea after hearing revellers complain not just about the expense but also about the weight of the backpack pieces. \"'I'm paying this much money but then it's heavy and by the time it's lunch I just want to throw it away',\" Danni recalls people saying.\nCarnicycle rents the backpacks to masqueraders long enough so that they can pose for photos, but are freed from carrying their load during the parade.\nDanii and Carnicycle's co-founder Luke Harris \u2013 who both hold down full-time jobs in addition to their environmental initiative - are not the only ones dedicating their spare time to making Trinidad's carnival both fun and eco-friendly\nLawyer Aliyah Clarke and fashion designer Kaleen Sanois started a side business called 2nd Closet - a pop-up thrift shop where people can buy and sell pre-owned clothing.\nThe two have also been making video tutorials with tips on how to transform costumes into beachwear and outfits for other occasions.\nAliya told the BBC it was something she first did for herself: \"After I was finished with my costume I would rip it apart, literally down to the wire, and figure out how to make this into something else to wear outside of carnival.\"\nNow she is sharing her ideas in a video segment the two millennials have dubbed \"Tipsy Tuesday\".\nThey also offer a closet-sorting service, which involves coming to a person's home and sorting through unwanted clothing, to rescue items fit for sale at their pop-up thrift shop.\nIn what Kaleen believes is a testament to the work they have been doing, they were asked to sort the sprawling closet of Machel Montano, a musician known as the \"King of Soca\" and a superstar in the carnival world.\n\"Clothes are personal things, especially for somebody like Machel who has so many big moments tied to his pieces,\" Kaleen explains.\nAfter sorting through Machel's shoes and clothes, 2nd Closet organised a two-day pop-up shop, giving people a chance to buy items worn by Machel on stage and in his music videos.\n\"People came with pictures, and were like 'I'm looking for this piece',\" Aliyah recalls of fans' enthusiasm for the second-hand items.\nBut costumes and outfits are not the only items being recycled to make Trinidad's festivities more environmentally friendly.\nAt Fete with the Saints, a party many regard as one of the best of Trinidad's carnival, food is eaten with biodegradable wooden cutlery and the drinks are poured into reusable cups.\nThe organisers of the fete -  a fundraiser for one of Trinidad and Tobago's top secondary schools \u2013 also hire \"bin detectives\" to ensure patrons properly sort and dispose their rubbish for recycling.\nIt is estimated that this year the bin detectives helped to more than double the amount of recyclables captured, compared with the two previous years combined.\n\"Over the past three years we've actually prevented over one million single-use plastics from entering the landfill, I think maybe over five tonnes of glass,\" says Vandana Mangroo, co-founder of Close the Loop Caribbean, a company which started working with the organisers of Fete with the Saints in 2023 to make the event more sustainable.\nJoseph Hadad, co-chairman of the party's organising committee, says that those behind the event knew that their efforts to make it greener would \"add some layer of costs and more labour\".

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nRussell won't 'bow down' to Verstappen\nGeorge Russell looks you in the eye and oozes self-belief as he describes how he feels heading into his seventh season in Formula 1, his first as effective leader of the Mercedes team.\n\"I know my time will come,\" the 27-year-old Briton says. \"And I've just got to ensure that I keep on performing. And whether it's this year or next year, it'll come.\n\"And if I keep delivering those results, as I did over these last three years against the best driver of all time, I believe I will get myself in the fight and hopefully a world championship to my name.\"\nRussell's self-confidence is deeply held, and has been there for as long as he has been racing. But it has been nurtured by the time he spent at Mercedes as team-mate to Lewis Hamilton.\nLast year, Russell became the first driver in Hamilton's 18-year career to comprehensively beat the seven-time champion in qualifying over a full season. The head-to-head score was 19-five to Russell, at an average advantage of 0.171 seconds a lap.\nAnd over their three years together since 2022, Russell finished ahead in the championship in two of them.\nThere are caveats - not least that Hamilton's final year at Mercedes came after he had told the team he was leaving them for Ferrari at the end of it.\nBut, as Russell puts it in an exclusive interview with BBC Sport: \"The results speak for themselves. And I don't have anything I need to prove or show.\n\"I am proud of the results I've achieved going up against somebody like Lewis.\n\"At the end of 2021, statistically and in terms of perception, Lewis was the greatest of all time. And I've had three years against the greatest of all time, and I finished ahead of him two out of the three years I had as team-mates. And finished ahead more times in 'quali' and more times in the race.\n\"If this was a different time or a different era, if you finish ahead of Lewis Hamilton, you're a world champion.\"\nWith Hamilton's departure, Russell, becomes the senior driver at Mercedes. His new team-mate is Andrea Kimi Antonelli, an 18-year-old Italian prodigy who has been on Mercedes' books for several years.\n\"He's a great kid,\" Russell says. \"He's very young, but he's a really nice guy. Super-fast, of course.\n\"Being thrown in at the deep end, which is going to be a big challenge. But in terms of raw speed, I don't think you can question it. And there's going to be an interesting new dynamic.\"\nHamilton's departure, Russell says, referencing the explosion of interest the move to Ferrari has created, \"has been good for everyone\".\n\"This is turning a page,\" Russell says about a team that had employed Hamilton for 12 years. \"It's a new chapter. And I don't suddenly feel any additional responsibility.\"\nAnd what does he think Hamilton faces at Ferrari, alongside new team-mate Charles Leclerc, against whom Russell has raced since they were boys in karting?\n\"Charles is a fantastic driver,\" Russell says. \"No doubt about that. So I'm going to be really intrigued to see how that pans out because they're two amazing drivers.\n\"He's obviously entering an Italian team where Charles has been very much the number one for the past six years. It's quite an interesting dynamic, but I think it'll be close between the two of them.\"\nGeorge Russell and Max Verstappen criticised each other publically after a dispute at last year's Qatar Grand Prix\nThere is one big elephant in the room as Mercedes head into 2025 - and its name is Max Verstappen.\nTeam boss Toto Wolff has said the team \"very much hope that the 2025 line-up will be the line-up going forward\". But it is no secret that that Wolff courted Verstappen last year, and still has hopes of attracting him to the team - perhaps as early as 2026.\nIf he succeeds, one of the current drivers - both of whom have been nurtured by the team for years - would have to find a seat elsewhere.\nRussell is aware of this as a potential scenario, but professes not to be remotely concerned about it.\n\"I don't think there's any pressure whatsoever,\" he says \"All I need to do is continue doing what I'm doing, continue doing what I've done my whole career.\n\"So that changes nothing. And it's not even something I'm thinking about. Because I 100% back myself. It's as simple as that. You perform and everything will be there for you.\n\"I want to go up against the best. I don't feel that my ability is in question.\"\nThe Verstappen question is given added edge when it comes to Russell because of their personal history. The pair had a major falling out at the end of last season and there is no sign of relations thawing this. \nRussell says: \"I wasn't going to just stand and be bullied around. People seem to always back down to him. And that's just not how I go about my business.\n\"I'm not there to be best mates with a world champion. I'm here to win. And that's his mentality as well. There's no love lost.\n\"I've never been scared to race against Max. I've always put up a fight.\"\n\nGeorge Russell set the fastest time on the final day of pre-season testing in Bahrain on 28 February\nTense as the situation may be between Russell and Verstappen, any battles between them may not be for a race win at the start of the season, Russell believes.\n\"I don't think either of us right now have a car that potentially is capable of beating the McLaren,\" he says.\n\"McLaren, without doubt, look by far the strongest. Especially their race pace looks pretty impressive.\"\nMercedes won four races last year - two each for Russell and Hamilton - and have come into 2025 hoping for a car with more rounded abilities that can be competitive everywhere, rather than only on certain tracks and in certain conditions, as last year.\n\"There's definitely improvements throughout the car, no doubt about it,\" Russell says. \"Naturally, there's always something you need to work on.\n\"So, you know, we struggled a bit with low-speed understeer last year. There's still signs of that that we're still trying to get on top of, and we think we've got some things in the locker to try and cure those issues. But definitely the car's feeling a bit more together.\"\nRussell's focus this year will not only be on the track. As a director of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, he will also be forced to confront the concerns many in F1 have about the conduct of Mohammed Ben Sulayem, the president of governing body the FIA.\nA series of Ben Sulayem's actions have angered the drivers in recent years, and over the winter, new rules codifying a process by which drivers can face race bans for swearing have increased concerns. \nRussell chooses his words carefully, but is firm about the drivers' convictions.\n\"Things have gone a little bit out of hand in the recent months with some of the things that have been going on,\" he says, adding that he feels the FIA's stance is \"unnecessary\".\n\"Not only we're racing drivers,\" he says, \"we're personalities, and if you are the individual who wants to swear as much as you like, that has a certain impact on your brand and your perception regardless of the FIA getting involved.\n\"There's times and a place. You have to ensure that our emotions stay real and true, especially when it comes to the (in-car) radio, and potentially an interview straight after the race. That's what's so pure about it.\n\"If you're talking on a Thursday afternoon in front of a number of people, maybe swearing is not really necessary or required. But when it comes to that raw emotion, you need to let us be as authentic as possible.\"\nAntonelli ready for 'big responsibility' of replacing Hamilton\nWho are the rookies joining the F1 grid in 2025? \nWho will win F1 drivers' title?

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nJonas turned professional in 2017 and has won 16 fights, lost two and drawn one \nNatasha Jonas v Lauren Price\nVenue: Royal Albert Hall, London Date: Friday, 7 March\nCoverage: Follow live text commentary from 20:00 GMT and radio coverage from 21:00 on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Sounds, BBC Sport website & app\nSetbacks lead to comebacks. Ages like a fine wine. A happy fighter is a dangerous fighter. Natasha Jonas' career lends itself to plenty of overused boxing cliches.\nA pioneer of women's boxing for more than a decade, the 40-year-old headlines an all-female card at London's iconic Royal Albert Hall on Friday.\nJonas will put her WBC and IBF welterweight titles on the line against Wales' WBA champion Lauren Price.\nPrice, 30, is the unbeaten Olympic golden girl brimming with confidence. To use another stock sporting phrase, she predicts a passing of the torch.\nLet's not write Liverpool's history-maker off just yet, though.\nToxteth-born Jonas was the first British female to ever box at an Olympic Games. She has overcome injuries, disappointing defeats and juggled boxing with motherhood.\nThrough stellar punditry work or as the first black woman to obtain a British Boxing Board of Control manager's licence, Jonas continues to make waves outside the ring too.\nBut her life could easily have panned out very differently. Speaking to BBC Sport, Jonas reflects on the 'sliding doors' moments which led to her becoming a two-weight world champion.\nJonas v Price - All you need to know\nBelfast, New York & plenty of controversy\nJonas caught the sporting bug as a four-year-old watching the Seoul 1988 Olympics. \nAlthough her memory of those Games is somewhat patchy, she remembers \"being overwhelmed and excited by all the sport that was happening\". \nTwo decades later she was nicknamed 'Miss GB' for her own Olympic appearance.\nWhen Jonas qualified for London 2012 at an event in China, she shared a heartwarming moment with her mother. \n\"That's when Mum told me at the airport how proud she was and that when I was a little girl, watching the Olympics on TV, I told her one day I wanted to be there,\" Jonas adds.\n\"Sometimes kids have big ideas. Sometimes life and the world gets in the way. But after 24 years and trying hundreds of sports, I got there.\n\"So looking back, I could say the '88 Games was the most pivotal event of my career.\"\nThis video can not be played\nIQ, speed & accuracy - why Jonas is confident for Price bout\nAs a teenager, Jonas dreamed of representing her country on the global stage, but not as a pugilist.\n\"I watched Rachel Yankey and Mia Hamm and always thought 'I'm a well better footballer',\" she says.\nJonas is \"not the most academic\" but buckled down to earn a football scholarship at St Peter's College in New Jersey.\n\"America was the place to be,\" she says, with only a handful of English women's football teams operating at a professional level at the time. \nBut a budding football career was cut devastatingly short when Jonas tore her cruciate ligament while in the States. \n\"If my injury hadn't have happened I definitely wouldn't be getting punched in the face for a living. It was a big turning point,\" Jonas adds.\nHer sister, Nikita Parris, has 72 caps for England and was part of the 2022 Euros winning squad.\nAsked if she would swap her career for a major trophy, Jonas replies: \"I'd rather go on to become an undisputed boxing world champion than a football World Cup winner.\"\nJonas is trained by Joe Gallagher, who has trained six world champions, including Liam Smith\nWhen Jonas returned to England she lost friendship groups made through football and, with her knee in a brace, began to put on weight.\nShe briefly worked in call centres but was sacked from all seven jobs.\n\"Now looking back as an adult, I recognise that I was depressed,\" Jonas says. \"I lost my identity. Everyone said I was going to play for Liverpool and England but now I was no longer 'Tasha the footballer' but just Tasha.\"\nIn a bid to regain her fitness, Jonas, aged 21, stepped into the legendary Rotunda Amateur Boxing Gym.\n\"All the lads were like 'who is she?'. They weren't used to having a girl in their gym,\" she recalls.\n\"After a warm-up, the coach asked us to get into pairs to do bags. I thought I'd be the little girl who is last to be picked, like when I used to play football with my cousins.\"\nInstead, Jonas was greeted by the kindness of future light-middleweight world champion Liam Smith - one of the popular boys in the gym. When he saw a deflated Jonas put her head down, he offered to partner up.\n\"I don't know if I would or wouldn't have stuck it out if he hadn't done that, but one little gesture from Liam made such a difference - there was no more awkwardness in the gym after that,\" Jonas adds.\nJonas beat American Quanitta Underwood at London 2012 but missed out on a medal after losing to Katie Taylor in the quarter-finals\nJonas called time on her amateur career in 2014 with a record of 57 wins and 26 defeats. She gave birth to her daughter, Mila, and was happy to never box again.\nThat soon changed after the pro debut of a trailblazing Irishwoman and a phone call from a former Team GB team-mate.\n\"I did some punditry work for Katie Taylor's debut and Tom Stalker phoned me afterwards,\" Jonas explains.\n\"He said there will be a lot of opportunity for pro females now and asked if I'd ever think of coming back? I said 'shut up, Tom'.\"\nJonas says she was \"happy with her routine\". Mila had turned two and was in nursery and the media work was keeping her busy.\nBut Stalker's words kept ringing in her ear. After speaking to her immediate family, Jonas realised the boxing fire was still burning.\n\"I phoned two cousins, my mum and dad,\" Jonas adds. \"I trusted their judgement and they knew the good and bad side to boxing. \n\"They were there for me when I cried for two days, after losing to Katie in the amateurs. \n\"But they all gave me their support and said I had nothing to worry about, especially as far as the baby is concerned.\"\nTurning pro was a decision that paid off. In February 2022, Jonas stopped Chris Namus to become light-middleweight world champion and has since won all five world-title level fights.\n\"If I could go back and talk to myself in some of those hardest moments earlier in life, I'd say 'chin up, kid, it all works out in the end',\" she says.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "Influential soul, jazz and funk producer and composer Roy Ayers has died at the age of 84.\nIn a statement posted on Facebook, his family said: \"It is with great sadness that the family of legendary vibraphonist, composer, and producer Roy Ayers announce his passing which occurred on March 4 2025 in New York City after a long illness.\"\nThey described him as \"highly influential and sought after as a music collaborator.\"\nAyers' own biggest hit was the mellow track Everybody Loves the Sunshine, which was covered by artists like d'Angelo and sampled by others including Mary J Blige and Tyler, the Creator.\n\nBut he was so much more than his best-known record. A pioneer of nu-soul and jazz funk, he was a key figure in the 90s acid jazz movement. \nHappy and Blurred Lines singer Pharrell Williams has described him as one of his greatest musical inspirations. \nAyers had a huge influence on many RnB and hip-hop stars, particularly in the 90s, with artists like Tribe Called Quest, Mary J Blige and Jill Scott sampling his earlier work on tracks like Bonita Applebaum, My Life and Watching Me.\nHe also worked with Guru and The Roots. Erykah Badu called him \"the king of neo soul\".\nMore recently, Calvin Harris told BBC Radio 2 that Ayers \"just stood out, his music is amazing and just so intricate... everything just sounds so rich and warm\". \nAyers performed at Glastonbury several times; his last performance there was in 2019.\nHe also wrote and produced the soundtrack for the blaxploitation film Coffy starring Pam Grier.\nAyers could play several instruments, including the flute and trumpet but he became synonymous with the vibraphone, a percussion instrument that looks similar to a xylophone but has a set of metal bars rather than wood.\nHis other hits include Running Away and Searchin', with his band Roy Ayers Ubiquity, who were also behind Everybody Loves the Sunshine. \nRoy Edward Ayers Jr was born into a musical family in Los Angeles on 10 September 1940. \nHis mum Ruby was a school teacher and piano teacher, while his dad, Roy Sr, was a parking attendant and trombonist.\nAyers began playing the piano at the age of five and went on to play several instruments and sing in the church choir before plumping for the vibraphone.\nJazz star Lionel Hampton may have had something to do with that. Ayers attended a Lionel Hampton Big Band concert when he was just five.

Ayers performed at Glastonbury several times; his last performance there was in 2019.He also wrote and produced the soundtrack for the blaxploitation film Coffy starring Pam Grier.Ayers could play several instruments, including the flute and trumpet but he became synonymous with the vibraphone, a percussion instrument that looks similar to a xylophone but has a set of metal bars rather than wood.His other hits include Running Away and Searchin', with his band Roy Ayers Ubiquity, who were also behind Everybody Loves the Sunshine. \"Ayers' own biggest hit was the mellow track Everybody Loves the Sunshine, which was covered by artists like d'Angelo and sampled by others including Mary J Blige and Tyler, the Creator.But he was so much more than his best-known record.

        "article_text": "Donald Trump has been threatening major tariffs on America's two largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico, for more than a month. It now appears that the day of reckoning is at hand.\nThe risk for the president is that his sweeping tariffs, which also target China, may drive up prices for businesses and consumers in the months ahead, damaging the health of the US economy - the issue that Americans say they care about most.\nThe economy and inflation was at the top of voter concerns last November \u2013 concerns Trump promised to address as he stormed back to the White House, partly on the back of lingering discontent about soaring prices early in the Biden presidency.\nTrump can comfortably boast that he has delivered many of his most striking campaign promises \u2013 including slashing federal jobs, stepping up immigration enforcement and recognising two sexes only.\nBut on inflation, the new Trump administration has made little tangible progress. Sky-high egg prices have been a daily reminder. And while the mass culling of chickens in response to bird flu has played a major role, the cost of the daily staple for many Americans has kept inflation front and centre in voters' minds.\nAs Trump confirmed on Monday that 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican-made goods would indeed be coming into effect, US stock markets took their biggest hit of the year, providing an early indication of the economic turbulence his policies could create. And Trump's tariffs on Mexican food imports, in particular, could hit Americans where they feel it the most \u2013 in higher prices at the grocery store.\nAccording to a CBS survey conducted last week, 82% of Americans say they think the economy should be a \"high\" priority for the president. Only 30% said that about tariffs.\nOnly 36% of respondents think Trump is prioritising the economy \"a lot\" \u2013 compared to 68% for tariffs. Just 29% believe Trump is prioritising inflation. Views on the state of the economy remain generally dour, as 60% said it is \"bad\", compared to 58% who had the same view last year.\nPublic opinion of Trump's handling of the economy as a whole is within the margin of error on the survey, with 51% approving. That exactly matches his overall job rating, suggesting that the fate of this president, like those of his predecessors, will hinge on the strength of the economy.\nAccording to Clifford Young, president of public affairs at polling company Ipsos, Trump is still in the honeymoon period of his presidency, when Americans will give him room to manoeuvre.\nTypically, he said, this benefit of the doubt for a new president lasts about six months \u2013 but that can be cut short if the economy suffers some kind of dramatic shift. Trump argues that his tariffs will boost US manufacturing, raise tax revenue and spur investment \u2013 but most economists say that prices for Americans are likely to rise, potentially in a similar timeframe.\nOn Tuesday night, in a primetime speech to a joint session of Congress, Trump will have a chance to make the case that the short-term pain of his tariff plan will lead to long-term benefits. It's his chance to convince the American public to keep his honeymoon going.\n\"I'd be interested to see how he links government efficiency to the economy, global tariffs to the economy, even immigration to the economy,\" said Young. \"Ideally, he would make an argument that all these different things he's doing are ultimately done with the view of improving the economy.\"\nThe challenge for the president is there are some indications that doubts about the economy are growing, along with warning signs of other challenges to come.\nA survey of public and private businesses released last week by the Conference Board, a non-partisan economic research group, found a precipitous drop in consumer confidence \u2013 the largest decline since August 2021. The souring mood among US consumers was largely attributed to concerns over inflation and economic disruptions caused by rising tariffs.\nInflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, rose 3% in January, marking a six-month high. The public appears to agree, as the CBS poll found 62% of Americans reporting that prices have been \"going up\" in the past few weeks.\nWhite House officials privately insist that administration efforts to cut government costs, reduce regulation and boost energy production will ultimately lead to lower prices even in the face of higher tariffs \u2013 but that such efforts take time to produce results.\nIn a television interview on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Trump plans to appoint an \"affordability tsar\" to address the concerns of \"working-class Americans\".\n\"President Trump said that he'll own the economy in six or 12 months,\" Bessent said, suggesting that former President Joe Biden was to blame for the current conditions. \n\"But I can tell you that we are working to get these prices down every day.\"\nWhile Tuesday's speech is not a formal State of the Union address, Trump can talk about what he is doing \u2013 and will do \u2013 to address these voter concerns. \nAny missteps could give Democrats, who have been struggling to find an effective line of attack against the new president, an opening. Their choice of rebuttal speaker, newly elected Senator Elissa Slotkin from the trade-dependent industrial Midwestern state of Michigan, suggest they are keen to focus on economic issues.\nAt the moment, Trump is at the height of his political power. Now, he appears willing to use that power to change the way the US conducts trade policy \u2013 an issue that has animated him for more than four decades.\nBut American history books are lined with the names of presidents felled by souring public perceptions of the economy. \nSome financial disruptions are entirely out of a White House's control. With his tariff decision, however, Trump is making a high-stakes bet that the American public will ultimately approve of his decisions.\nIf he's right, the payoff could be a generational political realignment on this issue. \nIf he's wrong, it could undercut the second term of his presidency before it even gets fully underway.",

Their parents met in the UK before moving to the US.\nAfter their parents divorced, their mother moved to Luton, England. The brothers spent time in the UK, where they built their early careers.\nPolice in the UK have linked Andrew Tate to the \"quite terrifying\" radicalisation of boys and young men in a 2024 report into violence against women and girls.\nThe brothers were first arrested in Romania in 2022. They are facing separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK. Both brothers also deny the charges against them in the UK.\nThe brothers had been under a travel ban in Romania for more than two years while they were under investigation.\nSpeculation that they would leave Romania had been mounting ahead of their journey, after the pair went quiet on social media.\nThey flew from Bucharest to Florida on a private jet on 27 February.\nProsecutors said the travel ban had been lifted, and the pair's US passports had been returned to them, but investigations into their alleged crimes have not been dropped and they are expected to return to Romania. \nThe Tates have a large US following and are popular figures among some elements of the American right.\nEarlier in February, some of Andrew Tate's alleged victims said they were \"extremely concerned\" by reports that US officials had asked for his travel restrictions to be relaxed.\nIt came after US special envoy Richard Grenell raised the Tate brothers with Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at the Munich Security Conference.\nHurezeanu said he had not considered Grenell's approach as a \"form of pressure\". Grenell told the Financial Times his support for the brothers was evident.\nThe Tates have been vocal supporters of US President Donald Trump, while Trump's close adviser, Elon Musk, restored Andrew Tate's account on X after he bought the social media platform in 2022.\nIn the US, the brothers are facing a civil lawsuit from a women who alleges they coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. They strongly deny the allegations.\nIn a statement issued on 4 March, Florida's attorney general, James Uthmeier, said that he had directed his office and law enforcement partners \"to conduct a preliminary inquiry into Andrew and Tristan Tate\".\nHe added: \"Based on a thorough review of the evidence, I've directed the Office of Statewide Prosecution to execute search warrants and issue subpoenas in the now-active criminal investigation into the Tate brothers.\"\nIn response, a statement from the Tate brothers' lawyer Joseph McBride called Uthmeier's comments \"inflammatory\" and \"biased\".\n\"He publicly took a side in an ongoing Florida lawsuit where Andrew and Tristan Tate are suing a Florida woman for orchestrating a sophisticated plot to use sex as a weapon to ruin their lives,\" he added.\nThe cases against the Tate brothers in Romania are now being rewritten by prosecutors, who allowed them to leave the country on the condition that they return - possibly as early as the end of March.\nThe pair's request to leave the country was accepted, prosecutors said, but their request for the charges against them to be dropped was rejected.\nThe brothers face a number of civil and criminal legal cases.\nThey are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women in Romania. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape. They deny the charges.\nThey face separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK, which they also deny. In March 2024, a Romanian court ruled they could be extradited to the UK after their case in Romania concluded.\nSeparately, lawyers for four women who claim they were assaulted by Andrew Tate said they were bringing a civil case at the High Court in the UK for \"damages for injuries they suffered as a result\".\nA representative for the Tate brothers said in response that they \"unequivocally deny all allegations\".\nA separate civil case in the UK, which the brothers are contesting, accuses the brothers and a third individual of being serial tax evaders.\nThe brothers have had their properties, vehicles, bank accounts and company shares returned to them by the Romanian authorities, a spokesperson for the brothers said.\nA Ferrari, a Mercedes-Benz, and an Audi A5 were among the vehicles released, the spokesperson said.\nThe assets, which were seized by the authorities in the wake of the brothers' detention in 2022, were released following a court appeal led by their lawyer Eugen Vidineac.\nSome of their assets \"remain under precautionary seizure\", the spokesperson said, but described the ruling as a \"significant step toward justice.\"\nFour women who allege they were sexually abused by Andrew Tate said they were in \"disbelief and feel re-traumatised\" by his departure from Romania.\nIn a joint statement, the four said: \"It is clear that he will now not face criminal prosecution for his alleged crimes in Romania; he will use it as an opportunity to harass further and intimidate witnesses and his accusers, and he will continue to spread his violent, misogynistic doctrine around the world.\"\nThey also urged British authorities to \"finally take action, do something about this terrifying unfolding situation and ensure he faces justice in the UK\".\nMatthew Jury, a lawyer representing the four alleged victims, told the BBC the Trump administration was \"interfering in due process\" in Romania and the UK.\nHe added he didn't think the Tate brothers would \"ever face justice in Romania now\".",

        "article_text": "The shocking blow-up between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House on Friday continues to ripple across the globe, including through American voters who expressed frustration at one or both leaders.\nThe extraordinary scene saw Vice-President JD Vance accuse the Ukrainian president of being \"disrespectful\" to the US, while Trump urged him to make a deal with Russia \"or we are out\". \nTrump also accused the Ukrainian president of \"gambling with World War Three\" as Zelensky pushed back at suggestions that he should work harder to agree a ceasefire with Vladimir Putin. Zelensky was eventually told to leave the White House early.\nWorld leaders and elected officials in the US have had much to say about the tense exchange, but so do American voters. We've asked five people what they think. \nThis South Carolina voter aligns himself with the Trump administration but he was frustrated by the Oval Office spat and wants the US to continue to back Ukraine. \nIt never should have happened. I blame both [Zelensky and Trump]. \nZelensky did come across as arrogant, frankly. I get he was trying to make his point but he doesn't know how to deal with Trump. [UK Prime Minister Keir] Starmer knows how to deal with Trump, [French Prime Minister Emmanuel] Macron knows how to deal with Trump, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin definitely knows how to deal with Trump, but [Zelensky] doesn't know how to handle Trump.\nSome of what Trump says is true. When he said Ukraine doesn't have the cards, [Zelensky] doesn't have the cards. \nBut Zelensky does have the cards in so far as saying that we will feel it in America shortly after Europe feels it, if Putin is appeased, because [Putin will] just reconstitute his forces and invade somebody else. \nThis Florida Democrat has repeatedly voted against Trump and said she was ashamed to call herself an American in the wake of the meeting. \nI had to pause it a couple of times to give myself a few moments to cool off. I saw Trump and Vance steamrolling President Zelensky and refusing to let him get a word in edgewise. \nThey were selfish, rude, callous, and displayed a complete lack of basic human empathy.\nIt's hard to stay optimistic about the outcome of this war, and I knew something like this was likely to happen after Trump was re-elected. \nI've been dreading this possibility since election day; however, I didn't anticipate Trump being this horrible about it. I'm terrified for Zelensky and Ukraine.\nIf more people had seen the full interaction between Trump and Zelensky, then this Pennsylvania voter says they would understand Trump's frustrations. \nThe majority of the American public is getting a sliver of what happened, I'm glad that was public but I wish people would watch the whole thing  because I think they'd have a very different point of view.\nThis war needs to end, but it's not going to end the way Zelensky wants it to end. It's a sad state of affairs.\nZelensky was expecting it to go a lot differently and I give Vance and Trump a lot of credit for handling it the way it did.\nPutin sitting there going, \"Damn, I better behave because Trump is holding no prisoners.\" \nThis New Jersey voter has backed both Republicans and Democrats in the past but was \"disgusted\" by how Trump and Vance handled themselves in the Oval Office. \nI was absolutely disgusted with it. Even if Zelensky and the Ukrainians were considered adversarial to us, you wouldn't talk to their head of state or head of government that way.\nI would go beyond sending more aid to Ukraine - I would go as far as saying we should send military assets: putting planes in the air or putting boots on the ground. \n[Putin] operates like a bully. The only way you're really going to get a bully to reconsider their actions is to stand up to them - you have to be willing to punch them in the mouth at some point in time. \nThis Indiana Trump voter wants to help Ukraine, but thinks there should be limit to US generosity to ensure Americans are taken care of too. \nI want to help them as much as we can but we can't keep giving, giving, giving.\nZelensky had good reason to want more, but I feel like he was in the wrong to ask for it in that manner. If he did it in private, it would have been the place for it.\nI didn't feel like Trump or Vance's reaction to it was wrong. It wasn't perfect, but I don't think it was a bad reaction per se. I hope there can be reconciliation after this, I want to help them end this war. \nBut if there isn't some middle ground they can find, I don't want to see the US to continue to spend and spend on a country that isn't ours when we have domestic problems.\nThis California voter was taken aback by the \"arrogant stance\" of Trump and Vance against Zelensky. \nAll it seemed like Trump and Vance wanted to do was \"make a deal\", in other words turn a profit from this conflict. Ukraine doesn't need trade partners. It needs allies, nations who aren't afraid to put some skin in this fight and fend off an invading enemy.\nThe world's leaders need to take in the full scope of this conflict and stop letting Vladimir Putin dictate the rules of engagement. \nThe war in Ukraine is not some limited regional border dispute. This is a case of full-blown invasion by one sovereign nation of another. \nThe war has gone on long enough for Ukraine to fight it without any other allies fighting alongside them in battle. Ukraine can't and shouldn't fight this war alone.\nThis Indiana voter supports the president but described Trump and Vance's behaviour as the wrong move. \nIn all my years alive, I've never seen anything like that before. I understand behind closed doors things like this happen, but the Oval Office is not where you're displaying your dirty laundry.\nI'm not a big fan of Zelensky but I found what happened in the Oval Office the other day is embarrassing.\nIt's getting muddled up between the personalities on display there but the fact of the matter is Russia invaded Ukraine not once but twice.\nRussia is the aggressor.\nI understand the administration wants to show the world what we're dealing with, but we're supposed to be the leader of the world and good leaders don't lose their cool at this level.\nI don't want to appear that I'm hostile of Trump, but I just think this style of leadership is not productive.",

I'm terrified for Zelensky and Ukraine.Kim E Pelletier, 57, RepublicanIf more people had seen the full interaction between Trump and Zelensky, then this Pennsylvania voter says they would understand Trump's frustrations. If he did it in private, it would have been the place for it.I didn't feel like Trump or Vance's reaction to it was wrong.",

He's got a point to prove, that's the beauty of this year.\n\"Anyone who plays well in the Six Nations has a chance to tour in the summer.\n\"There are a few boys in our squad who are in the mix and he's one of them.\"\nJones came in as a scrum consultant for the tournament after being given permission by his Harlequins club.\nThe Wales scrum impressed against Ireland with props Nicky Smith and WillGriff John given starts.\nJones says he was shocked Smith, who joined Leicester from Ospreys for the 2024-25 season, had not regularly been selected previously by Wales with Gareth Thomas consistently starting. \nSmith has made just five starts in the previous 50 Tests for Wales.\n\"I don't know why he wasn't picked, because I wasn't here, but I'm glad to have him here,\" said Jones.\n\"He's been good for us.

Ages like a fine wine. A happy fighter is a dangerous fighter. Natasha Jonas' career lends itself to plenty of overused boxing cliches.\nA pioneer of women's boxing for more than a decade, the 40-year-old headlines an all-female card at London's iconic Royal Albert Hall on Friday.\nJonas will put her WBC and IBF welterweight titles on the line against Wales' WBA champion Lauren Price.\nPrice, 30, is the unbeaten Olympic golden girl brimming with confidence. To use another stock sporting phrase, she predicts a passing of the torch.\nLet's not write Liverpool's history-maker off just yet, though.\nToxteth-born Jonas was the first British female to ever box at an Olympic Games. She has overcome injuries, disappointing defeats and juggled boxing with motherhood.\nThrough stellar punditry work or as the first black woman to obtain a British Boxing Board of Control manager's licence, Jonas continues to make waves outside the ring too.\nBut her life could easily have panned out very differently. Speaking to BBC Sport, Jonas reflects on the 'sliding doors' moments which led to her becoming a two-weight world champion.\nJonas v Price - All you need to know\nBelfast, New York & plenty of controversy\nJonas caught the sporting bug as a four-year-old watching the Seoul 1988 Olympics. \nAlthough her memory of those Games is somewhat patchy, she remembers \"being overwhelmed and excited by all the sport that was happening\". \nTwo decades later she was nicknamed 'Miss GB' for her own Olympic appearance.\nWhen Jonas qualified for London 2012 at an event in China, she shared a heartwarming moment with her mother. \n\"That's when Mum told me at the airport how proud she was and that when I was a little girl, watching the Olympics on TV, I told her one day I wanted to be there,\" Jonas adds.\n\"Sometimes kids have big ideas. Sometimes life and the world gets in the way. But after 24 years and trying hundreds of sports, I got there.\n\"So looking back, I could say the '88 Games was the most pivotal event of my career.\"\nThis video can not be played\nIQ, speed & accuracy - why Jonas is confident for Price bout\nAs a teenager, Jonas dreamed of representing her country on the global stage, but not as a pugilist.\n\"I watched Rachel Yankey and Mia Hamm and always thought 'I'm a well better footballer',\" she says.\nJonas is \"not the most academic\" but buckled down to earn a football scholarship at St Peter's College in New Jersey.\n\"America was the place to be,\" she says, with only a handful of English women's football teams operating at a professional level at the time. \nBut a budding football career was cut devastatingly short when Jonas tore her cruciate ligament while in the States. \n\"If my injury hadn't have happened I definitely wouldn't be getting punched in the face for a living. It was a big turning point,\" Jonas adds.\nHer sister, Nikita Parris, has 72 caps for England and was part of the 2022 Euros winning squad.\nAsked if she would swap her career for a major trophy, Jonas replies: \"I'd rather go on to become an undisputed boxing world champion than a football World Cup winner.\"\nJonas is trained by Joe Gallagher, who has trained six world champions, including Liam Smith\nWhen Jonas returned to England she lost friendship groups made through football and, with her knee in a brace, began to put on weight.\nShe briefly worked in call centres but was sacked from all seven jobs.\n\"Now looking back as an adult, I recognise that I was depressed,\" Jonas says. \"I lost my identity. Everyone said I was going to play for Liverpool and England but now I was no longer 'Tasha the footballer' but just Tasha.\"\nIn a bid to regain her fitness, Jonas, aged 21, stepped into the legendary Rotunda Amateur Boxing Gym.\n\"All the lads were like 'who is she?'. They weren't used to having a girl in their gym,\" she recalls.\n\"After a warm-up, the coach asked us to get into pairs to do bags. I thought I'd be the little girl who is last to be picked, like when I used to play football with my cousins.\"\nInstead, Jonas was greeted by the kindness of future light-middleweight world champion Liam Smith - one of the popular boys in the gym. When he saw a deflated Jonas put her head down, he offered to partner up.\n\"I don't know if I would or wouldn't have stuck it out if he hadn't done that, but one little gesture from Liam made such a difference - there was no more awkwardness in the gym after that,\" Jonas adds.\nJonas beat American Quanitta Underwood at London 2012 but missed out on a medal after losing to Katie Taylor in the quarter-finals\nJonas called time on her amateur career in 2014 with a record of 57 wins and 26 defeats. She gave birth to her daughter, Mila, and was happy to never box again.\nThat soon changed after the pro debut of a trailblazing Irishwoman and a phone call from a former Team GB team-mate.\n\"I did some punditry work for Katie Taylor's debut and Tom Stalker phoned me afterwards,\" Jonas explains.\n\"He said there will be a lot of opportunity for pro females now and asked if I'd ever think of coming back? I said 'shut up, Tom'.\"\nJonas says she was \"happy with her routine\". Mila had turned two and was in nursery and the media work was keeping her busy.\nBut Stalker's words kept ringing in her ear. After speaking to her immediate family, Jonas realised the boxing fire was still burning.\n\"I phoned two cousins, my mum and dad,\" Jonas adds. \"I trusted their judgement and they knew the good and bad side to boxing. \n\"They were there for me when I cried for two days, after losing to Katie in the amateurs. \n\"But they all gave me their support and said I had nothing to worry about, especially as far as the baby is concerned.\"\nTurning pro was a decision that paid off. In February 2022, Jonas stopped Chris Namus to become light-middleweight world champion and has since won all five world-title level fights.\n\"If I could go back and talk to myself in some of those hardest moments earlier in life, I'd say 'chin up, kid, it all works out in the end',\" she says.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

But do you think he really understands history?\"\nHis comments were \"deeply disappointing\" and made his position \"untenable\", New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said.\nHis comments came after Trump paused military aid to Kyiv following a heated exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week.\nHe contrasted Trump with Churchill who, while estranged from the British government, spoke against the Munich Agreement as he saw it as a surrender to Nazi Germany's threats. \nMr Goff quoted how Churchill had rebuked then UK Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain: \"You had the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour, yet you will have war.\"\nPeters said Mr Goff's views did not represent those of the New Zealand government.\n\"When you are in that position you represent the government and the policies of the day, you're not able to free think, you are the face of New Zealand,\" local media reported Peters saying.\n\"It's not the way you behave as the front face of a country, diplomatically,\" he said, adding that he would have taken the same course of action no matter which country was being spoken about.\nMr Goff is a veteran politician who had been high commissioner since January 2023. Before that, he served for two terms as mayor of Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, and was leader of the Labour Party from 2008 to 2011. He had also held several ministerial portfolios, including justice, foreign affairs and defence.\nPeters, who is also deputy prime minister, told reporters that he had made the decision to sack Phil Goff without first consulting Prime Minister Christopher Luxon.\nWhen it was pointed out that Luxon was the leader of New Zealand, Peters responded: \"I know he's the prime minister, I made him the prime minister.\"\nThe 79-year-old, who has previously worked with Mr Goff in government, leads the New Zealand First political party - which joined Luxon's National Party and the Act Party in 2023 to form the current ruling centre-right coalition government. \nLuxon, for his part, said Peters' decision to fire Mr Goff without first consulting him was \"entirely appropriate\". \nFormer Prime Minister Helen Clark was among those who criticised Mr Goff's sacking, saying it was backed by a \"very thin excuse\".\n\"I have been at Munich Security Conference recently where many draw parallels between Munich 1938 and US actions now,\" she wrote in a post on X.\nUnder the 1938 Munich Agreement, Hitler took control of Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland. The deal failed to stop Nazi Germany from advancing deeper into Europe and World War Two began when he invaded Poland in 1939.",

He had also held several ministerial portfolios, including justice, foreign affairs and defence.Peters, who is also deputy prime minister, told reporters that he had made the decision to sack Phil Goff without first consulting Prime Minister Christopher Luxon.When it was pointed out that Luxon was the leader of New Zealand, Peters responded: \"I know he's the prime minister, I made him the prime minister. \"His comments were \"deeply disappointing\" and made his position \"untenable\", New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said.His comments came after Trump paused military aid to Kyiv following a heated exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week.He contrasted Trump with Churchill who, while estranged from the British government, spoke against the Munich Agreement as he saw it as a surrender to Nazi Germany's threats.",

        "article_text": "Canada is expected to react forcefully and immediately to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on its products. \nTrump has said he going ahead with putting a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, starting on Tuesday. \nLast month Trump put on pause his plans to levy a 25% tariff on most Canadian imports, with \"energy resources\" only facing a 10% rate.\nNow that that pause has ended, and the US is now set to steeply tax goods from one of its top trading partners, a trade war seems almost certain.\nCanadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly told reporters later on Monday: \"Let's be clear, if Trump is imposing tariffs, we're ready.\" \nShe said Ottawa planned to impose retaliatory tariffs against US imports of C$155bn ($107bn; \u00a3 84bn), with the first tranche of $30bn ready immediately to be levied on everyday goods like pasta, clothing and perfume.\nTariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision. He sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue.\nEconomists suggest that such a move could have devastating immediate impacts on Canada's economy - while also leading to higher prices for Americans.\n\"I won't sugarcoat it - our nation could be facing difficult times in the coming days and weeks,\" Trudeau said in a televised address to Canadians.\nCanada had worked to avoid a trade war. It has pledged more than C$1bn ($690m; \u00a3560m) to boost security at its shared border with the US - a key point of contention for Trump, who appears to be using tariffs as a negotiating tactic.\nTrudeau has said in the past that all options for responding were on the table - here are four of them, and their possible impacts.\nCanada has already fought one tariff \"war\" with Trump.\nDuring his first term, the US president slapped 10% tariffs on Canadian aluminium products and 25% tariffs on Canadian steel, citing national security concerns.\nOttawa retaliated by imposing tariffs on select goods, which were chosen to send a political  message to Trump and his allies.\nIt put levies on Florida orange juice, and whiskey and bourbon from Tennessee and Kentucky - the latter being the home of then-Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell.\nBoth countries ended up agreeing to lift the tariffs a year later. \nSenior Canadian officials recently told local media that if Trump imposed tariffs again, the immediate response would likely be targeted. \nAccording to US government data, 17% of US exports go to Canada. More than 75% of Canada's exports go to the US.\nCanada stands to suffer a larger economic blow in any trade war with the US and this stark imbalance is why targeted tariffs are often the first and safest approach, said Peter Clark, a lawyer who previously worked on trade policy issues in Canada's federal finance department. \nBy targeting select goods, Canada can hit the US without widely punishing its own citizens, as tariffs can immediately raise prices for consumers at home.\nThis approach is also why officials are pushing a \"Buy Canadian\" campaign as a way to lessen the impact of a potential retaliation.\nBut pundits argue that Trump is less politically vulnerable this time, given that he cannot run for a third term in the White House. \n\"You won't have the same impact as last time,\" said Julian Karaguesian, an economics lecturer at McGill University in Montreal and a former finance counsellor at the Canadian embassy in Washington DC.\nAnother move Canada made in its first tariff war with its neighbour was to apply dollar-for-dollar tariffs.\nIt slapped identical tariffs on US aluminium and steel, and ensured the total dollar value of the American goods it taxed equalled the US tariffs on Canadian exports. That came up to around C$16.6bn at the time.\nThis time, the possible use of dollar-for-dollar tariffs could be much larger, with Canada posting a list of $30bn of potential goods it would tax \"until the U.S. eliminates its tariffs against Canada\". The list is heavy on agricultural products, but also includes inedible items like dental floss and luggage.\nThat could be expanded to another C$110bn worth of goods.\nBut the more sweeping Trump's tariffs are, the more goods Canada could tax in response.\nNot all of Canada is on board with dollar-for-dollar tariffs. Scott Moe, leader of the mineral-rich province of Saskatchewan, has said that broad levies on US goods would \"rip this country apart\".\nMr Karaguesian said the promised US tariffs on Canadian goods could plunge the country into a recession. If Canada responded with dollar-for-dollar tariffs, it could lead to inflation.\nThis would result in \"stagflation,\" he said, referring to a combination of high unemployment and rising prices.\nMr Clark said that whatever decision Canada took, politics would likely be top of mind. Polls suggest a majority of Canadians support retaliation, and that many Canadian business leaders want targeted, dollar-for-dollar tariffs.\nCanadian politicians might be pushed to respond more forcefully if it means a boost in approval, Mr Clark said. \"We're talking about political decisions, which are not always rational.\"\nOne of the most valuable assets in Canada's arsenal is energy.\nNorth-eastern US states like Vermont, New York and Maine significantly rely on electricity sold to them by neighbouring Canadian provinces. British Columbia and Manitoba also supply energy to western and Midwestern regions of the US.\nAbout 30 states receive some of their electricity from Canada, according to Canadian government data.\nCanada is also the top supplier of crude oil to the US, making up 60% of total oil imports, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\nDoug Ford, Ontario's premier, has suggested that Canada cut off Americans' supply to pinch Americans at the petrol pump.\n\"The only thing that would really sting in the immediate to short-term is if energy prices went up, because Trump himself campaigned on bringing energy prices down very quickly,\" said Mr Karaguesian.\nBut the move would be contentious, especially with the oil-rich province of Alberta - which has refused to sign off on taxing its oil and gas exports, arguing that doing so would disproportionately hurt its economy.\nOther ideas have been floated.\nFord said that Ontario could pull American-made alcohol off shop shelves in the province, signalling a different approach in which different provincial premiers could define their own responses.\nAnother option is not retaliating - at least for now. For weeks, Canadian officials have been meeting their American counterparts in Washington DC in a bid to stave off any American tariffs in the first place.\nBut that seems unlikely, with Joly saying on Monday retaliatory tariffs would go into effect if the US imposed the 25% levies.\nCanada has also signalled that it could bring in a relief programme for businesses harmed by the possible tariffs, similar to those introduced during the Covid pandemic.\nSome argue, given the economic costs of retaliation, that Canada should instead focus on diversifying its trade relationships and increasing domestic production.\n\"We're a natural resource superpower,\" Mr Karaguesia said, adding that the country could use the tariffs as a push to harness that potential and sell its products elsewhere.",

Booze, oil and orange juice: How Canada could fight Trump tariffs9 hours agoShareSaveNadine YousifBBC News, TorontoShareSaveWatch as leaders of Canada, US and Mexico trade warnings over tariff threatsCanada is expected to react forcefully and immediately to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on its products. The list is heavy on agricultural products, but also includes inedible items like dental floss and luggage.That could be expanded to another C$110bn worth of goods.But the more sweeping Trump's tariffs are, the more goods Canada could tax in response.Canada and Mexico face 25% tariffs on Saturday, Trump saysNot all of Canada is on board with dollar-for-dollar tariffs. That came up to around C$16.6bn at the time.This time, the possible use of dollar-for-dollar tariffs could be much larger, with Canada posting a list of $30bn of potential goods it would tax \"until the U.S. eliminates its tariffs against Canada\". Dollar-for-dollar tariffsAnother move Canada made in its first tariff war with its neighbour was to apply dollar-for-dollar tariffs.It slapped identical tariffs on US aluminium and steel, and ensured the total dollar value of the American goods it taxed equalled the US tariffs on Canadian exports.",
