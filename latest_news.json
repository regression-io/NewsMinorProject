I'd had so many rejections along the way,\" he says.\n\"So when someone said yes, I cried because it's everything I ever wanted.\"\nBefore Jack published debut novel Look Up, Handsome, he'd written other, self-published titles.\nBut he felt an entirely different emotion when he found out that those works had appeared on LibGen - a so-called \"shadow library\" containing millions of books and academic papers taken without permission.\nAn investigation by The Atlantic magazine revealed Meta may have accessed millions of pirated books and research papers through LibGen - Library Genesis - to train its generative AI (Gen-AI) system, Llama.\nNow author groups across the UK and around the world are organising campaigns to encourage governments to intervene.\nMeta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is currently defending a court case brought by multiple authors over the use of their work. \nLlama is a large language model, or LLM, similar to Open AI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.\nThe systems are fed huge amounts of data and trained to spot patterns within it. They use this data to create passages of text by predicting the next word in a sequence.\nDespite the systems being labelled intelligent, critics argue LLMs do not \"think\",  have no understanding of what they produce and can confidently present errors as fact.\nTech companies argue that they need more data to make the systems more reliable, but authors, artists and other creatives say they should pay for the privilege.\nA Meta spokesperson told BBC Newsbeat it had \"developed transformational GenAI powering incredible innovation, productivity and creativity for individuals and companies\".\nThey added that \"fair use of copyrighted materials is vital to this\", and that the company wants to develop AI that benefits everyone.\nAs well as concerns over copyright and accuracy, AI systems are also power-hungry, prompting environmental fears, and worries they could threaten jobs.\nWhile Jack's debut novel wasn't part of the LibGen dataset, he did find some of his self-published books had been taken.\nHe says he wasn't surprised because he'd seen so many fellow authors affected, but that it did spur him on to want to do something about it.\n\"There's always something you can do. You can't just say 'oh well'. You've got to speak up and fight back,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat.\nMeta says open source AI like Llama will \"increase human productivity, creativity, and quality of life\". \nBut Jack says it poses a real risk to creatives like him.\n\"It's annoying that the first thing AI comes for are creative jobs that bring you joy. \n\"We're so undervalued already, and we're even more undervalued now with AI coming in.\"\nJack says going up against a company like Meta, which is worth more than a trillion dollars, doesn't feel like a fight he can take on alone.\n\"How much control can you take back when your work has already been taken?\n\"How do we live with that and how do we get protected from that?\"\nHe's one of a growing number of writers calling on the government to intervene, with a demonstration planned on Thursday near Meta's London office, as well as action online.\nAbie Longstaff works at the Society of Authors, a union representing writers, illustrators and translators, and tells Newsbeat they have been raising concerns about the risks of AI for years.\n\"We all feel that level of helplessness,\" she says. \"But we're all fighting so hard.\"\nShe says her work has also been stolen and used to train AI, something she believes has an impact on future publishing opportunities.\n\"Large language models work by prediction, they work by looking at patterns. They want our voice, they want our expression, they want our style. \n\"So you can as a normal person go onto one of these sites and say 'please can you write me a book in the style of Abie Longstaff' and they'll write it in my style, in my voice.\"\nBecause their works have been scraped though, writers won't get any compensation or recognition if it's used this way.\n\"We want to see compensation, we want to see that it's more transparent,\" Abie says.\n\"The company has taken our books and used it to make money. It has money, but instead of paying us for our intellectual property instead of licensing a word, it's taking it all for free.\"\nThe Society of Authors as well as other unions like the Writers' Guild are encouraging writers to get in touch with their MPs to raise their concerns in government.\nIn December, the government shared a consultation in a bid to navigate the issue between copyright holders being in control and paid for their work and AI companies having \"wide and lawful access to high-quality data\".\nOne proposal was giving tech companies automatic access to works such as books, films and TV shows to train AI models unless creators opted out.\nBut Abie thinks that's the wrong way round.\n\"It's like saying you've got to put a note on your wallet saying no-one steal it,\" she says. \n\"It should be the AI companies asking us if they can use our work.\" \nWriting is something Jack had always dreamed of doing - and still does, despite the challenges he's currently facing.\n\"It's still my dream to be an author and hopefully write full time. It's incredibly difficult now, it's going to be more difficult with AI coming in.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "article_text": "Jorgen Strand Larsen bundles in Wolves' late winner to push Ipswich closer to the drop\nIpswich are teetering on the brink. With seven games left and 12 points to make up on fourth-bottom Wolves, the battle to stay up looks over. \nJorgen Strand Larsen's scrappy 84th-minute goal settled a tense encounter between the two relegation rivals after Pablo Sarabia had cancelled out a Town opener from Liam Delap.\nDefeat pushed the Tractor Boys closer to the drop in a game they simply had to win. Their fairytale rise from League One to the top flight in successive seasons looks certain to end with an immediate return to the Championship. \nWolves' comeback success at Portman Road crucially stretched them further clear of the bottom three and even Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna conceded their fight for survival looks bleak.\n\"I think it's certainly more than likely on the balance of probabilities,\" he said when asked about the prospect of relegation. \"Not that I don't think we can't finish the season strongly, but Wolves are a strong side and the chance of them losing all their games is really low. \n\"The likelihood is we'll fall short of our ultimate dream.\"\nWhen Ipswich won 2-1 at Wolves in December through Jack Taylor's last-gasp header - which ended Gary O'Neil's managerial reign at Molineux - they moved three points above Wolves.\nTown were still third bottom at the time, but just a point behind Crystal Palace, while second-bottom Wolves were four adrift of safety.\nFast forward five months and defeat at Portman Road leaves them needing one of the greatest of escapes. \nThe biggest deficit overcome by a side to stay up after 30 matches of a Premier League season was West Ham United in 2006-07. \nAt that stage, Alan Curbishley's men were eight points from safety, having been 10 behind a match earlier. Ipswich have a game less and a bigger gap.\nBradford City, in 1999-2000, and Fulham, in 2007-08, came from six points behind to survive with just five matches left, but it seems fanciful for the Tractor Boys to think of achieving that.\nJust seven of their 20 points have been won in Suffolk this season, a huge Achilles heel for a newly promoted side. Just one victory - 2-0 against Chelsea in December - has been celebrated at Portman Road and they have now lost six successive home league games for only the second time in their history, matching a wretched run in 1963 when they went on to be relegated too.\nLeicester have won nine points at home, while bottom club Southampton's sorry season is epitomised by the five points they have earned at St Mary's and they will be relegated if they fail to win at Tottenham on Sunday. \n\"You can look at different games, Liverpool, Fulham, [Aston] Villa we started really well, then came up short in terms of trying to break teams down, like the Crystal Palace game,\" reflected McKenna. \n\"We have had a few high energy games and the other teams have punished us. Today it was a spirited and committed performance but not enough to win. We are talking about small sample sizes. \n\"It's strange not to have more wins at home than away. I don't think there's one outstanding reason. If there was, we would have found it and sorted it.\"\nIn contrast, Wolves have earned 10 points from their seven home games since Vitor Pereira replaced O'Neil in December. \nUnder the Portuguese, Wolves have won more points than the three promoted sides put together - 23 from 15 games, scoring 19 goals and conceding 19.\nThe bottom three have won 16 points from a combined 43 games in that time (Ipswich eight, Southampton five and Leicester three). \nNo side has dropped more points from winning positions in the top flight this season than Ipswich (25) and they have simply not been competitive enough.\nThey have led against Fulham (twice), Manchester City, Aston Villa,(twice), Brentford, Leicester, Bournemouth, Manchester United and now Wolves and failed to win. \nEven Liam Delap's 12 goals have been unable to help them bridge the gap at this level. He has scored 38.71% of Ipswich's 31 this season - only Alexander Isak (41%), Mohamed Salah (39%) and Erling Haaland (36.8%) have higher figures in this campaign.\n\"There will be plenty of time to talk about it, analyse it and reflect on the positives and negatives,\" added McKenna. \n\"We knew coming into this nine-game block the balance of probabilities was really small, but we committed as a group to show the right values and show full commitment. \n\"We have Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Arsenal here after that, Newcastle at St James' Park and Everton in one of the last games at Goodison. \n\"We have some fantastic fixtures coming up for a club who haven't been into the Premier League for 22 years. \n\"I know today is a big setback and it hurts, but I know the players and supporters and everyone are going to muster up the energy to compete as well as we can in the last few games.\" \nThis video can not be played\nIpswich \u2018sad\u2019 as relegation looms \u2013 McKenna",

        "article_text": "Kevin de Bruyne has won six Premier League titles with Manchester City\nKevin de Bruyne has announced he will leave Manchester City after 10 years when his contract expires at the end of the season.\nDe Bruyne, who turns 34 in June, has won 16 trophies since joining City from Wolfsburg in 2015, including six Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2023.\nThe Belgium international has been labelled \"one of the greatest midfielders to ever play in this country\" by his manager Pep Guardiola. \nBut his announcement on Friday does raise several questions, which BBC Sport attempts to address. \n'One of the greatest' - De Bruyne to leave Man City\nWorld Football Podcast - Muller & De Bruyne: Leaving legends' legacies\nMatch of the Day Top 10: Premier League midfielders\nIt came from Pep Guardiola and technical director Txiki Begiristain.\nWhen he talks about contracts, Guardiola usually says it is a 'club' decision and passes on responsibility to those above him. On this occasion, he is owning it.\n\"It was not easy for me to tell him it won't continue,\" Guardiola told the media at his scheduled pre-match news conference before Sunday's Manchester derby at Old Trafford.\nThat statement reinforces De Bruyne's own words in his social media post: \"Whether we like it or not, it's time to say goodbye.\"\nWhat is not absolutely clear is what the key factors were in the decision to sever ties.\nDe Bruyne is one of the Premier League's highest earners. It was impossible to imagine City would offer an extension on the same \u00a3400,000-a-week terms. They are also pretty good at playing hardball, as former captain Ilkay Gundogan found out in 2023 when City refused to buckle over the Germany midfielder's demands for a two-year deal.\nDe Bruyne has been a shadow of his usual self this season. By common consent, he has not had a game-changing influence since the victory at Newcastle in January 2024, when he came off the bench to score one and create another, turning a 2-1 deficit into a 3-2 victory.\nHis four goals and seven assists in all competitions this season is down on normal levels. He last scored against Championship side Plymouth in the FA Cup last month. The last two of his six Premier League assists came in a 6-0 win against relegation-threatened Ipswich in January.\nGuardiola has admitted this season he was probably wrong to remain loyal to his core squad last summer. Was that the deciding factor, or was it deemed demeaning to offer De Bruyne an extension on far less than he is earning now?\nPep Guardiola says De Bruyne is \"one of the greatest midfielders to ever play in this country\"\nDe Bruyne's representatives have previously spoken with clubs from the Saudi Pro League, so contact in that direction is established.\nThere was also concrete interest from Major League Soccer's 2025 expansion club San Diego FC before the new season.\nSan Diego did hold discovery rights on De Bruyne, meaning no other club could negotiate with him.\nHowever, sources with an understanding of the situation says that has now been dropped and San Diego have no plans to return to the potential signing.\nIt cannot entirely be discounted he may move to another, less taxing, European league.\nDe Bruyne spoke at length about his situation in November, before the Champions League draw with Feyenoord.\n\"I can make a difference for this team,\" he said. \"And as long as I feel that, that's a good indicator I can still play at the top level. So that's the only assurance that I need.\"\nIn June 2024, De Bruyne said he was 'open' to moving to Saudi Arabia.\nHowever, he has three children, all under 10 - with eldest son Mason a player of promise - and it is not clear if he views Saudi Arabia as the right move at this stage in their lives. \nA week ago Guardiola admitted it had been a \"poor\" season and he had done a \"bad\" job.\n\"We don't deserve a bonus, not even a watch,\" he said before the FA Cup quarter-final win at Bournemouth.\nCity have already started to address the situation. In the winter transfer window, they spent a near-record \u00a3180m on four new players. And, with no Profit and Sustainability issues to hamper them because of the number of players sold for significant fees in recent years, further signings are certain this summer, with Bayer Leverkusen's Germany international Florian Wirtz high on the list of targets.\nBut there will be sales too. It is difficult to see Kyle Walker returning to City once his loan spell with AC Milan ends. Like De Bruyne, Gundogan's contract expires in June and while there is an option to extend by a year, it is not certain the clause will be activated.\nThere has been huge speculation about the future of Jack Grealish, who admitted this week he has been frustrated at his lack of Premier League starts. After being overlooked by Gareth Southgate for Euro 2024, Grealish will want to give himself the best chance of making it to the 2026 World Cup.\nGuardiola has spoken about the injury issues that have blighted John Stones and Nathan Ake this term, while it cannot be taken for granted that Bernardo Silva, Ederson or Matheus Nunes will still be at City when the summer window closes on 31 August.\nKalvin Phillips' time at the club should come to an end whether he returns from Ipswich or not. When the futures of James McAtee and Nico O'Reilly are taken into account, a dozen first-team squad members head into the summer with questions over them.\nIt is likely to be City's busiest summer of transfer activity since Guardiola arrived in 2016.\nDe Bruyne helped Manchester City to a first Champions League triumph in 2023\nThis is surely one of the easier elements of De Bruyne's exit to read. The Belgian's contract runs to 30 June. That means he is clear to play in the group phase of the expanded 32-team tournament in the United States. If City win their group, he could also play in the last-16 game.\nHowever, \"could\" is doing some heavy lifting here. To play any further part in the knockout phase, De Bruyne would have to sign a short-term extension, which Fifa has made possible under adjustments to their registration rules made specifically for the tournament.\nBut, if De Bruyne is intent on extending his career - and every indication so far is that is the case - why would he risk injury playing at a tournament which Guardiola has indicated he intends to use partly as preparation for the 2025-26 campaign? That would make little sense.\nShould he so wish, De Bruyne could sign a lucrative contract at one of the other 31 clubs purely to play in the tournament, and then leave when it is done, which is another avenue Fifa's amended rules have been created to allow.\nFar more likely, De Bruyne will play for Belgium in their World Cup qualifiers with North Macedonia and Wales at the beginning of June and then take a break before starting the next phase of his career somewhere else in July.\nThat would mean an Etihad Stadium send off in City's final home game against Bournemouth - scheduled for 18 May, but to be moved if Guardiola's side are in the FA Cup final that weekend.\nAs prestigious as Fifa president Gianni Infantino says the Club World Cup is, that would surely be a more fitting City farewell for De Bruyne - at least until he returns for the unveiling of the statue Guardiola believes is certain to be commissioned in his honour.\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\nGet Manchester City news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Last year, on 17 September, at around 15:30, a pager which a nurse called Adam was given at the start of his shift at a hospital in Lebanon received a message. The devices had been distributed by Hezbollah, the Shia Muslim group, to thousands of its members, including Adam, and he said it was how he and his colleagues expected to be alerted of emergencies or a disaster.\n\"The pager started beeping non-stop and, on the screen, it said 'alert',\" Adam, who did not want to use his real name for safety reasons, said. The text appeared to have been sent by the group's leadership. To read it, he had to press two buttons, simultaneously, with both hands. Adam did it many times, but the beeps continued. \"Then suddenly, as I was sitting at my desk,\" he said, \"the pager exploded\".\nOn his phone, Adam showed me a video of the room, filmed by a colleague minutes after he was rescued. There was a trail of blood on the floor. \"I tried to crawl to the door because I had locked it while I changed my clothes,\" he said. The blast had opened a hole in the wood desk. I noticed a beige-like object. \"That's my finger,\" he said.\nHezbollah is known for being a powerful militia and is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US. But in Lebanon, it is also a significant political movement with representation in parliament and a social organisation. Here, being a Hezbollah member does not necessarily mean you are a fighter. In fact, many are not. Adam told me he had never been one. People can work in the group's large array of institutions that include hospitals and emergency services, for example.\nHezbollah had decided to equip members with low-tech pagers for communicating rather than smartphones which it feared could be used by Israel, its arch-enemy, to gather sensitive information about the group. It turned out, though, that the devices which Hezbollah had distributed were part of a years-long elaborate Israeli plan: an explosive compound had been concealed within the pagers, waiting to be activated \u2013 and that is what happened on that day.\nIn the attack, Adam, who is 38, lost his thumb and two fingers on his left hand, and part of a finger on the other. He was blinded in his right eye, which has been replaced with a glass eye, and has only partial sight in the other. He showed me a picture of him in a hospital bed, taken an hour after the explosion, with his face burned, entirely blooded, covered with bandages. Despite his wounds, Adam remained committed to Hezbollah. I asked him how he felt when he looked at himself like that. \"Very good,\" he said in English. Then, in Arabic, he told me: \"Because we believe that the wounds are a kind of medal from God. Honouring what we go through fighting a righteous cause.\"\nBut the group is no longer the force it was since being dealt a devastating blow in Israel's bombing campaign and invasion of Lebanon, which followed the pager attacks, and faces serious challenges. At home, there is discontent among some supporters over the lack of funds for reconstruction, while the new government has vowed to disarm the group. In neighbouring Syria, the ouster of Bashar al-Assad's regime has disrupted the route used by Iran, its main supporter, for the supply of weapons and money.\nI visited communities in southern Lebanon that were destroyed by Israel's attacks, and saw that support for Hezbollah appeared undimmed. But, in views rarely expressed to media, others who backed it said the war had been a mistake, and even questioned the group's future as a military force.\nYou can listen to more from Hugo in his radio documentary - Crossing Continents: Hezbollah in trouble - here\nHezbollah, or Party of God, was created in the 1980s in response to Israel's occupation of Lebanon during the Lebanese civil war. To this day, the destruction of Israel remains one of its official goals. Their last war had been in 2006, which was followed by years of relative calm. Violence flared up again in 2023 after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. When Israel started bombarding Gaza, Hezbollah began firing rockets in around northern Israel, saying it was acting in support of Palestinians. Israel responded with air strikes on southern Lebanon, and tens of thousands of people were forced to flee on both sides of the border.\nThe pager attacks were a turning point in what had been, until then, an intensifying but relatively contained conflict. The devices exploded as people were working, shopping or at home. About a dozen people, including two children, were killed, and thousands wounded, many of them maimed. The attack caused anger in Lebanon, because of what was seen as its indiscriminate nature. A day later, walkie-talkies used by the group suddenly exploded too. I was at a funeral of some of the victims of the pagers when there was a loud blast. Hezbollah members, desperate, asked us to turn off our cameras or phones, as no-one knew what else could explode.\nIn the following weeks, Israel carried out a relentless bombing campaign and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. Across the country, around 4,000 people were killed and almost 18,000 others wounded. For Hezbollah, the conflict proved to be catastrophic. The group's top leaders were assassinated, many of its fighters killed and much of its arsenal destroyed. Among the dead was Hassan Nasrallah, who had been the head of Hezbollah for more than 30 years, assassinated in a massive air strike on the group's secret headquarters under apartment blocks in the Dahieh, where Hezbollah is based in Beirut.\nAt the end of November, battered, the group agreed on a ceasefire that was essentially a surrender.\nSouthern Lebanon is the heartland of Lebanon's Shia Muslim community, which is the bulk of Hezbollah's support base, and one of the regions of the country where the group has traditionally had a significant presence. I travelled to the border town of Kfar Kila, which had a pre-war population of 15,000 and was one of the first to fall when Israel invaded. Israel's stated war goal was to allow the return of residents to its northern communities, which had been emptied because of Hezbollah's attacks. In Kfar Kila, there was almost nothing left standing, and yellow Hezbollah flags dotted the huge piles of broken concrete and twisted metal.\nA 37-year-old woman called Alia had come with her husband and three daughters, aged 18, 14 and 10. The youngest was wearing a badge with a smiley picture of Nasrallah. \"I only knew that this was my house because of the remains of this plant over there, the roses, and this tree,\" Alia told me. From the street, she pointed at what she could identify in the rubble. \"This is the couch. There, the curtains. That was the living room. And that was the bedroom. That's my daughter's bicycle,\" she said. \"There's nothing to recover\".\nAccording to the World Bank, costs related to reconstruction and recovery are estimated at $11bn (\u00a38.5bn) across the country. One of Hezbollah's immediate challenges is to give financial help to people affected by the war, which is crucial to keep supporters on board. Those who lost their houses have received $12,000 to cover for a year's rent. But the group has not promised money to rebuild what was destroyed or to give compensation for destroyed businesses. The limited support is already fuelling discontent. Aila's shop had stock worth $20,000, and she was concerned no-one would cover her losses.\nIran, Hezbollah's backer, is one of the group's main sources of funds, weapons and training. But Lebanon's international allies want to cut off any financial support from Iran, to put even more pressure on Hezbollah, and say there will be no help if the Lebanese government does not act against Hezbollah. With the group weakened militarily, critics see this as a unique opportunity to disarm it.\nAlia told me: \"We don't want any aid that comes with conditions about our arms... We won't allow them to take our dignity, our honour, take away our arms just for us to build a house. We'll build it ourselves.\"\nIt is not surprising that Hezbollah's supporters remain defiant. For many, the group is a fundamental part of their lives, essential in their identities. But Hezbollah's power is seen - and felt - beyond its base. Before the war, its military wing was considered to be stronger than the Lebanese national army. A solid parliamentary bloc means that virtually no major decision has been possible without Hezbollah's consent. Because of Lebanon's fractured political system, the group has representation in the government. In short, Hezbollah has had the ability to paralyse the state, and many times has done so.\nBut the war has diminished the group's domestic position too. In January, the Lebanese parliament elected a new president, former army chief Joseph Aoun, after a two-year impasse that critics had blamed on Hezbollah. In the past, its MPs and allies would walk out of the chamber when a vote was scheduled. But Hezbollah, severely wounded and with its communities in need of help, felt it could no longer block the process, which was seen as vital to unlock some international support. In his inauguration speech, Aoun promised to make the Lebanese army the sole carrier of weapons in the country. He did not mention Hezbollah, but everyone understood the message.\nUltimately, Hezbollah's future may lie with Iran. One of the reasons for Iran to have a strong Hezbollah in Lebanon was to deter any Israeli attack, especially on its nuclear facilities. This is now gone. Other groups backed by Iran in the region, part of what it calls the Axis of Resistance, have also been significantly weakened, including Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen. And the fall of the Assad regime in Syria has interrupted Iran's land corridor to Lebanon - and Hezbollah. Even if Iran decides to rearm Hezbollah, it will not be easy.\nNasrallah has been succeeded by Naim Qassem, his former deputy, who is not seen as charismatic or influential. From time to time, rumours emerge of internal disagreements. And whispers of dissent among the rank and file are spreading. In southern Lebanon, I met a businessman who did not want to have his name published, fearing that he could become a target on social media. On the wall of his office, he had pictures of Hezbollah's leaders. Now, he was critical of the group.\n\"The mistakes have been huge,\" he said. \"Hezbollah decided to engage in a war to support Gaza without proper calculations, without consulting the people or the Lebanese state\". (To date, Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.) He told me a lot of supporters shared his view. \"If Hezbollah don't do a proper reassessment of the situation... they will destroy themselves and harm us along the way. We brought this destruction on ourselves, and we're now suffering\".\nAs part of the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah agreed to remove its weapons and fighters from southern Lebanon, and a Western diplomatic official told me the group had largely done it. Israel was required to withdraw its troops, but has remained in five positions, saying this is needed for the safety of its border communities. The Israeli military has also carried out air strikes on targets and people it says are linked to Hezbollah. Lebanon says the Israeli permanence in Lebanese territory and its attacks are violations of the deal.\nDiscussions about Hezbollah's disarmament are likely to be difficult and long. A source familiar with the group told me one of the options was for Hezbollah's arsenal, believed to still include long-range missiles, to be put under the control of the state, while its fighters, estimated to be several thousand, could be integrated into the Lebanese army.\nThe businessman told me: \"A lot of the families, especially those of wounded and martyred fighters, are totally dependent on Hezbollah. These people won't disengage from Hezbollah immediately\u2026 Without a plan, it would be a recipe for internal conflict. It would drive Lebanese to fight against each other\".\nFor weeks, I tried to interview a representative from Hezbollah, but no-one was made available.\nAdam, the pager casualty, has now returned to his work as a nurse. He no longer does nightshifts, however, as he cannot see well. The explosion also left shrapnel in head and chest. As he gets tired easily, he needs to take constant breaks to rest. Physiotherapy sessions are helping him adapt to using what is left of his left thumb and middle finger.\nProminent in his living room, is a picture he framed, of himself, with his injured hands, holding a pager. He shared with me another picture, of his maimed hand, only now it also bore a tattooed message which expressed that his wounds were a cheap sacrifice in honour of Nasrallah, the late Hezbollah leader. He, like many, still believes in the group's purpose, and the role it plays.",

        "article_text": "Fundamentally wrong, was how Germany's outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, described the new Trump tariffs.\nA unilateral attack - that was the view of Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called them brutal, unfounded and certain to have a \"massive impact\" on the European economy.\nHe convened an emergency meeting with representatives of French businesses most affected by the newly announced 20% tariffs on EU goods sold to the US and issued a call to arms to European business \"not to invest in America for some time until we have clarified things\".\n\"What message would we send by having major European players investing billions of euros in the American economy at a time when [the US] is hitting us?\" he said.\nFor France it's wine, champagne and the aeronautical industry, for Germany it's cars, and for Italy it's luxury goods. It's well known these sectors sell well abroad and now risk being clobbered by US import taxes. \nOverall, the chemicals, machinery and equipment industries in the EU are seen as the most vulnerable to the tariffs.\nBut dig a little deeper and there are other EU sectors, reliant on the US market, that could come as a bit of a surprise. \nFrench cognac, generally dismissed as an old person's tipple in Europe, is the booze of choice for many American rappers, playing a prominent role in the music and lifestyle of stars like Jay-Z, 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg. More than 40% of French brandy is exported to the US.\nSpain exports a lot of gas turbines to the US, alongside tonnes of olive oil.\nWhen we look at which EU countries are most exposed to the US in terms of GDP, the picture is also not quite what you might imagine.\nIreland is highly dependent on the US in terms of goods and services. Those exports - a lot linked to the pharmaceutical industry (which is currently exempt from the 20% tariffs, until the US boosts its own production) and also tech - make up a fifth of Ireland's GDP.\nCyprus, Luxembourg and Malta are more exposed than the EU average in terms of services exports. \nBelgium, the Netherlands and Slovakia are in a similar position when it comes to goods. \nGermany has a greater exposure to the US than the other major EU economies, at over 5% of GDP, followed by Italy (about 4%), France (3%) and Spain (just over 2%). These figures were collated in 2024 by CaixaBank research based on Eurostat figures for the previous year.\nThe response to the new US tariffs is being coordinated at EU HQ in Brussels. The European Commission deals with all overarching trade matters for the bloc's members. \nCommission President Ursula von der Leyen claims they hold \"a lot of cards\", including the strength to negotiate and the power to push back.\nThe US economy is mighty. It makes up 25% of global GDP. \nBut the EU single market of 450 million people (the biggest single market in the world) stands very close in size at 22% of global GDP. \nSo, yes, the EU can bite - hard - as well as bark when it comes to retaliating against Donald Trump's tariffs. Especially if, as EU figures have suggested, the bloc targets US services like Big Tech, possibly including Apple, Meta, Amazon and even Elon Musk's platform X.\nBut that risks a new backlash by the Trump administration. And the EU wants to avoid upping the ante.\nIf you take politics into account, not just economics, the EU has less room for manoeuvre than you might think. \nTake energy supplies, the EU has been buying US liquified natural gas (LNG) after it weaned itself off Russian gas following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \nTricky to reduce or heavily tax those imports. That would badly impact EU consumers, not only US industry, and it would worsen already dismal relations with the US. \nThink of all the recent rows over defence spending and Ukraine. Aside from the economic hell the EU sees and hopes to avoid in the new Trump tariffs, the bloc also really wants to sidestep a trade war with the country that used to be Europe's best friend.\nSo, the Brussels plan is: threaten heavy retaliation, hope Donald Trump is persuaded to negotiate, then pray he'll stage a U-turn on tariffs. \nThe EU's trade commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, says he's speaking to his US counterparts on Friday. It's an opening gambit. The EU is in no rush to retaliate.\nThe Trump administration has ruled out any country negotiating its way out of the new tariffs before they become live this weekend. But after that, what could the EU offer the US president to persuade him to back down?\nTrump is incandescent about the EU's massive trade surplus. It sells far more goods than it buys from the US. The surplus for 2024 was around $200bn (\u20ac180bn; $153bn).\nIt's the other way round when it comes to services - the US sells far more to the EU than the other way round. That is why the EU thinks its main retaliatory leverage against the US would lie in services, like banks and big tech.\nTo redress the goods imbalance, the EU could offer to buy more LNG from the US, or more military equipment, following its pledge to Washington to do more for its own security.\nBut that would break a different EU promise - to boost withering European arms industries by trying to buy EU when re-arming EU countries. It is something the US has already objected to, so that's tricky.\nBrussels could also cut direct and indirect tariffs on US goods. It could lose quotas on US agricultural produce.\nIt would be hugely reluctant to comply with another US ask: to water down its much-trumpeted digital regulations, aimed at limiting monopolies and placing restrictions on speech and content in the EU.\nHow do you price in the possible collapse of the international trading system, EU officials ask.\nEuropean firms fret about their markets being flooded by cheap goods from non-EU countries that are also hit by Trump tariffs and seeking to sell elsewhere. \nThe risk is very real when it comes to China. Trump is slapping more that 50% tariffs on Beijing when you add it all up.\nWould the EU have to ratchet up its import duties on Chinese goods to protect itself and could that lead to an unintended trade war with China?\nThese are anxious and hugely uncertain economic times.\nWhich is why the European Commission says it also wants to focus on matters it can control - if EU capitals agree - and that is reducing internal barriers within the EU single market. \nThose barriers, such as tax regimes, vary from country to country and impact the EU's overall economic growth and competitiveness. \nThe IMF calculates they're equivalent to a 45% tariff on EU manufacturing; 110% when it comes to services.\nThat is far higher than the tariffs now imposed on the EU by Donald Trump. \nEU countries say they're united in combating those. So far they've been divided over completing their own internal market.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nSix minutes to come to a clear & obvious decision - Ange on VAR 'lottery'\nTottenham head coach Ange Postecoglou is looking more isolated than ever.\nThe Australian directed a brief clap towards the furious travelling away fans from near the halfway line following his side's 1-0 loss at Chelsea but,  by then, it could be argued the damage had already been done.\nEnzo Fernandez's second-half header was enough to inflict a 16th defeat of the season on Tottenham and leave them 14th in the Premier League - 10 points away from the top 10 - and the signs are growing some fans have had enough.\nChants of \"you don't know what you're doing\" came from the away end after midfielder Lucas Bergvall was replaced by Pape Sarr in the 65th minute. \nRemarkably, Sarr found the net with an excellent long-range strike just four minutes later, leading Postecoglou to cup his ear and turn to the away end, only for VAR to then rule out the goal for a foul on Moises Caicedo. \nWhen asked about the incident after the match, Postecoglou said: \"Jeez mate, it's incredible how things get interpreted. We'd just scored, I just wanted to hear them cheer. Because we'd been through a tough time, and I thought it was a cracking goal. \n\"I wanted them to get really excited. I felt at that point we could potentially go on and win the game. I just felt momentum was on our [side]. It doesn't bother me. It's not the first time they've booed my substitutions or my decisions. That's fine, they're allowed to do that. \n\"But we'd just scored a goal, just scored an equaliser, I was just hoping we could get some excitement. If people want to read into that that somehow I'm trying to make a point about something, like I said, we'd been through a tough time, but I just felt there was a bit of a momentum shift there. \n\"If they get really behind the lads, I thought we had the momentum to finish on top of them.\"\nIt's just the latest in a season of incidents between Postecoglou and sections of the fanbase.\nThere was the recent exchange with an angry supporter after defeat by Fulham just before the international break, another similar back and forth happened after defeat at home to Leicester and he confronted the away end after they criticised players after losing at Bournemouth in December.\nHe added when asked if he was alienating the fans: \"You know what, I am at such a disconnect with the world these days, that who knows? Maybe you're right. I don't know. But that's not what my intention was.\"\nThis just compounds the lack of progress on the pitch, especially with almost a full squad of players available, as Spurs look to avoid their worst season in the Premier League era.\nFormer Spurs midfielder Jamie Redknapp put it plainly when he said on Sky Sports: \"Tottenham were awful. It could have been so much more. Not good enough in any department from Tottenham. Chelsea were so much better.\n\"When Sarr scored, it looked like Ange cupped his ears to say: I know better. There's a disconnect between the two [Tottenham fans and Ange Postecoglou] at the moment. \n\"It's not ideal for the manager. He's got some big games ahead. He's got to keep his head up, got to keep going, working hard and believing in what they do.\"\nHow does Daniel Levy run Tottenham - and would he ever leave?\nPostecoglou hopes Pochettino gets Spurs return\nChelsea boost top-four hopes to pile pressure on Postecoglou\nThis video can not be played\nThe game will be refereed by AI soon - Postecoglou\nPostecoglou is the first Spurs manager to lose his first four matches against Chelsea, while they have fewer points in London derbies this season than any of their neighbours - and the bigger picture offers no solace. \nWith eight games left, Spurs are 14th, and could well finish outside the top 10 for the first time in 17 years. They are now battling to avoid their worst season in the Premier League era.\nTottenham's lowest Premier League finish remains 15th in 1994 under manager Ossie Ardiles - when survival was only ensured in their penultimate match.\nThey have now lost 16 league games this season - their record in a 20-team league is 19, set in 2003-04.\nSince the Premier League's inception in 1992, only six times have Spurs lost 16 or more league matches in a campaign.\nSpurs' lowest points tally in a Premier League season - and in fact since three points for a win was introduced in 1981 - is 44. They need 11 points from their final eight games to pass that tally. \nWith 16 defeats in 30 matches, Spurs' loss percentage this season is 53% - and they haven't lost more than half of their league matches over a whole season since 1934-35. They lost exactly half of their league matches in 1953-94, 1974-75, 1976-77 - when they were relegated - and 2003-04.\nPostecoglou has only won 44 points from his past 39 league matches in charge - stretching back over the end of last season. \nReports suggest Postecoglou is under severe pressure. Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola, Fulham's Marco Silva and Brentford's Thomas Frank have all been linked with his job.\nThe 56-year-old, who became Spurs boss in June 2023 and is contracted to the club until 2027, even suggested in midweek there were plenty of outstanding candidates, external to replace him.\nHowever, Spurs are expected to at least wait until the culmination of the Europa League campaign - a chance not only to win a first trophy in 17 years, but also to qualify for next season's Champions League. They host Eintracht Frankfurt in the first leg of their quarter-final next Thursday.\nA club source indicated before the match that they weren't expecting any managerial changes before the end of the season. \nRedknapp, again speaking to Sky Sports, said after the match: \"I think for Ange Postecoglou, it feels like he's going to make history or be history.\n\"When you lose 16 games in a season as Tottenham manager, still having great players at your disposal, it's not going to wash with the fans. The performances haven't been good enough.\n\"If they can win some silverware, it'll be unbelievable for them.\"\nVice-captain James Maddison, reacting to the fan frustration, said: \"They have every right to be an angry bunch at the moment.\n\"I don't really want to be here talking and I'm sure the fans don't want to listen to me. It can still be a very special season if we lift silverware. We need them as much as they need us, so the message is to stick together.\"\nLike Postecoglou, chairman and co-owner Daniel Levy has faced criticism from the fans.\nBut Levy has given the head coach resources to shape a squad. Postecoglou has spent \u00a3214.8m, with the most recent arrivals signed in January - forward Mathys Tel, defender Kevin Danso and goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky. \nThat extra spend was an attempt to salvage the season while alive in three cup competitions, but after elimination from the domestic cups, it is Europa League or bust. \nIt will be Spurs' last chance to live up to Postecoglou's comment early in the campaign that he \"always wins a trophy in his second season\" - having done so in Scotland, Japan and Australia.\nWith little to play for in the Premier League, a end to the Spurs trophy drought would end the season on a high.\nOn another night, Postecoglou's post-match rant about VAR would have taken the headlines. On Thursday, it was a footnote.\nTottenham thought they had equalised when Sarr struck home from distance.\nThe celebrations followed but were cut short as VAR checked for a possible foul. After a lengthy delay, the goal was ruled out.\nPostecoglou told BBC Radio 5 Live he \"hated VAR to his core\", that there was no point in having referees - and that there would soon be AI officials.\nPostecoglou, who has often criticised VAR, become embroiled in a lively post-match interview with Sky Sports.\nHere is what he said in full:\n\"It's killing the game, mate. It's not the same game it used to be. \n\"We all sat on our couches last night and watched TV [when Everton's James Tarkowski was not sent off for a high challenge on Liverpool's Alexis Mac Allister] and I guarantee you if Jarred Gillett was VAR last night, it would've been a different outcome, so you just don't know what we're going to get.\n\"You are standing around for 12 minutes. It's just killing the game, but no-one cares about that. They just love the drama and controversy and I'm sure there will be 24 hours of discussion about it and that's what everyone wants - they're not really interested that it's killing the spectacle of the game.\n\"If a referee sees that and he needs to see it for six minutes, what's clear and obvious about it?\n\"Last night we were all sat on our couches and saw one replay and thought: 'Oh my God.'\n\"Tonight we sat there and were waiting for six minutes for something that VAR official Jarred Gillett thought was clear and obvious - it's crazy, it's madness. \n\"We accept it and have to take the fall out from it. Clear and obvious? What does that suggest? That it's on the first replay. That's why the game is going the way it is.\"",

The European Union has vowed a united response, and China has threatened countermeasures.\nRatings agencies like Fitch have warned that the mass tariff hikes could result in lower growth, higher inflation and potentially a recession in some parts of the world.\nHow will India - Asia's third largest economy - navigate these global tremors?\nTrump has dealt the most brutal blow to Asian countries, slapping 34% tariffs on China in addition to the 20% previously levied. Vietnam and Cambodia will have to pay 46% and 49% respectively.\nIn relative terms, at 27% India has fared better.\nBut the rate is still steep and will severely affect major \"labour intensive exports\", says Priyanka Kishore of the consultancy Asia Decoded. \"That will likely have a knock-on impact on domestic demand and headline gross domestic product at a time when growth is already stuttering,\" said Ms Kishore.\nBut the new trade realities also throw up opportunities for India.\nIts new tariff differential with Asian peers may potentially lead to some export re-routing. \"We can bring the footwear and garments business from Asian peers if we get our act together,\" says Nilesh Shah, a veteran fund manager.\nThis will take time though.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government will thus have to be strategic in how it navigates the situation.\nForemost, the announcement should \"give the government a greater sense of urgency in wrapping up a trade deal with the US\", says Rahul Ahluwalia, a public policy expert who previously worked for a government department. \"The US is our largest export market, so this is serious stuff.\" \nIndia exports some $91bn (\u00a369bn) in goods to the US, which account for 18% of its overall exports. Hectic trade negotiations have been under way with a fall deadline for conclusion. Ahluwalia says that deadline could now be compressed and brought forward.\nWhile doing that, India must also expand export markets beyond the US and focus on regions where tariffs remain low, such as Europe, Southeast Asia, and Africa,  recommends Indian trade research agency GTRI.\nIn the last couple of years, India has shown a renewed appetite for trade deals, launching free trade agreement (FTA) talks with a range of countries and blocs, including the European Union and the United Kingdom.\nLast year, Delhi signed a $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union.\nExperts say talks with other partners could now be expedited as cracks deepen between the US and many other global economies over Trump's actions.\nBut even as trade negotiations carry on with global partners, the government will need a plan on how it deals with the domestic fallout of Trump's decision.\nImpact on sectors that employ millions of people - like gems and jewellery and textiles - is likely to be significant. The government will need to extend support through means like expanding production-linked subsidies to ensure that India's domestic industry stays globally competitive and can leverage the new opportunities this has thrown up, according to the consultancy, Ernst & Young\nThe tariffs are \"fundamentally reshaping the global trading system\", says Agneshwar Sen, a trade policy expert at Ernst & Young India. This will require a \"fundamental revaluation of trading strategies\" as new supply chains emerge, he adds.\nIndia will also have to be mindful of other risk factors that emerge from this  - such as \"Chinese dumping\", says Mr Shah.\nAs it becomes more difficult for Chinese goods to enter the US, these will have to find other markets. And there are few others that are as large as India.\n\"The global South accounts for more than 20% of global consumption and is where the new middle class is being created. This is where China will attempt to sell,\" according to Akash Prakash of Amansa Capital, an investment management company in Singapore.\nFor the moment there's little clarity and no official word from the government on what its plans are.\nIndia has already reduced tariffs on some goods including high-end motorbikes and bourbon whiskey. Unlike Canada, Mexico or the European Union, Modi's government has adopted a conciliatory approach to Trump and these announcements are unlikely to trigger a retaliation, say experts.\nIndian businesses will now most likely face a period of uncertainty which is unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\"Clearly, the (Trump) administration wants even broader and deeper tariff cuts. The question is what, if anything, will satisfy the Trump administration?\", Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow at Carnegie Endowment told the BBC.\nIt is a million dollar question, for which there are no immediate answers.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

Not like in the amateurs where you get protected from all the outside noise,\" said Orie, who makes his pro debut in Manchester on Saturday.\n\"You hear a lot of stories about it being a rough transition. You hear about the sharks that are coming for you.\"\nBut Orie - who in 2020 graduated with a first class honours degree in economics and management - would not succumb to the \"dirty\" side of boxing.\nAfter snubbing an offer from WWE, he assembled a trusted backroom team and signed with Frank Warren's Queensberry Promotions.\n\"We're not going to take the mick with the progression,\" Orie added. \"It will be slow enough so I can improve but not too fast that the wheels fall off within two years.\"\nOrie said he \"let Great Britain down\" after he lost by split decision to Davit Chaloyan at the Paris Olympics\nOrie will kick off his pro journey against Bosnian journeyman Milos Veletic. \nHe looked remarkably at ease with the spotlight as he shared his fascinating story on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC One Breakfast.\nHe opened up on the struggles of not being able to speak a word of English when he moved from Russia to England aged seven, and how he was inspired to take up boxing by Anthony Joshua.\n\"I've always felt I'm inferior. That I've got more to prove. That I'm not good enough and always have to push myself to get to the next level,\" he later told BBC Sport.\nOrie was equally engaging during light-hearted filming for social media, where in a play on his unique name he revealed why he thinks pineapple on pizza is not 'delicious'.\nWhen conversation turned to his early exit in Paris, however, it was clear his Olympic disappointment still cuts deep.\n\"I always wanted to get at tattoo of the Olympic rings it but I don't feel worthy of one. What have I got to celebrate? I didn't win any medals,\" he said.\nOrie's parents tell him he will one day change his mind, that to even reach the pinnacle of the amateur code should be celebrated.\nHe is not convinced, but nor is he wallowing in misery. \n\"It's life and life sometimes doesn't give you what you want - and that's OK,\" he added.\nThis video can not be played\nOrie, speaking to BBC Sport in 2021\nUnder the tutelage of Sheffield-based coach Grant Smith, Orie has found the \"mental shift\" in preparing for longer bouts - rather than three rounds in amateur boxing - quite challenging.\nHe acknowledges the strong depth in heavyweight boxing, particularly in Britain, but is confident he has the attributes to one day emulate his hero Joshua and win a world title.\n\"It's about the reach a world title brings,\" he says. \"More than anything, I was inspired by Joshua because of how he presented and conducted himself out of the ring.\"\nOrie is an ambassador for BoxWise, a charity which delivers 10-week, non-contact boxing programmes to disadvantaged young people in the UK.\n\"Some of the kids I've seen, they go home and have troubled and messy home lives. The gym is all they have,\" he said.\n\"A boxing gym could be the difference from potentially getting life in prison to having a disciplined lifestyle.\"\nThere is a long road ahead for Orie's world-title quest. It is no easy feat - there are great fighters who never fulfilled their potential. But with his astuteness, dedication and desire to prove doubters wrong, you can be confident Orie will give it his best shot.\nAnd no matter what belts he wins inside the ring, his passion for using boxing as a vehicle for change will be an asset to the sport for years to come.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "When Rachel Chinouriri played London's O2 Arena last month, she cried.\nThe new wave indie songwriter was there as the support act for Sabrina Carpenter, just a week after her first Brit Awards, where she was nominated for artist of the year.\nSeven years after her debut single, those milestones felt like a validation. \nNo wonder she shed a tear.\n\"A lot of it was stress relief,\" says the 26-year-old, \"but I also felt strangely at home. \n\"I was just like, 'Wow, is this my life'.\"\nChinouriri was booked for the tour after Carpenter fell in love with her song All I Ever Asked and started playing it as her walk-on music in the US.\nWe speak on the 14th date, as she prepares to play Assago, Italy. By this point, she's having a blast \u2013 bounding across the catwalk every night, and dropping to her knees between songs to talk to the audience at eye level.\nBut she admits the first couple of shows were \"slightly rough\".\n\"I filmed Graham Norton for the first time on Friday, then it was the Brit Awards on Saturday. The tour started in Dublin on Monday, and I had to film a music video on my day off.\"\n\"I was having a lot of first time experiences and trying to figure out what I was comfortable with on the road,\" she says.\n\"I'd say from show five, I was starting to enjoy myself.\"\nIf there were nerves, they didn't show.\nThe singer's infectious energy and knotty pop-rock songs have been picking up new fans in every city. One reviewer called her set \"the perfect sweet treat before the main feast\". At the end of March, she surpassed 4 million monthly listeners on Spotify for the first time. Adele sent her a bouquet of roses.\nRachel Chinouriri is officially having a moment - but it hasn't come quickly.\nA former Brit School student, she released her first single, So My Darling, in 2018, and spent the next few years honing her sound. \nThe 2019 EP Mama's Boy was a mellow blend of soulful pop, while 2021's Four\u00b0 In Winter was full of atmospheric electronic soundscapes.\nUnderneath it all, though, Chinouriri was an indie kid. Raised in Croydon by strict Zimbabwean parents, she'd only been allowed to listen to Christian music at home. When they went out, the singer and her siblings would blast out hits by Coldplay, MIA, Lily Allen and Daughter.\nOnce she incorporated those sounds to her music, Chinouriri's career took off. All I Ever Asked \u2013 a chirpy rock anthem that disguises a desperately sad story about being undervalued \u2013 won her support slots with Lewis Capaldi and Louis Tomlinson.\nFlorence Pugh declared herself a fan, and ended up starring in the video for Never Need Me, a killer kiss-off to a boyfriend who left her dangling.\nFor a musician who'd suffered crippling anxiety as a teenager (\"I was pulling my hair out, and having panic attacks\") the success was entirely unexpected.\n\"British culture is quite self-deprecating,\" she says, \"so when I was younger, I just didn't believe I could do these things.\n\"Even the fact I can say I'm a two-time Brit nominee is still quite surreal. Then I'm like, Why is it surreal? \n\"I do deserve it because I've been making music since I was 16, and I haven't stopped'.\"\n\nChinouriri's debut album, the noughties-flavoured What A Devastating Turn Of Events, was finally released last May.\nInitially charting at number 17, it has continued to sell steadily, thanks to the continued popularity of All I Ever Asked on TiKTok, as well as Chinouriri's scene-stealing festival performances.\nReflecting on her rise, she says there is a \"privilege to having a slow-paced career\".\n\"I've seen what happens when you skyrocket or go viral. If I'd a massive hit song when I was 21, I wouldn't have been ready in any way, shape or form \u2013 mentally or professionally. I'd be panicking.\n\"So now that things are skyrocketing, I just need to remember that what I'm good at is writing how I feel and turning those feelings into music.\n\"And even though there's more opinions about what I'm doing now, I need to trust my gut.\"\n\nWhat A Devastating Turn Of Events was a huge emotional purge. Among the topics she discussed: Racism, school bullying, self-harm, alcoholism, alienation and toxic relationships.\nA recurring theme was men who take more from a relationship than they put back in.\n\"I'm quite a caregiver by nature, and that attracts boys who need a lot of help, or are very insecure,\" the singer reflects.\n\"I tend to be the person's 'mother', which isn't fun, because I have to be the strong one and there's no room for my emotions.\"\nBut the days of heartbreak are over. Last year, the singer unexpectedly found herself in a new kind of relationship, one where her needs are as important as her partner's.\nIt's written all over her new EP, Little House. \"Kissing me under the indigo / I begged for the morning sun not to rise / Oh, what a beautiful starry night,\" she sings, totally besotted, on the ballad Indigo.\nThe lead single, Can We Talk About Isaac, even uses her new partner's real name. His photo is on the artwork.\n\"It's quite a brave move,\" she laughs, \"but I'm a hopeless romantic, and I don't want to lose being able to document my life in song.\n\"It's a risk that whoever wants to date me was going to have to take!\"\nThe title track documents their chance meeting at a pub: \"With two pints in his hands, he came over and said, 'Nice to meet you'.\"\n\"He's very sweet, he's got a very simple friendship group, he likes going to the pub \u2013 but he does so much for me. It's the first experience I've ever had of being taken care of.\n\"He's changed my life, no matter what happens between us. We're both just really in love with each other and having a having a blast.\"\nAt the moment, though, the couple have been forced apart. The Sabrina Carpenter tour lasts five weeks, after which Chinouriri sets off for her first headline tour of North America.\nIt comes six months after the singer had to pull out of a US support slot with alt-pop star Remi Wolf. \nShe says the dates would have left her penniless, even with financial support from her record label.\n\"As much as I would have loved that tour, I wouldn't have been able to pay my rent, which was very, very scary,\" she says.\n\"My fans were like, 'Let's help out. Let's do a GoFundMe for 10 grand', but it was far beyond 10 grand. \n\"It was like, who's going to pay for visas, where's your band going to sleep, what are people going to eat? \n\"It was a big wake up call. It made me reassess; do I need to be styled all the time? Do I need to travel this way all the time?\n\"So now, I'm able to go back now in full force and upgrade my venues and sell out almost the entire tour, which is mental.\"\n\nThe cancellation taught her to slow down instead of grabbing every opportunity she's offered. \nIt's a sign that Chinouriri is finally shedding the self-doubt that clouded her early career.\nThe success of the Sabrina Carpenter tour is a prime example.\n\"There's always a risk as an opener, that people might be completely uninterested, but this has been the complete opposite,\" she says.\n\"Having the entire arena sing songs with you is such a blessed feeling to have.\"\nIt won't be long before she's selling out those arenas on her own.",

        "article_text": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has dismissed accusations that Washington was left unable to help in the Myanmar earthquake due to the Donald Trump administration's shuttering of its humanitarian aid agency.\nAsked by the BBC why the US had not meaningfully responded, as it routinely has to past such disasters, Rubio said \"we are not the government of the world\".\nEarlier this week, former officials at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) said the US was left unable to send rescuers and dogs due to the agency's dismantling. \nRubio said the US had to balance global humanitarian rescue work with \"other needs\" and \"other priorities\" that were in the US national interests.\n\"There's a lot of other rich countries in the world, they should all be pitching in.\n\"We're going to do our part. We already have people there. We'll have more people there. We'll help as much as we can [but] it's not the easiest place to work\u2026 they have a military junta that doesn't like us,\" Rubio said.\nOn Tuesday, a former USAID official told the BBC the shuttering of the agency, led by the billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk, meant the White House could not send teams from the US to save lives in the immediate aftermath of the 28 March magnitude 7.7 earthquake. \nThe confirmed death toll rose to 3,354 on 4 April, Myanmar's ruling military said. The number of injured stood at 4,508, while 220 were still missing.\nRoutinely in such earthquakes, the US can deploy up to 200 rescue workers and sniffer dogs along with specialist equipment, and is often the biggest and best equipment foreign response team on the ground. \nLast week, the state department said a US team of three advisers based in the region was being sent to disaster zone.\nSpeaking to reporters at a Nato meeting in Brussels,  Rubio blamed the military regime in Myanmar for the lack of access, even though the state department said earlier this week the country had made a formal request for assistance. \nFormer USAID officials say their work is seen as non-political, and they have previously accessed countries regarded as politically hostile.\n\"That would have impeded our response, no matter what,\" said Rubio.\n\"That said, we are willing to continue to help in the humanitarian crisis. Other countries need to do so as well. China is a very rich country. India is a rich country. There are a lot of other countries in the world, and everyone should pitch in.\"\nChina and India were among the first to have teams on the ground in Myanmar, according to former American humanitarian officials.\nRubio dismissed the accounts of humanitarian aid experts who said the inability to deploy a large US rescue team was due to the USAID cuts.\n\"These are people that make millions and hundreds of millions of dollars in these NGOs [non-governmental organisations] all over the world that stand up and they get flooded with the US taxpayer money, and then we have to spend 10 [or] 100 million dollars to get 10 million to people. We're not doing that anymore. Okay? We have stopped. We are no longer going to spend 10 million, 100 million dollars to get 10 million to recipients.\n\"We're not going to fund these global NGOs all over the world that are living off of this. We're not doing it.\n\"We are prepared to help and work with governments and appropriate NGOs on the ground that are delivering assistance. We will be there, and we will be helpful [but] there are a lot of other rich countries, they should also pitch in and help\u2026 we are going to do our part,\" Rubio added.\nAs news of the Myanmar earthquake emerged, the White House had reportedly tried to deploy a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) from the US - but could not do so because the Trump administration's cuts had cancelled logistics contracts and fired officials who oversaw such deployments, according to the former officials. \nThe cuts to USAID had been led by Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) after President Trump targeted foreign assistance on his first day in office, calling it an \"industry\" that was in many cases \"antithetical to American values\".",

        "article_text": "Jorgen Strand Larsen bundles in Wolves' late winner to push Ipswich closer to the drop\nIpswich are teetering on the brink. With seven games left and 12 points to make up on fourth-bottom Wolves, the battle to stay up looks over. \nJorgen Strand Larsen's scrappy 84th-minute goal settled a tense encounter between the two relegation rivals after Pablo Sarabia had cancelled out a Town opener from Liam Delap.\nDefeat pushed the Tractor Boys closer to the drop in a game they simply had to win. Their fairytale rise from League One to the top flight in successive seasons looks certain to end with an immediate return to the Championship. \nWolves' comeback success at Portman Road crucially stretched them further clear of the bottom three and even Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna conceded their fight for survival looks bleak.\n\"I think it's certainly more than likely on the balance of probabilities,\" he said when asked about the prospect of relegation. \"Not that I don't think we can't finish the season strongly, but Wolves are a strong side and the chance of them losing all their games is really low. \n\"The likelihood is we'll fall short of our ultimate dream.\"\nWhen Ipswich won 2-1 at Wolves in December through Jack Taylor's last-gasp header - which ended Gary O'Neil's managerial reign at Molineux - they moved three points above Wolves.\nTown were still third bottom at the time, but just a point behind Crystal Palace, while second-bottom Wolves were four adrift of safety.\nFast forward five months and defeat at Portman Road leaves them needing one of the greatest of escapes. \nThe biggest deficit overcome by a side to stay up after 30 matches of a Premier League season was West Ham United in 2006-07. \nAt that stage, Alan Curbishley's men were eight points from safety, having been 10 behind a match earlier.

Just one victory - 2-0 against Chelsea in December - has been celebrated at Portman Road and they have now lost six successive home league games for only the second time in their history, matching a wretched run in 1963 when they went on to be relegated too.\nLeicester have won nine points at home, while bottom club Southampton's sorry season is epitomised by the five points they have earned at St Mary's and they will be relegated if they fail to win at Tottenham on Sunday. \n\"You can look at different games, Liverpool, Fulham, [Aston] Villa we started really well, then came up short in terms of trying to break teams down, like the Crystal Palace game,\" reflected McKenna. \n\"We have had a few high energy games and the other teams have punished us. Today it was a spirited and committed performance but not enough to win. We are talking about small sample sizes. \n\"It's strange not to have more wins at home than away. I don't think there's one outstanding reason.

He has scored 38.71% of Ipswich's 31 this season - only Alexander Isak (41%), Mohamed Salah (39%) and Erling Haaland (36.8%) have higher figures in this campaign.\n\"There will be plenty of time to talk about it, analyse it and reflect on the positives and negatives,\" added McKenna. \n\"We knew coming into this nine-game block the balance of probabilities was really small, but we committed as a group to show the right values and show full commitment. \n\"We have Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Arsenal here after that, Newcastle at St James' Park and Everton in one of the last games at Goodison. \n\"We have some fantastic fixtures coming up for a club who haven't been into the Premier League for 22 years. \n\"I know today is a big setback and it hurts, but I know the players and supporters and everyone are going to muster up the energy to compete as well as we can in the last few games.\" \nThis video can not be played\nIpswich \u2018sad\u2019 as relegation looms \u2013 McKenna",

On the other side is former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp.\n\"Jurgen's preferred option for that summer was Julian Brandt, who was a great player,\" said former Liverpool director of research Ian Graham, who spoke to BBC Sport as part of a documentary released on BBC iPlayer about Liverpool's journey to winning the 2018-19 Champions League.\n\"Jurgen had obviously known him very well, coming from the Bundesliga, and knew the German market very well.\n\"We agreed that Brandt was a very good young player but not a standout in the same way that Mo was. From our data analysis point of view Mo was the best young wide forward in Europe, full stop.\n\"Roma were under pressure to sell because their finances were not in a good place, so we knew he was available for a good price.\n\"He played a forward and wide role that we needed to fill at the time, whereas Brandt was more of an attacking midfielder.\"\nGraham added: \"It's to Jurgen's credit that he engaged in that debate in an honest way with his eyes open to say, 'OK, I'm open to be convinced, show me that Mo is better'.\"\nKlopp didn't need much convincing and Liverpool signed Salah from Roma in June 2017 for \u00a334m.\nThe Reds believed the Egypt international would be a \"future superstar\" and so it has proved.\nSalah, who is yet to agree a new contract with Liverpool beyond this summer, has gone on to become a Liverpool legend. \nHe has scored 243 goals and registered 109 assists for the club in 393 appearances and, under Klopp, helped the Reds win the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and Fifa Club World Cup.\nHow to Win the Champions League\nLiverpool\nGraham was a consultant at Tottenham from 2007-2012 but \"they never really had the ambition to make more\" of data whereas he said \"Liverpool were the first team to have an in-house analytics department\".\nHe was at Liverpool from 2012 to 2023 and was a key part of the 'Moneyball' strategy - the statistical method Major League \u00adBaseball side Oakland Athletics used in the 1990s to recruit players - that Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group (FSG) adopted at the club.\n\"Moneyball is really the concept of, 'can we get more value for money out of our squad? Can we get more performance per pound spent? Because, if we can, that means we can compete with clubs with a higher budget than us',\" said Graham.\n\"We started off with about seven or eight different leagues, by the time I left we were probably taking data from about 60 different leagues so that we really understood what players could do on the pitch.\"\nGraham worked under former Liverpool sporting director Michael Edwards, who left the club in 2022 before returning as FSG's chief executive of football in 2024.\nThe pair were part of a transfer committee who, along with Liverpool's manager, would \"come to a consensus decision on the best players to sign\".\nLiverpool had appointed Klopp as manager in October 2015 and his willingness to engage in the use of data in recruitment was in contrast to his predecessor Brendan Rodgers.\n\"Previously, we had robust debates with Brendan about which players to sign and the two differences were our ideas about which players would improve Liverpool were very different to Brendan's ideas,\" said Graham.\n\"Brendan, understandably, put a big premium on Premier League experience whereas we felt those players were quite often overvalued by the market and players from other markets, like Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino, were undervalued.\"\nGraham explained that Rodgers \"came in with a preconception that the player he wanted to sign was the only solution for that position\" and that \"it was very difficult to persuade him otherwise\".\nIn Klopp, Graham said they had found the \"missing piece\" and, in some cases, \"a manager who seemed to see what the data saw\".\nHe added: \"He [Jurgen] is very happy to thank us for our suggestions to have stopped some of the less sensible signings, which at the time caused big arguments but, in retrospect, he could see this was a good process for signing players.\"\nThis video can not be played\nHow Jurgen Klopp almost didn't sign Salah\nKlopp had managed at Mainz and Borussia Dortmund in Germany, winning the Bundesliga in 2011 and 2012 with the latter.\nHis first trophy at Liverpool was the 2019 Champions League, with data playing \"a big part in signing\" nine of the 11 Liverpool players who started the final against Tottenham - in a game the Reds won 2-0.\n\"The club needed it and, from our point of view, the data approach needed it as well,\" said Graham on that piece of silverware.\n\"Looking back, it is a source of pride and is some validation that data can be of help. It adds to recruitment.\n\"Our data analysis means nothing without the scouts to understand the traditional way of viewing a player, without Jurgen to get the best out of the players, without the ownership to trust in the process and without the sporting director to make decisions based on what the data is telling him.\n\"Jurgen's impact on the Champions League win, it can't really be overstated. His presence at the club attracted some really great players, he got the best out of those players and - by the time of that final - we had a world-class first XI that was quite different to the team that he inherited.\"\nKlopp went on to end the club's 30-year wait for a top-flight title by guiding them to the 2019-20 Premier League crown.\nGraham said: \"Jurgen, coming from the German system, was much more happy to take that compromised approach and it worked out really well for Liverpool.\"\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

Why Aston Villa are a club transformed - and how good could it get?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Aston Villa manager Unai Emery has the best win percentage in the club's managerial historyAndy CryerBBC Sport senior journalistPublished5 April 2025608 CommentsUnai Emery has always been a manager who dreams big. \"So how good can this season become?Villa have proved over the past two years they can beat anyone on their day, seeing off Bayern Munich this campaign and beating Arsenal and Manchester City last season.So what about Champions League success?Emery has already proved himself to be a European master, winning four Europa Leagues and managing six different clubs in the Champions League.PSG will prove a tough test for the Midlanders though and, with Real Madrid or Arsenal waiting in a semi-final, they will have to do it the hard way.Villa have also won the competition before - albeit back in 1982 - while Porto's 2004 success under Jose Mourinho shows it is possible to upset the giants of Europe.Seeing the likes of Tottenham and Borussia Dortmund reach the final in recent years should also give Villa reasons for encouragement.Winning the Champions League might prove a step too far but, going by their current results in Europe, nobody will fancy playing Emery's men in the latter stages of the competition.Related topicsAston VillaPremier LeagueFootballMore on this storyLatest Aston Villa news, analysis and fan viewsGet Aston Villa news sent straight to your phonePublished26 July 2022",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump's blanket tariffs have put the world on the brink of a possible global trade war. The European Union has vowed a united response, and China has threatened countermeasures.\nRatings agencies like Fitch have warned that the mass tariff hikes could result in lower growth, higher inflation and potentially a recession in some parts of the world.\nHow will India - Asia's third largest economy - navigate these global tremors?\nTrump has dealt the most brutal blow to Asian countries, slapping 34% tariffs on China in addition to the 20% previously levied. Vietnam and Cambodia will have to pay 46% and 49% respectively.\nIn relative terms, at 27% India has fared better.\nBut the rate is still steep and will severely affect major \"labour intensive exports\", says Priyanka Kishore of the consultancy Asia Decoded. \"That will likely have a knock-on impact on domestic demand and headline gross domestic product at a time when growth is already stuttering,\" said Ms Kishore.\nBut the new trade realities also throw up opportunities for India.\nIts new tariff differential with Asian peers may potentially lead to some export re-routing. \"We can bring the footwear and garments business from Asian peers if we get our act together,\" says Nilesh Shah, a veteran fund manager.\nThis will take time though.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government will thus have to be strategic in how it navigates the situation.\nForemost, the announcement should \"give the government a greater sense of urgency in wrapping up a trade deal with the US\", says Rahul Ahluwalia, a public policy expert who previously worked for a government department. \"The US is our largest export market, so this is serious stuff.\" \nIndia exports some $91bn (\u00a369bn) in goods to the US, which account for 18% of its overall exports. Hectic trade negotiations have been under way with a fall deadline for conclusion. Ahluwalia says that deadline could now be compressed and brought forward.\nWhile doing that, India must also expand export markets beyond the US and focus on regions where tariffs remain low, such as Europe, Southeast Asia, and Africa,  recommends Indian trade research agency GTRI.\nIn the last couple of years, India has shown a renewed appetite for trade deals, launching free trade agreement (FTA) talks with a range of countries and blocs, including the European Union and the United Kingdom.\nLast year, Delhi signed a $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union.\nExperts say talks with other partners could now be expedited as cracks deepen between the US and many other global economies over Trump's actions.\nBut even as trade negotiations carry on with global partners, the government will need a plan on how it deals with the domestic fallout of Trump's decision.\nImpact on sectors that employ millions of people - like gems and jewellery and textiles - is likely to be significant. The government will need to extend support through means like expanding production-linked subsidies to ensure that India's domestic industry stays globally competitive and can leverage the new opportunities this has thrown up, according to the consultancy, Ernst & Young\nThe tariffs are \"fundamentally reshaping the global trading system\", says Agneshwar Sen, a trade policy expert at Ernst & Young India. This will require a \"fundamental revaluation of trading strategies\" as new supply chains emerge, he adds.\nIndia will also have to be mindful of other risk factors that emerge from this  - such as \"Chinese dumping\", says Mr Shah.\nAs it becomes more difficult for Chinese goods to enter the US, these will have to find other markets. And there are few others that are as large as India.\n\"The global South accounts for more than 20% of global consumption and is where the new middle class is being created. This is where China will attempt to sell,\" according to Akash Prakash of Amansa Capital, an investment management company in Singapore.\nFor the moment there's little clarity and no official word from the government on what its plans are.\nIndia has already reduced tariffs on some goods including high-end motorbikes and bourbon whiskey. Unlike Canada, Mexico or the European Union, Modi's government has adopted a conciliatory approach to Trump and these announcements are unlikely to trigger a retaliation, say experts.\nIndian businesses will now most likely face a period of uncertainty which is unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\"Clearly, the (Trump) administration wants even broader and deeper tariff cuts. The question is what, if anything, will satisfy the Trump administration?\", Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow at Carnegie Endowment told the BBC.\nIt is a million dollar question, for which there are no immediate answers.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

I hope you enjoy them.\"\nThe music will be revealed on a box set of seven CDs (or nine vinyl discs), titled Tracks II: The Lost Albums.\nThe scale of the release is quite different from its predecessor, Tracks, whose four discs collected random off-cuts and b-sides from the first 25 years of Springsteen's career.\nAccording to a press release, Tracks II will feature 83 songs, of which 74 have never been officially released in any form.\nMany of the tracks, including Fugitive's Dream and Don't Back Down on Our Love, have circulated on bootlegs for years, but will finally be heard in studio quality. \nSpringsteen said the release had been made possible when the Covid-19 pandemic allowed him to \"finish everything I had in my vault\".\nFans have known for years that Springsteen's vault contains hours and hours of unheard material. \nSpeaking to Variety magazine in 2017, the star admitted: \"We've made many more records than we released. Why didn't we release those records? I didn't think they were essential. \n\"I might have thought they were good, I might have had fun making them... but over my entire work life, I felt like I released what was essential at a certain moment, and what I got in return was a very sharp definition of who I was, what I want to do, what I was singing about. \n\"And I still basically judge what I'm doing by the same set of rules.\"\nIn a video trailer for Tracks II, Springsteen added: \"I often read about myself in the '90s as having some lost period or something. \n\"And I really, really was working the whole time.\"\n\nFans will finally get to hear those \"lost\" songs in June. \nSpringsteen said they would offer a glimpse into the home recordings he made after the commercial success of Born To Run and Born In The USA freed him from the pressure of using commercial recording studios.\n\"The ability to record at home whenever I wanted allowed me to go into a wide variety of different musical directions,\" he said in a statement. \nThat includes the \"sonic experimentation\" of Faithless, a film soundtrack to a movie that never got made.\nOther unreleased albums include the country-leaning Somewhere North of Nashville, cut in May 1995; and Twilight Hours, an orchestrated pop album that was written and recorded in the same period as 2018's Western Stars.\nThere are also the \"richly-woven border tales\" of Inyo, whose song titles - including The Aztec Dance and Ciudad Juarez - suggest a Latin American influence.\nSpringsteen described the last disc, Perfect World, as \"the one thing on this that wasn't initially conceived as an album\", instead highlighting several songs he wrote with longtime collaborator Joe Grushecky in the 1990s and early 2000s.\nAs a first taste of the collection, he released Rain In The River, from Perfect World, whose muscular drums and squalling feedback showcase the raw power of his regular backing band E Street Band.\n\nThe announcement comes a month before Springsteen kicks off his European tour, with dates in Manchester, Liverpool, Marseille, Berlin and Prague, amongst others.\nThe 75-year-old recently vowed to keep playing live \"until the wheels come off\", but said he had scaled back his tours after his wife, Patti Scialfa, was diagnosed with myeloma, a rare blood cancer.",

        "article_text": "From Saturday, most goods imported to the US from anywhere in the world will face a 10% \"baseline\" tariff.\nDonald Trump announced higher rates for some countries he singled out as the \"worst offenders\" for trade.\nOur correspondents have been answering your questions about what this means and the impact it could have.\nDavid Rash, in Yeovil, asks Deputy Economics editor, Dharshini David, if the tariffs will lead to a stagnant world economy following a reduced supply of foreign goods into the US and a reduction of US exports?\nThis is a very real risk.\nThe tariffs introduced by President Trump amount to the largest such levy to face American consumers in almost a century.\nIf they do get put in place \u2013 and remain \u2013 there is likely to be a serious dent to the amount bought by Americans, still the world's biggest shoppers, from the rest of the world.\nAnd those who are prepared to fork out for higher prices due to tariffs will have less to spend on other things.\nIn the event of the retaliation threatened by other countries, American exporters will suffer \u2013 hence the concern that not just the US but the whole global economy, so reliant on trade flows, could slow.\nBut as you say, the natural inclination is for countries hardest hit \u2013 toymakers from China to apparel manufacturers in Vietnam - to boost sale in other markets.\nThat might appeal to consumers \u2013 but obviously, could disadvantage businesses in those target markets.\nMike Heafield, 60, in Preston, asks Senior Technology reporter, Graham Fraser, What happens to products - like the iPhone - that are made in China by US companies? \nOne eye-catching consequence of the tariffs announcement has been the impact on Apple, with its share price falling 7%.\nThe US tech giant has large manufacturing bases in some of the countries hit hardest by President Trump's policy - notably China, which faces tariffs of 54%, and Vietnam (46%).\nIn 2019, when Trump was first in the White House, Apple was given Chinese tariff exemptions. Apple bosses will be hoping to work out a similar deal this time.\nThe global investment bank Citi said: \"If Apple cannot get exempted this time and assuming Apple gets hit by the accumulative 54% China tariffs and does not pass it through, we estimate about 9% negative impact to the company's total gross margin.\"\nIn February, Apple committed to invest more than $500bn (\u00a3396bn) in the US over the next four years. At the time, Trump claimed Apple's support for US manufacturing was partially a response to his trade policies, including tariffs.\nPaul Miller, in Devon, asks Dharshini David, Deputy Economics editor, about the impact of tariffs on US consumers, and whether the UK could gain from them.\nUS shoppers could very much be the frontline casualties in this trade war, blighted by higher prices and less choice, regardless of the president's rhetoric.\nAnd that does mean that producers will seek out and take advantage of new markets.\nWe saw that in the president's first term, when the likes of Vietnam and Malaysia took advantage of the tariffs he imposed on China to increase the amount they sold to America.\nIronically, they consequently are in the firing line now - and so will likely be vying to sell more to the UK \u2013 good for consumers, less so for competing businesses\nAlready, many producers are turning their sights beyond established customers \u2013 think whisky makers looking towards Asia. That is likely to intensify.\nTrump's announcement may mean a redraft of the global trade map \u2013 and our own shopping lists.\nJock Scott, from Nuneaton, asks Business reporter Nick Edser if the US tariffs have an effect on the UK's cost of living. \nAs ever when looking at the implications of the tariffs, there's a lot of uncertainty over this. In some circumstances UK prices could go up, in others they could fall.\nThe tariffs announced by Trump on Wednesday will be paid for by the businesses which import goods into the US. This means the initial impact of price rises is likely to be on US consumers, if American firms pass on the extra costs.\nHowever, some economists think the tariffs could strengthen the value of the dollar against other currencies. If the pound weakens against the dollar, then UK firms importing goods from the US will face higher costs. This could then lead to higher prices of these goods in UK shops if companies cannot absorb the increased costs themselves.\nAlso, if the UK government decides to retaliate with tariffs of its own on US goods entering the UK, there is a risk UK prices could rise if British businesses pass on the extra costs to customers.\nHowever, some economists have suggested prices could also fall as a result of the tariffs.\nSwati Dhingra, an economist and member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, has suggested that firms which normally send their goods to the US may instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK, potentially leading to a flood of cheaper goods.\nRobert Jones, from Cardiff, asks Kevin Peachey, Cost of living correspondent, about the impact of tariffs on our pension investments.\nThere is little doubt Trump's announcement on tariffs has led to immediate moves in share prices and are also likely to have a longer-term economic impact.\nRobert and Stephen have mentioned the drop in the value of their pension investments, and the situation will be unsettling for millions of people with any kind of investments.\nExperts say that investors have always had to ride economic shocks. Investments, by definition, require a long-term outlook and strategy.

        "summary": "This could then lead to higher prices of these goods in UK shops if companies cannot absorb the increased costs themselves.Also, if the UK government decides to retaliate with tariffs of its own on US goods entering the UK, there is a risk UK prices could rise if British businesses pass on the extra costs to customers.However, some economists have suggested prices could also fall as a result of the tariffs.Swati Dhingra, an economist and member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, has suggested that firms which normally send their goods to the US may instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK, potentially leading to a flood of cheaper goods.Getty ImagesWhat does this mean for my pension?Robert Jones, from Cardiff, asks Kevin Peachey, Cost of living correspondent, about the impact of tariffs on our pension investments.There is little doubt Trump's announcement on tariffs has led to immediate moves in share prices and are also likely to have a longer-term economic impact.Robert and Stephen have mentioned the drop in the value of their pension investments, and the situation will be unsettling for millions of people with any kind of investments.Experts say that investors have always had to ride economic shocks. Our correspondents answer your questions.From Saturday, most goods imported to the US from anywhere in the world will face a 10% \"baseline\" tariff.Donald Trump announced higher rates for some countries he singled out as the \"worst offenders\" for trade.Our correspondents have been answering your questions about what this means and the impact it could have.Will the tariffs lead to a stagnant global economy?David Rash, in Yeovil, asks Deputy Economics editor, Dharshini David, if the tariffs will lead to a stagnant world economy following a reduced supply of foreign goods into the US and a reduction of US exports?This is a very real risk.The tariffs introduced by President Trump amount to the largest such levy to face American consumers in almost a century.If they do get put in place \u2013 and remain \u2013 there is likely to be a serious dent to the amount bought by Americans, still the world's biggest shoppers, from the rest of the world.And those who are prepared to fork out for higher prices due to tariffs will have less to spend on other things.In the event of the retaliation threatened by other countries, American exporters will suffer \u2013 hence the concern that not just the US but the whole global economy, so reliant on trade flows, could slow.But as you say, the natural inclination is for countries hardest hit \u2013 toymakers from China to apparel manufacturers in Vietnam - to boost sale in other markets.That might appeal to consumers \u2013 but obviously, could disadvantage businesses in those target markets.What happens to US products that are made in China?Mike Heafield, 60, in Preston, asks Senior Technology reporter, Graham Fraser, What happens to products - like the iPhone - that are made in China by US companies? In some circumstances UK prices could go up, in others they could fall.The tariffs announced by Trump on Wednesday will be paid for by the businesses which import goods into the US. One eye-catching consequence of the tariffs announcement has been the impact on Apple, with its share price falling 7%.The US tech giant has large manufacturing bases in some of the countries hit hardest by President Trump's policy - notably China, which faces tariffs of 54%, and Vietnam (46%).In 2019, when Trump was first in the White House, Apple was given Chinese tariff exemptions. The state pension is unaffected.Does the UK have a 'Brexit benefit' over the EU?Paul Naldrett from Windsor asks Business correspondent Marc Ashdown if the UK's position outside of the European Union is actually an opportunity as the EU is given 20% tariffs.Some are referring to a \"Brexit benefit\" because the UK is only subject to 10% tariffs rather than the 20% being slapped on the EU.Not only will that limit the pain felt by British businesses compared to their European neighbours, but it could present trading opportunities.UK exporters to America could have a competitive edge, with US importers only facing half the tax by dealing with UK businesses instead of EU businesses.British firms - and consumers - could also benefit from cheaper goods finding their way here instead of America if the extra costs prove insurmountable.But, there are concerns about the impact that could have on homegrown industries if cheap products, possibly with lower standards, flood the UK market.Trump tariffs",

        "article_text": "A growing confrontation between Israel and Turkey over influence in Syria is posing a serious challenge for Syria's fragile new government.\nOn Wednesday night, Israel bombed several military targets in Syria, including two airports \u2013 Hama military airport and the T4 base near Homs.\nSyria's foreign ministry said the bombardment virtually destroyed the Hama base.  A prominent Syrian human rights group said four defence ministry employees were killed, and a dozen other people injured.\nThe air strikes hit Syria, but their real target was Turkey.\nShortly afterwards, Israel's foreign minister accused Turkey of playing a \"negative role\" in Syria, and Israel's defence minister warned Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, that he would \"pay a very heavy price\" if he allowed \"hostile forces\" to enter his country.\nAnkara is currently negotiating a joint defence pact with Sharaa's new government, and there have been widespread reports that Turkey is moving to station aircraft and air defence systems at Syria's T4 and Aleppo airbases.\nSome analysts compared Israel's intense air strikes on Hama airport this week with the much lighter bombing on the edge of the T4 base, suggesting that Turkey may have already moved some equipment there and that Israel was calibrating its attack to avoid a full-blown escalation.\nRelations between Israel and Turkey have nose-dived since the Gaza war began in October 2023, with Ankara introducing trade restrictions and accusing Israel of genocide.\nThat regional tension is now playing out on new ground in Syria.\nAfter the air strikes on Wednesday, Turkey's foreign ministry accused Israel of destabilising the region by \"both causing chaos and feeding terrorism\" and said it was now the greatest threat to the security of the region.\nBut foreign minister Hakan Fidan told Reuters news agency that his country was not seeking confrontation with Israel, and that Syria could set its own policies with its southern neighbour.\nSyria's new leader has repeatedly signalled that he was not looking for confrontation with Israel.  Soon after sweeping President Bashar al-Assad from power last December, he told the BBC that Syria would not pose a threat to any country.\nHe has even left the door open to normalising diplomatic relations with Israel in the future, telling the Economist last month that Syria wanted peace with all parties, but that it was too early to discuss such a sensitive issue.\nHis top priority since taking power has been to unite a bitterly divided Syria, and pacify external relations with its neighbours, while he cements his power and control.\nBut Israel has not made that easy. Its military interventions in Syria are fuelling conflict with both external powers like Turkey, and with internal groups like jihadists in the country's south.\nOnce an implacable enemy of Syria's former president and his Iranian ally, Israel is also suspicious of Sharaa, a man who once led the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda and whose new government is backed by Turkey.\nSince he took power, Israel's military has repeatedly pounded Syrian weapons stores, airfields and other military sites left by the former regime, to avoid them falling into enemy hands, it says.\nIt has also occupied a demilitarised buffer zone, set up after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, and has sent forces onto the Syrian side of a nearby mountain, setting up nine bases across the area.\nIsraeli troops are also making regular incursions into Syria's south-western provinces, vowing to prevent the presence of any armed groups or government forces there.\nEarlier this week, the local government in the southern city of Deraa said nine civilians were killed in an Israeli bombardment, during the deepest incursion there yet by Israeli forces.\nAnother four people were killed in Israeli shelling near the village of Koya late last month, after local gunmen tried to stop the advance of Israeli forces there.\nSince then, mosques in both Deraa and Damascus have reportedly called for jihad against Israeli forces.\nCharles Lister, head of the Syria Programme at the US-based Middle East Institute, which studies the region, has counted more than 70 ground incursions into south-west Syria since February, describing this as \"an extraordinarily dangerous moment \u2013 and an unnecessary one\".\nSince the fall of Assad four months ago, he says, not one attack has targeted Israel from Syria, the country's security forces have intercepted \"at least 18 weapons shipments destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon, and dismantled at least eight formerly Iranian-linked rocket launch sites\".\nMany Syrians are disappointed by Israel's response to their new government. They watched for years as Israel targeted the Assad regime, and believed that Assad's fall would bring the chance for a less confrontational relationship with Israel.\nSome say that view is now changing.\n\"We used to believe that the Israeli army was only targeting Assad's regime forces,\" said Ismail, a restaurant owner in the west of the country.  \"But its continued, incomprehensible bombings are sadly making us think that Israel is an enemy of the Syrian people.\"\nSyria is vulnerable because its internal divisions are easily inflamed by regional and global interventions. The roots of sectarian conflict run deep here, nourished by decades of repressive rule by the Assad family, members of Syria's Alawite minority.\nAhmed al-Sharaa's attempts to reassure the country's minorities were interrupted in early March by an explosion of violence in Syria's coastal region \u2013 a stronghold of the former regime.\nAt least 1,000 Alawite civilians or disarmed fighters were massacred by pro-government forces, after government units were ambushed in a co-ordinated attack led by remnants of Syria's former armed forces.\nThose former armed forces were once backed by Iran.  Some analysts believe their remnants may still be receiving some support from Tehran.\nSyrians celebrated the fall of Bashar al-Assad as an end to their civil war, and a chance to unite.\nBut outside powers helped fuel that civil war for more than a decade, and its neighbours are now eyeing the vacuum left by Assad. The risk is growing that Syria will again fall victim to the conflicts of outside powers, played out on Syrian soil.",

        "article_text": "Rural North Yorkshire is having its Hollywood moment. \nThe latest production to be filmed in the region is a new adaptation of the classic novel Wuthering Heights, which has just finished shooting in the Yorkshire Dales National Park.\nIt stars Australian actress Margot Robbie, who recently took the lead role in Barbie, and will play Cathy alongside Jacob Elordi's Heathcliff.\nEmily Bronte's novel was written in 1847 and set in the rugged Yorkshire moors.\nThe locations chosen for the new film included Arkengarthdale, Swaledale and the village of Low Row. Robbie, 35, stayed at the hotel Simonstone Hall, near Hawes, with other cast members.\nShe was also photographed in a white wedding gown surrounded by film crew for a scene believed to be her marriage to Heathcliff's rival, Edgar Linton.\nFashion bible Vogue has criticised her dress as being historically inaccurate, as the style was only popularised by Queen Victoria 40 years after the story is set.\nThe hotel is a \"historic country lodge\" where presenter Jeremy Clarkson famously got into a fight with a Top Gear producer in 2015. \nA staff member said Robbie was \"very lovely\" and even enjoyed a Sunday roast and afternoon tea there with her husband and new baby. \nThe employee told the BBC: \"It was a very positive stay for over a week and they enjoying the restaurant and and eating in the bar with her co-stars and production crew too.\n\"The weekend was great fun, where she met lots of other guests and visitors and she introduced her baby to the resident pigs and peacocks here.\" \nThe film crew's base camp was near Holiday Home Yorkshire in Reeth, whose owner said it was \"very exciting\" seeing the trailers in the tiny village. \nOne local holiday let owner said he saw Robbie driving a tractor with her co-star - although the agricultural vehicles were not invented until the late 19th Century.\nHe said: \"There were four tractors, old-fashioned open-to-the-elements style and they were being escorted by two Range Rovers.\"\nAnother Dales resident said he had seen filming at Surrender Bridge, which is close to an old lead smelting mill. The landmark also featured in the opening scene of the BBC series All Creatures Great and Small in the 1980s and is on the Coast to Coast path route.\nCrew members also stayed at the Charles Bathurst Inn, in Arkengarthdale, and were described as \"very friendly\". \nThe film, directed by Emerald Fennell, is due for release in February 2026. \nThere are hopes that it will lead to an upsurge in interest in the Bronte sisters and their work.\nThe director of the Bronte Parsonage Museum, a literary museum located at the former Bronte family home in Haworth, West Yorkshire, said: \"Every screen or theatre adaptation brings something fresh for contemporary audiences to think about. \n\"It is a testimony of Emily's legacy that her writing continues to inspire creatives today and we look forward to seeing what Emerald Fennell's adaptation adds to the mix.\" \nHaworth Parsonage is where Emily Bronte wrote Wuthering Heights and lived with her sisters Charlotte and Anne, and it was gifted to the Bronte Society in 1928. \nIt has the largest collection of Bront\u00eb items in the world. \nDirector Rebecca Yorke added: \"We're also delighted that some filming has taken place at nearby locations and hope that this will attract new visitors to the area and to the Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum.\" \nThere have been at least 10 film and television adaptations of Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte's only novel. \nOne of the most well-known was the 1939 version starring Merle Oberon as Cathy and Laurence Olivier as Heathcliff. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.\nOther high-profile actors who have played Heathcliff over the years include Ralph Fiennes, Tom Hardy and Richard Burton. \nMeanwhile, North Yorkshire was also the filming location for a Christmas film starring Rebel Wilson and Kiefer Sutherland. \nTinsel Town will be released in December 2025 and was shot in Knaresborough.\nWilson, 45, said at the time she \"loved\" the area and had been practising her Yorkshire accent. \nIn 2021, Tom Cruise surprised locals of Pickering when he touched down in a helicopter to shoot scenes for Mission: Impossible at a heritage railway. \nThe owner of a local B&B said in a Facebook post they had been walking the dog when they \"bumped into\" the Hollywood megastar.\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.",

        "article_text": "The UK exported nearly \u00a360bn worth of goods to the US last year, making it one of the most important markets for thousands of British businesses.\nAfter President Donald Trump announced a 10% tariff on nearly all UK products, we spoke to businesses from some of Britain's biggest exporters to find out what it could mean for them.\nThe UK food and drink industry exports a couple of billion pounds worth of goods to the US every year, satisfying Americans's taste for specialist products like smoked salmon, Scotch whisky and artisan cheeses.\nAdam Sopher, co-founder and chief executive at Joe & Seph's, the London-based luxury popcorn-maker, says the mere spectre of tariffs had already been affecting the business.\nUS retailers usually place their orders for Christmas early in the year, but it's had far fewer orders than normal as retailers wait to see what happens.\nJoe & Seph's made \u00a38m in sales last year of which 2%-3% came from the US. \"So it is not huge,\" says Mr Sopher. \"But the US is the biggest popcorn market in the world so we had planned that a lot of our growth would come from there.\"\nAs a consequence, he says, it's now planning to focus on growing its exports to the Middle East and Asia.\nHowever, the 10% tariff was not as bad as he was expecting and US importers aready have to pay a 5.8% tariff on Joe & Seph's goods when they reach American ports.\n\"So essentially what's happened is we're going to go from 5.8% to 10% as opposed to zero to 10%,\" says Mr Sopher. It is also lower than the new US tariffs levied on other countries, such as the 20% tax on the European Union.\n\"Ironically it could be a good thing,\" he says. \"These retailers who would have sourced from Europe might now say 'actually we'll buy more from the UK.\"\nFor something not visible to the naked eye, organic chemicals are a huge US export for the UK, totalling close to \u00a33bn last year.\nThey are used across a massive range of industries from food to make-up to engines and into agriculture.\nRather than feeling fearful about the US tariff, Robinsons Brothers reckons it may help the West Bromwich-based organic chemicals firm wrestle back American customers from cheaper overseas rivals.\nChief executive Adrian Hanrahan says: \"We supplied a lot more to the US but China and India knocked us out of that because of very low pricing.\"\nUnder Trump's new regime, China's imports face a 34% tariff while India's products will be taxed at 27%. Robinsons Brothers chemicals are already taxed at 6% when they reach the US \nMr Hanrahan says he is still trying to nail down whether the new 10% US tariff on UK goods means Robinsons Brothers' American customers will be paying an additional 4% or a total 16%.\n\"Either way, it is a lot less than China or India will see going into the US,\" he says. \"So I am really hoping and seeing an opportunity for us here in one area.\" \nHe says that since January, the company has been receiving more enquiries from the US, including two customers Robinsons Brothers lost five years ago \"at great expense\".\nAt the moment, Robinsons Brothers derives between 1.5% and 2% of total sales - which reached \u00a324m last year - from America. \nThis \"doesn't seem a lot\" says Mr Hanrahan but they are high margin products.\nThere are, of course, concerns that rival countries may have to dump products once destined for the US on other markets, such as the UK which, in turn, could drive down domestic prices.\nMr Hanrahan says: \"I am hoping that the UK government is preparing for that and putting something in place to mitigate any form of product dumping in the UK and in the EU.\"\nUK exports to the US linked to aircraft totalled \u00a32.2bn in 2024, official figures show.\nDPS Designs contributes a small - but important part - to that industry. The Forest of Dean-based firm makes metal moulds that are used to create plastic sections of airplane seats.\nThe US is DPS's biggest growth market. Around \u00a3150,000 worth of sales come directly from the US out of a total \u00a33m.  \nThe company's managing director of engineering, Sebastian Down, says the firm will negotiate with its customers \"to see if we can share in the pain\" of the new 10% tariffs - once he deciphers what they apply to.\n\"The amount of detail is paper-thin,\" he said.\nDPS Designs has already had to grapple with the ambiguous language used by the White House around tariffs, after Trump announced 25% trade tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to the US. The company uses aluminium to make its moulds.\n\"There was no-one you could speak to so it relied on me going onto the US department of whatever website, trying to look at lots of detail that basically didn't exist,\" he says.\nUltimately, the aluminium tariff does not apply to his business. But the new 10% tariff criteria isn't clear either. Does it, for example, apply to parts that make up a product or only to the finished article itself? \n\"It is as clear as mud,\" says Mr Down. \nThe US market for British-made cars is of enormous consequence for the UK economy. Last year, the UK exported \u00a39bn worth to America. \nThe sector was already reeling from Trump's previously announced 25% US tariff on cars and light vehicles.  \nMike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, says: \"These tariff costs cannot be absorbed by manufacturers, thus hitting US consumers who may face additional costs and a reduced choice of iconic British brands.\"\nWith Trump's announcement on Wednesday of 10% US taxes on nearly all UK imports, the net will now widen to include the likes of electric motorcycle-maker Maeving.\nSeb Inglis-Jones, co-founder and co-chief executive of the Coventry company, says that sales from the US are \"ever evolving\". Last month, for example, 68% of sales came from America though typically, the US makes up about 40% of its \u00a36m annual turnover.\nMr Inglis-Jones says that the US has helped counterbalance a less-than-optimistic economic outlook in Maeving's other key markets such as the UK, France and Germany.\n\"In the US, there's just more disposable income and so with a slightly more discretionary purchase like ours, a slightly more expensive British built electric motorcycle, Americans are just way more able to spend that money.\"\nHe says that Maeving recently raised prices in the US, not as a pre-emptive move before tariffs but because the cost of doing business in the States had increased.\nWill the company now lift prices again?\n\"We haven't got that far,\" says Mr Inglis-Jones. \"I think we care more about, as a young EV [electric vehicle] company, about the growth and making sure the price is right for the US customer.\n\"If we can't stomach it, we will have to put the prices up again.\"",

A coroner concluded the negative effects of online material contributed to her death.\nThe donations are thought to have gone to the Molly Rose Foundation, which campaigns for internet safety. Meta and Pinterest declined to comment.\nMolly's family said they had decided not to take legal action against the tech companies and would \"never accept compensation\" over Molly's death.\nIn a statement via their solicitor, the family said that they would \"pursue the aims we share with Meta and Pinterest through the Molly Rose Foundation to help ensure young people have a positive experience online\".\nMeta and other social media companies face multiple lawsuits in the US from families who claim their children were harmed by social media. The cases also involve attorneys general from more than 40 states, who claim that the design of the platforms caused harm to children.\nThe first trial is expected to be heard in November.\nDetails of payments to the Molly Rose Foundation have not been publicly disclosed. Rose was Molly's middle name.\nThe charity's annual report states: \"The Molly Rose Foundation has received grants from donors that wish to remain anonymous. Having considered their obligations, the Trustees have agreed to respect these wishes.\"\nThe BBC believes that this refers to the payments to the charity from the two social media companies. These payments started in 2024 and are expected to be paid over a number of years.\nIt's not known exactly when any agreement over donations was reached.\nWithin the last nine months the charity has recruited a CEO, two public policy managers, a head of communications and a fundraising manager.\nAsked about the donations, the charity repeated in a statement that it would \"respect these wishes\" for anonymity.\nIt is understood that no members of the Russell family have received any money from the donation.\nAfter approaching the family's solicitor, a statement was released saying: \"Following the coroner's inquest into Molly's death, we have decided that we will pursue the aims we share with Meta and Pinterest through the Molly Rose Foundation to help ensure young people have a positive experience online, instead of pursuing legal action. We, Molly's family, have always made clear that we would never accept compensation consequent upon Molly's death.\"\nThe Molly Rose Foundation has become a leading voice in highlighting the dangers of unregulated social media and remains highly critical of Meta.\nIt has called on the government to strengthen the existing Online Safety Act with more robust legislation.\nIt is not calling for a children's social media ban, as planned in Australia, but is demanding that technology companies take more responsibility for the content channelled to young people through social media algorithms.\nIn March this year, in association with publisher Pan Macmillan, the charity sent a copy of a book written by Facebook whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams to every MP in the country. In it Ms Wynn-Williams, who used to be the company's global public policy director, makes a series of critical claims about what she witnessed during her seven years at Facebook.\nMolly's father Ian Russell is an unpaid trustee of the foundation and remains an outspoken campaigner.\nIn January Mr Russell wrote to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, calling on the government to act urgently to protect young people online. In his letter, Mr Russell said the UK was \"going backwards on online safety\".\nHe singled out Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg for specific criticism after the company scrapped its fact-checking programme on Facebook.\nHe said Mr Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, the owner of X, were part of a \"wholesale recalibration\" of the online world, moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\".\nHe told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg: \"By turning the platforms backwards away from safety, Mark Zuckerberg has changed the game fundamentally and shown that the platforms aren't really here to play safe, they're here to make money.\"\nMatthew Bergman, a US lawyer and founder of the Social Media Victims Law Centre, welcomed the news of the donations and paid tribute to the \"indefatigable efforts\" of Molly's father \"to hold social media companies accountable\".\nMeta and Pinterest were approached by BBC News, but declined to comment.",

        "article_text": "In This City Is Ours, Liverpool actor James Nelson-Joyce plays a leading gang member who is struggling to balance his criminal career and family life, against a backdrop of changing modern masculinity.\nSo it's not hard to see why the new BBC drama has been dubbed by reviewers as the \"Scouse Sopranos\" - with reference to the acclaimed US mafia boss Tony and his equally conflicting set-up.\nNelson-Joyce plays the notorious Michael Kavanagh, who works for drug lord and lifelong friend Ronnie Phelan, played by Sean Bean. And the plot focuses on the power struggle between Michael and Ronnie's son Jamie - played by Nelson-Joyce's real life football friend and fellow Scouser Jack McMullen - as to who will take over the business when the top dog retires to Spain, via the Wirral.\nInconveniently though, Michael falls in love with Diana (Hannah Onslow). The couple are trying for a baby but due to his low sperm count need to try IVF to start a family.\nIt's not an ideal environment for domestic bliss to blossom - or good for Michael's street cred - but it does provide the scene for the 36-year-old actor's \"most amazing\" TV experience to date. \n\"It's about Michael allowing himself to be vulnerable,\" Nelson-Joyce tells BBC News.\n\"Because a lot of men put up this brave wall where it's like, I can't be seen to be that person,\" he adds. \"It's took Diana to be that breath of fresh air in his life.\" \nHe believes it is important to show on screen how \"we are allowed to change\".\n\"Because Michael's identity throughout has been as Ronnie's right-hand man, so he's always been the one you don't mess with.\n\"Whereas for the first time in his life, he's allowing himself to be who he wants to be; this loving partner who's reliable, who's safe and who doesn't lie to his partner.\"\nThe rising star, who has been mentioned as potential future James Bond, previously appeared opposite Sheffield actor Bean in another Merseyside crime drama, Time.\nAnd he has featured alongside another Liverpudlian, Stephen Graham, in Time, Little Boy Blue, and the recent historical drama A Thousand Blows.\nHe says his latest character's respect for his partner in crime, Ronnie, was a mirror of his real life working relationship with Bean, who he describes as \"a gift\" of a co-star and a \"kind human being\".\nGraham is \"so supportive\" of Nelson-Joyce's career too. The former's own headline-grabbing new show, Adolescence, also tackles toxic masculinity and its potentially deadly effects.\nThis City is Ours' Bafta-winning director Saul Dibb (The Sixth Commandment) notes how Nelson-Joyce has played \"hard men\" roles before but has not been able to demonstrate \"all of the other qualities\" he possesses, until now.\nThe Telegraph has awarded the show five stars, calling it a \"superb crime thriller of betrayals and shifting loyalties\". Critic Anita Singh noted that it \"doesn't quite live up to\" the Sopranos \"but it comes close\".\nIn a four-star review, the Independent said Nelson-Joyce's \"conflicted gangster\" and the show's \"moral ambivalence\" elevated it \"above the average boilerplate crime drama\".\nThe Guardian's Lucy Mangan awarded three stars, however, suggesting \"the fantastic performances don't do enough to lift this Scouse Sopranos.\"\nBut the Sunday Times' Carol Midgley offered another four-star review, saying it \"is as much about family dynamics and the human condition as it is about gangsters and violence\".\nThe show's creator and writer Stephen Butchard (The Last Kingdom) tells us he is \"happy\" with comparisons to the \"brilliant\" New Jersey-based crime show \"because that really is about a family\".\n\"We haven't got as many cured meats,\" he jokes, of Mr Soprano's favourite food.\nAnother reference point was Shakespeare, he explains, to \"explore those huge human emotions of your ambition and greed and love and betrayal.\"\n\"Once greed and secrets take hold, the fabric of any society, including a family, begins to fray,\" he adds.\nFormer engineer Butchard was keen to capture the \"vibrancy\" of his native Liverpool, which he describes as a \"really handsome\" and \"friendly\" modern world city.\nBeautiful vistas of the city's skyline and glamorous waterfront are juxtaposed with life on its streets (along with shots of the gang's dealings in sunny Marbella and Malaga).\n\"I didn't want to show a Liverpool that has been seen previously on the television,\" he says.\n\"Because this story could be told in any city around the world, but then it's only when you come to the characters that you can give them that Liverpool inflection, bite and hopefully humour, and reflect the mood of the city.\"\nHe says he was was impressed with the \"wonderful\" Scouse accents perfected by the non-local members of the extended fictional crime family, including Onslow, Julie Graham and Laura Aikman, as well as Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson.\nAs for genuine Scouser Nelson-Joyce, just when he thought he was out, the producers may have pulled him back in for a second series.\n\"We want to do a season two\" says the star.\n\"It would be mad if there wasn't\" offers Dibb.\nBoth underline the overwhemingly positive responses they've received, particularly from viewers with purple bins.\n\"Because they're the people who know if we've got all the details right,\" says the London director, adding that Liverpudlians would \"not hold back\" in saying so if not.\nHe recounts how a train conductor told actor Michael Noble - who plays Michael's confidant/enforcer, Banksey - that they had \"done they city proud\".\nThe reaction has been \"really lovely\" and \"a bit crazy\" adds Nelson-Joyce.\n\"It feels like the whole city loves it,\" he says. \"I think people really bought the relationship between me and Hannah and really wanted us to work.\"\nHis celebrity pal, ex-Liverpool footballer Jamie Carragher told him personally last week that he thought the show was \"[expletive] brilliant\".\nTony Soprano could not have put it better himself.\nThis City Is Ours airs on BBC One on Sundays at 21:00 BST.

        "article_text": "Being Maria, a new film starring Matt Dillon and Anamaria Vartolomei, explores the life of Maria Schneider and the making of one of the most notorious films in cinema history.\nIt may be the most infamous scene in the entire history of cinema. The sexually explicit drama Last Tango in Paris, made by Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci and released in 1972, is the story of an affair between a middle-aged man, Paul, and a young woman, Jeanne, in a Paris apartment. The notorious \"butter scene\" was not in the original script and elements of it were made without 19-year-old actress Maria Schneider's prior consent.\nWarning: This article contains themes of sexual assault that some may find upsetting.\u00a0\nSchneider struggled with drug addiction and her mental health for years after the film's release, but her story, and the making of Last Tango in Paris, is now being told through the film Being Maria. It stars Matt Dillon as Marlon Brando, who played Paul, and Anamaria Vartolomei as Schneider. The film's French director Jessica Palud adapted the story from a 2018 memoir by journalist Vanessa Schneider, Maria's cousin.\n\"I think we have to look at the context of the time of Last Tango in Paris, it's now fifty years since the film was made,\" Matt Dillon tells the BBC. \"That time was a different time, but it's very important to look at it now from a different perspective.\n\"It was really a traumatic experience for her. And not just at the time it happened, but as it continued to follow her and haunt her wherever she went in her life, in so many ways.\"\nBeing Maria explores Schneider's background: she was the product of an affair between a famous French actor, Daniel G\u00e9lin, and a Romanian model. She first met her father as a teenager, and he introduced her to film sets. Last Tango in Paris was her first leading role, and she would later recall in a 2007 interview, then in her fifties, that she was persuaded to take the part instead of starring in a film with French film star Alain Delon, and, at the age of 19, \"didn't understand all of the film's sexual content\". She \"had a bad feeling about it all\", she said, but was told by her agency she couldn't possibly turn down working with Marlon Brando, one of the greatest stars of 20th-Century cinema.\nShe remembered what happened on the day of filming that scene, in which her character is raped by Brando's, using butter as a lubricant. \"That scene wasn't in the original script. The truth is it was Marlon who came up with the idea. They only told me about it before we had to film the scene and I was so angry\u2026 I felt humiliated and to be honest, I felt a little raped, both by Marlon and by Bertolucci. After the scene, Marlon didn't console me or apologise,\" she said. \"Marlon said to me: 'Maria, don't worry, it's just a movie,' but during the scene, even though what Marlon was doing wasn't real, I was crying real tears.\n\"Thankfully, there was just one take.\"\nBertolucci would later talk about why he withheld details of the scene from Schneider, saying: \"I wanted her reaction as a girl, not as an actress. I wanted her to react humiliated.\" He insisted that it was only the use of the butter that had surprised the actress, but Matt Dillon says what happened was \"really wrong\".\n\"It's something that we often do, actors, we won't tell the other actor, or the director will encourage us to not reveal what we're going to do, so we can get a real reaction,\" he says. \"But it was really wrong, with a scene that was so sensitive, to do something like that.\"\u00a0\nJessica Palud tells the BBC that recreating the rape scene \"couldn't be avoided\" in Being Maria, but this time, the audience sees events from Maria Schneider's perspective. \"I couldn't avoid shooting this scene because it was the very moment in which her life completely switches. Everything goes wrong from there,\" Palud says. \"It was important to have the scene from her point of view, in her body, in her gaze, what she went through, and the fact that there were witnesses. Maria was being assaulted in the presence of the whole crew, who were observing and not reacting.\"\nThis time the scene was prepared using an intimacy co-ordinator, which 61-year-old Dillon says was his first time working with one. \"I said to the intimacy co-ordinator, 'do you know what the scene is about?'\" he recalls. \"They said yes, and I said, 'Because you can probably trace back the role of an intimacy co-ordinator to that moment, in that film.'\"\u00a0\nThe use of an intimacy co-ordinator, who acts as a choreographer and a liaison between actors and production during simulated sex and nude scenes, is increasingly standard in the industry since the #MeToo movement. It now makes headlines when they're declined, including by Mikey Madison in Oscar winner Anora, or when Gwyneth Paltrow revealed that she told one to \"step a little bit back\" during her sex scenes with Timoth\u00e9e\u00a0Chalamet in Marty Supreme.\n\"I don't think it's a bad thing, I think it can evolve into being something good,\" Dillon says of using intimacy co-ordinators. \"It seems they're there to prevent people from crossing boundaries, but in fact it's creating boundaries that give opportunities for different ways of approaching these scenes. I hope that's how it evolves rather than people feeling like 'they're here to tell us what we can and can't do.' And Anamaria and I were very comfortable.\"\nAnamaria Vartolomei (who also made Golden Lion winner Happening, featuring scenes of illegal abortion) says that although she felt \"safe, protected and guided\" shooting the rape scene on the Being Maria shoot, she still became upset. \"This scene was really violent,\" she tells the BBC. \"I couldn't imagine what it was for Maria as she felt it for real. I'm just playing her. But this thing really happened to her, and she had no one around her. She just had people looking at her without doing anything. I think the violence of it was double because she didn't have the support I had on set, but I still felt it was really hard.\u00a0\n\"I was so emotional that day. I couldn't stop crying because I feel I accumulated the violence of the scene when I saw it on screen. When I had to play it, all my tears came out. I think it's very brutal. And it's insane to think that somebody could do this.\"\u00a0\nMaria Schneider was not only professionally unsupported on set, but she also lacked the experience to know that Bertolucci couldn't make her to do the scene. \"I should have called my agent or had my lawyer come to the set because you can't force someone to do something that isn't in the script, but at the time, I didn't know that,\" she would say later.\u00a0\nBut it was also the sensation the film Last Tango in Paris caused when it was shown from October 1972 that would undo Schneider. Despite (or helped by) it being banned or restricted in some countries; it made around $36m in the US alone. In France, it was reported audiences were queueing round the block for two hours or more to get a ticket.\nThe disparity between Bertolucci, Brando and Schneider became clear: critical reaction to the film aided Bertolucci's reputation as an international auteur, and both he and Brando were nominated for Oscars for the film. Brando, now doubly legendary for making Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather during the same period, is reported to have made around $3m out of Last Tango, as he took a share of the profits; Schneider recalled she was paid around $4,000. She appeared in full-frontal nudity; Brando never appeared naked in the film.\nThe young woman found the overnight fame increasingly hard to deal with. She told interviewers when the film came out that she had slept with 50 men and 20 women and \"had tried heroin\", because, she later explained, that although this was untrue, she was seen [as] \"that sexy bimbo\". Her erratic behaviour, she said, was down to being afraid. \"To be suddenly famous all over the world was frightening,\" she said. \"I didn't have bodyguards like they do today. People thought I was just like my character, and I would make up stories for the press, but that wasn't me\u2026 It made me go mad. I got into drugs\u2026 it was like an escape from reality. It was the 70s and at that time, it was all going on.\"\nHer cousin, Vanessa Schneider, has said of her that she was also a victim of the double standards of the time: \"For puritanical viewers, she was an easy woman who made pornography. It was brutal for her, especially since it wasn't at all in her nature \u2013 she was pretty modest, reserved and fairly conservative in certain respects.\"\n\"People thought I was like the girl in the movie, but that wasn't me,\" Maria Schneider declared in a 2007 interview. \"I felt very sad because I was treated like a sex symbol, I wanted to be recognised as an actress, and the whole scandal and the aftermath of the film turned me a little crazy and I had a breakdown.\" Schneider also revealed that she tried to take her life during this period.\nLater on, Schneider would get sober, but although she made around 50 films during her career (including the critically acclaimed 1975 film The Passenger, co-starring Jack Nicholson) she remarked that \"Last Tango is still the one everyone asks me about.\" She died in 2011, from cancer.\n\"The unfortunate thing is Maria Schneider gave an incredible performance in that film, and you could see how her career could have taken a different path,\" Matt Dillon says. \"But she already had so many strikes against her. Her family of origin was a very messy situation. She was abandoned by her parents and then abandoned by the people that she worked with. I think this abandonment followed her.\"\nSchneider is not the only female actor of that era who suffered because of the hype around an erotic movie they starred in \u2013 Sylvia Kristel also found it hard to escape the sensation created by 1974's soft porn movie Emmanuelle, in which she had the leading role, and which also featured a rape scene. Nor was it only women who suffered making films with sexual content; Schneider would later say that \"even Brando said he felt raped and manipulated\" during the infamous Last Tango scene.\n\"It was an era of celebrity directors,\" Anna Smith, host of the podcast Girls on Film, tells the BBC. \"And the pattern seems to be mainly domineering male directors exploiting and bullying younger actresses. The entitlement of some of these lauded men enabled them to exert control over women.\"\n\"We had this idea of the creator, the director that has the supreme power,\" says Vartolomei, \"and that they were a sort of guru of directing, and that all the people around him were listening to him as if he was God. I think that was the problem back then. Now we're more protected and our voice is heard, and it is also valued, which [it] wasn't back then.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How Snow White became 2025's most divisive film\n\u2022 10 of the best films to watch in March\n\u2022 Why cult film Emmanuelle is 'extremely problematic' \nBut Being Maria director Jessica Palud points out that one of the more extraordinary aspects of Schneider's character was that long before the era of #MeToo, she was speaking out about what happened on the set of Last Tango in Paris. \"The thing is that what I really found interesting and touching about her is that although it was in the 1970s and at the time, many young actresses would get assaulted or raped, but they kept it inside. Maria was extremely vocal and clear in interviews\u2026 she would speak up, but she wasn't listened to.\"\u00a0\nSchneider's experience on Last Tango was eventually taken seriously in 2016, when footage of Bertolucci's 2013 interview with Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise about the infamous scene and his desire for Schneider's humiliation to be real resurfaced. This time, it caused outrage. Some did not realise that the sex scene was, however traumatic, only simulated by Brando and Schneider. The then 76-year-old director called the furore \"ridiculous\" and reiterated that Schneider knew about the scene beforehand.\nAll three of the main storytellers of Last Tango in Paris \u2013 Bertolucci, Brando and Schneider \u2013 are now dead. Knowing that the horror, shock, upset and fury seen on Maria Schneider's face is real, and deliberately provoked, should the film, as French newspaper Le Monde pondered after the cancellation of a 2024 screening in Paris due to protests, carry some kind of warning?\n\"I have long thought that the perceived canon of cinematic greats needs re-examining \u2013 as it comes from an inherently patriarchal place,\" says Smith. \"I think it's healthy to revisit classics from a modern perspective; I hope our understanding of the damage that can be caused by certain attitudes and practices has evolved.\"\nBeing Maria, Palud says, attempts to show that, but she says that \"I did not want to judge nor condemn, but to show the system and show what needs to change in the system for this younger generation to be protected. There's still a lot to do. But a scene like this wouldn't happen now, thank God.\"\nVartolomei adds: \"I feel this movie is clearing things up for Maria, along with Vanessa Schneider's book. Back then, Maria was considered a victim, but for me she's far from that, as she found the strength to talk, for the story to be heard, even if she decided to talk in a society that wasn't ready to receive her voice. But now I'm just happy that we are finally able to hear her.\"\nBeing Maria has a US-wide release from 4 April.\u00a0\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

For countries he has deemed the \"worst offenders\", the rates can go as high as 50%. They start taking effect on 5 April.\nEconomists have warned the new levies - and those that other countries impose in retaliation - could push prices up for Americans across the board, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has said that they will increase inflation.\nThat's because the companies importing the goods may pass the costs of the tariffs on to customers or simply bring fewer products into the country, creating a limited supply.\nHere are six everyday items that could become more expensive for American consumers.\nThe \"worst offenders\" about to be hit with the highest tariffs include the clothing manufacturing hubs of Vietnam, China and Bangladesh. The three - among the top five largest apparel importers to the US - could soon see levies ranging from 34% to 46% charged on their products.\nThat means major US department stores like Target and Walmart, where Americans often turn for affordable clothing, and some familiar apparel brands may feel the pressure.\nThe Gap, an American clothing retailer that also operates Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta, sources about 21% of its clothing from Vietnam, according to an analysis by Prof Sheng Lu at the University of Delaware's Fashion & Apparel Studies department. Another 37% of its clothing comes from India, Indonesia and Bangladesh.\nH&M, known for its inexpensive fashions, manufactures most of its clothing in China and Bangladesh.\nThe tariffs could bring an \"unfair burden to American families, particularly lower-income households\", warned the US Fashion Industry Association in a statement on Wednesday.\nVietnam is open to working out a deal with the administration to avoid the tariffs, Trump has said. China, on the other hand, has retaliated with its own steep levies.\nAlmost all of the coffee consumed in the US comes from outside the country, meaning it could soon become a bigger burden on Americans' wallets.\nThe US mostly sources its coffee from Brazil and Colombia, which are subject to the baseline 10% tariffs. Vietnam is also a key exporter of certain varieties.\nWalter Haas, owner of San Francisco-based coffee roastery Graffeo, told the Washington Post that once tariffs hit, his company will feel it \"immediately\". \nIf they remain in place, those cost increases will be \"permanently baked into the price consumers pay\", he added.\nOther imported foods could similarly rise in price, especially those coming from European Union nations, who will all be hit by a 20% tariff. Prices of shelf staples such as olive oil, which is primarily imported from Italy, Spain and Greece, could rise further.\nShoes and trainers, among the most basic necessities and also one of Americans' biggest splurges, could become more expensive, including the popular Nike Air Force 1 and Adidas Samba trainers. Both sportswear companies rely heavily on Asian factory hubs for their inventories.\nAbout half of Nike and 39% of Adidas trainers are made in Vietnam.\nIn 2024, the US imported more than $27bn of footwear, mostly from China and Vietnam, which was subject to tariffs of about $3bn, according to data by Prof Lu. \nNow, that tax amount could nearly triple.\nUBS analysts told Reuters that, all in all, retailers may not be able to fully swallow the costs, and would need to raise prices by 10% to 12% to offset the levies on Vietnamese manufacturers.\nFrance is one of the biggest foreign suppliers of wine to the US, and its winemakers have expressed anxiety about what the 20% EU tariffs will mean for their business.\nThe Bourgogne Wine Board, which represents producers in the French region of Burgundy, said the US tariffs would deliver \"a serious blow\" to both exporters and American consumers.\n\"The risk with these additional tariffs is that they could push our wines past a psychological price threshold,\" warned Laurent Delaunay, president of the Bourgogne Wine Board - meaning above what buyers feel comfortable paying.\nPrice increases could be seen at restaurants, especially for imported beers or drinks using foreign spirits. Separately, Trump expanded an aluminium tariff to include all canned beer, which could also make it more expensive for those who stay home.\nUBS analysts told Reuters that large alcohol sellers would have to hike prices up to 5% to cover the tariffs if they choose not to absorb the costs themselves.\nCell phones, TVs and video game consoles tend to be big-ticket purchases, and the latest US tariffs could make them even bigger.\nChina, as well as Taiwan and South Korea, are all top exporters of electronics to the US.\nAlmost all iPhones are made in China, although some are also made in India (which, too, is on the \"worst offenders\" list with a 26% tariff). Samsung, meanwhile, has significant production operations in Vietnam.\nIt's still unclear how these major tech companies will respond to the new levies. But Japanese video gaming company Nintendo announced on Friday that it is delaying pre-orders of its Switch 2 console, saying it needs to \"assess the potential impact of tariffs.\"\nAmericans may soon find that loading up fast-fashion hauls from Chinese online retailers like Temu or Shein with a few swipes on their phones has gotten more expensive.\nAlong with imposing the country-level tariffs, Trump has signed an executive order ending an exemption that prevented charging the levies on small-dollar shipments from China. \nThe exemption is referred to as the \"de minimis\" loophole, and it had allowed shipments under $800 (\u00a3620) to enter the US duty-free. Experts say it was a big reason why Temu and Shein were able to keep their costs low.\nThe order means those companies may have to pay taxes for the first time on the clothes they often send directly to customers.\nIt is unclear just how much costs for these goods could rise with the elimination of the loophole, but the White House says small shipments sent to the US through the international postal network could be subject to a tax of \"either 30% of their value, or $25 per item.\"\nThat tax would then increase to $50 per item after 1 June, according to the White House.",

        "article_text": "April Hubbard sits on the theatre stage where she plans to die later this year.\nShe is not terminally ill, but the 39-year-old performance and burlesque artist has been approved for assisted dying under Canada's increasingly liberal laws.\nWarning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing\nShe is speaking to BBC News from the Bus Stop Theatre, an intimate auditorium with a little under 100 seats, in the eastern city of Halifax, Nova Scotia.\nIlluminated by a single spotlight on a stage she has performed on many times before, she tells me she plans to die here \"within months\" of her imminent 40th birthday. She'll be joined by a small group of her family and friends.\nApril plans to be in a \"big comfy bed\" for what she calls a \"celebratory\" moment when a medical professional will inject a lethal dose into her bloodstream.\n\"I want to be surrounded by the people I love and just have everybody hold me in a giant cuddle puddle and get to take my last breath, surrounded by love and support,\" she says.\nApril was born with spina bifida and was later diagnosed with tumours at the base of her spine which she says have left her in constant, debilitating pain.\nShe's been taking strong opioid painkillers for more than 20 years and applied for Medical Assistance in Dying (Maid) in March 2023. While she could yet live for decades with her condition, she qualified to end her life early seven months after applying. For those who are terminally ill it is possible to get approval within 24 hours.\n\"My suffering and pain are increasing and I don't have the quality of life anymore that makes me happy and fulfilled,\" April says. Every time she moves or breathes, she says it feels like the tissues from the base of her spine \"are being pulled like a rubber band that stretches too far\", and that her lower limbs leave her in agony.\nWe meet April as, almost 3,000 miles away, MPs are scrutinising proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. They voted in principle in support of those plans in November 2024, but months of detailed scrutiny have followed - and further votes in the Commons and Lords are required before the bill could possibly become law.\nThis week, the BBC witnessed a man's death in California, where assisted dying laws are far more similar to those being considered in Westminster.\nCritics say Canada is an example of the \"slippery slope\", meaning that once you pass an assisted dying law it will inevitably widen its scope and have fewer safeguards.\nCanada now has one of the most liberal systems of assisted dying in the world, similar to that operating in the Netherlands and Belgium. It introduced Maid in 2016, initially for terminally ill adults with a serious and incurable physical illness, which causes intolerable suffering. In 2021, the need to be terminally ill was removed, and in two years' time, the Canadian government plans to open Maid to adults solely with a mental illness and no physical ailment.\nOpponents of Maid tell us that death is coming to be seen as a standard treatment option for those with disabilities and complex medical problems.\n\"It is easier in Canada to get medical assistance in dying than it is to get government support to live,\" says Andrew Gurza, a disability awareness consultant and friend of April's.\nAndrew, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, says he respects April's decision, but tells us: \"If my disability declines and my care needs got higher, I'd still want to be here. To know there's a law that's saying you could easily end your life - it's just really scary.\"\nBefore she was approved for Maid, April was assessed by two independent physicians who were required to inform her of ways to alleviate her suffering and offer alternative treatments.\n\"The safeguards are there,\" she says, when we press her about disabled people who feel threatened by assisted dying, or whether Maid is being used as a shortcut to better quality care. \"If it's not right for you and you're not leading the charge and choosing Maid, you're not going to be able to access it unless it's for the right reasons,\" she adds.\nThere were 15,343 Maid deaths in 2023, representing around one in 20 of all deaths in Canada - a proportion that has increased dramatically since 2016 and is one of the highest in the world. The average age of recipients was 77.\nIn all but a handful of cases, the lethal dose was delivered by a doctor or nurse, which is also known as voluntary euthanasia. One doctor we spoke to, Eric Thomas, said he had helped 577 patients to die.\nDr Konia Trouton, president of the Canadian Association of Maid Assessors and Providers, has also helped hundreds of patients to die since the law was introduced.\nThe procedure is the same each time - she arrives at the home of the person who has been given approval for Maid and asks if they wish to go ahead with it that day. She says the patients always direct the process and then give her the \"heads up and ready to go\".\n\"That gives me an honour and a duty and a privilege to be able to help them in those last moments with their family around them, with those who love them around them and to know that they've made that decision thoughtfully, carefully and thoroughly,\" she adds.  If the answer is yes, she opens her medical bag.\nDemonstrating to the BBC what happens next, Dr Trouton briefly puts a tourniquet on my arm. She shows me where the needle would be inserted into a vein in the back of my hand to allow an intravenous infusion of lethal drugs.\nIn her medical bag she also has a stethoscope. \"Strangely, these days I use it more to determine if someone has no heartbeat rather than if they do,\" she tells me.\nA list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line\nSome 96% of Maid provisions are under \"track one\" where death is \"reasonably foreseeable\". Dr Trouton says that means patients are on a \"trajectory toward death\", which might range from someone who has rapidly spreading cancer and only weeks to live or another with Alzheimer's \"who might have five to seven years\".\nThe other 4% of Maid deaths come under \"track two\". These are adults, like April, who are not dying but have suffering which is intolerable to them from a \"grievous and irremediable medical condition\".\nThat is in stark contrast to Labour MP Kim Leadbeater's bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales, which says patients must be expected to die within six months. The Westminster bill would not allow doctors to give a lethal dose \u2013 rather patients would have to self-administer the drugs, usually by swallowing them.\nDeath via intravenous infusion normally takes just a few minutes, as the lethal drugs go straight into the bloodstream, whereas swallowing the drugs means patients usually take around an hour or two to die, but can take considerably longer, although they are usually unconscious after a few minutes.\nDr Trouton told me she regarded the Canadian system as quicker and more effective, as do other Maid providers. \"I'm concerned that if some people can't swallow because of their disease process, and if they're not able to take the entire quantity of medication because of breathing difficulties or swallowing difficulties, what will happen?\"\nBut opponents argue it's being used as a cheaper alternative to providing adequate social or medical support.\nOne of them is Dr Ramona Coelho, a GP in London, Ontario, whose practice serves many marginalised groups and those struggling to get medical and social support. She's part of a Maid Death Review Committee, alongside Dr Trouton, which examines cases in the province.\nDr Coelho told me that Maid was \"out of control\". \"I wouldn't even call it a slippery slope,\" she says \"Canada has fallen off a cliff.\"\n\"When people have suicidal ideations, we used to meet them with counselling and care, and for people with terminal illness and other diseases we could mitigate that suffering and help them have a better life,\" she says. \"Yet now we are seeing that as an appropriate request to die and ending their lives very quickly.\"\nWhile at Dr Coelho's surgery I was introduced to Vicki Whelan, a retired nurse whose mum Sharon Scribner died in April 2023 of lung cancer, aged 81. Vicki told me that in her mum's final days in hospital she was repeatedly offered the option of Maid by medical staff, describing it as like a \"sales pitch\".\nThe family, who are Catholic, discharged their mother so she could die at home, where Vicki says her mum had a \"beautiful, peaceful death\". \"It makes us think that we can't endure, and we can't suffer a little bit, and that somehow now they've decided that dying needs to be assisted, where we've been dying for years.\n\"All of a sudden now we're telling people that this is a better option. This is an easy way out and I think it's just robbing people of hope.\"\nSo is Canada an example of the so-called slippery slope? It's certainly true that the eligibility criteria has broadened dramatically since the law was introduced nine years ago, so for critics the answer would be an emphatic yes and serve as a warning to Britain.\nCanada's assisted dying laws were driven by court rulings. Its Supreme Court instructed Parliament that a prohibition on assisted dying breached the country's Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The extension of eligibility for those who were not terminally ill was in part a response to another court decision.\nIn Britain, judges in the most senior courts have repeatedly said any potential change to the law around assisted dying is a matter for Parliament, after the likes of Tony Nicklinson, Diane Pretty and Noel Conway brought cases arguing the blanket ban on assisted suicide breached their human rights.\nApril knows some people may look at her, a young woman, and wonder why she would die.\n\"We're the masters of masking and not letting people see that we're suffering,\" she says. \"But in reality, there's days that I just can't hide it, and there's many days where I can't lift my head off the pillow and I can't eat anymore.\n\"It's not a way I want to live for another 10 or 20 or 30 years.\"\nAdditional reporting by Joshua Falcon.",

Many nations will face much higher tariffs of up to 50%, starting on 9 April.\nTrump has said his intervention was aimed at encouraging US consumers to buy more American goods and boost the domestic economy.\nBut the announcement - and retaliatory tariffs from countries such as China - led to stocks plunging more than 5% amid fears of a global recession.\nJaguar Land Rover announced on Saturday it would \"pause\" all shipments to the US as it works to \"address the new trading terms\".\nSir Keir wrote: \"This week we will turbocharge plans that will improve our domestic competitiveness, so we're less exposed to these kinds of global shocks.\n\"We stand ready to use industrial policy to help shelter British business from the storm.\"\nThe prime minister admitted some may feel \"uncomfortable\" with the government intervening in the economy, but said the UK could not \"cling to old sentiments when the world is turning this fast\". \nHe has not ruled out further tax rises in the autumn, but pointed out the government had resisted doing so in its Spring Statement. \nAn industrial strategy promised in Labour's election manifesto is due to be unveiled this summer. Elements of that could now be adapted and brought forward to aid UK firms.\nIn the Telegraph, Sir Keir reiterated the government's position that it would \"keep calm and fight for the best deal\" with the US, but said \"all options remain on the table\".\nHe added: \"I will only strike a deal if it is right for British business and the security of working people.\"\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch has urged the prime minister to strike a \"deep and meaningful trade deal\" with the US, that \"delivers growth without compromising on standards\".\nThe UK exported nearly \u00a360bn worth of goods to the US last year, mainly machinery, cars and pharmaceuticals.\nOn Wednesday, the government published a 400-page list of US goods it could include in any possible tariff response. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told MPs the government would consult with businesses on how retaliatory tariffs could affect them.\nThe list covers 27% of imports from the US - chosen because they would have a \"more limited impact\" on the UK economy, the Department for Business and Trade said.\nSir Keir said he would also seek to reduce trade barriers with other economies to limit the impact of US tariffs on UK exports.\nOver the weekend, the prime minister spoke to several world leaders to discuss how to respond to the US tariffs.\nIn a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday, the pair agreed a trade war was \"in nobody's interests\" but \"nothing should be off the table\".\nBut both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say UK families and businesses will first feel the impact of the National Insurance hike for employers that takes effect today.",

Since the 1980s, he has brought history and culture to audiences in a way that textbooks simply cannot.\nBurns's body of work has earned him two Academy Award nominations, two Grammy Awards and 15 Emmy wins. At his home in Walpole, New Hampshire, US, the acclaimed documentary-maker tells BBC special correspondent Katty Kay that, like most creatives, he has more ideas than he knows what to do with.\n\"Your head might be filled with 40 or 50 topics, as my head is always filled up, but when one [topic] drops down to your heart, you realise it's firing on all cylinders,\" Burns tells Kay.\nThose topics have ranged from jazz to baseball, and from the granular, such as a chronicle of Leonardo da Vinci's life and work, to the expansive, like 2009's The National Parks: America's Best Idea.\n\"I don't want to tell you stories about what I know,\" he says.\u00a0\"I'd rather share with you a process of discovery. So, I dive into things that I don't know enough about.\" His next area of exploration is the 18th Century: his six-part, 12-hour series, The American Revolution, is due to air on PBS on 16 November. This month marks the 250th anniversary of the start of the American War of Independence, which began in the 13 colonies of British America in 1775, and continued for many years, culminating in the founding of a United States of America.\n\"The American Revolution is one of the most important events in human history,\" Burns told PBS ahead of special screenings for students and teachers across the US. \"We went from being subjects to inventing a new concept, citizens, and set in motion democratic revolutions around the globe.\"\nOn the subject of history, Burns says he does not subscribe to the popular view that it is always doomed to repeat itself, deferring to the opinion of the 19th-Century Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana. \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,\" was Santanya's comment, in reference to the Holocaust. \"It's [a] lovely phrase you'd wish would be true,\" says Burns. He also points to the famous quote that is attributed to US author Mark Twain: \"History doesn't repeat itself, but it does often rhyme.\"\nBurns doesn't gloss over the uncomfortable parts of US history, pointing out that, for him, being patriotic doesn't mean erasing the past; for instance, the fact that Benjamin Franklin owned slaves. \"He knew it was wrong, and he kept doing it,\" Burns says.\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay\nWatch\u00a0Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on\u202fYouTube.\n\"At the beginning, growing up, I had a kind of idealised version of my country. I love my country. I don't know anyone who loves their country more than me. I make films about the US, but I make films about us.\"\nBurns tells Kay that he believes it can take time for a story's significance to be understood. \"I've been interviewing Obama about his administration, and the longer I wait to do that film, the better it will be, because of the perspective that the passage of time will give,\" Burns says.\nWhen asked about the breadth of his work, which ranges from biographies of single individuals to global events, Burns says that he can be laser-focused on the task at hand. As Burns wraps up The American Revolution and the forthcoming Obama project, he says that he has more than enough material to last beyond \"the 2030s\" \u2013 and, in particular, he has his eyes set on a history of the US's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\nMore like this:\n\u2022 It took nearly 60 years for Brooke Shields to overcome her imposter syndrome\n\u2022 'I was born to be an actor': Twice-knighted Derek Jacobi on nearly 70 years on the stage and screen\n\u2022 Expect to 'age out' of your career, says Vera Wang \u2013\u00a0 she's had at least four\n\"Somebody asked of Duke Ellington, who is certainly our most prolific [composer, with] maybe 22\u2026, 2,300, 2,400 compositions, what the most important one is.

The pressure remains to urgently find a viable long-term solution for the canal. \n\"We will continue to call on the Welsh government to help secure a more sustainable future for this beautiful canal that brings so much to the area.\"\nThe Welsh government previously said \"protecting and enhancing our environment and natural resources is key to addressing the climate and nature emergencies\".\nIt added any arrangement between the canal and Welsh Water would be a commercial contractual decision in which it should not be involved.\nWelsh Water said it was \"pleased to have come to an agreement to support the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal that covers the cost of providing the water and doesn't incur additional costs for our customers or put at risk the supply of drinking water over the summer\".\n\"We will continue to work closely with the Canal and Rivers Trust, Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Government on a longer-term solution that can support the canal beyond the coming year,\" it added.",

Robbie, 35, stayed at the hotel Simonstone Hall, near Hawes, with other cast members.\nShe was also photographed in a white wedding gown surrounded by film crew for a scene believed to be her marriage to Heathcliff's rival, Edgar Linton.\nFashion bible Vogue has criticised her dress as being historically inaccurate, as the style was only popularised by Queen Victoria 40 years after the story is set.\nThe hotel is a \"historic country lodge\" where presenter Jeremy Clarkson famously got into a fight with a Top Gear producer in 2015. \nA staff member said Robbie was \"very lovely\" and even enjoyed a Sunday roast and afternoon tea there with her husband and new baby. \nThe employee told the BBC: \"The weekend was great fun, where she met lots of other guests and visitors and she introduced her baby to the resident pigs and peacocks here.\" \nThe film crew's base camp was near Holiday Home Yorkshire in Reeth, whose owner said it was \"very exciting\" seeing the trailers in the tiny village. \nOne local holiday let owner said he saw Robbie driving a tractor with her co-star - although the agricultural vehicles were not invented until the late 19th Century.\nHe said: \"There were four tractors, old-fashioned open-to-the-elements style and they were being escorted by two Range Rovers.\"\nAnother Dales resident said he had seen filming at Surrender Bridge, which is close to an old lead smelting mill. The landmark also featured in the opening scene of the BBC series All Creatures Great and Small in the 1980s and is on the Coast to Coast path route.\nCrew members also stayed at the Charles Bathurst Inn, in Arkengarthdale, and were described as \"very friendly\". \nThe film, directed by Emerald Fennell, is due for release in February 2026. \nThere are hopes that it will lead to an upsurge in interest in the Bronte sisters and their work.\nThe director of the Bronte Parsonage Museum, a literary museum located at the former Bronte family home in Haworth, West Yorkshire, said: \"Every screen or theatre adaptation brings something fresh for contemporary audiences to think about. \n\"It is a testimony of Emily's legacy that her writing continues to inspire creatives today and we look forward to seeing what Emerald Fennell's adaptation adds to the mix.\" \nHaworth Parsonage is where Emily Bronte wrote Wuthering Heights and lived with her sisters Charlotte and Anne, and it was gifted to the Bronte Society in 1928. \nIt has the largest collection of Bront\u00eb items in the world. \nDirector Rebecca Yorke added: \"We're also delighted that some filming has taken place at nearby locations and hope that this will attract new visitors to the area and to the Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum.\" \nThere have been at least 10 film and television adaptations of Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte's only novel. \nOne of the most well-known was the 1939 version starring Merle Oberon as Cathy and Laurence Olivier as Heathcliff. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.\nOther high-profile actors who have played Heathcliff over the years include Ralph Fiennes, Tom Hardy and Richard Burton. \nMeanwhile, North Yorkshire was also the filming location for a Christmas film starring Rebel Wilson and Kiefer Sutherland. \nTinsel Town will be released in December 2025 and was shot in Knaresborough.\nWilson, 45, said at the time she \"loved\" the area and had been practising her Yorkshire accent. \nIn 2021, Tom Cruise surprised locals of Pickering when he touched down in a helicopter to shoot scenes for Mission: Impossible at a heritage railway. \nThe owner of a local B&B said in a Facebook post they had been walking the dog when they \"bumped into\" the Hollywood megastar.\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.",

Several media reports have linked Mr Polyakov to a YouTube account, which features videos of a recent trip to Afghanistan. \n\"As well as all the somewhat more established threats to such peoples - from things like logging and mining in the Amazon where most uncontacted peoples live - there are now an increasing number of... influencers who are trying to do this kind of thing for followers,\" Mr Mazower said.\n\"There's a growing social media fascination with this whole idea.\"\nSurvival International describes the Sentinelese as \"the most isolated Indigenous people in the world\" living on an island around the size of Manhattan.  \nMr Mazower told the BBC an estimated 200 people belong to the tribe, before adding it was \"impossible\" to know its true number.\nFew details are known about the group, other than they are a hunter-gatherer community who live in small settlements and are \"extremely healthy\", he said. \nHe added that the incident highlighted why government protections for communities such as the Sentinelese are so important.\nThe UN's Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention sets out obligations for governments to protect the rights. India's government has an initiative focusing on tribal welfare, but the country has come under criticism in recent years for failing to protect against evictions. \nIt is not the first time an outsider has attempted to make contact with the Sentinelese. \nIn November 2018, John Allen Chau, also a US national, was killed by the tribe after visiting the same island. \nLocal officials said the 27-year-old was a Christian missionary. \nMr Chau was shot with bows and arrows upon landing. Reports at the time suggested he had bribed fisherman to take him to the island.",

        "article_text": "It may be that zoo animals are so well cared for they develop allergies as a side effect.\nIn 2018, staff at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago began to notice something unusual about a male polar bear named Siku. He was losing hair, revealing patches of black skin underneath. Evidently itchy, he was scratching and rubbing himself against his enclosure. Kathryn Gamble, the zoo's director of veterinary medicine, had a hunch what was wrong: allergies.\nBut what would a polar bear be allergic to? Gamble and her colleagues anaesthetized Siku and conducted a skin test, injecting small amounts of various allergy-provoking substances into his skin. Siku's skin reacted against house mites, as well as elm, mulberry and red cedar pollen. Oddly enough, \"one of the things that he initially showed a very strong response to on his skin was actually human hair dander\", Gamble recalls.\nWe often think that allergies only afflict people, but a broad range of other animals can also develop them. That includes pet dogs and cats \u2013 in which experts say allergies are on the rise \u2013 but also everything from rhinoceroses, bats, dolphins to chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys. Lincoln Park Zoo staff say they have seen allergy-afflicted black leopards, fennec foxes, saki monkeys, Japanese macaques and black bears.\nFortunately for itchy animals living in captivity like Siku, animal allergies are treatable, just like in humans. But these cases may also tell us something deeper about how and why allergies develop.\nScientists speculate that animals get allergies for similar reasons as people in many Western countries \u2013 especially those living in cities \u2013 who are currently experiencing a rise in allergies.\nSome experts blame the fact that pets, as well as farm and zoo animals, are increasingly being raised in manmade environments where they're less exposed to the parasites, microbes and other pathogens that they evolved with, causing their immune system to go awry.\u00a0\n\"In dogs and cats, the numbers definitely have gone up, as the numbers in people have gone up,\" says Annette Petersen, a veterinary dermatologist at Michigan State University. \"I wouldn't be surprised if more zoo animals [are getting] allergies too,\" she adds \u2013 although no research has yet looked into whether or not this is the case.\u00a0\u00a0\nAllergy symptoms can vary across animals. Humans and other primates that inhale allergy-causing substances through the nose often develop hay fever-type symptoms, with discharge, sneezing and weepy eyes. But most animals absorb allergy-provoking substances through the skin and develop skin conditions, says Andrew Rosenberg, a veterinary dermatologist and director of medical operations at the Animal Dermatology Group, a US-based veterinary company.\nThe cats Rosenberg sees will often scratch their face and neck, tear out hair, or develop pink plaques or crusted pimples on their bodies. Allergic dogs will lick itchy paws and scratch at armpits and groin areas \u2013 and tend to develop ear infections. Horses can break out in hives. Occasionally, Rosenberg also sees allergic zoo animals \u2013 like the itchy female rhinoceros and her calf from New York's Bronx Zoo that developed severe rashes, bloody ulcerations and weeping infections.\u00a0 \u00a0\nPut simply, allergies occur when the immune system \u2013 which is supposed to protect us from harmful parasites, bacteria or viruses \u2013 mistakenly produces an exaggerated response to harmless substances, like peanuts or pollen.\nIt's unclear what exactly is causing the current rise in allergies among people. While some experts used to solely blame the fact that humans are increasingly growing up in cleaner, more hygienic environments where they're less exposed to microbes than in the wild, research is now pointing to a wider set of factors that also involves the loss of important microbes and parasites that live in and on our bodies, says Andrea Graham, a parasitologist at Princeton University.\nFrequent cleaning and soaps likely contributes to our reduced exposure to these organisms, alongside the use of antibiotic drugs and ointments, greater distancing from domesticated animals and parasite-free food, Graham says. (People can take some steps to help reduce the likelihood of allergies, however \u2013 read more about\u00a0the habits that help prevent allergies here).\nThe loss of certain parasites and microbes in our guts may be particularly consequential; scientists believe that these used to play an important role in our biology by suppressing and modulating our immune system in order to avoid being attacked by it, says Graham. Now, without these organisms to rein in and train our immune response, our immune system is more likely to go into overdrive, including against harmless pathogens, she adds.\nScientists also believe that early childhood exposure to microbes and parasites is especially important for training the immune system to correctly discriminate between harmful and harmless substances and mount an appropriate response. \"Early life is really important for getting the tuning of your immune system right,\" Graham says.\nSome of the best evidence for this theory comes from studies of Amish populations in the US. One 2016 study compared Amish children in Indiana state, who use traditional farming practices and are exposed to lots of microbes through interactions with farm animals and house dust, with children from Hutterite communities in South Dakota, who use highly industrialised farming practices and live in households less exposed to dust and animals. Though both populations were genetically very similar, \"the rate of allergies was about four times higher in the Hutterites who had taken on modern industrial farming\", says Andrew Flies, an immunologist at the University of Tasmania's Menzies Institute for Medical Research.\nFlies, Petersen, Graham and Rosenberg all suspect that animals kept in households, farms and zoos might develop allergies for similar reasons. They typically get dewormed and vaccinated to prevent infections, and are generally less exposed to the bacteria and parasites they evolved with compared to their relatives in the wild, Graham says.\nFor zoo animals, Petersen says, \"the food they're eating is parasite-free and probably not heavily bacterially contaminated\". Compare that to a bacteria-smothered cadaver a lion would eat in the Serengeti, probably together with the prey's microbe- and parasite-containing guts.\u00a0\nIn other words, it may be that animals are so well cared for in zoos they develop allergies as a side effect.\nWhile no-one has yet published a specific study looking into this, Flies and others suspect that allergies are much more common in these more human environments than in the wilderness. In the wild, allergies might affect the survival of animals \u2013 for instance if allergic animals scratch themselves and develop infections, Flies says. Petersen recalls a lion with allergies she once treated who had developed a bad ear infection. \"If he can't hear well in the wild \u2013 if the ears are plugged with pus and stuff from the infection \u2013 that would obviously be a major disadvantage,\" she says. For these reasons, allergies may have disappeared from wild populations.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut that theory is tough to prove. Animals in the wild may well have allergies, Gamble says \u2013 but we would be less likely to spot them.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat may have contributed to Siku's allergies, Gamble adds, is the fact that he had been moved to Chicago two years before he started developing them. Often, \"if a person moves to a new environment where they're exposed to pollens that their bodies have never seen before, they have a response to it,\" she says.\nOther factors may also be contributing to allergies in animals. Rosenberg says that in his clinic in the northeastern US, where he's seen rising cases of pet allergies, this may be linked to climate change, which is causing higher pollen counts and longer allergy seasons. \"It's my impression that we're seeing more common allergies and we're seeing more severe allergies than ever before,\" he says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why we may soon need to eat 'resurrection' plants\n\u2022 Elephants hate bees \u2013 here's why that's good news for Kenyan farmers\n\u2022 Mud, water and wood: The system that kept a 1604-year-old city afloat\nAs awareness around animal allergies is growing, so is knowledge on how to treat them. Rosenberg was able to treat the allergic rhinoceroses with an approach similar to allergy shots in people, injecting them with small doses of the allergy-provoking substances and gradually dialling up the dose to teach their immune systems that they don't represent a threat and to lessen their response.\nSiku the polar bear received a similar treatment, receiving a combination of allergy-provoking substances mixed into organic honey \u2013 the licking of which helped the substances get absorbed through the soft tissues in his mouth. Honey has the added benefit of containing some local pollen itself, Gamble adds. And sure enough, during another allergy test 36 months after the treatment, Siku was much less reactive to the substances he had previously been allergic to \u2013 including human hair dander.\u00a0 \u00a0\nFor a long time, studies of animals have been used to better understand health conditions in people, but allergies are a rare case where lessons learned in humans may help animals, Flies says.\nOne lesson is the value of being exposed to a rich community of microorganisms. As many people turn to yoghurts and other probiotics for their health benefits, including a reduction in allergies, perhaps researchers can find ways to do the same for zoo animals, farm animals and pets at risk of developing allergies, says Graham.\n\"I'm hopeful that more and more people will study it because I do think we're still battling against this idea that 'clean' is always healthier.\"\n--\u00a0\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

For these reasons, allergies may have disappeared from wild populations.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut that theory is tough to prove. Animals in the wild may well have allergies, Gamble says \u2013 but we would be less likely to spot them.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat may have contributed to Siku's allergies, Gamble adds, is the fact that he had been moved to Chicago two years before he started developing them. Often, \"if a person moves to a new environment where they're exposed to pollens that their bodies have never seen before, they have a response to it,\" she says.\nOther factors may also be contributing to allergies in animals. Rosenberg says that in his clinic in the northeastern US, where he's seen rising cases of pet allergies, this may be linked to climate change, which is causing higher pollen counts and longer allergy seasons. \"It's my impression that we're seeing more common allergies and we're seeing more severe allergies than ever before,\" he says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why we may soon need to eat 'resurrection' plants\n\u2022 Elephants hate bees \u2013 here's why that's good news for Kenyan farmers\n\u2022 Mud, water and wood: The system that kept a 1604-year-old city afloat\nAs awareness around animal allergies is growing, so is knowledge on how to treat them. Rosenberg was able to treat the allergic rhinoceroses with an approach similar to allergy shots in people, injecting them with small doses of the allergy-provoking substances and gradually dialling up the dose to teach their immune systems that they don't represent a threat and to lessen their response.\nSiku the polar bear received a similar treatment, receiving a combination of allergy-provoking substances mixed into organic honey \u2013 the licking of which helped the substances get absorbed through the soft tissues in his mouth. Honey has the added benefit of containing some local pollen itself, Gamble adds. And sure enough, during another allergy test 36 months after the treatment, Siku was much less reactive to the substances he had previously been allergic to \u2013 including human hair dander.\u00a0 \u00a0\nFor a long time, studies of animals have been used to better understand health conditions in people, but allergies are a rare case where lessons learned in humans may help animals, Flies says.\nOne lesson is the value of being exposed to a rich community of microorganisms. As many people turn to yoghurts and other probiotics for their health benefits, including a reduction in allergies, perhaps researchers can find ways to do the same for zoo animals, farm animals and pets at risk of developing allergies, says Graham.\n\"I'm hopeful that more and more people will study it because I do think we're still battling against this idea that 'clean' is always healthier.\"\n--\u00a0\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

Lincoln Park Zoo staff say they have seen allergy-afflicted black leopards, fennec foxes, saki monkeys, Japanese macaques and black bears.For a long time, studies of animals have been used to better understand health conditions in people, but allergies are a rare case where lessons learned in humans may help animals \u2013 Andrew FliesFortunately for itchy animals living in captivity like Siku, animal allergies are treatable, just like in humans. But these cases may also tell us something deeper about how and why allergies develop.Scientists speculate that animals get allergies for similar reasons as people in many Western countries \u2013 especially those living in cities \u2013 who are currently experiencing a rise in allergies.Some experts blame the fact that pets, as well as farm and zoo animals, are increasingly being raised in manmade environments where they're less exposed to the parasites, microbes and other pathogens that they evolved with, causing their immune system to go awry. But most animals absorb allergy-provoking substances through the skin and develop skin conditions, says Andrew Rosenberg, a veterinary dermatologist and director of medical operations at the Animal Dermatology Group, a US-based veterinary company.Getty ImagesExperts say allergies in dogs are on the rise too, with flea and environmental allergies more common than food allergies (Credit: Getty Images)The cats Rosenberg sees will often scratch their face and neck, tear out hair, or develop pink plaques or crusted pimples on their bodies. While some experts used to solely blame the fact that humans are increasingly growing up in cleaner, more hygienic environments where they're less exposed to microbes than in the wild, research is now pointing to a wider set of factors that also involves the loss of important microbes and parasites that live in and on our bodies, says Andrea Graham, a parasitologist at Princeton University.It may be that zoo animals are so well cared for they develop allergies as a side effectFrequent cleaning and soaps likely contributes to our reduced exposure to these organisms, alongside the use of antibiotic drugs and ointments, greater distancing from domesticated animals and parasite-free food, Graham says.",

The invention catches on, but one night some graves containing these high-tech \"shrouds\" are desecrated, so Karsh and his brother-in-law (Guy Pearce) have to work out who was responsible. This may sound like the kind of scenario that the director of Scanners and The Fly might use to justify lots of gory body horror, but The Shrouds is a \"restrained, even elegant\" film inspired by Cronenberg's own bereavement, says Steve Pond at The Wrap. \"It's a deeply personal look at loss that finds plenty of time to get creepy but never loses sight of the fact that it's a movie about grief\u2026 Its focus, which never wavers, is always on the feeling of loss, not the sight of gore.\"\nReleased on 18 April in the US\nThree of Hollywood's brightest young stars get together in On Swift Horses, a handsome period romance directed by Daniel Minhan and adapted from Shannon Pufahl's novel. Daisy Edgar-Jones plays Muriel, the fianc\u00e9e of an upstanding Korean War veteran, Lee (Will Poulter). He is looking forward to a traditional family life in California in the go-getting 1950s, but when his younger brother Julius (Jacob Elordi) comes to stay, Julius's gay relationships and gambling sprees help Muriel to understand why she is attracted to women and drawn to betting on horse races. Graham Guttman at Screen Rant calls the film a \"quietly devastating [story of] great pain and even greater love, all of which is portrayed beautifully by the film's all-star cast\", adding: \"On Swift Horses, with its sweeping romance and epic nature, feels outside of time, transcending any issues to become something deeply affecting.\" On the other hand, the BBC's Caryn James considers it \"a disappointment [that] works much better as an idea than as a film\".\nReleased on 25 April in the US and Canada, and on 30 April in France\nOn a remote island in Eastern Europe, fanged and furry monsters called Ochi lurk in the forests. A farmer (Willem Dafoe) is obsessed by hunting them, but when his shy teenage daughter (Helena Zengel) finds an injured baby Ochi, it turns out to be a big-eyed, pointy-eared beastie that bears a striking resemblance to Gizmo from Gremlins and Grogu from The Mandalorian. The girl then defies her father and takes the creature back to its family \u2013 a journey that is visualised using practical rather than digital effects. \"The Legend of Ochi, the rare A24 family film, is a charming throwback to adventure movies of the 80s like The Neverending Story and The Dark Crystal,\" says Brian Tallerico at RogerEbert.com, \"complete with original puppetry that reportedly contains not an ounce of CGI manipulation. It feels like a family film made by flesh-and-blood people in an era when computers are doing so much of the work.\"\nReleased on 25 April in the US, the UK, Canada and Ireland\nRyan Coogler has already put his own personal stamp on the sports drama (Creed) and the superhero blockbuster (Black Panther), and now, with Sinners, the writer-director takes on gothic horror. His favourite leading man, Michael B Jordan, plays two gun-toting twin brothers, Smoke and Stack, who go back to their rural hometown in 1930s Louisiana, only to find that the local blues music \"can pierce the veil between life and death\". The town is soon infested with vampires \u2013 but don't think of Sinners as a straightforward vampire chiller. \"The film is very genre-fluid,\" Coogler said in The Hollywood Reporter. \"It switches in and out of a lot of different genres. Yes, vampires are an element, but it's not the only supernatural element in the movie... I'm blessed to have found this medium that I can work out deep philosophical and existential questions that I may be struggling with while contributing to an art form that means so much to my family.\"\nReleased internationally on 18 April\nFirst dates can be awkward, but not many are as awkward as the one in Drop, a high-concept one-location thriller from Christopher Landon, the writer-director of Happy Death Day and Freaky. Meghann Fahy stars as a single mother, Violet, who agrees to have dinner with the eligible Henry (Brandon Sklenar) in a Chicago skyscraper's restaurant. Everything is going smoothly until someone in the restaurant starts sending threatening messages to Violet's phone. She is told that there is an intruder in her home, and that unless she poisons Henry, her five-year-old son will be killed. \"[Fahy's] dialled-in performance is thankfully matched by an overarching crispness to the proceedings,\" says Adrian Horton in The Guardian. \"Just enough flourishes, an enjoyable but not unbearable amount of stress, no wasted time, a perfect match of star, script and style. For those who sort for lean and limber in their thrillers, Drop is a date worth making.\"\nReleased internationally on 11 April\nWhen Alex Garland was making his last film, Civil War, his military advisor for the battle sequences was Ray Mendoza, an Iraq War veteran. This collaboration prompted Garland and Mendoza to co-direct another film, a faithful recreation of a battle which Mendoza himself was in, that plays out in real time over 90 minutes. D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai plays Mendoza (alongside Will Poulter, Joseph Quinn and Charles Melton) in what some critics are calling cinema's most authentic and immersive ever depiction of a wartime firefight. It's a film that pushes the \"war is hell\" concept \"to its logical, visceral and most infernal conclusion\", says Kevin Maher in The Times. \"This is a movie that's as difficult to watch as it is to forget. It's a sensory blitz, a percussive nightmare and a relentless assault on the soul.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US and Canada, 16 April in Spain, 17 April in Australia, Brazil and Germany, and 18 April in the UK\nIf you finished watching Peter Jackson's series, The Beatles: Get Back, and you wanted to know what John Lennon got up to after the Fab Four broke up, then One to One: John & Yoko could be the film for you. Directed by Kevin Macdonald (One Day in September, Marley) along with Sam Rice-Edwards, the documentary chronicles the 18 months in the early 1970s when Lennon and Yoko One lived in Greenwich Village, New York. It covers the only full-length concert Lennon played after his time in The Beatles \u2013 but that was just one of the couple's many endeavours during their stay in the Big Apple. \"Drawing on televised interviews, taped phone calls with agents and managers, and personal film footage,\" says David Hughes in Time Out, \"Macdonald charts the couple's determination to fight for any worthy cause that crosses their eyeline, from the Vietnam War to fundraising for remanded prisoners unable to afford bail. The pair's artistry, individually and collectively, seems to be matched only by their energy and moral clarity.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US, the UK and Ireland\nWhat if Die Hard was set at a meeting of the world's most powerful political leaders? And what if the US president in Air Force One was a woman? The answer to both of these questions can be found in G20, a gleefully over-the-top action thriller directed by Patricia Riggen. Viola Davis stars as US President Danielle Sutton, who is at a G20 summit in South Africa when a terrorist group takes the guests hostage. What the bad guys (led by Antony Starr from The Boys) haven't counted on is that the POTUS is an army veteran, and even when she's wearing a cocktail dress, she can fight with the best of them. \"It was the sort of thing you'd imagine as a kid, just playing the most heroic character you could possibly play,\" Davis told Variety. The only question the film doesn't answer is whether the sequel will be called G21.\nReleased on 10 April on Prime\nA Minecraft Movie is a children's adventure co-starring Jack Black, and adapted from a video game about a colourful fantasy world being threatened by infernal invaders. Does that sound familiar? If so, it's because the very same summary applies to The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Still, that was the second highest grossing film of 2023, so maybe A Minecraft Movie will be just as lucrative. The difference is that the new film, which also stars Jason Momoa and Jennifer Coolidge, has live-action actors in a CGI world. Also, it's directed by Jared Hess, the maker of such eccentric comedies as Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre. \"By some force of alchemy, his cockeyed look at things \u2013 a mix of deadpan delivery, garish colours, and exaggerated interactions \u2013 is weirdly perfect for this adaptation,\" says Jordan Hoffman in Entertainment Weekly. \"There's an 'anything goes' attitude here\u2026 [and] this loosey-goosey attitude is a breath of fresh air after so many family films that seem preordained by lore.\"\nReleased internationally on 4 April\nWith a dynamic that's not a million miles away from the central relationship in A Real Pain, Sacramento is an indie comedy about two mismatched male friends \u2013 one neurotic, the other annoyingly outgoing \u2013 embarking on a trip together. Glenn, played by Michael Cera, is even more anxious than usual because he is about to become a father, while the extrovert Rickey, played by Michael Angarano, is traumatised by the death of his own father. Could a weekend in Sacramento, California help them to overcome all of their issues? Angarano is also the co-writer, co-producer and director of a film that features both his ex-partner, Kristen Stewart, and his current partner, Maya Erskine. David Ehrlich at IndieWire says that Angarano \"graduates from overeager dilettante to unusually shrewd comic director\" with Sacramento. \"Its casual nature and outward lack of ambition belie how well it manages to convey the terror that change brings into our lives, the mania of trying to deny it, and the relief that comes from recognising that someone else in your world is changing with you.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US\nAng Lee's second film, The Wedding Banquet, was a romantic comedy about a gay Taiwanese New Yorker who marries a Chinese woman so that she can get a green card, only for his unwitting parents to mark the occasion with a lavish party. The film made Lee's name as a director when it was released in 1993, and it went on to be nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Now it has been remade by Andrew Ahn (Fire Island), with a stellar cast that includes Bowen Yang (Wicked), Lily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon) and Kelly Marie Tran (Star Wars: The Last Jedi). Ahn moves the story to Seattle, adds a subplot about fertility treatment, and rejigs the nationalities and generations so that the visiting relative is now a grandmother (Minari's Youn Yuh-jung) from South Korea. \"An intended marriage of convenience still lies at its heart,\" says Amber Wilkinson in Screen Daily, \"but the relationships are given a modern makeover as Ahn probes questions of commitment and celebrates the families we choose to make for ourselves\".\nReleased on 18 April in the US and Canada\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/d4f6/live/3b43abe0-1089-11f0-ac9f-c37d6fd89579.jpg",
        "article_text": "Is it simply the modern language of football? Or just \"jargon\" dressing up the game's time-honoured glossary of terms in fancy new clothes?\nFrom a \"low block\" to a \"high press\", football's phrasebook has gained many new entries in recent years that have become part of the conversations before, during and after games.\nThese words alone spark debate from supporters to players past and present, from the cynics who dismiss them, to the newer generation who embrace them as an integral part of the football experience.\nBBC Sport pundits Pat Nevin and Chris Sutton, who have to decide which to use or avoid, have outspoken views on the subject.\nFormer Scotland forward Nevin says: \"I think it's just jargon used in every industry. It is showing someone you're in a little cosy club. You are saying 'we know about these things' and it makes you sound a bit cleverer.\n\"It is saying 'we're in the club, we're in the know - you're not'. I never use them, or if I do I immediately apologise or flag it up. \n\"For instance, I might say a team is defending really deep, then add 'or as they say in the modern parlance, a low block'.\"\nSutton said: \"It's just the evolution of the game. They're just different words aren't they? I'm not one who gets too stuck in the past - but there might be one I take real umbrage with.\"\nSo what are these modern terms? And what do they really mean?\nThe official description, according to statisticians Opta and data firm Second Spectrum, is when \"a defensive team has recently lost the ball and has not had time to re-organise its defensive shape. [The team] is out of position, and is either pressing or actively moving to get back into a stable defensive position\".\nNevin: \"The gold standard of the new jargon. It says you probably don't know what you're talking about, but you want people to think you are.\n\"I have never used it, other than facetiously. There should be a ban on it. Let's invoke a three-strike-and-out transitions law. \n\"Use it once as a co-commentator and you get a stern look, twice a yellow card, then three times you're on your way.\n\"What does it mean? You've given the ball away again. That's it.\n\"When coaches say they have to work on transitions, they should just not give the ball away and be better.\"\nSutton: \"I've always thought transition is when you win the ball back. It's a change isn't it? It's what the word means. Change from defending to attacking.\"\nA \"low block\", as defined by Opta, is the starting position of your team from your own goal.\nInterestingly, Nottingham Forest - third in the Premier League and heading towards the Champions League - are currently second-lowest with a starting position of 39.6 metres, sandwiched in between Southampton (39.8 metres) and Ipswich Town (39.4 metres) who are both almost certainly heading back to the Championship.\nNevin: \"Nottingham Forest suggests an exception and a successful strategy, but my overall definition is it means you're not good enough as a team, you can't get the ball out, so you defend deep.\n\"There you go - it's defending deep. It's just easier to say 'we're playing in a low block' rather than admit you're not good enough to play out so we have to sit back and play on the break.\n\"It's a fairly modern, generational thing. You can spot it a mile away. You can't wear a big sticker saying 'I've got my coaching badges' but this is almost telling people you've read the manuals and you've got your badges.\"\nSutton: \"It's the new phrase for defending your own box or defending deeply. I don't know where some of these phrases come from.\"\nThis is a defensive tactic where a team places its defenders higher up the pitch. Much focus has been placed on the \"high line\" Ange Postecoglou employs at Tottenham Hotspur, but the current highest line in the top flight is Manchester City at 45.9 metres.\nNevin: \"This is the one I'm absolutely fine with, because it is descriptive and perfectly explains what is happening to someone who may not know football very well. \n\"It's probably much older than the rest of the cliches and I would say it would have been used when I played.\"\nSutton: \"Fine by me. Making sure the distance between defenders and midfield isn't too great, teams can't play through out and you look to catch careless forwards offside. \n\"If you use this phrase, listeners or viewers will understand exactly what you mean.\"\nThis means defending high up the pitch to force the opposition into mistakes.\nNevin: \"New jargon. Been done for years. It's not a new Pep Guardiola thing. 'The Crazy Gang' at Wimbledon used to do it when I played and were brilliant at it.\n\"The old phrase was 'closing down'. You close the opposition down and get right in their faces high up the pitch. It's been rebranded as some new concept but every team used to do it.\n\"The recent great Barcelona sides were the high watermark, but it started in the 1970s when Johan Cruyff used to do it with Ajax. I did it for the first time in under-15s football at Celtic Boys Club.\n\"When I played, we usually did with a sign, which could be anything, but the favourite sign was 'when you see that big useless centre-back get the ball, all go in to try and make him give the ball away'.\"\nSutton: \"If someone talked to me about a 'high press' when I was playing, I would have thought they were telling me to iron my shirt.\n\"It's closing down and I suspect Herbert Chapman's great Arsenal side in the 1930s was doing this.\n\"It's a classic from people who think football didn't exist before 2010 and the '60s, '70s and '80s never happened. Do they think players of that era just stood around in a rigid 4-4-2 and didn't run or close down?\"\nWimbledon - pioneers of the high press?\nThis is when teams try to win the ball back quickly after conceding possession, to avoid being hit on the counter-attack by their opponents and potentially starting an attack of their own.\nNevin: \"It's not one I've come across too much but you press up to try and retrieve the ball immediately. Seems simple enough.\"\nSutton: \"I used this phrase north of the border and got absolutely rinsed by my fellow pundits. \n\"I meant when you won the ball back high up quickly by shutting down the opposition. Just another version of the press, and you're then on the counter-attack.\"\nHigh turnovers, as measured by Opta metrics, are \"the number of possessions that start in open play and begin 40 metres or less from the opponent's goal\".\nNevin: \"Of limited use. Winning the ball back high up the pitch.\"\nSutton: \"When someone mentions 'turnovers' to me I think of the apple things you used to buy in shops. \n\"You hear all this stats-based stuff now and it's basically winning the ball in the opposition half, that's all.\"\nSpurs boss Postecoglou called this \"the most useless statistic in world football. Seriously, it could fall off your backside, fall to somebody on the halfway line who scores and it's an assist. It doesn't impress me\".\nThe Opta definition is simple - the player who passes the ball to the player who scores.\nNevin: \"I like assists because I got far more assists than goals in my playing career, but Ange makes a great point. I used to keep a record of them. I agree with Ange, but as a phrase people do know what it means.\n\"I was always a bit miffed on the other side of that argument when I beat seven men, drew the keeper and passed it to John Aldridge to tap in at Tranmere.\"\nSutton: \"I take Ange's point. There could be a proper assist but what if the ball hits you on the backside? Is that really an assist? \n\"And what about when a player lets the ball run through his legs, or draws a defender out of position. That's one for the nerds and laptop crunchers.\"\nUsually the assist maker, Nevin celebrates a rare goal instead\nThis is measured by simply adding assists and goals.\nNevin: \"I hate the wording but I'm OK with the concept. I think the new purveyors of football parlance need to up their game a bit here. It needs a better phrase. Very simplistic this one, but I'm fine with what it stands for.\"\nSutton: \"It used to just be goals, but now this has been added. Next throw-ins and corners will be in there, all sorts of things. I think people do get what it means, though.\"\nTypically a striker (often wearing number nine) dropping deeper into midfield to link play, disturb the opponents' defence and make space for others, rather than playing in the traditional forward's role.\nNevin: \"I'm absolutely OK with this. The first time it was used to me was in 1982 at the European Under-18s Championship when I was with Scotland. We won it in Finland and I was player of the tournament. We beat Czechoslovakia in the final so I was very happy with it.\n\"The coaches were Andy Roxburgh and Walter Smith. Andy ended up becoming Uefa's first technical director. He used a phrase 'unreal nine' or 'false nine'. It simply means no-one playing as as a traditional centre forward. It is a false striker.\n\"We rotated it with Scotland between myself, Ally Dick of Spurs and Gary Mackay of Hearts. We had two wide attackers and a false nine but all three of us could do all three jobs.\"\nSutton: \"What is the difference between a 'false nine' and 'number 10'? Think of Roberto Firmino at Liverpool. Someone who is essentially a forward who drops deep to show for the ball and link everything.\n\"At Blackburn when we won the title, we played 4-4-2 but a striker would drop deep when the opposition had the ball to attach themselves to a midfielder. Is that the same thing?\"\nThree phrases for the price of one. Effectively a defensive midfielder - or two - used by some teams to act as a shield for defence and link the whole side together. As the word means, \"a central point\".\nNevin: \"It's just a new name for the deep-lying central midfield player. In South America they would call that a 'five'. It is trying to pigeonhole all of them into one simple term.\n\"Chelsea play with two pivots, two 'sixes'. It's 4-3-3 with two deep-lying midfield players. It was used with Scotland when I played. Graeme Souness could do that easily and brilliantly.\n\"Chelsea do it all the time with Moises Caicedo and they have Enzo Fernandez, Romeo Lavia and are asking Reece James to do it as well.\"\nSutton: \"I don't know where this 'pivot' thing came from. It was a defensive midfielder, then a holding midfielder - and now we've got pivot.\n\"The 'pivots' I played with were Neil Lennon at Celtic and David Batty at Blackburn. Strong defensive holding midfield players.\"\nA full-back who moved into a more central possession when their team has the ball. Can be an extra midfielder and helps both attacking and defensive strategies.\nNevin: \"Stevie Clarke and myself did this at Chelsea. It can be described, as it used to be, as an underlapping full-back, someone stepping into midfield. [Inverted full--back] is an upgrade linguistically and one I don't mind.\n\"When I hear hybrid full-back, I can just say I won't be using that one and never will.\"\nSutton: \"I always think about left-footers playing on the right and vice-versa here, enabling them to step inside into midfield. We had Mark Bowen at Norwich City but we used to just call them attacking full-backs.\n\"As for hybrid' - that just makes me think of cars.\"\nThis is taken to mean the spaces between the edge of the penalty box towards the 'D' on either side of the area.\nNevin: \"Instantly droppable. Nonsensical. It only exists when a little gap opens up, basically just looking for a space between the striker and the midfielder. I don't think it's a very helpful phrase and is pretty meaningless.\"\nSutton: \"An absolute no-no. It's simply wrong. What a load of nonsense.\n\"How can you have a half-space? A space is a space is a space. If I dig a hole it's a hole. It is not a half-hole.\nThis phrase is believed to have originated in American football to describe an area of the field that forms around the quarterback on passing plays.\nNevin: \"Pockets of space is telling people to find space, It's just new words for the same thing.\"\nSutton: \"I get this a bit more. I think that's allowed. You can also call it a zone.\n\"I think this is the space in between the opposition defence and midfield, in the wider channels when teams play with three forwards and the highest forward will drop into spaces.\n\"As a description people will understand what you're talking about.\"\nBayern Munich and Germany's Thomas Muller has been bestowed with his own positional term\nThis is used to describe spaces between lines line of forwards and midfield players or midfield players and defenders.\nNevin: \"Teams never stand in straight lines, which is the silliness of all of this. If the formation has what you might call 'lines', you're trying to find the gaps and spaces between those lines.\n\"The last thing you do is go there between the line. You have to arrive when the ball arrives in there. That's the skill Cole Palmer is the best at it in the Premier League. Never stand there - always arrive there.\"\nSutton: \"I don't know who thought of this. Teams don't just line up in straight lines in a 4-3-3 or 4-4-2. \n\"The term itself presumably means you try to play through these so-called 'lines', mainly between the midfield and attack.\"\nAnd one to watch out for...\nThis was coined by, and has been used for, Bayern Munich's Germany attacker Thomas Muller and translates to \"space investigator\".\nMuller described himself as \"an interpreter of space\".\nNevin: \"I'll leave the German to others.\"\nSutton: \"Does what it says on the tin.\"\nThis video can not be played\nTonali's goal - a cross?

In particular, futuristic wheelchair basketball game Drag x Drive, where both \"mice\" are pushed to mimic moving wheels.\nElsewhere, Donkey Kong Bananza will be the first time the ape mascot has had a 3D platforming game of his own in 25 years, so there was some pressure on Nintendo to deliver a game which justified the wait.\nFor lack of a better term it\u2019s a destruct-em-up - you can destroy much of the floor and scenery in each level.\nBut there's that dreaded price news again.

        "article_text": "The Nike Air Jordan 1 is, in some ways, the iconic US trainer. It's a popular line by a large American brand, created four decades ago for homegrown basketball legend Michael Jordan.\nBut although Nike sells most of its products in the US, almost all of its trainers are made in Asia \u2013 a region targeted by President Donald Trump's tariffs salvo against foreign countries he accuses of \"ripping off\" Americans.\nNike's shares fell 14% the day after the tariffs announcement, on fears over the impact they could have on the company's supply chain.\nFollow live updates\nSo what will all this mean for the price of Nike's trainer?\nIt depends on how much of the cost increase Nike decides to pass on to customers, if any, and how long they think the tariffs will actually be in place for.\nGoods from Vietnam, Indonesia and China face some of the heaviest US import taxes - between 32% to 54%.\nHopes remain that Trump might be willing to negotiate those rates lower. On Friday, he said he had had a \"very productive\" call with the leader of Vietnam, helping Nike shares to recover some ground after their steep Thursday falls.\nBut most analysts think the firm's prices will have to go up.\nSwiss bank UBS estimates that there will be a 10% to 12% increase in the prices of goods that come from Vietnam - where Nike produces half of its shoes.\nMeanwhile, Indonesia and China account for almost all of the balance of its trainer production.\n\"Our view is that, given how extensive the list of tariffs is, the industry will realise there are few ways to mitigate the impact in the medium term other than by raising prices,\" UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a note.\nDavid Swartz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, agrees that price rises are likely but says any large price increase would reduce demand. \n\"This is a very competitive industry. My guess is that it would be difficult for Nike to raise prices by much more than 10-15%. I don't think it could offset most of the tariff,\" he says.\nMany other western brands such as H&M, Adidas, Gap and Lululemon will be facing the same predicament.\nNike is already facing a tight bottom line. \nIt had around $51bn (\u00a339.6bn) in sales in its most recent fiscal year. The cost of making products, including shipping, third-party profits and warehouse fees, consumed only about 55% of revenue, giving it a healthy gross profit margin of more than 40%.\nBut that profit gets whittled away once you add in the cost of other business operations. A third of its revenue, for example, is consumed by selling and administrative expense.\nBy the time you factor in interest and taxes, Nike's profit margin has shrunk to about 11%.\nThat is across all its products, as they don't break down costs separately for its different items.\nRahul Cee, who set up the trainer review website Sole Review, says there are other ways Nike could keep retail prices low.\nMr Cee, who trained as a footwear designer and worked for Nike and Vans in India, says one way could be to downgrade the level of tech in the trainer.\n\"So instead of using high-performance midsole foams and construction, stick to injection moulded EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate),\" he says.\nAnother option would be instead of bringing out a new design every one to two years, to refresh the design cycle every three to four years.\nSimeon Siegel, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, says most companies were looking at Wednesday's announcement as \"still far from the final conclusion\".\n\"I don't think that many people believe that those numbers are etched in stone just yet,\" he says.\nTheoretically, Nike is such a big brand that it should be able to put up prices without it hitting their sales, he says, but adds: \"Do they have it right now is the question and do they have it across their product offering is another?\"\nEven before the announcement, Nike was facing a slump in sales that had curbed its ability to command full price for its shoes. \nFinance chief Matthew Friend has also cited tariffs as an example of developments that were affecting consumer confidence.\nAnd Nike relies heavily on US sales, with the market contributing to roughly $21.5bn of its sales - almost everything it sells in its largest market of North America.\nSentiment in the US is a \"significant concern\" for Nike as it directly affects demand for its footwear, says Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.\n\nBut ultimately he says firms may be forced to pass the cost of the levies on to consumers.\n\"Nike is very likely to raise prices if the tariff war persists. There is no way for brands to absorb a 30% to 50% increase in sourcing costs.\"\nHe adds: \"How US trading partners react against the reciprocal tariff policy will also have a major impact.\"\nChina has already hit back with a 34% tariff of its own.\nPart of the rationale behind Trump's tariff policy is because he wants more companies to manufacture their goods in the US.\nHowever, Prof Lu does not see Nike, or other companies, significantly reshaping its supply chain any time soon \"due to the complexity involved in footwear manufacturing\".\nThat includes the time needed to \"consider a long list of factors when deciding where to source their products - quality, costs, speed to market and various social and environmental compliance risks\".\nMatt Powers from the Powers Advisory Group says the lack of American textile mills will make it \"difficult and expensive [for Nike] to pivot production back to the US\".\nMr Powers added: \"This transition, if pursued, would take years and require significant investment.\"\nNike did not respond to BBC requests for comment for this article.\nWe also contacted 30 suppliers in Asia but none responded.\nAdditional reporting by Natalie Sherman in New York",

Not like in the amateurs where you get protected from all the outside noise,\" said Orie, who makes his pro debut in Manchester on Saturday.\n\"You hear a lot of stories about it being a rough transition. You hear about the sharks that are coming for you.\"\nBut Orie - who in 2020 graduated with a first class honours degree in economics and management - would not succumb to the \"dirty\" side of boxing.\nAfter snubbing an offer from WWE, he assembled a trusted backroom team and signed with Frank Warren's Queensberry Promotions.\n\"We're not going to take the mick with the progression,\" Orie added. \"It will be slow enough so I can improve but not too fast that the wheels fall off within two years.\"\nOrie said he \"let Great Britain down\" after he lost by split decision to Davit Chaloyan at the Paris Olympics\nOrie will kick off his pro journey against Bosnian journeyman Milos Veletic. \nHe looked remarkably at ease with the spotlight as he shared his fascinating story on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC One Breakfast.\nHe opened up on the struggles of not being able to speak a word of English when he moved from Russia to England aged seven, and how he was inspired to take up boxing by Anthony Joshua.\n\"I've always felt I'm inferior. That I've got more to prove. That I'm not good enough and always have to push myself to get to the next level,\" he later told BBC Sport.\nOrie was equally engaging during light-hearted filming for social media, where in a play on his unique name he revealed why he thinks pineapple on pizza is not 'delicious'.\nWhen conversation turned to his early exit in Paris, however, it was clear his Olympic disappointment still cuts deep.\n\"I always wanted to get at tattoo of the Olympic rings it but I don't feel worthy of one.

        "article_text": "Jonny Bairstow and James Anderson will not face off this season after Yorkshire were promoted and Lancashire relegated\nThe 2025 County Championship begins on Friday - and, remarkably for early April, the weather is set to be glorious.\nBut which county sides will sparkle this season and whose outlook is gloomy?\nThe BBC's local radio county cricket commentators and online journalists - who will be providing ball-by-ball radio and live text commentary throughout the season on the BBC Sport website and app - take a look at each club's prospects... \nCounty Championship preview: Who can stop Surrey?\nJennings 'job' is to win Lancashire silverware\nBears must spread wickets around - Hannon-Dalby\n2024 season - Eighth in Division Two\nDave Fletcher - BBC Radio Derby\nGiven Derbyshire finished bottom of Division Two in 2024, things can surely only improve. \nThey did at least win a game last year, unlike 2023, but it was another bitterly disappointing watch for the County Ground faithful.\nThey were not helped by an opening round washout against Gloucestershire last season which meant they were playing catch-up from the off.\nThat appears unlikely to be repeated so a quick start \u2013 against the same opposition - is essential.\nThey have added Australian opening batter Caleb Jewell to the squad and he will be joined by returning Kiwi quick bowler Blair Tickner, whose spell last season was all too brief.\nThere's a new captain at the helm, too, although it is a familiar figure. Wayne Madsen, who led the side to promotion in 2012, takes over from David Lloyd after his solitary campaign leading the side.\nTickner's return and the presence of experienced bowlers such as Zak Chappell and Pat Brown can only benefit newcomer Harry Moore.\nAlready in the England system, the much talked-about 17-year-old will be starting his first full season in the senior side having already shown he can more than hold his own at that level.\nWinter signings Jack Morley and Martin Andersson will be better for having been with the group last season.\nThe big challenge remains the ability to take 20 wickets a match, something Mickey Arthur's side have to do if they are to repeat the relative riches of his first season in charge in 2022.\nMatthew Potts' Durham appearances this season may be limited by England call-ups\n2024 season - Fifth in Division One\nMartin Emmerson - BBC Radio Newcastle\nDurham finished fifth on their return to Division One last season and in general more than held their own. They might be able to improve on that this year. We'll see.\nThey weren't helped by the loss of their entire opening game - at home to Hampshire in April \u2013 but there was only really Surrey who turned them over.\nThat was towards the end of the season and the week Surrey retained their title - and they beat a weakened Durham side struggling with injuries.\nFrom a batting point of view they have added Emilio Gay to the ranks. He joined towards the end of last season from Northants, while Will Rhodes chose to leave Warwickshire after seven seasons, despite the offer of a new contract. \nThey will help boost a line-up which includes the leading batter in Division One last season, in South African David Bedingham. He scored 1,331 runs, including a club-record 279 against Lancashire in September. He also became the first Durham batter to score centuries in four consecutive innings.\nOpener Michael Jones has left for Lancashire. His outings last season were limited due to selection choices, so he took the decision to head back home.\nBowling is the key issue. They've had no luck with overseas players in recent seasons. Scott Boland lasted part of one game before returning home to Australia in April. Neil Wagner managed just one game too. Veteran Peter Siddle came in and did well in his four games, while West Indian Chemar Holder didn't particularly pull up any trees in his three matches. Keeping their bowlers fit will be key.\nIt remains to be seen how much of a good signing Sam Conners will be. The bowler has joined from Derbyshire. While he boasted 50 championship wickets in 2022, he took 27 the following year, but only played five Championship matches last season. Australian seamer Brendan Doggett will play County Championship matches in April and May. The 30-year-old seamer plays for South Australia and has 157 first-class wickets to his name.\nThen there's the likes of ever-dependable all-rounder Ben Raine. Matthew Potts is important to the team too, when England allow him to be available. Seventeen-year-old James Minto looks a good prospect and fellow bowler Daniel Hogg will be looking to push on after a career-best 7-66 against Notts in Chester-le-Street.\n2024 season - Fourth in Division One\nVictoria Polley - BBC Radio Essex\nThere's been change at the top for Essex over the winter with Chris Silverwood returning to the club as director of cricket. \nEssex won successive titles (Div 2 & 1) in his previous tenure as head coach, including a first County Championship win in 25 years, before England came calling. \nWith his assistant Anthony McGrath taking over from then up until last season, it will hopefully be a more seamless transition than these changes can sometimes be.\nDean Elgar was vital at the top of the order last season but who will open alongside him is the big question? Do Essex give a chance to teenager Charlie Allison who has impressed in the white-ball formats? They have other options in the likes of Nick Browne or Robin Das, or even bumping Paul Walter or Michael Pepper up higher.\nJordan Cox was also key with the bat last season but has had a torrid winter, denied an England Test debut by a thumb injury. International opportunities could affect his availability.\nAn international call-up still eludes bowler Sam Cook but England's loss is very much Essex's gain - alongside Jamie Porter and Simon Harmer, it's a potent bowling attack.\nIt would've been strengthened with the signing of Shardul Thakur but his late involvement in the IPL has ruled him out of a move to Chelmsford, and Essex continue to hunt for a replacement.\nIt's been six years since Essex last won a County Championship title and they continue to punch above their weight in competing at the top end of the table. \nThey might not have the squad size and budgets of other counties but there's still plenty of talent and experience among the Essex ranks. Can Silverwood add more silverware to his Essex collection on his Chelmsford return?\n2024 season - Sixth in Division Two\nNick Webb - BBC Radio Wales Sport\nThe arrival of Richard Dawson as head coach after the unexpected departure of Grant Bradburn is the main change at Sophia Gardens, with the squad looking remarkably similar to last season. \nThe second One-Day Cup triumph in four years put a gloss on an otherwise disappointing 2024 campaign as Glamorgan showed only marginal improvement in the T20 Blast and fell away in the latter stages of the Championship promotion race.\nKey factors in the Championship will be finding a consistent opening partnership to go with the settled top order of Sam Northeast, Kiran Carlson, Colin Ingram and Chris Cooke, as well as getting the most out of a seam attack lacking raw pace. \nEddie Byrom, unlucky with injury in several seasons, is the most likely starter up top but his partner could be one of four or five candidates. \nSri Lankan Asitha Fernando is likely to partner Timm van der Gugten with the new ball in the opening stages of the season, while it will be interesting to see if on-loan England off-spinner Shoaib Bashir makes an impact as cover for Mason Crane early on when pitches usually don't help the twirlers.\nThere is little doubt that young all-rounder Ben Kellaway will become a regular in all formats sooner or later, but being thrown in as a red-ball opener was maybe a step too far. \nHis ambidextrous spin is a unique selling point added to some hard hitting in the middle order. \nOverall the county needs to manage a fair degree of change in the medium term, with a fair few of their stalwarts well past the 30 mark.\nJames Bracey played two Test matches for England in 2021\n2024 season - Seventh in Division Two\nEd Seabourne - BBC Radio Bristol\nGloucestershire approach the 2025 season with a renewed sense of ambition, keen to ensure this campaign isn't looked back on as the previous September's hangover.\nWhilst 2024 will always be remembered for the remarkable run to the county's first T20 Blast trophy, head coach Mark Alleyne made no bones about the fact he was disappointed to have ended so far behind the promotion spots in the County Championship.\nDespite the final positioning, significant strides forward were made on the batting side. \nWicketkeeper James Bracey is following a stellar year that saw him achieve the rare double of 1,000 runs and 50 dismissals, and there is increasing competition for spots in the top order.\nThe signing of Australian all-rounder Cameron Green for five matches will only add to that, and there is even hope he will be allowed to bowl towards the end of his stay.\nThe club possesses a group of promising young pace bowlers, including recent England Lions call-ups Zaman Akhter and Ajeet Singh Dale, and newly appointed Championship skipper Cameron Bancroft has spoken of his excitement in working with them.\nThe departure of Zafar Gohar, however, means the squad is without a proven red-ball spinner, and, especially with the dry spring, the serious question will be whether there is enough variety in the attack in its current form to force wins on a consistent basis.\n2024 season - Second in Division One\nKevan James - BBC Radio Solent\nTrying to improve on their second-place finish in the Championship last season may depend on a dip in form from Surrey, but also how Hampshire cope without being able to call upon two very influential players.\nJames Vince, the captain and leader of the batting line-up, has decided red-ball cricket is no longer for him. Mo Abbas, taker of 180 wickets over the past four seasons, has been moved on.\nVeteran Mark Stoneman looks a shrewd signing to partially or maybe fully offset the hole left by Vince.\nOn the bowling front, exciting prospects Sonny Baker and John Turner will be given more responsibility. They will certainly add pace.\nA disappointing T20 campaign will hopefully be turned around by the addition of two hard-hitting South Africans in Lhaun-dre Pretorius and Dewald Brevis.\nPretorius, 19, was the top run scorer in the recent SA20 competition, while Brevis finished the tournament with the top strike rate of 180.\nBy all accounts Pretorius has the potential to be world class very quickly.\n2024 season - 10th in Division One (relegated)\nMatt Cole - BBC Radio Kent\nThe summer of 2024 was a pretty dismal affair for both club and supporters. In the Championship they found themselves outgunned, particularly in the bowling department, and never really looked like they were escaping the drop from Division One they'd so narrowly avoided the year before.\nPerhaps more worrying was the T20 Blast campaign. The Spitfires - perennial contenders for the knockout stages - won just four of 14 games and finished bottom of the South Group. The One-Day Cup didn't add much encouragement for supporters desperate for something to hope for.\nKent come into the new season though with Adam Hollioake replacing Matt Walker as head coach. It's the former Surrey and England all-rounder's first time in the role for a county side and players and supporters alike have received the appointment with some excitement.\nThe playing ranks have been bolstered by new signings \u2013 Chris Benjamin moving from Warwickshire hoping to reinvigorate his career as an all-formats batter.\nKent's bowling was the major cause for concern last season, both injuries and lack of form making them look toothless at times. A double signing of seamers just before the start of the campaign is looking to address that \u2013 recent Test debutant for Pakistan, Kashif Ali, and experienced South African pace man Keith Dudgeon are in place for the first part of the campaign.\nThey've also added Corey Flintoff \u2013 son of Andrew, brother of Rocky \u2013 to the squad, the fast-bowling all-rounder joining on a rookie contract.\nWith Aussie bowlers Wes Agar and Tom Rogers returning for the T20 Blast, it appears more of an evolution than a revolution at Canterbury this summer.\nBut if Hollioake can get the best out of the squad they could be among the front-runners for promotion back to the top division of the Championship and a return to upsetting the big budget sides in the Blast.\nRocky Flintoff played four County Championship matches for Lancashire last season\n2024 season - Ninth in Division One (relegated)\nScott Read - BBC Radio Lancashire\nSince winning the County Championship title in 2011, Lancashire have been relegated four times. \nOn the previous three occasions they've won promotion straight back to Division One. \nThey'll be expected to continue that trend this season and will start as firm favourites. \nEven without James Anderson for the first month, the Red Rose have a healthy blend of senior professionals and young players making their way in the game. \nThe overseas signings of Marcus Harris and Anderson Phillip look like excellent business. \nPhillip, for the first 11 games, will provide some extra pace, Harris for the entire season to open the batting. \nThe arrival of the Australian opener will also allow Luke Wells to bat at six giving Lancashire some much-needed experience in the middle order. \nLancashire have some fine young players who endured a tough season for the club last year. A year on from that, the likes of Matty Hurst, George Balderson and George Bell should prosper. \nFor Hurst, almost 700 runs at an average of 32 in his debut season for a relegated team was an impressive return. \nThere will also be plenty of opportunities for Tom Aspinwall and Rocky Flintoff, who does not turn 17 until next week.\nAnderson not ruling out playing for three more years\nBancroft's winning experience 'boosts' Gloucestershire\nBairstow named new Yorkshire red-ball captain  \n2024 season - Fifth in Division Two\nRichard Rae - BBC Radio Leicester\nThe return of Peter Handscomb, who made 894 runs in 14 Championship innings at an average of 74.5 last season, the signing of Shan Masood from June onwards, the presence at the top of the order of the talented Rishi Patel and the fact most of the bowlers have legitimate claims to be described as all-rounders, should mean Leicestershire are not short of runs this season. \nNor, if the likes of Patel, Sol Budinger, Rehan Ahmed and Louis Kimber find form, will they score those runs slowly.\nThe big question is whether they have the firepower to bowl teams out twice. \nLast season, Leicestershire took the lowest number of wickets (139) in Division Two by some distance, and some supporters have argued the signing of New Zealand-born Netherlands international Logan van Beek adds to their ranks of bowling all-rounders rather than gives the Foxes the cutting edge they need to break games open.\nTall young left-arm prospect Josh Hull has that potential, but has spent the close season struggling with injury.\nThere is hope in the pre-season performances of the likes of veteran Chris Wright and the promising Tom Scriven, while Ben Green's return from Somerset for the first seven Championship matches adds depth.\n2024 season - Third in Division Two\nKevin Hand - BBC Radio London\nThe signing of New Zealand batter Kane Williamson is something of a coup for a county that are operating under strict financial restrictions imposed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).\nThe rearrangement of the budget for wage allocation within the squad meant a number of players were released last season, including the tough decision to let the popular former England opener Mark Stoneman go.\nWith the evergreen opener Sam Robson aging well and Leus de Plooy a gun player in all formats, Middlesex have a top order to be feared -  probably for the first time since Robson, Nick Gubbins and Nick Compton formed a top three that played a huge part in the 2016 Championship winning side.\nThe mark of the Middlesex team under former director of cricket Angus Fraser, who took charge in 2009, was the regular ability to blast through teams with the ball.\nIn the absence of the retired Tim Murtagh, Middlesex struggled to rattle through the wickets last year and captain Toby Roland-Jones bore a heavy burden on that front. \nIt was refreshing to see the right-armer clear of injury for the season and his team will desperately need that once more if they are to be promoted.\nThe former England international will have his workload eased this year by the arrival of South African seamer Dane Paterson, another crucial addition to the squad that could make a significant difference to a side that looked on course for promotion for most of last season.\nThe signings of Williamson and Paterson to bolster the Championship side are a clear indication that Middlesex want success to return in the shape of promotion this year.\nDarren Lehmann was Australia head coach between 2013 and 2018\n2024 season - Fourth in Division Two\nAndrew Radd - BBC Radio Northamptonshire\nThe arrival of Australian Darren Lehmann as head coach at Wantage Road has triggered a wave of pre-season positivity in a squad left feeling somewhat bruised by the events of the past couple of years.\nAfter being relegated from Division One in 2023 they failed to register a Division Two win in 2024 until September, by which time Lehmann's predecessor John Sadler had lost his job following defeat in the T20 Blast quarter-finals.\nWith opener Emilio Gay and fast bowler Jack White both heading north, to Durham and Yorkshire respectively, there will be opportunities for others to shine. \nYoung batters Krish Patel (who opened his account with five boundaries on first-class debut at Headingley last September) and Aadi Sharma have much to offer, while the seam attack has been bolstered by the signings of Dom Leech, left-armer Liam Guthrie and \u2013 for the four Championship fixtures in May \u2013 Harry Conway from South Australia. \nGeorge Scrimshaw and the hugely promising Raphy Weatherall suffered injuries last season and will be eager to re-establish themselves.\nMuch will depend \u2013 certainly in four-day cricket - on the tried-and-trusted trio of Luke Procter, Ben Sanderson and Rob Keogh. \nIndian leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal had a major impact towards the end of 2024 and returns this year for a longer second-half stint.\nOther key figures across all formats will be Saif Zaib, who \u2013 to the relief of supporters \u2013 agreed a contract extension until at least the end of 2027, plus a couple of upwardly-trending all-rounders in Justin Broad, son of former tennis star Neil and named the county's Media Player of the Year last season, and Gus Miller.\n2024 season - Eighth in Division One\nDave Bracegirdle - BBC Radio Nottinghamshire\nYazz knew what she was on about, didn't she? 'The Only Way Is Up' was not only a catchy hit single but is also a good place to approach Nottinghamshire's hopes for 2025.\nHead coach Peter Moores has emphasised that it's important to learn from what went wrong last year, as well as draw a line underneath it. \nAs a brief reminder, Notts narrowly avoided relegation from Division One of the County Championship, finished bottom of their group in the T20 Blast and barely raised a pulse in the One-Day Cup.\nSo what might be different this time around?\nThe only domestic signing sees Conor McKerr join from Surrey but with Josh Tongue now fully fit, those two bolster a fast-bowling unit that promises untold riches. \nIf Notts can keep Olly Stone healthy, alongside overseas recruits in Australia's Fergus O'Neill and Pakistan's Mohammad Abbas, throw in the evergreen Brett Hutton and the raw pace of Rob Lord, then their resources seem well stocked.\nTeenagers Farhan Ahmed and Freddie McCann both made their county debuts towards the back end of last season and already carry the weight of expectation.\nThe prodigious spinning fingers of 17-year old Ahmed have already marked him out as a generational talent, while 19-year-old team-mate McCann hit two centuries in just seven innings.\nSome astute observers are already wondering if Kyle Verreynne is the best wicketkeeper-batter in the world right now. The county fought off a lot of competition to secure the services of the South African for the whole campaign.\nThat just leaves the top order. While Trent Bridge members may not see too much of England's Ben Duckett once again, there are guaranteed runs from skipper Haseeb Hameed and the gifted Joe Clarke, both as good as any in the county game.\nShoaib Bashir will join Glamorgan on loan for the first three County Championship games of the season\n2024 season - Third in Division One\nAnthony Gibson - BBC Radio Somerset\nWith a strong and settled squad of players shrewdly captained by Lewis Gregory, and terrific team spirit, Somerset go into the new season with every hope of marking the club's 150th anniversary with a first County Championship.\nInjuries permitting, Matt Henry will be back to lead a powerful seam attack, balanced by the spin of Jack Leach, rising star Archie Vaughan and, once he returns from a loan spell at Glamorgan or his England duties are over, Shoaib Bashir. \nAmong the batters, the only real question is who will partner Vaughan at the top of the order, Sean Dickson being the most likely answer. \nThe three Toms - Lammonby, Abell and Banton - will once again make up the engine room of the batting, with James Rew ready to reinforce his reputation as one of the most promising wicketkeeper-batters in the country.\nUnlike the infinitely talented Will Smeed, who is happily returning to the red-ball fold, Tom Kohler-Cadmore will focus on the white ball and the Blast, so that the firepower which has seen Somerset reach Finals Day in each of the past three seasons remains very much intact.\nFor Somerset's team of youngsters to have reached the One-Day Cup Final last year was a surprise, but they can by no means be discounted. James Rew's younger brother, Thomas, will surely come into that side, and what a prospect he is.\nLast year was a case of so near and yet so far - in contention for all three trophies, ending up with none. \nThe team will have learned from that, and if they can graft staying power onto all their other strengths, this could, at last, be Somerset's season.\nTom Lawes is one of a number of exciting all-rounders at Surrey\n2024 season - First in Division One (champions)\nMark Church - BBC Radio London\nThere is no reason Surrey cannot win a fourth Championship title on the spin this summer. \nThey obviously know how to put all the parts together over the course of a season and the squad is much the same. \nThe addition of Matt Fisher is exciting and there will be international call-ups. But the spine of the side is solid and experienced and if someone is missing, the gap gets filled without anybody noticing.\nOne to keep an eye on is Tom Lawes. He has all the talent in the world with both bat and ball, and if he produces consistently, it would not be a surprise if he were representing England soon. He will be aiming for a permanent spot in the Championship XI but as always there is healthy competition for places.\nThere is one certainty. In terms of the Championship, Surrey will want to be better than last season. \nThey are always looking to improve, and they know everybody else is trying to catch them. \nThey will be tested, especially by the likes of Essex and Hampshire but they know how to win the Championship, and they still have all the players that have managed that in the past three years. It is a good recipe to have.\n2024 season - First in Division Two (promoted)\nAdrian Harms - BBC Radio Sussex\nThere's much excitement and anticipation on the south coast, as Sussex return to Division One after almost a decade in Division Two.\nDuring that period they have never mounted a serious promotion bid, and it's taken change at the top, and the subsequent appointment of Paul Farbrace to galvanise the club.\nFarbrace has introduced a winning mentality that had been sadly lacking, and  crucially supplemented a talented group of younger players with, in his words, \"knarled old pros\" who know how to win, and battle when the going gets tough.\nHowever, this is essentially a young Sussex side most with no experience of first division cricket, and therefore the experience of Australian Daniel Hughes, skipper John Simpson and Ollie Robinson will be crucial particularly during the opening weeks of the season.\nBut don't think Sussex will be a soft touch and are back in Division One for the ride.\nProvided the top order can score enough runs, they have a match-winning spinner in Jack Carson and are especially difficult to beat at Hove, where they haven't lost since Farbrace took the helm.\nSussex have taken nine long years to return to Division One, and the feeling around the club is that's where they want to stay.\nJacob Bethell's game time at Edgbaston is likely to be limited this season\n2024 season - Seventh in Division One\nMike Taylor - BBC Radio WM\nA confusing winter followed a confusing summer. \nOften in 2024 it seemed something was going to happen for Warwickshire - they were front-runners in both white-ball tournaments, and frequently built strong early positions in Championship games. \nAnd then nothing happened. No white-ball final, only one four-day win. \nSeveral leading players had outstanding individual seasons - runs for the captain Alex Davies, wickets for Olly Hannon-Dalby, both for Ed Barnard, England calls for Jacob Bethell and Dan Mousley - but the total, somehow, came to less than the sum of the parts. \nA detailed high-performance review had seemed, from the outside, to have also come to no significant conclusion, the exit of performance director Gavin Larsen being unrelated, until head coach Mark Robinson suddenly left seven weeks ago.\nNow, there is both change and continuity. Ian Westwood, a known and trusted leader, is promoted to replace Robinson. \nThe patient, determined approach he showed as an opening bat and captain in testing circumstances should serve him well. \nA collection of overseas players also mixes the familiar and the new. Hasan Ali is already popular at Edgbaston, while Beau Webster has the qualities that should see him thrive mid-summer. \nHopefully all will avoid the bad luck with injuries that has so weighed Warwickshire down in recent years, and has hit Tom Latham before he even arrives.\nEdgbaston is always a busy place, but had become grumpy in the stands by last September, with so much promise unfulfilled. \nHaving seemed at times to be pushing on all fronts at once, they had gone nowhere. The club has a lot of moving parts but no shortage of talent. \nIf Davies and Westwood can steer the team in a clear direction, and maintain a strong challenge at least in one competition, it will be a year of progress.\n2024 season - Sixth in Division One\nGed Scott - BBC Sport online's Pears reporter\nA long, hard, emotional season eventually blossomed into some happiness for Worcestershire in 2024.\nIn between all the trauma of not being able to play their first home game at flood-hit Worcester until 25 May then came the devastating loss of one of their players, Josh Baker, at the tragically early age of just 20.\nBut the spirit the Pears showed in adversity could only be admired.\nThey gave a string of youngsters their chance in an unexpectedly progressive One-Day Cup campaign \u2013 and, either side of the mid-summer County Championship break, they produced three huge red-ball victories on the trot.\nThat not only helped them stay in the top flight, it was enough to catapult them up to sixth - their highest finish since two-division cricket began in 2000. Finishing above both neighbours Warwickshire and also Nottinghamshire, where four of their former players are now based, was a source of particular pride and pleasure.\nBuilding on that and again keeping their place in an always competitive division is now the challenge - although they will have to do so without the retired Joe Leach, as well as Kiwi Nathan Smith, who did well over the first half of last summer but then opted to join champions Surrey.\nBut they have another New Zealand fast bowler Jacob Duffy arriving from the second game onwards. They have three more incomers in Ben Allison from Essex, Nottinghamshire spinner Fateh Singh and Australian seamer Ben Dwarshuis for the T20 Blast.\nThey also still have that same marvellous team spirit to fall back on \u2013 and a real, genuine hunger.\nLong-term doubts remain over their future at New Road - but, in the short term, prospects at Worcester are brighter than people might think.\nJonny Bairstow will captain Yorkshire in the County Championship this season\n2024 season - Second in Division Two (promoted)\nJonathan Doidge - BBC Radio Leeds\nIt is likely to be a very interesting 2025 for Yorkshire.\nWith financial concerns now, apparently, assuaged at the very moment the team has returned to the top flight of the Championship, plus a new coaching staff and new red ball and T20 captains, there should rightly be an air of optimism.\nJonny Bairstow follows in his late father David's footsteps to steer the Championship challenge. He'd love to have a title as captain on his CV but aside from captaincy, his presence alone with the bat will be huge.\nSimilarly, Dawid Malan is going to be back playing more red-ball cricket, a major plus. Add to that potent opening pair of Adam Lyth and Finlay Bean, plus James Wharton, whose career began to blossom last year in particular, and more established batters like George Hill and that end of the team should be capable of setting up games.\nAs we know, that's no good without the ability to take 20 wickets and in that department there's plenty of encouragement. \nThe outstanding Ben Coad will again lead the line. Overseas input comes from, in particular, New Zealand's Ben Sears plus Will Sutherland (two matches) and Jordan Buckingham (four) also chipping in, while there's also George Hill, Jordan Thompson, off-season recruit Jack White, plus Matt Revis and Matt Milnes, who are on the road back from injury.\nDom Bess looks likely to be this coach's first pick among the spinners, though Dan Moriarty and Jafer Chohan will want a say in that.\nWith Bairstow donning the wicketkeeping gloves, Jonathan Tattersall and Harry Duke are going to have to wait for further opportunities, unless required as batters. You'd certainly have to feel for Tattersall after he led the team back up last season - but this is professional sport.\nWith One-Day Cup centurion Will Luxton awaiting another opportunity, there'll be upward pressure with the bat and I'd be backing Ben Cliff to put some serious pressure on the more senior bowlers in the squad. He could really take his own game to the next level as the season unfolds.\nIn summary, there's optimism that head coach Anthony McGrath can take the team to places it hasn't been for quite some time.",

        "summary": "A double signing of seamers just before the start of the campaign is looking to address that \u2013 recent Test debutant for Pakistan, Kashif Ali, and experienced South African pace man Keith Dudgeon are in place for the first part of the campaign.They've also added Corey Flintoff \u2013 son of Andrew, brother of Rocky \u2013 to the squad, the fast-bowling all-rounder joining on a rookie contract.With Aussie bowlers Wes Agar and Tom Rogers returning for the T20 Blast, it appears more of an evolution than a revolution at Canterbury this summer.But if Hollioake can get the best out of the squad they could be among the front-runners for promotion back to the top division of the Championship and a return to upsetting the big budget sides in the Blast.Lancashire - 'Red Rose favourites for promotion'Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Rocky Flintoff played four County Championship matches for Lancashire last season2024 season - Ninth in Division One (relegated)Scott Read - BBC Radio LancashireSince winning the County Championship title in 2011, Lancashire have been relegated four times. Last season, Leicestershire took the lowest number of wickets (139) in Division Two by some distance, and some supporters have argued the signing of New Zealand-born Netherlands international Logan van Beek adds to their ranks of bowling all-rounders rather than gives the Foxes the cutting edge they need to break games open.Tall young left-arm prospect Josh Hull has that potential, but has spent the close season struggling with injury.There is hope in the pre-season performances of the likes of veteran Chris Wright and the promising Tom Scriven, while Ben Green's return from Somerset for the first seven Championship matches adds depth.Middlesex - 'Williamson signing a coup'2024 season - Third in Division TwoKevin Hand - BBC Radio LondonThe signing of New Zealand batter Kane Williamson is something of a coup for a county that are operating under strict financial restrictions imposed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).The rearrangement of the budget for wage allocation within the squad meant a number of players were released last season, including the tough decision to let the popular former England opener Mark Stoneman go.With the evergreen opener Sam Robson aging well and Leus de Plooy a gun player in all formats, Middlesex have a top order to be feared -  probably for the first time since Robson, Nick Gubbins and Nick Compton formed a top three that played a huge part in the 2016 Championship winning side.The mark of the Middlesex team under former director of cricket Angus Fraser, who took charge in 2009, was the regular ability to blast through teams with the ball.In the absence of the retired Tim Murtagh, Middlesex struggled to rattle through the wickets last year and captain Toby Roland-Jones bore a heavy burden on that front. It is a good recipe to have.Sussex - 'Experienced players will be crucial'2024 season - First in Division Two (promoted)Adrian Harms - BBC Radio SussexThere's much excitement and anticipation on the south coast, as Sussex return to Division One after almost a decade in Division Two.During that period they have never mounted a serious promotion bid, and it's taken change at the top, and the subsequent appointment of Paul Farbrace to galvanise the club.Farbrace has introduced a winning mentality that had been sadly lacking, and  crucially supplemented a talented group of younger players with, in his words, \"knarled old pros\" who know how to win, and battle when the going gets tough.However, this is essentially a young Sussex side most with no experience of first division cricket, and therefore the experience of Australian Daniel Hughes, skipper John Simpson and Ollie Robinson will be crucial particularly during the opening weeks of the season.But don't think Sussex will be a soft touch and are back in Division One for the ride.Provided the top order can score enough runs, they have a match-winning spinner in Jack Carson and are especially difficult to beat at Hove, where they haven't lost since Farbrace took the helm.Sussex have taken nine long years to return to Division One, and the feeling around the club is that's where they want to stay.Warwickshire - 'Bears have no shortage of talent'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jacob Bethell's game time at Edgbaston is likely to be limited this season2024 season - Seventh in Division OneMike Taylor - BBC Radio WMA confusing winter followed a confusing summer. Wayne Madsen, who led the side to promotion in 2012, takes over from David Lloyd after his solitary campaign leading the side.Tickner's return and the presence of experienced bowlers such as Zak Chappell and Pat Brown can only benefit newcomer Harry Moore.Already in the England system, the much talked-about 17-year-old will be starting his first full season in the senior side having already shown he can more than hold his own at that level.Winter signings Jack Morley and Martin Andersson will be better for having been with the group last season.The big challenge remains the ability to take 20 wickets a match, something Mickey Arthur's side have to do if they are to repeat the relative riches of his first season in charge in 2022.Durham - 'Bowling the key issue'Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Matthew Potts' Durham appearances this season may be limited by England call-ups2024 season - Fifth in Division OneMartin Emmerson - BBC Radio NewcastleDurham finished fifth on their return to Division One last season and in general more than held their own. It was refreshing to see the right-armer clear of injury for the season and his team will desperately need that once more if they are to be promoted.The former England international will have his workload eased this year by the arrival of South African seamer Dane Paterson, another crucial addition to the squad that could make a significant difference to a side that looked on course for promotion for most of last season.The signings of Williamson and Paterson to bolster the Championship side are a clear indication that Middlesex want success to return in the shape of promotion this year.Northamptonshire - 'Lehmann arrival brings positivity'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Darren Lehmann was Australia head coach between 2013 and 20182024 season - Fourth in Division TwoAndrew Radd - BBC Radio NorthamptonshireThe arrival of Australian Darren Lehmann as head coach at Wantage Road has triggered a wave of pre-season positivity in a squad left feeling somewhat bruised by the events of the past couple of years.After being relegated from Division One in 2023 they failed to register a Division Two win in 2024 until September, by which time Lehmann's predecessor John Sadler had lost his job following defeat in the T20 Blast quarter-finals.With opener Emilio Gay and fast bowler Jack White both heading north, to Durham and Yorkshire respectively, there will be opportunities for others to shine.",

The European Union has vowed a united response, and China has threatened countermeasures.\nRatings agencies like Fitch have warned that the mass tariff hikes could result in lower growth, higher inflation and potentially a recession in some parts of the world.\nHow will India - Asia's third largest economy - navigate these global tremors?\nTrump has dealt the most brutal blow to Asian countries, slapping 34% tariffs on China in addition to the 20% previously levied. Vietnam and Cambodia will have to pay 46% and 49% respectively.\nIn relative terms, at 27% India has fared better.\nBut the rate is still steep and will severely affect major \"labour intensive exports\", says Priyanka Kishore of the consultancy Asia Decoded. \"That will likely have a knock-on impact on domestic demand and headline gross domestic product at a time when growth is already stuttering,\" said Ms Kishore.\nBut the new trade realities also throw up opportunities for India.\nIts new tariff differential with Asian peers may potentially lead to some export re-routing. \"We can bring the footwear and garments business from Asian peers if we get our act together,\" says Nilesh Shah, a veteran fund manager.\nThis will take time though.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government will thus have to be strategic in how it navigates the situation.\nForemost, the announcement should \"give the government a greater sense of urgency in wrapping up a trade deal with the US\", says Rahul Ahluwalia, a public policy expert who previously worked for a government department. \"The US is our largest export market, so this is serious stuff.\" \nIndia exports some $91bn (\u00a369bn) in goods to the US, which account for 18% of its overall exports. Hectic trade negotiations have been under way with a fall deadline for conclusion. Ahluwalia says that deadline could now be compressed and brought forward.\nWhile doing that, India must also expand export markets beyond the US and focus on regions where tariffs remain low, such as Europe, Southeast Asia, and Africa,  recommends Indian trade research agency GTRI.\nIn the last couple of years, India has shown a renewed appetite for trade deals, launching free trade agreement (FTA) talks with a range of countries and blocs, including the European Union and the United Kingdom.\nLast year, Delhi signed a $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union.\nExperts say talks with other partners could now be expedited as cracks deepen between the US and many other global economies over Trump's actions.\nBut even as trade negotiations carry on with global partners, the government will need a plan on how it deals with the domestic fallout of Trump's decision.\nImpact on sectors that employ millions of people - like gems and jewellery and textiles - is likely to be significant. The government will need to extend support through means like expanding production-linked subsidies to ensure that India's domestic industry stays globally competitive and can leverage the new opportunities this has thrown up, according to the consultancy, Ernst & Young\nThe tariffs are \"fundamentally reshaping the global trading system\", says Agneshwar Sen, a trade policy expert at Ernst & Young India. This will require a \"fundamental revaluation of trading strategies\" as new supply chains emerge, he adds.\nIndia will also have to be mindful of other risk factors that emerge from this  - such as \"Chinese dumping\", says Mr Shah.\nAs it becomes more difficult for Chinese goods to enter the US, these will have to find other markets. And there are few others that are as large as India.\n\"The global South accounts for more than 20% of global consumption and is where the new middle class is being created. This is where China will attempt to sell,\" according to Akash Prakash of Amansa Capital, an investment management company in Singapore.\nFor the moment there's little clarity and no official word from the government on what its plans are.\nIndia has already reduced tariffs on some goods including high-end motorbikes and bourbon whiskey. Unlike Canada, Mexico or the European Union, Modi's government has adopted a conciliatory approach to Trump and these announcements are unlikely to trigger a retaliation, say experts.\nIndian businesses will now most likely face a period of uncertainty which is unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\"Clearly, the (Trump) administration wants even broader and deeper tariff cuts. The question is what, if anything, will satisfy the Trump administration?\", Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow at Carnegie Endowment told the BBC.\nIt is a million dollar question, for which there are no immediate answers.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Hungary's government has announced it is withdrawing from the International Criminal Court (ICC).\nThe move was announced by a senior official in Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government hours after Israel's leader Benjamin Netanyahu, who is sought under an ICC arrest warrant, arrived in Hungary for a state visit. \nOrban had invited Netanyahu as soon as the warrant was issued last November, saying the ruling would have \"no effect\" in his country.\nIn November, ICC judges said there were \"reasonable grounds\" that Netanyahu bore \"criminal responsibility\" for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war between Israel and Hamas. Netanyahu has condemned the ICC's decision as \"antisemitic\".\nThe ICC, a global court, has the authority to prosecute those accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\nHungary is a founding member of the ICC, which counts 125 member states, and will be the first European Union nation to pull out of it. A withdrawal has no impact on on-going proceedings. \nThe ICC was a \"respectable initiative\", Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas told Hungarian state-owned news agency MTI, but added it had deviated from its original purpose and become a political body.\nHe said the warrant issued against Netanyahu was unacceptable and that the government did not want to participate in the court's work anymore. Hungary's parliament has never proclaimed the ICC's statute, so it is not part of the country's law, Gulyas added.\nIsrael meanwhile has thanked Orban for its \"clear and strong moral stance alongside Israel,\" Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar wrote on X.\n\"The so-called 'International Criminal Court' lost its moral authority after trampling the fundamental principles of international law in its zest for harming Israel's right to self-defence,\" Sa'ar added.\nHungary's decision aligns with its broader foreign policy stance under Orban, who has cultivated close ties with Israel and adopted a critical view of international institutions perceived as infringing on national sovereignty.\nWhile Hungary's withdrawal may carry symbolic weight and political implications, it does not significantly alter the ICC's operational capacity or legal framework. \nThe court has faced similar challenges in the past and continues to function with broad international support.\nBut Hungary's criticism of the ICC as \"politically biased\" and its decision to withdraw as Netanyahu visits may set a precedent for other nations to question or abandon their commitments to international justice based on political alliances or disagreements with specific rulings.\nThe US, Russia, China and North Korea are among the nations that are not part of the ICC, and therefore do not recognise its jurisdiction.\nIsrael is also not part of the treaty, but the ICC ruled in 2021 that it did have jurisdiction over the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, because the UN's Secretary General had accepted that Palestinians were a member.\nHungary now needs to send written notification to the UN Secretary General to leave the treaty, with the withdrawal taking effect one year later, according to article 127 of the Rome Statute.\nICC spokesman Fad El-Abdullah told the BBC: \"On the visit of Mr Netanyahu, the Court has followed its standard procedures, after the issuance of an arrest warrant. The Court recalls that Hungary remains under a duty to cooperate with the ICC.\"\nSince the warrant was issued, Hungarian authorities should technically arrest Netanyahu and hand him over to the court in the Hague, although member states do not always choose to enforce ICC warrants.\nIn Europe, some ICC member states said they would arrest the Israeli leader if he set foot in their country, while others, such as Germany, announced that he would not be detained if he visited.\nThe White House had said the US rejected the ICC decision and Netanyahu has visited the country since the warrant was issued in November. His visit to Hungary marks Netanyahu's first trip to Europe since then.\nHungarian Defence Minister Kristof Szalay-Bobrovniczky, greeted Netanyahu on the tarmac of Budapest airport on Wednesday night, welcoming him to the country.\nIsrael is appealing against the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant, and strongly rejects the accusations. It both denies the authority of the ICC and the legitimacy of the warrants.\nNetanyahu said at the time that it was a \"dark day in the history of humanity\", and that the ICC had become \"the enemy of humanity\".\n\"It's an antisemitic step that has one goal - to deter me, to deter us from having our natural right to defend ourselves against enemies who try to destroy us,\" he said.\nIn the same ruling, ICC judges also issued a warrant against Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, whom Israel says is dead.\nThe visit comes as Israel announced it was expanding its Gaza offensive and establishing a new military corridor to put pressure on Hamas, as deadly Israeli strikes were reported across the Palestinian territory.\nThe war in Gaza was triggered by the deadly Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed some 1,200 people and led to 251 hostages being taken to Gaza. Since then, more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed, Palestinian health authorities say.",

        "article_text": "Fundamentally wrong, was how Germany's outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, described the new Trump tariffs.\nA unilateral attack - that was the view of Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called them brutal, unfounded and certain to have a \"massive impact\" on the European economy.\nHe convened an emergency meeting with representatives of French businesses most affected by the newly announced 20% tariffs on EU goods sold to the US and issued a call to arms to European business \"not to invest in America for some time until we have clarified things\".\n\"What message would we send by having major European players investing billions of euros in the American economy at a time when [the US] is hitting us?\" he said.\nFor France it's wine, champagne and the aeronautical industry, for Germany it's cars, and for Italy it's luxury goods. It's well known these sectors sell well abroad and now risk being clobbered by US import taxes. \nOverall, the chemicals, machinery and equipment industries in the EU are seen as the most vulnerable to the tariffs.\nBut dig a little deeper and there are other EU sectors, reliant on the US market, that could come as a bit of a surprise. \nFrench cognac, generally dismissed as an old person's tipple in Europe, is the booze of choice for many American rappers, playing a prominent role in the music and lifestyle of stars like Jay-Z, 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg. More than 40% of French brandy is exported to the US.\nSpain exports a lot of gas turbines to the US, alongside tonnes of olive oil.\nWhen we look at which EU countries are most exposed to the US in terms of GDP, the picture is also not quite what you might imagine.\nIreland is highly dependent on the US in terms of goods and services. Those exports - a lot linked to the pharmaceutical industry (which is currently exempt from the 20% tariffs, until the US boosts its own production) and also tech - make up a fifth of Ireland's GDP.\nCyprus, Luxembourg and Malta are more exposed than the EU average in terms of services exports. \nBelgium, the Netherlands and Slovakia are in a similar position when it comes to goods. \nGermany has a greater exposure to the US than the other major EU economies, at over 5% of GDP, followed by Italy (about 4%), France (3%) and Spain (just over 2%). These figures were collated in 2024 by CaixaBank research based on Eurostat figures for the previous year.\nThe response to the new US tariffs is being coordinated at EU HQ in Brussels. The European Commission deals with all overarching trade matters for the bloc's members. \nCommission President Ursula von der Leyen claims they hold \"a lot of cards\", including the strength to negotiate and the power to push back.\nThe US economy is mighty. It makes up 25% of global GDP. \nBut the EU single market of 450 million people (the biggest single market in the world) stands very close in size at 22% of global GDP. \nSo, yes, the EU can bite - hard - as well as bark when it comes to retaliating against Donald Trump's tariffs. Especially if, as EU figures have suggested, the bloc targets US services like Big Tech, possibly including Apple, Meta, Amazon and even Elon Musk's platform X.\nBut that risks a new backlash by the Trump administration. And the EU wants to avoid upping the ante.\nIf you take politics into account, not just economics, the EU has less room for manoeuvre than you might think. \nTake energy supplies, the EU has been buying US liquified natural gas (LNG) after it weaned itself off Russian gas following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \nTricky to reduce or heavily tax those imports. That would badly impact EU consumers, not only US industry, and it would worsen already dismal relations with the US. \nThink of all the recent rows over defence spending and Ukraine. Aside from the economic hell the EU sees and hopes to avoid in the new Trump tariffs, the bloc also really wants to sidestep a trade war with the country that used to be Europe's best friend.\nSo, the Brussels plan is: threaten heavy retaliation, hope Donald Trump is persuaded to negotiate, then pray he'll stage a U-turn on tariffs. \nThe EU's trade commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, says he's speaking to his US counterparts on Friday. It's an opening gambit. The EU is in no rush to retaliate.\nThe Trump administration has ruled out any country negotiating its way out of the new tariffs before they become live this weekend. But after that, what could the EU offer the US president to persuade him to back down?\nTrump is incandescent about the EU's massive trade surplus. It sells far more goods than it buys from the US. The surplus for 2024 was around $200bn (\u20ac180bn; $153bn).\nIt's the other way round when it comes to services - the US sells far more to the EU than the other way round. That is why the EU thinks its main retaliatory leverage against the US would lie in services, like banks and big tech.\nTo redress the goods imbalance, the EU could offer to buy more LNG from the US, or more military equipment, following its pledge to Washington to do more for its own security.\nBut that would break a different EU promise - to boost withering European arms industries by trying to buy EU when re-arming EU countries. It is something the US has already objected to, so that's tricky.\nBrussels could also cut direct and indirect tariffs on US goods. It could lose quotas on US agricultural produce.\nIt would be hugely reluctant to comply with another US ask: to water down its much-trumpeted digital regulations, aimed at limiting monopolies and placing restrictions on speech and content in the EU.\nHow do you price in the possible collapse of the international trading system, EU officials ask.\nEuropean firms fret about their markets being flooded by cheap goods from non-EU countries that are also hit by Trump tariffs and seeking to sell elsewhere. \nThe risk is very real when it comes to China. Trump is slapping more that 50% tariffs on Beijing when you add it all up.\nWould the EU have to ratchet up its import duties on Chinese goods to protect itself and could that lead to an unintended trade war with China?\nThese are anxious and hugely uncertain economic times.\nWhich is why the European Commission says it also wants to focus on matters it can control - if EU capitals agree - and that is reducing internal barriers within the EU single market. \nThose barriers, such as tax regimes, vary from country to country and impact the EU's overall economic growth and competitiveness. \nThe IMF calculates they're equivalent to a 45% tariff on EU manufacturing; 110% when it comes to services.\nThat is far higher than the tariffs now imposed on the EU by Donald Trump. \nEU countries say they're united in combating those. So far they've been divided over completing their own internal market.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on Wednesday including a 10% tariff on most countries. \nSome of America's biggest trading partners will see even higher tariffs beginning 9 April. \nThe aggressive shift in trade policy makes clear where Trump stands on tariffs, but has left much of the world wondering what Americans - who are expected to see the side effects - think of the move. \nWe asked five people what they think. \nShe thinks the pain Americans will feel will be temporary and worth it. \nI know we're all going to get pinched in the pocket for a while. I think in the long run, it's going to get us out of the massive deficit that we're in. \nI am concerned about the price of goods going up. I am going to end up being more particular about what I buy, basically I'll tighten the belt for a while. \nBut then I think it's going to go full circle and it's going to be a good thing for the economy and for people in general. \nWe've been the world's financial doormat for a while and we've gotta stop it. \nThe soon-to-be-retiree worries about economic instability prompted by Trump's actions. \nI'm very unhappy. I'm probably a couple of years away from retiring and I don't know if I'm going to be able to retire. \nMy 401k's not doing great, Social Security is on the line and I don't think the tariffs are going to help America's standing on the world platform. \nTrump is not a king and I feel like our Congress and Senate is letting us down, both parties, by not pushing back [on tariffs].\nThey know better, and they're not doing anything. Why? \nThe trucker welcomes the incoming tariffs and hopes they can help restore smaller US towns.\nI feel like the way to kick-start investment back into US manufacturing is exactly this. \nIt's a necessary evil. \nUp until the 70s, there were two steel mills [in my area] and then they closed. And up until the last 10 years, the sites have been abandoned\nWe might not get back everything, but even if we recover 30-40% of it, it's quite a bit of money and jobs. \nGloria, who is retired, feels Trump administration officials don't appreciate how tariffs will affect her life.\nI'm on a fixed income. I'm retired, so things are going to go up and I'm worried. It means less money that I'll have coming in.\nWhat I'm trying to do is stock up on food because I think things are going to get really, really bad as far as shipping. Food is the one thing that you can't really cut from your budget. \nIf I can be honest, Trump's got all the money. He doesn't have to [worry about] food. Musk has all the things, so this isn't going to affect them. So they don't know about the pain. \nThey say 'a little pain', but how little is this pain?\nRobin says she's trying to hold out hope, but she worries the economic turmoil will affect her and her family.\nI'm worried. I'm worried about my retirement funds. I'm worried that he's going to make other countries hate us for what he's doing. I just think he's an idiot.\nI have a son and he's 30. He has his own family and he's looking for work and he's struggling. This isn't going to help things. He has two children - 18 months and six.\nI tend to be a glass half-full type of person, but the president and his ideas are just so crazy sometimes. My financial adviser, who I really trust, did say that some of Trump's plans are good and good for the finance market. \nIt gives me a little bit of hope, I guess. But then when you see the stock market plunging, it was like \"oh, maybe not\".",

Cosmetic surgery is \"more normalised\", she added.\nSome of the growth in cosmetic surgery is also caused by people who previously had non-surgical procedures, like filler and Botox, now choosing to go under the knife because they were getting \"fatigue\" from repeatedly going to clinics to get the work done, Nugent said.\nAnd the rise of weight-loss injections such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro have played a role, too. Nugent said that some people taking these medications, also known as \"skinny jabs\", are getting surgery on their face.\n\"As they lose weight they start to notice deflation and some sagging of their face,\" she said.\nThe BAAPS statistics do not show how many people have surgery after taking weight-loss drugs, but Nugent said that of the patients she has treated, \"more and more\" are people taking the medications.\nPeople have cosmetic surgery for a wide range of reasons.\nKirsten White, 33, a talent acquisition specialist from Sheffield, had a breast reduction and uplift after losing weight with a gastric sleeve.\nShe said her \"breasts were basically down to my bellybutton\" before surgery, leading to backache and the need for physiotherapy, she said.\n\"I don't think people are surprised when I tell them I've had cosmetic surgery because I think it's pretty normal now,\" she said. \n\"There's not so much the stigma that there used to be that it's really taboo and people are a lot more supportive of doing what will make you feel happy.\"\nMen underwent 1,799 surgical procedures in 2024, a slight drop from 2023 - making up just 6.6% of all surgeries in the BAAPS dataset.\nNose jobs (rhinoplasty) remained the most popular among men, with 332 surgeries done in 2024, which is a 14% drop on 2023.\nFace and neck lifts increased by 26%, with 140 done in 2024, suggesting a growing interest in anti-aging procedures among men - though Nugent said it was harder to spot trends for men due to the smaller numbers treated.\nBeauty standards are shaped by social media and celebrity culture, said Dr Beth Daniels, director of the Centre for Appearance Research at UWE Bristol. \nThe pandemic also caused a shift, when the move towards video calls \"heightened our awareness of our appearance\" because people saw their own faces on their computer screens.\nDr Daniels said that society places value on youthful looks, which could push some women to get cosmetic procedures.\n\"As women age, they're often discounted in a number of ways\" and are \"made to feel invisible in society\", she said.\nBAAPS vice president Anthony Macquillan suggested the overall increase in facelifts could be linked to societal changes, such as the rising pension age.\nHe said: \"For many, this type of surgery is not just aesthetic but also functional, helping to maintain confidence, secure employment, and reduce anxiety associated with age-related bias.\"\nThe BAAPS data is based on statistics from 233 of its members. Jim Frame, president of the UK Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons and professor at Anglia Ruskin University, said that it does not cover all of the cosmetic surgery operations that happen in the UK because some is carried out by ENT and maxillofacial surgeons, or by non-BAAPS members, especially fillers and Botox.\nThe data also does not include surgeries carried out overseas, where the lower cost of treatment in countries like Turkey attracts Brits. \nCosmetic procedures and surgery carry risks and the NHS warns that they \"can lead to serious complications if they're not done correctly\". \nIt advises people to research thoroughly beforehand, including checking the credibility of the clinic and getting information about the most common complications of the procedure.\n\"There are a lot of susceptible people that are committing to surgeries that a fairly large proportion will regret,\" Prof Frame said.",

Live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app\nAlpine's Jack Doohan suffered a high-speed crash as Friday practice at the Japanese Grand Prix was punctuated by four red-flag stoppages.\nThe Australian was uninjured in the crash, which was caused because Doohan failed to shut the DRS overtaking aid, which meant the car had less grip than he expected as he entered the 160mph first corner.\nTeam principal Oliver Oakes said it had been a \"misjudgement\" and \"something to learn from\".\nDoohan's was the first of four incidents that led to the session being stopped, two of which were for the grass catching fire beside the track.\nMcLaren's Oscar Piastri ended up fastest from team-mate Lando Norris.\nThe second stoppage was caused when Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso spun off and became beached in the gravel at Degner One, shortly after the session was restarted following a 20-minute delay to repair the damage to the barriers at Turn One.\nAnd a few minutes after the session was resumed, the cars had to return to the pits when the grass caught fire between Dunlop and Degner One.\nThat left only seven minutes of running at the end of the session, but it was stopped after six when a bigger patch of grass caught fire on the run down to Spoon Curve.\nThe fires are believed to have been caused by a combination of sparks from the cars and dry grass - Japan's wet season is in the summer. \nThe country's grand prix was held in the autumn until last year, when it was moved to avoid typhoon season and to improve Formula 1's sustainability with regard to travel and logistics.\nA statement from F1's governing body, the FIA, said: \"While we continue to look into the fires that occurred during FP2, our focus before tomorrow will be on taking preemptive measures. \n\"The grass has been cut as short as possible, and loose, dried grass has been removed from affected areas. Prior to tomorrow's sessions, the grass will be dampened, and specific response teams will be stationed around the track.\"\nProposal to bring back V10 engines set to be rejected\nHow to follow Japanese Grand Prix on the BBC\nDoohan's accident, which badly damaged his car, was the result of an oversight by a driver in only his fourth race in F1.\nHe was on only his second flying lap of the day, as his car had been driven by reserve Ryo Hirakawa in the first session.\nThe DRS, which boosts straight-line speed by reducing downforce, is triggered to shut automatically if the driver brakes.\nDoohan turned into the first corner having lifted off but not braked, and because he did not press the DRS button, the device remained activated.\nThat meant the wing was still in its open, low-downforce position, and the car immediately spun as he entered the corner. It careered across the gravel trap before making a heavy impact with the crash barrier.\nDoohan said: \"It was a heavy one, something that caught me by surprise, and I will learn from it. I know the team has a lot of work ahead to repair the car.\"\nThe shunt could increase the pressure on the 22-year-old, who has been dealing with questions as to whether his seat is under threat following Alpine's signing of Argentine Franco Colapinto as reserve driver.\nColapinto raced for Williams last year and his presence in a race seat could unlock significant amounts of sponsorship money from Latin America.\nThis video can not be played\nSwapped seats & shaky starts: What to know before Japanese Grand Prix\nThe series of stoppages left it impossible to draw any serious conclusions about relative pace, although it remains clear that McLaren are the team to beat.\nOn an unusually cold day of only 13C, all the drivers mentioned the strong north-westerly winds as making life difficult on a circuit with so many long, fast corners.\nNorris said: \"We're still in a good position, it's tricky just because of the wind. Wind makes a big difference, especially on a circuit like this when it's so quick.\n\"You're on such a fine limit for a long time in the first sector, the tiniest bit of wind can upset the car a lot. I still feel good, like we're in a reasonable place.\"\nFrenchman Isack Hadjar continued to impress for Racing Bulls with third fastest time on his first visit to Suzuka, considered one of the most demanding circuits on the calendar.\nHis team-mate Liam Lawson, who was demoted from the Red Bull team after just two races before this event, was fifth fastest behind Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari.\nHamilton said: \"It felt great. We got through all the programme. We have some performance to pick up - we're not the quickest at the moment - but it's a good baseline.\n\"From weekend to weekend I'm getting more comfortable, and understanding more of the set-up changes we can do and knowing what tools I have that can get the car in a better place.\"\nMercedes' George Russell was sixth fastest, from the second Ferrari of Charles Leclerc.\nRussell said: \"A pretty positive day for us, the car has been handling really nicely and I've been pretty pleased with that. We've got to make sure it stays the same for tomorrow. \n\"It is really windy out there and tomorrow the wind is going to shift 180 degrees so that is going to really change how the car is feeling but I am confident we can be in the mix for fighting for the front two rows.\"\nMax Verstappen was eighth, complaining of understeer in his Red Bull, with Pierre Gasly's Alpine and the Williams of Carlos Sainz completing the top 10.\nThis video can not be played\nHorner - Tsunoda has made a good start in Japan\nYuki Tsunoda impressed in the first session, topped by Norris, after his move up to Red Bull in place of Lawson, with sixth fastest time just 0.107 seconds slower than team-mate Verstappen.\nThe Japanese was only 18th in the second session, and did not complete a representative lap on the soft tyres.\nTsunoda said: \"P1 was better than expected.

Racecards, live text, results & reports on the BBC Sport website and app.\nRunners, riders, trainers and form - all the key details you need to know for Saturday's big race at Aintree.\nNote: Colours and approximate odds may change.\n(Racecard number, horse, trainer, jockey, recent form, age, weight carried [ie 11st 12lb is top weight]. Form: F - Fell, P - Pulled up, U - Unseated rider.)\nVerdict: Lots with chances but Senior Chief could still be improving, while Hewick looks primed to run well.\n1 Senior Chief 2 Hewick 3 Stumptown 4 Iroko\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Paul Townend\nForm: 311-P8 Age: 9 Weight: 11-12\nConvincing victor last year, having won the Irish National 12 months earlier, and could well be in the shake-up again. Pinpointed two months ago by 20-time champion jockey AP McCoy - who advises the owner - as the pick of JP McManus' stellar squad. Would be the first horse carrying top weight to triumph since the legendary Red Rum in the 1970s.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Venetia Williams Jockey: Charlie Deutsch\nForm: F-1P66 Age: 11 Weight:11-9\nThrives in different conditions, at Haydock in the mud \u2013 scene of five of his seven career victories, including back-to-back runnings of the Betfair Chase. Past three runs have been disappointing. Owned by flamboyant former banker Rich Ricci, you might not get rich backing this one although trainer did triumph with 100-1 outsider Mon Mome in 2009.\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 125-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Patrick Mullins\nForm: 73-411 Age: 8 Weight: 11-8\nOwner Stewart Andrew clearly thinks he's a rocket - he eyed Cheltenham Gold Cup, but trainer preferred to go for the National. Would be an emotional winner as Andrew's wife Sadie died in December 2022, five days after watching Nick Rockett in his first race. A winner of the Thyestes Chase then Bobbyjo Chase, where Intense Raffles was runner-up, but that rival better off at the weights here. Jockey rides for trainer father.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Brian Hayes\nForm: 1-P625 Age: 9 Weight: 11-8\nWould be a poignant winner as the last horse bought for owners Cheveley Park Stud by joint boss David Thompson at the end of 2020, just 19 days before his death. Runner-up in Irish Gold Cup to Galopin Des Champs at 66-1 when finishing ahead of subsequent Cheltenham winners Fact To File and Inothewayurthinkin. Drying ground should suit.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: John Joseph Hanlon (IRE) Jockey: Gavin Sheehan\nForm: 232571 Age: 10 Weight: 11-7\nAn \u00a3800 bargain buy who has won big races including the King George VI Chase, Bet365 Gold Cup, Galway Plate and American Grand National. Trainer, nicknamed 'Shark', has taken horse into local pub to celebrate victories, and believes he could be sent off favourite. Well backed in lead-up to race, would be suited by dry spell with good going right up his street.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Henry de Bromhead (IRE) Jockey: Rachael Blackmore\nForm: 443-26 Age: 12 Weight: 11-3\nLooked a potential winner last year in closing stages before finishing third. Triumphed in 2021 Cheltenham Gold Cup for trainer, who won National a month later with stablemate Minella Times as Rachael Blackmore became first female jockey to win the race. Could easily be prominent again for her although would be some effort to become only third horse to complete Gold Cup-National double.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Sean O'Keeffe\nForm: 2-5351 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nShowed bundles of promise when winning the Supreme Novices' Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival four years ago but much of that has been unfulfilled. Won for the first time in two years last time out at Thurles. Not the most obvious victor in trainer's talented team and no guarantee at all that he will appreciate this marathon distance.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Jonathan Burke\nForm: 0-8P43 Age: 9 Weight: 11-2\nWhile powerful trainer has other hopefuls, including last year's winner, don't let this one go under the radar. Third under top weight to Intense Raffles in last year's Irish Grand National before winning Bet365 Gold Cup at Sandown. Breeding and form point to potential for big run. Minella horses take their name from a Tipperary family hotel run by racehorse trader John Nallen.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Jordan Gainford\nForm:  U58708 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nBoasts some decent form including Irish Gold Cup win, when Minella Indo was second, albeit that was three years ago. Has run well at this meeting before, including a good second to Jonbon over shorter distance last year. Trainer seeking fourth victory in race, but suspicion is age, weight and longer trip may be against this one.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Keith Donoghue\nForm: -U1111 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nSecured fourth straight victory of the season by winning Cross Country Chase at Cheltenham Festival in fine style last month. That is the same race Tiger Roll won before his 2018 and 2019 National triumphs. Stumptown's trainer went to town at Cheltenham by landing the Gold Cup with Inothewayurthinkin, who was then made hot favourite for this but skips the race.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 8-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Freddie Gingell\nForm: 83-222 Age: 9 Weight: 11-1\nPart-owned by former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, Hitman has been a bit hit and miss. Has a habit of coming second - finishing runner-up in 11 of his 26 races - and this distance is a real unknown. Talented 19-year-old jockey credits much of his success to his mother Kim who died in 2020 from cancer aged 43.\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 150-1\nTrainer: Nigel Twiston-Davies Jockey: Sam Twiston-Davies\nForm: 1P-132 Age: 9 Weight: 11-1\nJockey rides for trainer father, who has landed the race twice before. Winner of Midlands Grand National last year. Owner Bryan Burrough hoping for second success, 42 years after his colours were carried to victory by the Jenny Pitman-trained Corbiere. It's a tough ask but had a convincing victory over fences at Ascot earlier in season and stamina looks assured.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: James Reveley\nForm: 6-2383  Age: 10 Weight: 11-0\nForm has dipped since reaching top of his game two or three years ago. Won jump racing's festive showpiece, the King George VI Chase at Kempton, in 2022 and was second a year later. In between, finished runner-up in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Will take a brave man or woman to pick this one after an 11-race losing run. Stable jockey rides Kandoo Kid.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 50-1\nTrainer: Nicky Henderson Jockey: James Bowen\nForm: 9-5515  Age: 11 Weight: 10-13\nBit of an enigma. Was on a 10-race losing run when won well at Cheltenham on New Year's Day. Maybe he was just in the party mood. Green and gold colours of owner JP McManus look more likely to succeed elsewhere, although there is a breeding positive - Chantry House's sire Yeats was also dad to 2022 National winner Noble Yeats.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Harry Skelton\nForm: 210-32 Age: 10 Weight: 10-12\nNamed after owner Max McNeill's late father and ex-professional golfer Ted, who was three under par through five holes to lead The Open at Royal Portrush in 1951. Will the gelding be above or below par? Fourth in the Scottish National two years ago but well behind Minella Cocooner and Nick Rockett in last season's Bet365 Gold Cup.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Mark Walsh\nForm: 286411  Age: 8 Weight: 10-12\nAnother powerful weapon in the armoury of Cheltenham Gold Cup-winning trainer, who also has Stumptown and Vanillier. A beaten favourite for both the Galway Plate and Kerry National but form of his Leopardstown win in December reads well and now takes a big step up in trip. Named after a 1970s film about a 12th Century knight, could he put his rivals to the sword here?\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 12-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Harry Cobden\nForm: P23-18 Age: 9 Weight: 10-11\nDecent third in Topham Chase over National fences last year. Won Coral Gold Cup, formerly the Hennessy, at Newbury in November. Only one horse, Many Clouds, has gone on to also win the National, though trainer thinks he can do it. He won in 2012 with Neptune Collonges and says the grey Kandoo Kid is the \"ideal horse for the race\".\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 20-1\nTrainer: Oliver Greenall & Josh Guerriero Jockey: Jonjo O'Neill Jr\nForm: 2-2F42  Age: 7 Weight: 10-11\nA Cheltenham Festival winner in 2023. Second at Aintree meeting 12 months ago to subsequent Gold Cup winner Inowthewayurthinkin when nominated by owner JP McManus as his 'National horse for next year'. Joint-trainer Oliver Greenall's father Lord Daresbury is former racecourse chairman who has an Aintree stand named after him. Co-trainer Josh Guerriero won Foxhunters' Chase over National fences as amateur jockey in 2008.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 9-1\nTrainer: Tom Gibney (IRE) Jockey: JJ Slevin\nForm: 11-902 Age: 7 Weight: 10-10\nSounds like a deadly serious lottery, and has a deadly serious chance. Winner of the Irish Grand National last year. Nearly all of his races have been on soft or heavy ground. The grey runs in the 'double green' colours of owner-breeders Simon Munir and Isaac Souede. Showed his wellbeing when second, despite carrying more weight, to Nick Rockett at Fairyhouse in February.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Henry de Bromhead (IRE) Jockey: Darragh O'Keeffe\nForm: 1P-169 Age: 9 Weight: 10-10\nPulled up in last year's Irish National but marked himself out as a candidate for this race when winning well at Cheltenham in October. Subsequently sixth in the Coral Gold Cup at Newbury when he was staying on, which could be a good sign for the test ahead. Owned by the Lucky In Life Syndicate. Will the horse live up to their name?\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Richard Phillips Jockey: Harry Bannister\nForm: F03106 Age: 11 Weight: 10-10\nPreviously based in Ireland, where he won the Midlands National last summer at Kilbeggan. Having second run for amiable Gloucestershire trainer, who does a nice line in impressions. He helped buy the horse with John Rosbotham, a friend of 55 years with whom he dreamed in the school playground of having a National runner, and it runs for a syndicate of 12 called the Dozen Dreamers.\nRating: 4/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey:  Sam Ewing\nForm: 212433 Age: 7 Weight: 10-9\nFive of his six wins have come at roughly half the distance of this race. Looks an uphill task on the face of it, but interestingly mentioned as a potential surprise package by the trainer \u2013 who has won three times previously - when weights for the race were announced in February. Would probably benefit from soft ground.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Nigel Twiston-Davies Jockey: Tom Bellamy\nForm: 5-324P Age: 7 Weight: 10-9\nOwner David Proos hoping to go two better after his family silks were carried to third by Rinus in 1990. No forlorn hope based on his second to Kandoo Kid in Coral Gold Cup at Newbury. One for alliteration fans - could Broadway Boy follow Mon Mome, Party Politics and Red Rum as a nifty-sounding National winner for trainer, who has triumphed twice before?\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Jody McGarvey\nForm: U50029 Age: 10 Weight: 10-9\nEleventh in last year's race, when hampered late on, having previously finished eighth and pulled up. Prominent on each occasion before fading. Winner of the Troytown Chase in 2023. Will probably be spotted towards the front again but takes a leap of faith to see him stay there and become only the fourth grey horse to win the National.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Paul O'Brien\nForm: 3PP-P0 Age: 8 Weight: 10-9\nLooked to be heading for big things after winning Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham in 2023 but career over the bigger obstacles has not been straightforward and pulled up on three of his past four runs. Jockey called up for first ride in race after original bookings Bryony Frost (riding in France) then Johnny Burke (on Minella Cocooner instead) were unavailable\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Danny Mullins\nForm: 37-008 Age: 8 Weight: 10-7\n'Caught the eye' of last year's winning trainer when the weights were revealed in February. Finished seventh in 2024 when appeared to run out of steam. That could be perceived as a stamina doubt, although might see out the trip better now a year stronger and stable's Hedgehunter won in 2005 after a tired late fall the previous year.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Jonjo & AJ O'Neill Jockey: Nick Scholfield\nForm: 5P-241 Age: 9 Weight: 10-9\nIntriguing contender who finished fourth in the Welsh Grand National before ending a two-year losing run with victory at Uttoxeter. Finished third to subsequent National winner Corach Rambler at Cheltenham Festival two years ago. Formerly owned by Tory peer Michelle Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman before being sold last year to Martin Tedham, who sponsors the trainer's yard.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Sean Flanagan\nForm: -P6913 Age: 10 Weight: 10-6\nThis was my selection in 2023, when he ended up finishing second to Corach Rambler for shrewd trainer. Was 14th last year on softer ground but comfortable Punchestown win in February showcased his credentials. Jockey is qualified aircraft pilot although nearly took wrong route at Cheltenham last month before recovering to finish third in Cross Country Chase. Chance again if the satnav is working.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Michael Keady Jockey: Ciaran Gethings\nForm:  F22999  Age: 8 Weight: 10-6\nRunner-up in the Kerry and Munster Nationals when trained by Willie Mullins but switched stables last month. Now based in the Flat racing capital of Newmarket. Trainer set up on his own five months ago and is looking for first win over jumps in biggest steeplechase of all. Has to be a doubt over whether this contender possesses the same ability and stamina as some of his rivals.\nRating: 4/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Nicky Henderson Jockey: Nico de Boinville\nForm: 141122 Age: 8 Weight: 10-6\nNovice chaser looking to break duck for trainer, who is one of the greats but has poor record in this race \u2013 with no win from 43 previous runners. Sound jumper who should like the ground. Need an omen? One of the owners, Paul Humphreys, was born on same day as Grand National legend Red Rum. Their syndicate once included the late John Sillett, Coventry City's FA Cup-winning manager.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Philip Hobbs and Johnson White Jockey: Micheal Nolan\nForm: 45U4-1 Age: 13 Weight: 10-6\nThe obstacles should not be an issue, having finished eighth and fourth in the past two runnings of the shorter Topham Chase over the National fences. However, this is a longer and stiffer task. No 13-year-old horse has won the National since Sergeant Murphy 102 years ago and hard to see an equine teenager being celebrated this time around.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 150-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Sean Bowen\nForm: -33713  Age: 10 Weight: 10-5\nThis race has been the long-term plan, says the trainer, who has been successful three times before. And he has been dealt a nice hand with the horse sneaking in towards the bottom of the weights. Rider is actually allergic to horses, but is on the verge of becoming British champion jockey and steps in for injured Jack Kennedy.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Ben Pauling Jockey:  Beau Morgan\nForm: 5-2P77 Age: 10 Weight: 10-5\nA family affair as 20-year-old jockey rides horse owned by his mother Georgia. The expected sunny conditions should suit as six of his seven wins have come on good ground. Second in the Ultima Chase at last year's Cheltenham Festival, he ran three times over hurdles this season before finishing a distant seventh in the Grimthorpe Chase at Doncaster.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 80-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Danny Gilligan\nForm: 352P4B Age: 8 Weight: 10-4\nUnlikely to need a Duffle Coat on Merseyside this weekend with sunny spells forecast and temperatures expected to reach 18C. Unlikely too that this grey will prove good enough to triumph despite low weight. Runner-up in last summer's Galway Plate and has finished second several times but only managed to wrap up one win from his past 27 races.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 100-1\nLatest horse racing results",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump's tariffs have sparked falls in stock markets around the world - but how will they affect sport?\n\"It's potentially the difference between life and death.\"\nThe words of a \"hugely frustrated\" Lynn Calder - the head of Ineos Automotive, the car company owned by Manchester United minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe - when talking about the impact United States tariffs would have on the business.\nWith its manufacturing based in France, the company now faces the prospect of 25% tariffs being imposed on vehicles exported to the crucial American market, with Calder admitting it was \"vulnerable to tariffs\" and needed \"direct and urgent political intervention\"., external\nHer stark warning was a reminder of the effect the duties introduced by US President Donald Trump will have on the wide range of industries linked to sport through investment or sponsorship. \nGlobal stock markets have fallen as investors reacted amid fears of inflation, but beyond the wider economic turmoil, how else could the ripples of a trade war affect the world of sport?\nTrump's so-called 'Liberation Day' could have ramifications for a club such as Manchester United in other ways.\n\"It has $650m of loans from the US because the club is listed in New York,\" football finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport.\n\"If the Trump administration's tariffs have a positive impact on the US dollar and it strengthens, that means the value of those loans in sterling terms will increase, and this could hit United's accounts and have implications for Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR) that limit clubs' losses.\n\"In the 2022 accounts there was a \u00a358m cost due to foreign exchange movements on these loans. So the United board will be watching with interest as to what happens in terms of the market reaction to these tariffs as far as global exchange rates are concerned.\"\nThe US is set to stage some of the world's biggest sports events over the next few years, including the 2026 World Cup and 2028 LA Olympics and Paralympics. \nThese events are meant to provide overseas businesses with a key opportunity to raise their profile and boost sales in the US. \nKorean car manufacturer Hyundai Group, for instance, will look to take advantage of its sponsorship deal with football governing body Fifa during the Club World Cup this year, and then the World Cup in 2026. But could Trump's aggressive trade policies make such businesses think again?\n\"I suspect some sponsors are now re-assessing how they 'activate' such deals in the US, given the trade barriers that have now been imposed,\" says John Zerafa, a sports event bid strategist.\n\"Why would a sponsor spend millions of pounds doing so if it is now prohibitive to sell in America?\"\nMany sports teams and athletes are also sponsored by sportswear brands. \nWith most of these companies relying on materials and manufacturing in Asia - where Trump has directed some of the highest tariffs - it is no surprise that shares in the likes of Nike, Adidas and Puma have all fallen sharply, with fears that higher importing costs would be passed on to consumers.\nHowever Maguire says the impact should be limited. \"For a $100 (\u00a376.36) replica sports jersey sold in the US, manufacturing costs are likely to be in the region of $12-15 dollars at source, and maybe even lower,\" he says.\n\"So even if there's a 40% tariff when the goods are imported to the US, that'll only be around $4 more.\n\"Consumers are used to paying premium prices in sports retail. The manufacturer and retailer should absorb some of this, and it shouldn't impact on the amount being sold - or the commissions being earned by clubs that sell merchandise.\"\nThe European Sponsorship Association told BBC Sport that it was \"monitoring the situation closely and will actively seek the views of the sport sponsorship community\".\n\"As a representative body we will respond accordingly if there proves to be any sign of a material negative impact on the industry,\" it said.\nAmid talk of a trade war, Trump's tariffs have also raised questions over the atmosphere at the various sports events it is due to host, not least the Ryder Cup in the US later this year. \nWith European Union leaders highly critical of the policy, it would be little surprise if anti-European sentiment among the American fans is intensified.\nAnd then there's the 2026 World Cup, which the US is co-hosting alongside Mexico and Canada.\nIn January, Trump vowed to impose tariffs of 25% on imports from the neighbouring countries - America's two biggest trading partners - in a move he said was designed to address the entry of opioid drug fentanyl to the US, the large amounts of undocumented migrants that have come across US borders, as well as trade deficits.\nLast month Trump claimed the political and economic tensions between the US and its World Cup co-hosts would be good for the tournament. \"I think it's going to make it more exciting. Tension's a good thing,\" he said.\nHe also announced the formation of a World Cup taskforce, external which he will chair to ensure the tournament runs smoothly. Fifa has been approached for comment on their response to the US President's tariffs.\nBut Trump's protectionist policies raise serious questions over the three countries' willingness and ability to work together on security for instance, or to ensure fans can gain entry visas, and then pass easily across borders. \nWith imported materials such as steel and aluminium more expensive, there may also be concerns about the development of infrastructure for the tournament.\nTrump has also spoken provocatively about making Canada 'the 51st state', leading to the US anthem being booed by Canadian fans at NBA and NHL fixtures. \nCould the additional tensions over tariffs mean such scenes are repeated at the World Cup or even the Olympics?\n\"Nations and cities host global sports events for a variety of reasons, from enhancing reputation and driving global investment, to sending a message to the world that you are open, welcoming and ready to do business. It seems nothing could be further from the truth in terms of Trump's America,\" says Zerafa.\n\"It's not just tariffs. From forced repatriations, and hostility to the EU and Nato, to a possible takeover of Greenland and bad blood with Canada. All this makes it a very challenging backdrop for the World Cup 2026 and LA Games in 2028 to promote that narrative.\"\nThe IOC has been approached for comment. Insiders told BBC Sport they are confident that Trump's love of sport - and his desire for LA 2028 to be a successful global platform towards the end of his second term in office - will ensure that preparations for the Olympics are not derailed by geopolitics.\nWith retaliatory tariffs being imposed by other countries, a trade war could impact any person, team or league buying sports equipment that is made in the US, as well as American consumers of products manufactured overseas of course.\nThe Premier League exports its content to the US via its lucrative \u00a32bn TV deal with NBC, but because this is deemed a service rather than a product, the tariffs do not apply.\n\"As such there should be no consequences, unless there is some form of escalation in the trade relationship between the UK and the US,\" says Maguire. \n\"So the Premier League won't have to come to some sort of compromise with its broadcast partner.\"\nA bigger concern for the UK football industry will be consumers having less money to spend on tickets and TV subscriptions if fears of a recession come to pass.",

        "article_text": "\"Je m'appelle Luis Enrique.\" \nThat's how the Paris St-Germain manager introduced himself to the cameras in Paris back in July 2023.\nBut beyond that, he keeps his French private - except for his favourite phrase: on va gagner (\"we're going to win\"). \nThat pretty much sums the Spaniard up: Honest, direct and not one for show. \nLuis Enrique doesn't perform. He is intense, an obsessive and he lets the work speak for itself.\nAnd what work it has been, transforming PSG from a star-studded squad to a collective, cohesive and resilient unit.\nSaturday's win against Angers secured back-to-back Ligue 1 titles for Luis Enrique's PSG, as they remain unbeaten in the league all season.\nThey still have a chance of repeating last season's domestic treble and, with a Champions League quarter-final coming up against Aston Villa, a first European title is a serious possibility.\nWinning titles is nothing new to the French champions but Luis Enrique has helped turn them from a team long associated with egos and big-money into a vibrant, youthful and thrilling team to watch.\nSo how have PSG and Luis Enrique finally started to win over the neutrals?\nTragedy, withdrawal & ruthlessness: The Luis Enrique story\nLuis Enrique is World Cup winner on Twitch with live Q&As\nPSG beat Angers to clinch Ligue 1 title with six games left\nLife has hit Luis Enrique hard.\nIn 2019, he lost his nine-year-old daughter Xana to a rare form of bone cancer. \nHe has spoken about her with remarkable calm. \"Her body is gone,\" he said, \"but she hasn't died. She's still with us.\"\nIn a deeply moving documentary, he talked about visiting his mother.\n\"My mother couldn't keep photos of Xana. Until I came home and asked, 'Why are there no photos of Xana, Mom?' 'I can't, I can't\u2026,' she used to say. 'Mom, you have to put up photos of Xana, Xana is alive,' I replied.\"\n\"Physically, she may not be here, but spiritually she is. Because every day we talk about her, we laugh, and we remember because I think Xana still sees us.\"\nIn her memory, he and his wife have launched a foundation to help families of terminally ill children - especially those who can't afford to stop working during their child's final months. \nIt's an act of love and fierce purpose. Like everything he does.\nHe is a man grounded in more ways than one.\nFor over two years, he's walked barefoot most mornings on the grass of the pitches of the PSG training ground. \nHe's convinced that 'earthing' helps him avoid spring allergies and reconnect with something deeper. \nHe's strict with his body, too. He stretches every 30 minutes at the training ground, trains daily - even at home sometimes, weaving between sofas and walls - and has turned both house and office into functional gyms, with straps and bars hanging from ceilings and walls.\nHe enjoys surfing, swimming, endurance running and long cycle rides up the steep climbs of Spain's Picos de Europa. \nIn 2007, he completed the Frankfurt Ironman challenge - a 2.4-mile swim, a 118-mile cycle and a full marathon. The following year, he ran the legendary Marathon de Sables, a 155-mile race over six days in the Sahara desert.\n\"I only know how to compete,\" he said to himself when he retired from playing in 2004. Managing was the only option for the former Barcelona and Spain forward.\nAs a coach, Luis Enrique has copied the philosophy of his former team-mate Pep Guardiola from the beginning. \nHe hasn't brought anything truly new to the table, but, using the tonnes of energy he has, he has become one of the top representatives of a broader cultural shift.\nHis relentless edge is now driving everything at Paris St-Germain, although initially he didn't even want the job.\nHe thought the club only cared about names. Players such as Neymar, Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe. Uncoachable, he assumed. \nBut when he heard the philosophy had changed - that they now wanted to build a team - he reconsidered. \nAnd, soon after he arrived, Neymar and Marco Verratti were gone. Messi, who might have stayed had he known Luis Enrique was coming, had already committed to Inter Miami.\nHe understands and appreciates the importance of individual stars, but only up to a point. \nIn a recent documentary about his first season at PSG, he was seen warning Mbappe, his star player at the time, about his obligation to fulfil his defensive duties - just after the player had scored a hat-trick.\n\"He's the best player in the world,\" the Asturian insisted several times. \"But if the team with the best player in the world always won, PSG would have eight Champions League titles and they haven't had any.\"\nHe is a manager who respects structure, but is never afraid to speak his mind. \n\"I'm not afraid of the worst in football... if they sack me, no problem,\" he said. \"The next day, I'll go for a cycling trip.\" \nIt's that perspective that helped him ride out a rocky start last season - including a 4\u20131 loss to Newcastle in the Champions League and heavy criticism from the supporters.\nBut he stayed calm and kept faith in his footballing beliefs. Structure, repetition, and positional discipline. \nHis dream? One day, managers will have mics in the stands and be able to talk players through their positions during a match.\nHe had to rewire a squad addicted to chaos when he arrived in Paris.\nSo he spent little time in an office, instead sitting with his assistants, working directly with his players and embedding his ideas.\nSome players push back against his intensity. Mbappe, for example, didn't love being boxed in as a number nine or publicly challenged after a hat-trick.\nBut others thrive, because he doesn't do favourites.\nHe could not care less if the media don't like him. \nThe three-part documentary about his life is titled You Lot Haven't Got A Clue - a message to the media and a window into how little their opinions affect him. \nHe admitted, if it were up to him, he would take a 50% pay cut if that meant he would not have to speak to the media again. \n\"I don't read the opinions of the journalists,\" he once said, \"not because of a lack of respect, but because, logically, they haven't dedicated even 10% of the time, nor do they have the information, that my staff and I have on any given issue.\"\nAnd there lies another contradiction - a coach unwilling to give one-on-one interviews, yet prepared to expose himself for all to see in a documentary.\nNot for the first time, either.\nNothing was off-limits when, during the World Cup in Qatar, much of Spain was glued to their computer screens as Luis Enrique, then in charge of the national team, spent hours on Twitch answering questions on all aspects of his life as far ranging as why he ate six eggs a day, hated cheese and slept naked.\nHis reasons for his regular streams were the same as why he agreed to the documentary: to offer his most honest version and let people judge. \n\nDiscipline, injuries & family - how Dembele turned career around\nForward Ousmane Dembele has been one of PSG's success stories.\nLast summer, Luis Enrique gave him a mission to score more goals. The message was clear: be more selfish and shoot more. \nDembele listened. He's now thriving in a central role, playing as a false nine, more involved in the build-up, getting more touches, more shots, more goals. \nHe's not the erratic winger from his Barcelona days. He's focused. And the goals have flowed, having now scored 32 goals in all competitions this season.\nFor Luis Enrique, failure isn't trying and falling short. It's failing to give everything.\nHe has carried the belief that football isn't life or death since his playing days. He'll never shed a tear over a defeat. \nWhen it became clear that Mbappe was leaving last summer, he said something that may come to define his PSG reign.\n\"The team will play better,\" he said. No longer forced to design a side around one star, he felt liberated. \"Next year,\" he thought, \"I'm going to control everything that happens on the pitch.\"\nAnd this is very much his PSG, a team that many believe could achieve their dream of finally winning the Champions League.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "Being Maria, a new film starring Matt Dillon and Anamaria Vartolomei, explores the life of Maria Schneider and the making of one of the most notorious films in cinema history.\nIt may be the most infamous scene in the entire history of cinema. The sexually explicit drama Last Tango in Paris, made by Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci and released in 1972, is the story of an affair between a middle-aged man, Paul, and a young woman, Jeanne, in a Paris apartment. The notorious \"butter scene\" was not in the original script and elements of it were made without 19-year-old actress Maria Schneider's prior consent.\nWarning: This article contains themes of sexual assault that some may find upsetting.\u00a0\nSchneider struggled with drug addiction and her mental health for years after the film's release, but her story, and the making of Last Tango in Paris, is now being told through the film Being Maria. It stars Matt Dillon as Marlon Brando, who played Paul, and Anamaria Vartolomei as Schneider. The film's French director Jessica Palud adapted the story from a 2018 memoir by journalist Vanessa Schneider, Maria's cousin.\n\"I think we have to look at the context of the time of Last Tango in Paris, it's now fifty years since the film was made,\" Matt Dillon tells the BBC. \"That time was a different time, but it's very important to look at it now from a different perspective.\n\"It was really a traumatic experience for her. And not just at the time it happened, but as it continued to follow her and haunt her wherever she went in her life, in so many ways.\"\nBeing Maria explores Schneider's background: she was the product of an affair between a famous French actor, Daniel G\u00e9lin, and a Romanian model. She first met her father as a teenager, and he introduced her to film sets. Last Tango in Paris was her first leading role, and she would later recall in a 2007 interview, then in her fifties, that she was persuaded to take the part instead of starring in a film with French film star Alain Delon, and, at the age of 19, \"didn't understand all of the film's sexual content\". She \"had a bad feeling about it all\", she said, but was told by her agency she couldn't possibly turn down working with Marlon Brando, one of the greatest stars of 20th-Century cinema.\nShe remembered what happened on the day of filming that scene, in which her character is raped by Brando's, using butter as a lubricant. \"That scene wasn't in the original script. The truth is it was Marlon who came up with the idea. They only told me about it before we had to film the scene and I was so angry\u2026 I felt humiliated and to be honest, I felt a little raped, both by Marlon and by Bertolucci. After the scene, Marlon didn't console me or apologise,\" she said. \"Marlon said to me: 'Maria, don't worry, it's just a movie,' but during the scene, even though what Marlon was doing wasn't real, I was crying real tears.\n\"Thankfully, there was just one take.\"\nBertolucci would later talk about why he withheld details of the scene from Schneider, saying: \"I wanted her reaction as a girl, not as an actress. I wanted her to react humiliated.\" He insisted that it was only the use of the butter that had surprised the actress, but Matt Dillon says what happened was \"really wrong\".\n\"It's something that we often do, actors, we won't tell the other actor, or the director will encourage us to not reveal what we're going to do, so we can get a real reaction,\" he says. \"But it was really wrong, with a scene that was so sensitive, to do something like that.\"\u00a0\nJessica Palud tells the BBC that recreating the rape scene \"couldn't be avoided\" in Being Maria, but this time, the audience sees events from Maria Schneider's perspective. \"I couldn't avoid shooting this scene because it was the very moment in which her life completely switches. Everything goes wrong from there,\" Palud says. \"It was important to have the scene from her point of view, in her body, in her gaze, what she went through, and the fact that there were witnesses. Maria was being assaulted in the presence of the whole crew, who were observing and not reacting.\"\nThis time the scene was prepared using an intimacy co-ordinator, which 61-year-old Dillon says was his first time working with one. \"I said to the intimacy co-ordinator, 'do you know what the scene is about?'\" he recalls. \"They said yes, and I said, 'Because you can probably trace back the role of an intimacy co-ordinator to that moment, in that film.'\"\u00a0\nThe use of an intimacy co-ordinator, who acts as a choreographer and a liaison between actors and production during simulated sex and nude scenes, is increasingly standard in the industry since the #MeToo movement. It now makes headlines when they're declined, including by Mikey Madison in Oscar winner Anora, or when Gwyneth Paltrow revealed that she told one to \"step a little bit back\" during her sex scenes with Timoth\u00e9e\u00a0Chalamet in Marty Supreme.\n\"I don't think it's a bad thing, I think it can evolve into being something good,\" Dillon says of using intimacy co-ordinators. \"It seems they're there to prevent people from crossing boundaries, but in fact it's creating boundaries that give opportunities for different ways of approaching these scenes. I hope that's how it evolves rather than people feeling like 'they're here to tell us what we can and can't do.' And Anamaria and I were very comfortable.\"\nAnamaria Vartolomei (who also made Golden Lion winner Happening, featuring scenes of illegal abortion) says that although she felt \"safe, protected and guided\" shooting the rape scene on the Being Maria shoot, she still became upset. \"This scene was really violent,\" she tells the BBC. \"I couldn't imagine what it was for Maria as she felt it for real. I'm just playing her. But this thing really happened to her, and she had no one around her. She just had people looking at her without doing anything. I think the violence of it was double because she didn't have the support I had on set, but I still felt it was really hard.\u00a0\n\"I was so emotional that day. I couldn't stop crying because I feel I accumulated the violence of the scene when I saw it on screen. When I had to play it, all my tears came out. I think it's very brutal. And it's insane to think that somebody could do this.\"\u00a0\nMaria Schneider was not only professionally unsupported on set, but she also lacked the experience to know that Bertolucci couldn't make her to do the scene. \"I should have called my agent or had my lawyer come to the set because you can't force someone to do something that isn't in the script, but at the time, I didn't know that,\" she would say later.\u00a0\nBut it was also the sensation the film Last Tango in Paris caused when it was shown from October 1972 that would undo Schneider. Despite (or helped by) it being banned or restricted in some countries; it made around $36m in the US alone. In France, it was reported audiences were queueing round the block for two hours or more to get a ticket.\nThe disparity between Bertolucci, Brando and Schneider became clear: critical reaction to the film aided Bertolucci's reputation as an international auteur, and both he and Brando were nominated for Oscars for the film. Brando, now doubly legendary for making Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather during the same period, is reported to have made around $3m out of Last Tango, as he took a share of the profits; Schneider recalled she was paid around $4,000. She appeared in full-frontal nudity; Brando never appeared naked in the film.\nThe young woman found the overnight fame increasingly hard to deal with. She told interviewers when the film came out that she had slept with 50 men and 20 women and \"had tried heroin\", because, she later explained, that although this was untrue, she was seen [as] \"that sexy bimbo\". Her erratic behaviour, she said, was down to being afraid. \"To be suddenly famous all over the world was frightening,\" she said. \"I didn't have bodyguards like they do today. People thought I was just like my character, and I would make up stories for the press, but that wasn't me\u2026 It made me go mad. I got into drugs\u2026 it was like an escape from reality. It was the 70s and at that time, it was all going on.\"\nHer cousin, Vanessa Schneider, has said of her that she was also a victim of the double standards of the time: \"For puritanical viewers, she was an easy woman who made pornography. It was brutal for her, especially since it wasn't at all in her nature \u2013 she was pretty modest, reserved and fairly conservative in certain respects.\"\n\"People thought I was like the girl in the movie, but that wasn't me,\" Maria Schneider declared in a 2007 interview. \"I felt very sad because I was treated like a sex symbol, I wanted to be recognised as an actress, and the whole scandal and the aftermath of the film turned me a little crazy and I had a breakdown.\" Schneider also revealed that she tried to take her life during this period.\nLater on, Schneider would get sober, but although she made around 50 films during her career (including the critically acclaimed 1975 film The Passenger, co-starring Jack Nicholson) she remarked that \"Last Tango is still the one everyone asks me about.\" She died in 2011, from cancer.\n\"The unfortunate thing is Maria Schneider gave an incredible performance in that film, and you could see how her career could have taken a different path,\" Matt Dillon says. \"But she already had so many strikes against her. Her family of origin was a very messy situation. She was abandoned by her parents and then abandoned by the people that she worked with. I think this abandonment followed her.\"\nSchneider is not the only female actor of that era who suffered because of the hype around an erotic movie they starred in \u2013 Sylvia Kristel also found it hard to escape the sensation created by 1974's soft porn movie Emmanuelle, in which she had the leading role, and which also featured a rape scene. Nor was it only women who suffered making films with sexual content; Schneider would later say that \"even Brando said he felt raped and manipulated\" during the infamous Last Tango scene.\n\"It was an era of celebrity directors,\" Anna Smith, host of the podcast Girls on Film, tells the BBC. \"And the pattern seems to be mainly domineering male directors exploiting and bullying younger actresses. The entitlement of some of these lauded men enabled them to exert control over women.\"\n\"We had this idea of the creator, the director that has the supreme power,\" says Vartolomei, \"and that they were a sort of guru of directing, and that all the people around him were listening to him as if he was God. I think that was the problem back then. Now we're more protected and our voice is heard, and it is also valued, which [it] wasn't back then.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How Snow White became 2025's most divisive film\n\u2022 10 of the best films to watch in March\n\u2022 Why cult film Emmanuelle is 'extremely problematic' \nBut Being Maria director Jessica Palud points out that one of the more extraordinary aspects of Schneider's character was that long before the era of #MeToo, she was speaking out about what happened on the set of Last Tango in Paris. \"The thing is that what I really found interesting and touching about her is that although it was in the 1970s and at the time, many young actresses would get assaulted or raped, but they kept it inside. Maria was extremely vocal and clear in interviews\u2026 she would speak up, but she wasn't listened to.\"\u00a0\nSchneider's experience on Last Tango was eventually taken seriously in 2016, when footage of Bertolucci's 2013 interview with Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise about the infamous scene and his desire for Schneider's humiliation to be real resurfaced. This time, it caused outrage. Some did not realise that the sex scene was, however traumatic, only simulated by Brando and Schneider. The then 76-year-old director called the furore \"ridiculous\" and reiterated that Schneider knew about the scene beforehand.\nAll three of the main storytellers of Last Tango in Paris \u2013 Bertolucci, Brando and Schneider \u2013 are now dead. Knowing that the horror, shock, upset and fury seen on Maria Schneider's face is real, and deliberately provoked, should the film, as French newspaper Le Monde pondered after the cancellation of a 2024 screening in Paris due to protests, carry some kind of warning?\n\"I have long thought that the perceived canon of cinematic greats needs re-examining \u2013 as it comes from an inherently patriarchal place,\" says Smith. \"I think it's healthy to revisit classics from a modern perspective; I hope our understanding of the damage that can be caused by certain attitudes and practices has evolved.\"\nBeing Maria, Palud says, attempts to show that, but she says that \"I did not want to judge nor condemn, but to show the system and show what needs to change in the system for this younger generation to be protected. There's still a lot to do. But a scene like this wouldn't happen now, thank God.\"\nVartolomei adds: \"I feel this movie is clearing things up for Maria, along with Vanessa Schneider's book. Back then, Maria was considered a victim, but for me she's far from that, as she found the strength to talk, for the story to be heard, even if she decided to talk in a society that wasn't ready to receive her voice. But now I'm just happy that we are finally able to hear her.\"\nBeing Maria has a US-wide release from 4 April.\u00a0\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "England Women's captain Leah Williamson suffered an ACL injury when Arsenal faced Manchester United, which ruled her out of the 2023 World Cup\nA number of high-profile injuries have occurred in women's football in recent years - but could the type of pitches they play on be a contributing factor?\nThat is a question Brighton chief executive officer Paul Barber asked last week and he welcomed research into his theory. \nThe Seagulls hope to build a new purpose-built stadium for the women's team by 2027-28 and are exploring all scientific research to make facilities the best.\nThat includes finding out whether pitch surfaces designed for male athletes are adequate for females. If not, what is the best solution?\nFemale footballers might need 'different pitch type' to cut injury risk\nMost top-tier football pitches are now hybrid, which means they are essentially a synthetic mat through which real grass can grow. \nThese pitches feel like natural grass but can be regrown each year. They are also hard-wearing, which means they can be drained and recovered to play football on. \nHowever, most of these pitches - which are used predominantly in the men's Premier League - are made up of 95% sand and 4-5% polyethylene fibres to help reduce waterlogging. \nWomen's Super League teams use a variety of grounds across the season but all pitches meet the minimum elite standards required by the league licence. \nBrighton's Broadfield Stadium is one of the only natural grass surfaces in the WSL, with most clubs playing on a hybrid pitch. \nArsenal, Aston Villa and Leicester City use their male counterparts' stadiums as their main home pitch, as well as occasionally playing at secondary grounds.\nWest Ham were the only WSL club not to play a match at their men's team stadium last season. \nThe Bescot Stadium - home of League Two Walsall FC - is used for Villa's matches in the Women's League Cup and FA Cup and was recently renovated.\nCrystal Palace, who earned promotion from the Women's Championship, play the majority of their matches on the VBS Community Stadium and the pitch was replaced with a new hybrid surface this season. \nAnd Leicester City's second pitch - Burton Albion's Pirelli Stadium - is an artificial grass pitch and is only used when there are scheduling clashes.\nBrighton Women play some WSL matches at the Amex Stadium\nWhile little research has been carried out regarding pitches for female athletes specifically, plenty of data has been gathered in football generally. \nEverything from traction, the hardness of the surface, how high the ball bounces, how far the ball rolls and shock absorption have been looked into. \nNeil Rodger, the principal consultant at STRI Group - a company working in the development of sports surfaces - admitted more research was needed to see if there was any link to increased injury risk in female footballers and certain pitches.\n\"It's never been broken down into men's football and women's football. We've always just designed football pitches,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"When you think about injuries in the men's or women's game, there are so many factors that contribute - the training load, sleep, physiology, hormones...\n\"The pitch is a factor, it's in the mix. Historically, in the women's and men's game, there have been unsafe pitches. In the modern game, that's not really the case. \n\"Particularly in the Premier League, the pitch quality is exceptional and the grounds teams are very good. There's more research needed to see if there is any link.\"\nRodger said it was unknown if there was \"a very subtle difference between what is optimal for the men's game and what is for the women's game\", but the volume of matches played in shared stadiums was no doubt a contributing factor in reducing the quality of surfaces.\n\"Arsenal Women play a lot of matches at the Emirates and the grounds team will prepare the pitch to the exact same high standard as they would for the men,\" he added. \n\"But whether it's men's or women's, the more games you play on a pitch, the more wear and tear it takes and the more the quality of the pitch is going to be impacted. \n\"More usage means more maintenance needed. That is a factor.\"\nHaving coached in the Women's Super League and on the international stage, West Ham boss Rehanne Skinner has experienced a number of pitch surfaces.\nBut she believed it was not the type of surface, but how you manage the quality of the pitches which was the most important factor to consider. \n\"It's got to be about investment into the quality of the pitch or how you manage stadiums independently to reduce the volume of games on them,\" added Skinner. \n\"We groundshare in a lot of instances and that means the pitches take a lot - TV masks some of it. When you're actually standing on them, they look very different. \n\"I think the bottom line is, it is down to the volume of games on the pitch. That definitely needs to be something that's addressed.\"\nFormer Chelsea and England defender Claire Rafferty suffered anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in her career - and believed the pitch was a contributing factor.\nWhile the 36-year-old admitted it was not something she thought about while playing, Rafferty said the idea that the pitches male players currently play on may not be optimal for women was an \"interesting concept\". \n\"The only limitation is we're trying to improve the standard of the game in general, so do we increase barriers to entry if we have women-only pitches?\" Rafferty told BBC Sport. \n\"When we're looking at grassroots, are we limiting access? Yes, there needs to be research, but there is that argument too.\n\"My ideal pitch would be a grass pitch. If we get into the details of the grass length, that can have an impact as well. \n\"If the grass is too long, then you're at risk of the boots getting stuck and non-contact injuries. But if it's too short and dry then you don't have that balance there.\"\nFormer Scotland international Jen Beattie played at the Emirates Stadium regularly with Arsenal\nFormer Scotland and Arsenal defender Jen Beattie said there were \"so many different factors\" that could contribute to injury, but playing surfaces should not be the primary focus.\nThree major names, Vivianne Miedema, Beth Mead and Leah Williamson, suffered ACL injuries while playing for the Gunners, and Chelsea striker Sam Kerr is not expected back until April 2025 after being sidelined since January 2024.\n\"It's hard to pinpoint one thing and I think separating men and women and playing on different pitches just makes the games go even further apart rather than looking at other things that I think are more important,\" Beattie told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"If we're talking about ACLs, that comes from more conditioning and physicality. There needs to be more research into women's health because we are just different.\n\"That's a proven fact. The priority needs to be looking at that rather than playing on different pitches. I've no idea how logistically that would work.\"\nA number of clubs now track players' menstrual cycles following recent studies linking periods to ACL injuries. \nThere has also been research carried out by organisations such as the European Club Association (ECA) on how varying footwear can contribute to injury risk.\n\"I think there needs to be more research specifically for women,\" said ex-England striker Ellen White, who suffered an ACL injury during her career.\n\"Women are built slightly differently with childbearing hips, or you are on your period, so your ligaments are slightly looser.\n\"But I feel there needs to be more research into exactly why certain movements happen or more strength and conditioning to help with the muscles in and around the knee.\n\"I was unlucky, I went for a couple of challenges and my knee just gave out. I don't think there was an overarching reason why. It was just luck of the draw.\"\nHead here to get involved\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "Lesotho was slapped with the White House's highest tariff rates in the list released by US President Donald Trump on Wednesday.\nAmericans bringing goods in from the small southern African country will have to pay an additional 50% import tax.\nThe US has a big trade deficit with Lesotho, which sells textiles \u2013 including jeans \u2013 and diamonds to America.\nThe 50% rate for Lesotho was part of what Trump described as \"reciprocal tariffs\" imposed on imports from dozens of countries, including 20 in Africa. All nations face a minimum rate of 10%.\nResponding to the news, Lesotho's Trade Minister Mokhethi Shelile said his government would send a delegation to Washington to argue against the new trade measure.\n\"My biggest concern was the immediate closure of factories and job losses,\" the AFP news agency quotes him as telling journalists on Thursday.\nOne of Trump's aims with his tariff announcement is to reduce his country's trade deficit with the rest of the world.\nAnd this gives a clue as to why Lesotho has been hit so hard.\nAccording to White House figures, in 2024 while the US exported just $2.8m (\u00a32.1m) worth of goods to Lesotho, its imports from the southern African country amounted to $237.3m.\nIn their calculations, US officials used the difference between the value of imports and exports in setting the tariff rates for different countries.\nIn recent years, Lesotho has been successful in selling textiles to the US, making the most of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa). This US legislation from 2000 allowed eligible African countries to send some goods to the US without having tariffs slapped on them.\nSigned into law by President Bill Clinton, Agoa was intended to help African countries grow their economies and create jobs, but these tariffs appear to threaten its future.\nLesotho's garment factories have made jeans for major American brands such as Levi's and Wrangler in recent years.\nClothes make up nearly three-quarters of what Lesotho exports to the US \u2013 its second biggest trading partner after South Africa.\nThe value of that US trade amounts to more than 10% of its total annual national income. The extra costs that the tariffs will incur for American buyers could reduce demand and therefore have a big impact on Lesotho's economy.\n\"This has been a devastating day for us,\" Teboho Kobeli, founder of Lesotho clothes manufacturer Afri-Expo Textiles, told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.\nHe said he had spent the day in talks with industry colleagues and the government about what to do next. \nWhile his business, which Mr Kobeli says employs around 2,000 people, can look for other markets, the US is so significant  that \"we can't just shelve the US market... we need to do everything we can to bring [it] back\".\nColette van der Ven, a lawyer who specialises in international trade, told the BBC that the 50% figure Trump has imposed on Lesotho \"makes little sense logically\".\nShe described it as \"ironic\" that the US was effectively punishing Lesotho for the success it has enjoyed under Agoa.\n\"It's this sense that the US is being taken advantage of because it's running a trade deficit. It's really reflective of a new ideology about trade and who is benefiting and who is not\".\nOther African countries hit with extra tariffs include 47% for Madagascar, 40% for Mauritius, 37% for Botswana and 30% for South Africa.\nNigerian exports will be hit too - at a rate of 14%.\nKenya, Ghana, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Senegal and Liberia were among those countries whose exports to the US will be subject to the baseline tariff of 10%. The US is not running a trade deficit with these countries.\n\nTrump said the reciprocal tariffs were \"for countries that treat us badly\".\nDuring Wednesday's announcement at the White House, the Republican president said that the US had been taken advantage of by \"cheaters\" and had been \"pillaged\" by foreigners.\n\"Our taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, but it is not going to happen any more,\" Trump said.\nSouth Africa is on the long list of countries dubbed the \"worst offenders\", which also includes China, Japan and the European Union. These now face higher US rates - payback for unfair trade policies, Trump said.\n\"They have got some bad things going on in South Africa. You know, we are paying them billions of dollars, and we cut the funding because a lot of bad things are happening in South Africa,\" he said, before going on to name other countries.\nUS-South Africa relations have become increasingly strained since the start of the Trump presidency in January.\nSouth Africa's biggest export to the US is platinum, which may be exempted from the import tax. But its second biggest export - cars - will be hit hard.\nIn a statement, the South African presidency condemned the new tariffs as \"punitive\", saying they could \"serve as a barrier to trade and shared prosperity\".\n\"We now have to look amongst ourselves and say, within the customs union in southern Africa... how we're going to respond to these issues,\" South Africa's Trade Minister Parks Tau is quoted by AFP as saying.\n\"Diversifying our trade is going to be important... enhancing our work on the African continent and collaborating,\" he said.\nThe White House released a list of roughly 100 countries and the tariff rates that the US would impose on what Trump dubbed \"liberation day\" for the American people.\nTrump added 34% to the existing 20% duties on all Chinese imports to the US, making it the highest rate globally.\nIn addition, Trump imposed a 25% tariff on all foreign-made cars.\nThe US is expected to start charging the 10% tariffs on 5 April, with the higher duties for certain nations starting on 9 April.\nAfrican countries like South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya have long-standing trade relations with the US, and the new tariffs could significantly affect existing economic ties.\nAnnabel Bishop, chief economist at Investec, a South Africa-based banking and investment firm, believes the impact will be \"very negative\".\nBut she told the BBC that the tariffs could accelerate the current shift in Africa's trading practices.\n\"What we would expect to see is greater trade with the Global South, where possible, [there] is likely to be some switching in trade partners.\"\nThe tariffs also come in as many African countries are already grappling with the effects of US foreign aid cuts, which provided health and humanitarian assistance to vulnerable nations.\nTrump announced the aid freeze on his first day in office in January as part of a review into the US government spending.\nAdditional reporting by Basillioh Rukanga, Mayeni Jones and Cecilia Macaulay\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs - or import taxes - for nearly every country in the world could push prices up on almost all the staples Americans routinely buy, from clothes to coffee.\nAfter declaring a national economic emergency on Wednesday, the US president announced new tariffs on billions of dollars of goods of at least 10%. For countries he has deemed the \"worst offenders\", the rates can go as high as 50%. They start taking effect on 5 April.\nEconomists have warned the new levies - and those that other countries impose in retaliation - could push prices up for Americans across the board, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has said that they will increase inflation.\nThat's because the companies importing the goods may pass the costs of the tariffs on to customers or simply bring fewer products into the country, creating a limited supply.\nHere are six everyday items that could become more expensive for American consumers.\nThe \"worst offenders\" about to be hit with the highest tariffs include the clothing manufacturing hubs of Vietnam, China and Bangladesh. The three - among the top five largest apparel importers to the US - could soon see levies ranging from 34% to 46% charged on their products.\nThat means major US department stores like Target and Walmart, where Americans often turn for affordable clothing, and some familiar apparel brands may feel the pressure.\nThe Gap, an American clothing retailer that also operates Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta, sources about 21% of its clothing from Vietnam, according to an analysis by Prof Sheng Lu at the University of Delaware's Fashion & Apparel Studies department. Another 37% of its clothing comes from India, Indonesia and Bangladesh.\nH&M, known for its inexpensive fashions, manufactures most of its clothing in China and Bangladesh.\nThe tariffs could bring an \"unfair burden to American families, particularly lower-income households\", warned the US Fashion Industry Association in a statement on Wednesday.\nVietnam is open to working out a deal with the administration to avoid the tariffs, Trump has said. China, on the other hand, has retaliated with its own steep levies.\nAlmost all of the coffee consumed in the US comes from outside the country, meaning it could soon become a bigger burden on Americans' wallets.\nThe US mostly sources its coffee from Brazil and Colombia, which are subject to the baseline 10% tariffs. Vietnam is also a key exporter of certain varieties.\nWalter Haas, owner of San Francisco-based coffee roastery Graffeo, told the Washington Post that once tariffs hit, his company will feel it \"immediately\". \nIf they remain in place, those cost increases will be \"permanently baked into the price consumers pay\", he added.\nOther imported foods could similarly rise in price, especially those coming from European Union nations, who will all be hit by a 20% tariff. Prices of shelf staples such as olive oil, which is primarily imported from Italy, Spain and Greece, could rise further.\nShoes and trainers, among the most basic necessities and also one of Americans' biggest splurges, could become more expensive, including the popular Nike Air Force 1 and Adidas Samba trainers. Both sportswear companies rely heavily on Asian factory hubs for their inventories.\nAbout half of Nike and 39% of Adidas trainers are made in Vietnam.\nIn 2024, the US imported more than $27bn of footwear, mostly from China and Vietnam, which was subject to tariffs of about $3bn, according to data by Prof Lu. \nNow, that tax amount could nearly triple.\nUBS analysts told Reuters that, all in all, retailers may not be able to fully swallow the costs, and would need to raise prices by 10% to 12% to offset the levies on Vietnamese manufacturers.\nFrance is one of the biggest foreign suppliers of wine to the US, and its winemakers have expressed anxiety about what the 20% EU tariffs will mean for their business.\nThe Bourgogne Wine Board, which represents producers in the French region of Burgundy, said the US tariffs would deliver \"a serious blow\" to both exporters and American consumers.\n\"The risk with these additional tariffs is that they could push our wines past a psychological price threshold,\" warned Laurent Delaunay, president of the Bourgogne Wine Board - meaning above what buyers feel comfortable paying.\nPrice increases could be seen at restaurants, especially for imported beers or drinks using foreign spirits. Separately, Trump expanded an aluminium tariff to include all canned beer, which could also make it more expensive for those who stay home.\nUBS analysts told Reuters that large alcohol sellers would have to hike prices up to 5% to cover the tariffs if they choose not to absorb the costs themselves.\nCell phones, TVs and video game consoles tend to be big-ticket purchases, and the latest US tariffs could make them even bigger.\nChina, as well as Taiwan and South Korea, are all top exporters of electronics to the US.\nAlmost all iPhones are made in China, although some are also made in India (which, too, is on the \"worst offenders\" list with a 26% tariff). Samsung, meanwhile, has significant production operations in Vietnam.\nIt's still unclear how these major tech companies will respond to the new levies. But Japanese video gaming company Nintendo announced on Friday that it is delaying pre-orders of its Switch 2 console, saying it needs to \"assess the potential impact of tariffs.\"\nAmericans may soon find that loading up fast-fashion hauls from Chinese online retailers like Temu or Shein with a few swipes on their phones has gotten more expensive.\nAlong with imposing the country-level tariffs, Trump has signed an executive order ending an exemption that prevented charging the levies on small-dollar shipments from China. \nThe exemption is referred to as the \"de minimis\" loophole, and it had allowed shipments under $800 (\u00a3620) to enter the US duty-free. Experts say it was a big reason why Temu and Shein were able to keep their costs low.\nThe order means those companies may have to pay taxes for the first time on the clothes they often send directly to customers.\nIt is unclear just how much costs for these goods could rise with the elimination of the loophole, but the White House says small shipments sent to the US through the international postal network could be subject to a tax of \"either 30% of their value, or $25 per item.\"\nThat tax would then increase to $50 per item after 1 June, according to the White House.",

        "article_text": "England Women's captain Leah Williamson suffered an ACL injury when Arsenal faced Manchester United, which ruled her out of the 2023 World Cup\nA number of high-profile injuries have occurred in women's football in recent years - but could the type of pitches they play on be a contributing factor?\nThat is a question Brighton chief executive officer Paul Barber asked last week and he welcomed research into his theory. \nThe Seagulls hope to build a new purpose-built stadium for the women's team by 2027-28 and are exploring all scientific research to make facilities the best.\nThat includes finding out whether pitch surfaces designed for male athletes are adequate for females. If not, what is the best solution?\nFemale footballers might need 'different pitch type' to cut injury risk\nMost top-tier football pitches are now hybrid, which means they are essentially a synthetic mat through which real grass can grow. \nThese pitches feel like natural grass but can be regrown each year. They are also hard-wearing, which means they can be drained and recovered to play football on. \nHowever, most of these pitches - which are used predominantly in the men's Premier League - are made up of 95% sand and 4-5% polyethylene fibres to help reduce waterlogging. \nWomen's Super League teams use a variety of grounds across the season but all pitches meet the minimum elite standards required by the league licence. \nBrighton's Broadfield Stadium is one of the only natural grass surfaces in the WSL, with most clubs playing on a hybrid pitch. \nArsenal, Aston Villa and Leicester City use their male counterparts' stadiums as their main home pitch, as well as occasionally playing at secondary grounds.\nWest Ham were the only WSL club not to play a match at their men's team stadium last season. \nThe Bescot Stadium - home of League Two Walsall FC - is used for Villa's matches in the Women's League Cup and FA Cup and was recently renovated.\nCrystal Palace, who earned promotion from the Women's Championship, play the majority of their matches on the VBS Community Stadium and the pitch was replaced with a new hybrid surface this season. \nAnd Leicester City's second pitch - Burton Albion's Pirelli Stadium - is an artificial grass pitch and is only used when there are scheduling clashes.\nBrighton Women play some WSL matches at the Amex Stadium\nWhile little research has been carried out regarding pitches for female athletes specifically, plenty of data has been gathered in football generally. \nEverything from traction, the hardness of the surface, how high the ball bounces, how far the ball rolls and shock absorption have been looked into. \nNeil Rodger, the principal consultant at STRI Group - a company working in the development of sports surfaces - admitted more research was needed to see if there was any link to increased injury risk in female footballers and certain pitches.\n\"It's never been broken down into men's football and women's football. We've always just designed football pitches,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"When you think about injuries in the men's or women's game, there are so many factors that contribute - the training load, sleep, physiology, hormones...\n\"The pitch is a factor, it's in the mix. Historically, in the women's and men's game, there have been unsafe pitches. In the modern game, that's not really the case. \n\"Particularly in the Premier League, the pitch quality is exceptional and the grounds teams are very good. There's more research needed to see if there is any link.\"\nRodger said it was unknown if there was \"a very subtle difference between what is optimal for the men's game and what is for the women's game\", but the volume of matches played in shared stadiums was no doubt a contributing factor in reducing the quality of surfaces.\n\"Arsenal Women play a lot of matches at the Emirates and the grounds team will prepare the pitch to the exact same high standard as they would for the men,\" he added. \n\"But whether it's men's or women's, the more games you play on a pitch, the more wear and tear it takes and the more the quality of the pitch is going to be impacted. \n\"More usage means more maintenance needed. That is a factor.\"\nHaving coached in the Women's Super League and on the international stage, West Ham boss Rehanne Skinner has experienced a number of pitch surfaces.\nBut she believed it was not the type of surface, but how you manage the quality of the pitches which was the most important factor to consider. \n\"It's got to be about investment into the quality of the pitch or how you manage stadiums independently to reduce the volume of games on them,\" added Skinner. \n\"We groundshare in a lot of instances and that means the pitches take a lot - TV masks some of it. When you're actually standing on them, they look very different. \n\"I think the bottom line is, it is down to the volume of games on the pitch. That definitely needs to be something that's addressed.\"\nFormer Chelsea and England defender Claire Rafferty suffered anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in her career - and believed the pitch was a contributing factor.\nWhile the 36-year-old admitted it was not something she thought about while playing, Rafferty said the idea that the pitches male players currently play on may not be optimal for women was an \"interesting concept\". \n\"The only limitation is we're trying to improve the standard of the game in general, so do we increase barriers to entry if we have women-only pitches?\" Rafferty told BBC Sport. \n\"When we're looking at grassroots, are we limiting access? Yes, there needs to be research, but there is that argument too.\n\"My ideal pitch would be a grass pitch. If we get into the details of the grass length, that can have an impact as well. \n\"If the grass is too long, then you're at risk of the boots getting stuck and non-contact injuries. But if it's too short and dry then you don't have that balance there.\"\nFormer Scotland international Jen Beattie played at the Emirates Stadium regularly with Arsenal\nFormer Scotland and Arsenal defender Jen Beattie said there were \"so many different factors\" that could contribute to injury, but playing surfaces should not be the primary focus.\nThree major names, Vivianne Miedema, Beth Mead and Leah Williamson, suffered ACL injuries while playing for the Gunners, and Chelsea striker Sam Kerr is not expected back until April 2025 after being sidelined since January 2024.\n\"It's hard to pinpoint one thing and I think separating men and women and playing on different pitches just makes the games go even further apart rather than looking at other things that I think are more important,\" Beattie told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"If we're talking about ACLs, that comes from more conditioning and physicality. There needs to be more research into women's health because we are just different.\n\"That's a proven fact. The priority needs to be looking at that rather than playing on different pitches. I've no idea how logistically that would work.\"\nA number of clubs now track players' menstrual cycles following recent studies linking periods to ACL injuries. \nThere has also been research carried out by organisations such as the European Club Association (ECA) on how varying footwear can contribute to injury risk.\n\"I think there needs to be more research specifically for women,\" said ex-England striker Ellen White, who suffered an ACL injury during her career.\n\"Women are built slightly differently with childbearing hips, or you are on your period, so your ligaments are slightly looser.\n\"But I feel there needs to be more research into exactly why certain movements happen or more strength and conditioning to help with the muscles in and around the knee.\n\"I was unlucky, I went for a couple of challenges and my knee just gave out. I don't think there was an overarching reason why. It was just luck of the draw.\"\nHead here to get involved\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "The list of would-be buyers for TikTok in the US - both rumoured and confirmed - has grown longer as the deadline for deciding its future looms.\nThe social media giant faces being shut down in the US unless it sells to an American company by 5 April.\nThe runners and riders range from US tech giants to the British entrepreneur dubbed \"the king of homemade porn\".\nHowever, TikTok and its Chinese owner, ByteDance have still not confirmed they are willing to do a deal.\nThey also continue to reject the reason for the sale - that the US considers their ties to the Chinese government a national security threat.\nIt is also not clear what exactly would be sold, in particular what would happen to TikTok's algorithim, which decides what content to expose users to, and is considered a big reason for its success.\n\"TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand - it's simply not as powerful,\" said Kelsey Chickering, principal analyst at Forrester Research.\nDespite all this uncertainty, Ms Chickering said it was unlikely the app would go offline in the US as it briefly did in January.\n\"It is highly unlikely that TikTok will go dark again. All signs point to a deal or another extension.\"\nVice President JD Vance told Fox News on Thursday that the Trump administration was set to announce a deal ahead of the Saturday deadline.\n\"I think that we're in a good place. We're going to keep on working at it,\" he said.\nAs with everything else to do with the app's future, who exactly is attempting to buy  it is cloaked in uncertainty.\nAccording to the New York Times, Amazon recently sent a letter to the US Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expressing interest.\nAmazon declined to comment when approached by BBC News. \nAnother late-stage bid reportedly came from an app marketing and analytics company called AppLovin.\nThey have remained similarly tight-lipped on the speculation, though - at least in public. \nA third last-minute bidder includes the man once called \"the king of homemade porn\" by the Sunday Times - British OnlyFans founder Tim Stokely.\nHis proposed bid - and all the media attention which comes with it - happens to coincide with the relaunch of a company he co-founded in 2022.\nOne confirmed bidder is Perplexity, an AI search startup which counts Amazon's Jeff Bezos among its backers.\nThe company recently published its \"vision\" for what its version of TikTok would look like for America.\nAnother potential investor is Frank McCourt, who founded the Project Liberty organisation in 2021, which aims to give more power to internet users. \nHe says he would scrap the current algorithm in favour of a far more open version where users have more control over what they see on the platform.\nAlso part of this bid are Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary.\nAccording to the Financial Times, a consortium of American businesses is close to getting US government endorsement for a bid - though of course it is up to ByteDance, not the White House, whether they sell or not.\nThe group includes Trump loyalist Marc Andreessen and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.\nOracle already handles the data for TikTok in the US.There are a number of other potential bids which have been mentioned by Donald Trump when he has been asked.\nHe has said, in responses to questions from reporters, that Elon Musk may be interested in getting hold of TikTok, and has also mentioned Microsoft in the past.\nMicrosoft had a bid rejected in 2020 when the previous Tump administration explored a TikTok ban which never happened.\nYouTuber Jimmy Donaldson, or MrBeast to his millions of fans, has also said he's been contacted by a number of different groups trying to get him to be the face of a new bid.\nBut whoever ends up being picked by the White House to go forward with a bid will still have to get over the same huge hurdle: how do you buy a company that's not for sale?",

He says he would scrap the current algorithm in favour of a far more open version where users have more control over what they see on the platform.Also part of this bid are Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary.A bid from MrBeast?According to the Financial Times, a consortium of American businesses is close to getting US government endorsement for a bid - though of course it is up to ByteDance, not the White House, whether they sell or not.The group includes Trump loyalist Marc Andreessen and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.Oracle already handles the data for TikTok in the US.There are a number of other potential bids which have been mentioned by Donald Trump when he has been asked.He has said, in responses to questions from reporters, that Elon Musk may be interested in getting hold of TikTok, and has also mentioned Microsoft in the past.Microsoft had a bid rejected in 2020 when the previous Tump administration explored a TikTok ban which never happened.YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson, or MrBeast to his millions of fans, has also said he's been contacted by a number of different groups trying to get him to be the face of a new bid.But whoever ends up being picked by the White House to go forward with a bid will still have to get over the same huge hurdle: how do you buy a company that's not for sale? Vance confident TikTok will be sold in US as deadline looms2 days agoShareSaveImran Rahman-JonesTechnology reporterShareSaveGetty ImagesThe list of would-be buyers for TikTok in the US - both rumoured and confirmed - has grown longer as the deadline for deciding its future looms.The social media giant faces being shut down in the US unless it sells to an American company by 5 April.The runners and riders range from US tech giants to the British entrepreneur dubbed \"the king of homemade porn\".However, TikTok and its Chinese owner, ByteDance have still not confirmed they are willing to do a deal.They also continue to reject the reason for the sale - that the US considers their ties to the Chinese government a national security threat.It is also not clear what exactly would be sold, in particular what would happen to TikTok's algorithim, which decides what content to expose users to, and is considered a big reason for its success. A third last-minute bidder includes the man once called \"the king of homemade porn\" by the Sunday Times - British OnlyFans founder Tim Stokely.His proposed bid - and all the media attention which comes with it - happens to coincide with the relaunch of a company he co-founded in 2022.How the proposed and then shelved TikTok ban affected US influencersOne confirmed bidder is Perplexity, an AI search startup which counts Amazon's Jeff Bezos among its backers.The company recently published its \"vision\" for what its version of TikTok would look like for America.Another potential investor is Frank McCourt, who founded the Project Liberty organisation in 2021, which aims to give more power to internet users. \"TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand - it's simply not as powerful,\" said Kelsey Chickering, principal analyst at Forrester Research.Despite all this uncertainty, Ms Chickering said it was unlikely the app would go offline in the US as it briefly did in January.",

        "article_text": "Last year, on 17 September, at around 15:30, a pager which a nurse called Adam was given at the start of his shift at a hospital in Lebanon received a message. The devices had been distributed by Hezbollah, the Shia Muslim group, to thousands of its members, including Adam, and he said it was how he and his colleagues expected to be alerted of emergencies or a disaster.\n\"The pager started beeping non-stop and, on the screen, it said 'alert',\" Adam, who did not want to use his real name for safety reasons, said. The text appeared to have been sent by the group's leadership. To read it, he had to press two buttons, simultaneously, with both hands. Adam did it many times, but the beeps continued. \"Then suddenly, as I was sitting at my desk,\" he said, \"the pager exploded\".\nOn his phone, Adam showed me a video of the room, filmed by a colleague minutes after he was rescued. There was a trail of blood on the floor. \"I tried to crawl to the door because I had locked it while I changed my clothes,\" he said. The blast had opened a hole in the wood desk. I noticed a beige-like object. \"That's my finger,\" he said.\nHezbollah is known for being a powerful militia and is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US. But in Lebanon, it is also a significant political movement with representation in parliament and a social organisation. Here, being a Hezbollah member does not necessarily mean you are a fighter. In fact, many are not. Adam told me he had never been one. People can work in the group's large array of institutions that include hospitals and emergency services, for example.\nHezbollah had decided to equip members with low-tech pagers for communicating rather than smartphones which it feared could be used by Israel, its arch-enemy, to gather sensitive information about the group. It turned out, though, that the devices which Hezbollah had distributed were part of a years-long elaborate Israeli plan: an explosive compound had been concealed within the pagers, waiting to be activated \u2013 and that is what happened on that day.\nIn the attack, Adam, who is 38, lost his thumb and two fingers on his left hand, and part of a finger on the other. He was blinded in his right eye, which has been replaced with a glass eye, and has only partial sight in the other. He showed me a picture of him in a hospital bed, taken an hour after the explosion, with his face burned, entirely blooded, covered with bandages. Despite his wounds, Adam remained committed to Hezbollah. I asked him how he felt when he looked at himself like that. \"Very good,\" he said in English. Then, in Arabic, he told me: \"Because we believe that the wounds are a kind of medal from God. Honouring what we go through fighting a righteous cause.\"\nBut the group is no longer the force it was since being dealt a devastating blow in Israel's bombing campaign and invasion of Lebanon, which followed the pager attacks, and faces serious challenges. At home, there is discontent among some supporters over the lack of funds for reconstruction, while the new government has vowed to disarm the group. In neighbouring Syria, the ouster of Bashar al-Assad's regime has disrupted the route used by Iran, its main supporter, for the supply of weapons and money.\nI visited communities in southern Lebanon that were destroyed by Israel's attacks, and saw that support for Hezbollah appeared undimmed. But, in views rarely expressed to media, others who backed it said the war had been a mistake, and even questioned the group's future as a military force.\nYou can listen to more from Hugo in his radio documentary - Crossing Continents: Hezbollah in trouble - here\nHezbollah, or Party of God, was created in the 1980s in response to Israel's occupation of Lebanon during the Lebanese civil war. To this day, the destruction of Israel remains one of its official goals. Their last war had been in 2006, which was followed by years of relative calm. Violence flared up again in 2023 after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. When Israel started bombarding Gaza, Hezbollah began firing rockets in around northern Israel, saying it was acting in support of Palestinians. Israel responded with air strikes on southern Lebanon, and tens of thousands of people were forced to flee on both sides of the border.\nThe pager attacks were a turning point in what had been, until then, an intensifying but relatively contained conflict. The devices exploded as people were working, shopping or at home. About a dozen people, including two children, were killed, and thousands wounded, many of them maimed. The attack caused anger in Lebanon, because of what was seen as its indiscriminate nature. A day later, walkie-talkies used by the group suddenly exploded too. I was at a funeral of some of the victims of the pagers when there was a loud blast. Hezbollah members, desperate, asked us to turn off our cameras or phones, as no-one knew what else could explode.\nIn the following weeks, Israel carried out a relentless bombing campaign and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. Across the country, around 4,000 people were killed and almost 18,000 others wounded. For Hezbollah, the conflict proved to be catastrophic. The group's top leaders were assassinated, many of its fighters killed and much of its arsenal destroyed. Among the dead was Hassan Nasrallah, who had been the head of Hezbollah for more than 30 years, assassinated in a massive air strike on the group's secret headquarters under apartment blocks in the Dahieh, where Hezbollah is based in Beirut.\nAt the end of November, battered, the group agreed on a ceasefire that was essentially a surrender.\nSouthern Lebanon is the heartland of Lebanon's Shia Muslim community, which is the bulk of Hezbollah's support base, and one of the regions of the country where the group has traditionally had a significant presence. I travelled to the border town of Kfar Kila, which had a pre-war population of 15,000 and was one of the first to fall when Israel invaded. Israel's stated war goal was to allow the return of residents to its northern communities, which had been emptied because of Hezbollah's attacks. In Kfar Kila, there was almost nothing left standing, and yellow Hezbollah flags dotted the huge piles of broken concrete and twisted metal.\nA 37-year-old woman called Alia had come with her husband and three daughters, aged 18, 14 and 10. The youngest was wearing a badge with a smiley picture of Nasrallah. \"I only knew that this was my house because of the remains of this plant over there, the roses, and this tree,\" Alia told me. From the street, she pointed at what she could identify in the rubble. \"This is the couch. There, the curtains. That was the living room. And that was the bedroom. That's my daughter's bicycle,\" she said. \"There's nothing to recover\".\nAccording to the World Bank, costs related to reconstruction and recovery are estimated at $11bn (\u00a38.5bn) across the country. One of Hezbollah's immediate challenges is to give financial help to people affected by the war, which is crucial to keep supporters on board. Those who lost their houses have received $12,000 to cover for a year's rent. But the group has not promised money to rebuild what was destroyed or to give compensation for destroyed businesses. The limited support is already fuelling discontent. Aila's shop had stock worth $20,000, and she was concerned no-one would cover her losses.\nIran, Hezbollah's backer, is one of the group's main sources of funds, weapons and training. But Lebanon's international allies want to cut off any financial support from Iran, to put even more pressure on Hezbollah, and say there will be no help if the Lebanese government does not act against Hezbollah. With the group weakened militarily, critics see this as a unique opportunity to disarm it.\nAlia told me: \"We don't want any aid that comes with conditions about our arms... We won't allow them to take our dignity, our honour, take away our arms just for us to build a house. We'll build it ourselves.\"\nIt is not surprising that Hezbollah's supporters remain defiant. For many, the group is a fundamental part of their lives, essential in their identities. But Hezbollah's power is seen - and felt - beyond its base. Before the war, its military wing was considered to be stronger than the Lebanese national army. A solid parliamentary bloc means that virtually no major decision has been possible without Hezbollah's consent. Because of Lebanon's fractured political system, the group has representation in the government. In short, Hezbollah has had the ability to paralyse the state, and many times has done so.\nBut the war has diminished the group's domestic position too. In January, the Lebanese parliament elected a new president, former army chief Joseph Aoun, after a two-year impasse that critics had blamed on Hezbollah. In the past, its MPs and allies would walk out of the chamber when a vote was scheduled. But Hezbollah, severely wounded and with its communities in need of help, felt it could no longer block the process, which was seen as vital to unlock some international support. In his inauguration speech, Aoun promised to make the Lebanese army the sole carrier of weapons in the country. He did not mention Hezbollah, but everyone understood the message.\nUltimately, Hezbollah's future may lie with Iran. One of the reasons for Iran to have a strong Hezbollah in Lebanon was to deter any Israeli attack, especially on its nuclear facilities. This is now gone. Other groups backed by Iran in the region, part of what it calls the Axis of Resistance, have also been significantly weakened, including Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen. And the fall of the Assad regime in Syria has interrupted Iran's land corridor to Lebanon - and Hezbollah. Even if Iran decides to rearm Hezbollah, it will not be easy.\nNasrallah has been succeeded by Naim Qassem, his former deputy, who is not seen as charismatic or influential. From time to time, rumours emerge of internal disagreements. And whispers of dissent among the rank and file are spreading. In southern Lebanon, I met a businessman who did not want to have his name published, fearing that he could become a target on social media. On the wall of his office, he had pictures of Hezbollah's leaders. Now, he was critical of the group.\n\"The mistakes have been huge,\" he said. \"Hezbollah decided to engage in a war to support Gaza without proper calculations, without consulting the people or the Lebanese state\". (To date, Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.) He told me a lot of supporters shared his view. \"If Hezbollah don't do a proper reassessment of the situation... they will destroy themselves and harm us along the way. We brought this destruction on ourselves, and we're now suffering\".\nAs part of the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah agreed to remove its weapons and fighters from southern Lebanon, and a Western diplomatic official told me the group had largely done it. Israel was required to withdraw its troops, but has remained in five positions, saying this is needed for the safety of its border communities. The Israeli military has also carried out air strikes on targets and people it says are linked to Hezbollah. Lebanon says the Israeli permanence in Lebanese territory and its attacks are violations of the deal.\nDiscussions about Hezbollah's disarmament are likely to be difficult and long. A source familiar with the group told me one of the options was for Hezbollah's arsenal, believed to still include long-range missiles, to be put under the control of the state, while its fighters, estimated to be several thousand, could be integrated into the Lebanese army.\nThe businessman told me: \"A lot of the families, especially those of wounded and martyred fighters, are totally dependent on Hezbollah. These people won't disengage from Hezbollah immediately\u2026 Without a plan, it would be a recipe for internal conflict. It would drive Lebanese to fight against each other\".\nFor weeks, I tried to interview a representative from Hezbollah, but no-one was made available.\nAdam, the pager casualty, has now returned to his work as a nurse. He no longer does nightshifts, however, as he cannot see well. The explosion also left shrapnel in head and chest. As he gets tired easily, he needs to take constant breaks to rest. Physiotherapy sessions are helping him adapt to using what is left of his left thumb and middle finger.\nProminent in his living room, is a picture he framed, of himself, with his injured hands, holding a pager. He shared with me another picture, of his maimed hand, only now it also bore a tattooed message which expressed that his wounds were a cheap sacrifice in honour of Nasrallah, the late Hezbollah leader. He, like many, still believes in the group's purpose, and the role it plays.",

Trump has argued that the US has spent $300-$350bn on such aid, while the US Department of Defense said $182.8bn had been \"appropriated\" - a figure that covers US military training in Europe and replenishment of US defence stocks - for Operation Atlantic Resolve.\nThe US has also been attempting to reach a deal for access to Ukrainian minerals as part of negotiations to end the war.

Yes, use it to motivate you. But please don't look at [my content] and think less of yourself, because if that's happening, then I would suggest you turn away.\"\nFellow influencer Emily Jones, from Ammanford, said she tried to be \"100% transparent\" when sharing time-saving cleaning tips with her more than 13k Instagram followers.\n\"It tends to be this daily thing of resetting the house, and cleaning and tidying,\" said the 32-year-old mum-of-two.\n\"I try and do stuff where if I've got half an hour or I've got an hour where the baby's napping, I'm like 'right, I'm just going to do half an hour' because to me that's what keeps it real and that's what's realistic. \n\"You can't clean all day. It's just impossible.\n\"I'm a mum. I'm trying to work at the same time. I've got two young kids. I've got all the things everybody else has going on in their lives.\"\nThere are more than 11m posts on Instagram under the hashtag #cleaning and more than 2.6m for #reset.\nWith almost 2m followers across Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and YouTube, 30-year-old Roo Day, from Hertfordshire, is one of the most high-profile cleaning influencers in the UK.\nRoo shares videos of what she calls \"one hour speed cleans\", where she sets herself a 60-minute timer and attempts to get as much cleaning done as possible.\n\"Genuinely to my core I would rather be spending the least amount of time cleaning possible, and I feel like people do also feel that way as well,\" said Roo.\nRoo said the majority of cleaning social media content was created by women, but that a growing number of male influencers were getting involved too.\n\"I don't think it's mega empowering that I am doing all of this cleaning,\" she said.\n\"[But] it just so happens that the split in my household means that I do a little bit more of the cleaning, because I'm not out at a 9 to 5 job all day.\n\"If we're going to be talking about gender, it shouldn't just be women who are doing it.\n\"And there's so many male creators now that I watch. In fact, if I see a male and they're like 'reset with me', I'm locked in.\n\"I love the fact that it is still predominantly female, but a lot of men are getting into it now as well.\"\nDr Stephanie Alice Baker, an associate professor in sociology at City St George's University of London, said cleaning was a role that women had \"typically\" occupied.\nShe said creating social media content based upon cleaning therefore offered \"a sense of control\".\n\"They can monetise something they'd traditionally have completed as unpaid labour.\"\nDr Baker said that while lifestyle content was increasing in popularity, audience interest was not new.\n\"This type of content existed before social media, it's just that social media makes it a lot more accessible,\" she said.\n\"The mediums and the audiences have changed but the concerns around self-improvement have existed over generations.\"\nDr Ceri Bradshaw, a psychologist at Swansea University, said there was a risk that people could be \"easily tricked\" by snappy, 60-second cleaning videos that in reality take hours of physical work.\n\"I think we're also easily tricked into thinking that we should be more like the people that we watch,\" she added.\nBut Dr Bradshaw said she understood the appeal of watching cleaning content.\n\"With the cleaning, you're effectively sort of fixing something that needs fixing and it's happening very, very quickly.\n\"It's quite soothing to the brain.\"",

Cosmetic surgery is \"more normalised\", she added.\nSome of the growth in cosmetic surgery is also caused by people who previously had non-surgical procedures, like filler and Botox, now choosing to go under the knife because they were getting \"fatigue\" from repeatedly going to clinics to get the work done, Nugent said.\nAnd the rise of weight-loss injections such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro have played a role, too. Nugent said that some people taking these medications, also known as \"skinny jabs\", are getting surgery on their face.\n\"As they lose weight they start to notice deflation and some sagging of their face,\" she said.\nThe BAAPS statistics do not show how many people have surgery after taking weight-loss drugs, but Nugent said that of the patients she has treated, \"more and more\" are people taking the medications.\nPeople have cosmetic surgery for a wide range of reasons.\nKirsten White, 33, a talent acquisition specialist from Sheffield, had a breast reduction and uplift after losing weight with a gastric sleeve.\nShe said her \"breasts were basically down to my bellybutton\" before surgery, leading to backache and the need for physiotherapy, she said.\n\"I don't think people are surprised when I tell them I've had cosmetic surgery because I think it's pretty normal now,\" she said. \n\"There's not so much the stigma that there used to be that it's really taboo and people are a lot more supportive of doing what will make you feel happy.\"\nMen underwent 1,799 surgical procedures in 2024, a slight drop from 2023 - making up just 6.6% of all surgeries in the BAAPS dataset.\nNose jobs (rhinoplasty) remained the most popular among men, with 332 surgeries done in 2024, which is a 14% drop on 2023.\nFace and neck lifts increased by 26%, with 140 done in 2024, suggesting a growing interest in anti-aging procedures among men - though Nugent said it was harder to spot trends for men due to the smaller numbers treated.\nBeauty standards are shaped by social media and celebrity culture, said Dr Beth Daniels, director of the Centre for Appearance Research at UWE Bristol. \nThe pandemic also caused a shift, when the move towards video calls \"heightened our awareness of our appearance\" because people saw their own faces on their computer screens.\nDr Daniels said that society places value on youthful looks, which could push some women to get cosmetic procedures.\n\"As women age, they're often discounted in a number of ways\" and are \"made to feel invisible in society\", she said.\nBAAPS vice president Anthony Macquillan suggested the overall increase in facelifts could be linked to societal changes, such as the rising pension age.\nHe said: \"For many, this type of surgery is not just aesthetic but also functional, helping to maintain confidence, secure employment, and reduce anxiety associated with age-related bias.\"\nThe BAAPS data is based on statistics from 233 of its members. Jim Frame, president of the UK Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons and professor at Anglia Ruskin University, said that it does not cover all of the cosmetic surgery operations that happen in the UK because some is carried out by ENT and maxillofacial surgeons, or by non-BAAPS members, especially fillers and Botox.\nThe data also does not include surgeries carried out overseas, where the lower cost of treatment in countries like Turkey attracts Brits. \nCosmetic procedures and surgery carry risks and the NHS warns that they \"can lead to serious complications if they're not done correctly\". \nIt advises people to research thoroughly beforehand, including checking the credibility of the clinic and getting information about the most common complications of the procedure.\n\"There are a lot of susceptible people that are committing to surgeries that a fairly large proportion will regret,\" Prof Frame said.",

He's got a lot of style and is like a sponge when he's learning anything new.\"\nTo aid his training, the family are building a rail park at their property in the French ski resort of Avoriaz and split the winter season between France and the United States, where mum Jennifer was born.\n\"We were just casual snowboarders,\" Jennifer said. \"Now we chase the snow across the world!\" \nIn the summer months, the family are back in Nantwich in Cheshire and Sharpe trains at the Chill Factore in Manchester and Tamworth Snowdome.\nBrookes and her family live 10 miles away and Mia's mum Vicky has been advising the Sharpes on the number of competitions he should enter at his age - as well as keeping snowboarding fun.\nSharpe and Brookes, 18, have ridden together a number of times.

Lawyers say they expect more to come forward driven by the boom in cheap genetic testing and ancestry websites.\nA sharp, funny woman with shoulder-length white hair, Susan tells me her story from her sunny front room somewhere in southern England.\nHer husband is sitting next to her, jogging her memory and chipping in from time to time.\nAfter taking that DNA test almost a decade ago, the genealogy company entered her data into its vast family tree, allowing other users to make contact with their genetic relatives \u2013 close or distant.\nSix years later she received a message out of the blue.\nThe stranger said that his data matched hers in a way that could only mean one thing: he must be her genetic sibling.\n\"That was just panic. It was every emotion I could think of, my brain was all over the place,\" she says.\nSusan's first reaction was that she may have been secretly adopted. Both her parents had died some years before, so she plucked up the courage and asked her older brother.\nHe was sure the whole thing was a scam. His sister had always been part of his life, and he was \"absolutely certain\" that one of his first memories was of his mother being pregnant.\nSusan though still had her suspicions. She was slightly taller than her brother and, with her striking blonde hair, had never looked like the rest of family.\nHer eldest daughter did some digging and found a copy of all the births registered in the local area on the day her mother was born.\nThe next baby girl on the list, registered at the same NHS hospital, had the exact same surname as the man who had contacted her through the genealogy website.\nIt couldn't be a coincidence. The only possible explanation was a mistake or mix-up in that maternity ward more than seven decades ago.\nUntil recently cases like this were unheard of in the UK, although there have been a handful of examples in other countries.\nThe standard practice in the NHS today is to place two bands around babies' ankles immediately after birth and keep mother and child together through their hospital stay.\nIn the 1950s maternity care was very different. Babies were often separated, placed in large nursery rooms and cared for by midwives.\n\"The whole system was far less sophisticated back then,\" says Jason Tang, from the London law firm Russell Cooke, which is representing Susan.\n\"It may be that staff didn't attach a card or tag immediately, or that it simply fell off and was put back on the wrong baby or on the wrong crib.\"\nFrom the late 1940s the UK also saw a post-war baby boom putting more pressure on busy maternity services in the newly formed NHS.\nThis, of course, meant nothing to Susan for decades.\nShe grew up as part of a \"normal, working class\" household, met her husband and ended up working for the NHS herself in a \"hands-on\" clinical role.\nOther than \"a bit of the usual trauma\" in her teenage years, she remembers her parents as a \"very good, loving\" couple who \"did everything they could and always encouraged me\".\n\"In a way, I'm so glad they are not here anymore to see this,\" says Susan. \"If they are up there watching me, I really hope they don't know what's gone on.\"\nIf home DNA tests had been available earlier, she doesn't think she could have told them the truth \"because it would have been so awful\".\n\"But I really don't think that for me, anything has changed about them, they are still mum and dad,\" she says.\nOn the other hand, her relationship with the man she has always known as her older brother has, she thinks, been strengthened by what she's gone through.\n\"It's actually brought us closer together. Now we meet up more often and I get cards sent to 'my dear sister',\" she says.\n\"Both he and his wife have been absolutely fantastic, honestly I cannot praise them enough.\"\nShe remembers receiving another \"lovely letter\" from a cousin at the time who told her, \"Oh don't worry, you're still part of the family\".\nAs for her new blood relations, she says the situation has been more difficult.\nShe has met up with the man who contacted her, her biological sibling, and laughs as she remembers how similar they both looked.\n\"If you'd put a wig on him and a bit of makeup, it could honestly have been me,\" she jokes.\nShe has also seen photographs of the other woman who she was swapped with at birth, and her sons.\nBut building a relationship with that new side of her family has not been easy.\n\"I know they are my biological relatives but I didn't grow up with them so there's not that emotional connection there,\" she says.\n\"They closed ranks, basically, through loyalty to their sister which is admirable and I understand.\"\nSusan's genetic parents died some years ago but she's been told she looks like her biological mother.\n\"I'd still like to know a bit more about her \u2013 what she was like and all that \u2013 but I never will, so there you go,\" she says.\n\"But if I take the emotion out of it, and just think logically and clearly, I was better off how I grew up.\"\nSusan is one of the first to ever receive compensation - the amount is not being disclosed - in a case like this.\nShe needed to take a second DNA test before the NHS trust involved accepted its historic mistake and made a \"very lovely\" apology.\nLast year, the BBC reported on another decades-old case of babies swapped at birth, which again came to light after someone was given a DNA testing kit for Christmas.\nSusan says the settlement was never about money but the recognition a mistake had been made all those years ago.\n\"I suppose you always want someone to blame, don't you?\" she asks.\n\"But I know this will be with me for the rest of my life. I just wanted a conclusion.\"",

We already have people there. We'll have more people there. We'll help as much as we can [but] it's not the easiest place to work\u2026 they have a military junta that doesn't like us,\" Rubio said.\nOn Tuesday, a former USAID official told the BBC the shuttering of the agency, led by the billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk, meant the White House could not send teams from the US to save lives in the immediate aftermath of the 28 March magnitude 7.7 earthquake. \nThe confirmed death toll rose to 3,354 on 4 April, Myanmar's ruling military said. The number of injured stood at 4,508, while 220 were still missing.\nRoutinely in such earthquakes, the US can deploy up to 200 rescue workers and sniffer dogs along with specialist equipment, and is often the biggest and best equipment foreign response team on the ground. \nLast week, the state department said a US team of three advisers based in the region was being sent to disaster zone.\nSpeaking to reporters at a Nato meeting in Brussels,  Rubio blamed the military regime in Myanmar for the lack of access, even though the state department said earlier this week the country had made a formal request for assistance. \nFormer USAID officials say their work is seen as non-political, and they have previously accessed countries regarded as politically hostile.\n\"That would have impeded our response, no matter what,\" said Rubio.\n\"That said, we are willing to continue to help in the humanitarian crisis. Other countries need to do so as well. China is a very rich country. India is a rich country. There are a lot of other countries in the world, and everyone should pitch in.\"\nChina and India were among the first to have teams on the ground in Myanmar, according to former American humanitarian officials.\nRubio dismissed the accounts of humanitarian aid experts who said the inability to deploy a large US rescue team was due to the USAID cuts.\n\"These are people that make millions and hundreds of millions of dollars in these NGOs [non-governmental organisations] all over the world that stand up and they get flooded with the US taxpayer money, and then we have to spend 10 [or] 100 million dollars to get 10 million to people. We're not doing that anymore. Okay? We have stopped. We are no longer going to spend 10 million, 100 million dollars to get 10 million to recipients.\n\"We're not going to fund these global NGOs all over the world that are living off of this. We're not doing it.\n\"We are prepared to help and work with governments and appropriate NGOs on the ground that are delivering assistance. We will be there, and we will be helpful [but] there are a lot of other rich countries, they should also pitch in and help\u2026 we are going to do our part,\" Rubio added.\nAs news of the Myanmar earthquake emerged, the White House had reportedly tried to deploy a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) from the US - but could not do so because the Trump administration's cuts had cancelled logistics contracts and fired officials who oversaw such deployments, according to the former officials. \nThe cuts to USAID had been led by Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) after President Trump targeted foreign assistance on his first day in office, calling it an \"industry\" that was in many cases \"antithetical to American values\".",

        "article_text": "Once home to a thriving Jewish majority, Thessaloniki holds fragments of a lost world. One traveller's journey to find them leads to something even more powerful: living memory.\nAs my family admired the gleaming remodel of Thessaloniki's century-old Modiano Market, local culinary guide Smaragda Marki admitted to me that among the trendy cafes and German delicatessen, she wished it were just a little more Greek. \"I wish it were a little more Jewish,\" I responded, staring up at the colourful Easter decorations.\nThe newly reopened market had topped my list of places to go in Greece's second-largest city, bringing together my two favourite things to look for while travelling: good food and tidbits of Jewish history. However, Modiano left me dissatisfied on both counts. Though the building still bears the name of its Jewish architect and stands on the site of the former Talmud Torah Synagogue, little else hinted that the nut stand used to be a kosher butcher or that Jews had any other part of its past life.\nThessaloniki was once considered an epicentre of Jewish culture, one of the only cities in Europe where Jews were the majority. Known as Salonika at the time, it was part of the Ottoman Empire until 1912. The Ottoman Empire allowed Jews escaping the Spanish Inquisition in the 15th Century to settle there for hundreds of years. But with Ottoman power beginning to wane in the early 20th Century, Greece took over the city in 1912. Five years later, the Great Fire of 1917 devastated huge swaths of the city and left 70,000 people homeless, including much of the Jewish population. The Talmud Torah Synagogue (and 31 others) were destroyed. The one-time centre of Jewish culture and majority Jewish city received its final blow in 1943 when Nazi forces deported 50,000 Jews to Europe's concentration camps.\nEighty years later, I struggled to find traces of the community, and even finding a Jewish guide to show me around proved difficult. It wasn't surprising; Thessaloniki's Jewish community now numbers less than 1,000 people, a small population sample within which to find a niche professional tour guide. Plenty of companies offered tours of Jewish Thessaloniki, most touting bonafides by proximity to, rather than being a part of the small congregation.\nEventually, I booked through a company based in Athens because it was run by a Greek Jew. I still didn't know if my actual guides would be Jewish, though at least I could be sure they were trusted by the community.\nWhen Elia Matalon greeted us the next morning, I let out a sigh of relief. In the lobby of our hotel, he explained that he and his wife Hella Kounio-Matalon run their tours together and they both come from families that go back many generations in Thessaloniki's Jewish community. Later in the eight-hour tour he would tell us about how his mother survived the war by hiding in homes across the border in Albania while Kounio-Matalon spoke of her father surviving Auschwitz. We began walking toward a Holocaust memorial sculpture, through a narrow alleyway where he pointed to a restaurant owned by a gentile chef who became fascinated by the city's Jewish history and now serves traditional Sephardic Jewish foods like nogada (meatballs in walnut sauce).\nMuch of the city's history is Jewish history. In the Ano Ladadika neighbourhood, we stared up at the city's famous broken clock, stopped by an earthquake in 1978. The building originally belonged to a bank started by the Italian Jewish Allatini brothers, 19th-Century entrepreneurs whose flour company grew to be the largest in the Balkans before World War Two.\nWe walked down adjacent Siggrou Street and paused in front of a 1926 mansion. Today, it houses a hookah bar, which meant we could wander into the lovely plant-filled atrium and up the grand staircase. Outside, Matalon pointed out the holes in the doorpost where a mezuzah once hung. A visible symbol of Jewish identity, the traditional decorative case holds a prayer, fulfilling the commandment to \"write them on the doorposts of your house\".\nSo much of visiting Jewish history around the world is like this: evidence of where we once were. Visiting the former site of the Jewish cemetery. Peering at painted-over holes and fading stars of David. Jews left their mark on Thessaloniki, but hardly in a fashion that hints to the glorious centre of Jewish life it once was. I love to imagine what it was like to live in these rich Jewish worlds, what could be if we weren't constantly getting kicked out of places.\nAcross the street from Modiano Market, we entered one of the city's two remaining synagogues. Because Thessaloniki's laws granted properties owned by Jews before WW2 without surviving family members to the Jewish community, the congregation owns the building, which mostly houses offices, and the synagogue on the ground floor. Marble tablets on the wall list the more than 70 synagogues that served the city's once much-larger Jewish population.

        "article_text": "Ecosystems which have never been seen before are being accidentally created by humans. They offer a stark look into the nature of tomorrow.\nVenture deep into the forests on O'ahu, Hawaii's third largest island, and you'll find yourself threading through a dense understory of richly scented pepper, cinnamon and guava trees.\u00a0\n\"It's beautiful,\" says Corey Tarwater, an ecologist at the University of Wyoming in the US who began researching O'ahu's ecosystems in 2014. Sounds like the \"cheww-chewww\" song of the pale green warbling white-eye and the chattering, almost electrical call of the red-billed leiothrix surround you. \"There's really neat lizards around,\" adds Tarwater. \"There's these highly structured forests with these amazing tropical plant species.\"\nFor hikers setting out on O'ahu's mountain trails, these are thrilling wildernesses within easy reach of Hawaii's capital, Honolulu, says Tarwater. Yet nothing is quite as it might seem, she adds. \"You wouldn't know unless you study them, but if you walk around any forest around Honolulu, there's not going to be one single native plant species there.\"\u00a0\nO'ahu's lowland forests are now almost entirely devoid of the plants and animals that grew here for millions of years before the arrival of humans. Settlers brought extinctions by cutting down trees to make farms and introducing voracious predators and disease-carrying animals. Today, these tropical forests are a tapestry of non-native species introduced from every corner of the planet: Brazilian peppertree, Indonesian cinnamon and roseleaf bramble from the Himalayas and Australia. Most of the animals, including all the birds that Tarwater mentioned earlier, are also alien.\nO'ahu's mountainous terrain \u2013 a filming location that has evoked heroic, untrammelled wildernesses in the Jurassic Park and King Kong films \u2013 is shaped \"at every level\" by human action, says Jef Vizentin-Bugoni, a Brazilian ecologist at Universidade Federal de Pelota who researched the island's birds with Tarwater. He recalls having his expectations upturned when he arrived on the island in 2017, eager to see Hawaii's famous honeycreepers, a set of brightly coloured native bird species that exist nowhere else in the world. Instead, he was first confronted with an unfamiliar flurry of red and white feathers, which turned out to be a red-whiskered bulbul, a bird whose native range spans from India to Southern China.\u00a0\n\"I followed it as it flitted between trees until it stopped to feed on a fruit I immediately recognised \u2013 guava, a plant native to Brazil,\" he says. \"That moment captured the essence of what's happening in Hawaii: a South American plant being eaten by an Asian bird on a remote Pacific island.\"\nMost of these exotic species arrived in the last century or two and were thrown together more or less at random \u2013 some are escaped pets, others relics from abandoned farms. Yet unlike urban environments where foxes and seagulls scratch together a living eating anything they can find, the forests of O'ahu show signs of structure and organisation.\nBirds that have only lived together for the last century have assumed specialist roles, such as distributing the seeds of native plants, that were once performed by now extinct birds. In a 2019 study, Tarwater and Vizentin-Bugoni analysed the eating patterns of birds and seed dispersal on the island to see how they compared to a structured and stable native ecosystem that had evolved together over millennia.\u00a0\n\"If I compare what I'm seeing in O'ahu with what I see in the middle of the Amazon, will the interactions have the same organisation?\" asked Vizentin-Bugoni. \"To our surprise, the answer was yes.\"\nFor the last few decades, ecologists have documented the appearance of \"emerging\" or \"novel ecosystems\" like that on O'ahu. Broadly, novel ecosystems can be defined as \"autonomous, wild ecosystems that deviate from natural baselines because of human activities\", explains ecologist Jens-Christian Svenning, a professor at Aarhus University in Denmark who studies these ecosystems. Novel ecosystems may contain combinations of species never before seen in history: with some native species living alongside other species introduced by humans beyond their historically recorded ranges or driven into new locations by climate change.\nHumans may also alter the environment itself, creating new habitats by reshaping the landscape or altering environmental chemistry. For example, along the coast of the Netherlands, marine ecologist Laura Govers has documented how a system of coastal defences like dams and sea walls, built during the mid-20th Century, has created a series of salty lakes where exotic species have flourished.\nIn Brazil, rainforests cleared for farming have later become freshwater floodplains, known as v\u00e1rzeas, which are home to a new mix of species. Similarly, retired quarries can fill with water to become deep lakes, and even mines have become valued habitats.\nOne former shale oil mine between the Scottish cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow left a mountain made of stone, says Eric Higgs, professor of ecology at the University of Victoria in Canada. Over at least a century piles of stone formed a novel ecosystem through natural assembly processes, says Higgs. It is now a specially protected area that harbours rare plants such as the early purple orchid and the tiny white flowers of the knotted pearlwort.\nUnlike zoos and botanical gardens, which also contain globe-spanning collages of plants and animals, novel ecosystems like those on O'ahu are not dependent on humans to continually plant and maintain them. They now exist as self-sustaining systems, says Svenning. \"These are wild but changed ecosystems,\" he says. They have passed some critical threshold which means they are unlikely to ever go back to how they were before. \"If you removed all people from the planet, Hawaii would be on a different evolutionary ecological trajectory going forward,\" he says.\nSo how much of the planet is already covered by novel ecosystems like these? Some analyses have arrived at startling figures \u2013 in a 2013 book on novel ecosystems, researchers argued that 30-40% of the world's terrestrial ecosystems have already transformed into novel states. A study by Svenning projected that half of the land on the planet would be novel by 2100.\nHowever, these figures \u2013 like much around \"novel ecosystems\" \u2013 remain highly controversial among ecologists. Critics argue that scientists often cannot clearly define when a threshold of novelty has been passed. There are plenty of cases that are \"kind of borderline\", says Svenning. For example, power plants in Florida and Japan are venting warm water that has created tropical microenvironments with an abundance and variety of species not seen in the surrounding cooler waters.\n\"They don't depend on direct active management,\" like zoos, Svenning says. \"But they still rely on ongoing human activity to be there, right?\"\nFor the last decade, says Vizentin-Bugoni, scientists have studied O'ahu as an \"amazing crystal ball\" that offers a glimpse of the future of our planet if humans continue to damage environments and drive species to extinction.\nFor millions of years, the remote location of the Hawaiian archipelago, some 2,000 miles (3,200km) from its nearest neighbour (the US mainland), made it a petri dish for the emergence of unique species. After the islands first emerged from the ocean as lifeless rocks erupting from volcanoes between 30 million and 500,000 years ago, plants and animals arrived there extremely rarely. Migrating birds were the exception, along with the seeds they deposited in their droppings.\u00a0\nHawaii's plants and the birds that remained there therefore evolved largely in isolation from the rest of the world, leading to the evolution of species found nowhere else on the planet, from \"flightless ibises to bird-hunting owls\", writes anthropologist Todd Braje in his 2024 book\u00a0Understanding Imperiled Earth. Without any mammals or large predators of any kind, unique birds evolved to fill diverse niches, like the moa-nalo, (or \"flightless megaducks\", as Braje calls them) that grew to 2ft (0.6m) in height and helped to disperse large seeds and cycle nutrients on the islands.\nOf the 142 species of bird that evolved to live on Hawaii and nowhere else on the planet, 95 are now extinct, including the moa-nalo, according to the American Bird Conservancy. Similar trends among plants and invertebrates have earned it the label of the \"extinction capital of the world\".\nHawaii's islands are a \"microcosm\" of the issues countries worldwide face from exotic species, according to 2020 research led by Liba Pejchar, a conservation scientist at the University of Colorado. The arrival of humans \u2013 first small groups of Polynesian sailors around 1,000 years ago, later Europeans in 1778 \u2013 resulted in forest clearances and the introduction of rats, dogs and cows. For birds, the greatest threat today is the mosquito, which since the 1800s has spread avian malaria that can kill native birds with a single bite.\n\"We like to think of O'ahu as the cautionary tale for all the other Pacific Islands and the Hawaiian Islands,\" says Tarwater. \"It's what you don't want to have happen.\"\nUnsurprisingly, when Tarwater began meticulously tagging Hawaiian birds, non-native species had a bad rap. \"When we first started working out on O'ahu, we were asked by people why we didn't just shoot the [non-native] birds,\" says Tarwater. But by instead observing them, her and Vizentin-Bugoni's team discovered that several of the last native fruiting plants, such as the violet berried uki'uki which clings on in pockets high up the mountains, are wholly dependent on non-native birds to disperse seeds.\n\"It was shocking to us that they were just so embedded into these systems,\" says Tarwater. Still, it's a \"double-edged sword\", she says. \"Unfortunately, they also disperse our non-native plants,\" she says \u2013 which can, in turn, crowd out the endangered natives.\nDuring a decade investigating the rich networks that have self-assembled here, both Tarwater and Vizentin-Bugoni have been amazed to find the extent to which ecosystems have meshed together. In a 2020 paper, Tarwater showed that the traits and bodies of non-native birds have shifted in areas they have invaded \u2013 some, for example, have smaller bills, better for eating O'ahu's smaller fruits. On O'ahu you can now watch mysterious flocks of numerous species take off together in search of fruit. This behaviour is also seen in the Amazon, but in O'ahu the flocks are made up of birds from all around the planet, from the Himalayas to South America.\nFor the profoundly and irreversibly changed environments we see in O'ahu, the most intuitive name might have come not from a scientist at all but from Higgs' young daughter: she has dubbed them \"freakosystems\", he says. Since these strange places began to gain recognition in the late 1990s, the biggest question has been what environmentalists should do about them.\nInvasive species\nDeliberately and accidentally, humans have introduced countless species of animals, plants and other organisms to non-native biomes. While most new additions are innocuous, more than 37,000 species have been found to harm native species, habitats and ecosystems, causing them to be labelled invasive, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).\nGlobally, invasive non-native species are one of the top five drivers of global biodiversity loss, according to IPBES, contributing to 60% of global extinctions and causing damages worth $423bn (\u00a3323bn) per year.\nRestoration ecologists have been on the frontlines of answering this question, says Higgs. Traditionally, these scientists have aimed to recover degraded landscapes towards some reference point \u2013 often, in the Americas, this was set about the time that European colonies began arising in the Americas. The idea was to restore ecosystems to a pre-disturbance or pre-human state.\nBut in many places \u2013 including islands like Hawaii and New Zealand, where so many species of plants and animals have gone extinct and non-native species have spread so far \u2013 turning back the clock was clearly impossible. This idea of \"practical unrestorability\" became the hallmark of what a novel ecosystem is, says Higgs.\u00a0\nFaced with these challenges, ecologists began to question how useful it would be to follow traditional conservation strategies, such as eradicating non-native \"invasive\" species \u2013 typically defined as an introduced species that harms its new environment. But it is not always easy, in much-changed environments, to identify which species these are.\nTake, for example, the packs of feral donkeys or \"burros\" that roam the American South and Australia, the descendants of working animals once used widely in mines and mills that were turned loose decades ago. In places where feral donkeys and horses have competed with native herbivores and overgrazed plants, some local governments have resorted to large-scale culls.\nBut research has shown that donkeys also dig water holes \u2013 known as wells or \"ass holes\" \u2013 in many cases providing the only water source in drylands where temperatures can reach almost 50C (122F). In the Sonoran Desert, which spans the US and Northern Mexico, these holes support more than 50 other species, including birds and large native mammals such as mule deer. Mountain lions have even been observed eating donkeys.\u00a0\nMeanwhile in Australia, introduced megafauna \u2013 from feral horses and donkeys to camels and water buffalo \u2013 often make drylands more functionally similar to the ancient past, when 200kg (440lb) giant wombats dug holes in the country's interior, Svenning's research has shown.\nYet for nature lovers brought up to value pristine environments, and having long ago learned of the destruction wrought by invasive black rats or cane toads, novel ecosystems challenge many of the fundamental values that have driven conservation for decades. In 2011, when the writer Emma Marris published the influential book Rambunctious Garden, which explored novel ecosystems, critics responded that she was giving permission to \"trash nature\". Like Marris, many urban communities have come to love novel environments that have arisen in their local neighbourhoods. Mount Sutro, for example, a forest of non-native eucalyptus, has become a much-loved park in San Francisco, says Higgs.\nAs climate change and nature-loss continue, ecologists are adapting their language to acknowledge that many ecosystems have \"novel elements\" or degrees of \"ecological novelty\". A new map published by researchers in March 2025, tracked how ecosystems across the planet were being changed by climate change, the loss of key animals and native plants being replaced by invasive species. Matthew Kerr, a researcher in Svenning's lab at Aarhus University who made the map, says he found that novel habitats are now truly global, with more than half of the earth's land highly changed: \"This extended out to protected areas,\" he says, including nature parks and marine reserves.\nResponding to these findings, ecologist Anna Walentowitz at the University of Bayreuth in Germany wrote that ecological novelty is now the \"new normal\" for our planet, forcing us to question how we protect nature today.\nO'ahu, at least, is teaching us important lessons that can help protect other environments not yet so degraded, including other islands where native ecosystems remain healthier, says Vizentin-Bugoni. Research has spotlighted certain species that set alarm bells ringing, as they are most likely to do harm to surrounding ecosystems.\n\"For the plants, the ones that are most likely to be a problem are the ones that fruit for a long period and also have small seeds,\" he says. Both these characteristics increase the chance of being eaten by birds and spread around rapidly.\nOn O'ahu itself, research into novel ecosystems is guiding more unconventional conservation strategies. Most land managers are aiming to safeguard the 87% of native plants threatened with extinction by meticulously removing invasive plant species from \"these tiny restoration sites\", explains Tarwater. Although this allows native plants to grow without competition, these denuded areas quickly become bird-free zones, she says. \"There's not enough fruit in those areas to attract them there, which isn't good [for native plants], if those are the only things left to disperse their fruits.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The ancient forest that supports Venice\n\u2022 Hawaii's ancient land management system\n\u2022\u00a0The race to protect Pacific whales\nTo get the birds to spread native plants around, the team in O'ahu instead try to trick them. They use speakers to play the calls of \"birds that we know are really good seed dispersers\" to lure them to restoration sites where native plants remained, Tarwater says. \"Once they're there, they're like: 'Oh, hey, look at that fruit!' and they'll eat it.\" (Read about how scientists coax back species with sound in other parts of the world too.)\nSuch strategies work with non-native birds to help conserve the tiny patches of remaining native plants \u2013 although many roles, such as the moa-nalos' dispersal of large seeds, are still not filled, as no non-native species are big enough.\nIt all makes unravelling what to do with these novel habitats difficult. \"It's complex and depends on the goals of restoration,\" says Tarwater. A conservationist focusing on native plants may eradicate as many non-native competitors as possible, she says. \"But if you're interested in conserving a native snail or some of these other species, that [non-native plant] might be the habitat that they currently rely upon.\"\nWhile novel ecosystems remain controversial, on O'ahu, conservationists and land managers have become less black-and-white about native and non-native species, says Tarwater.\n\"We know that the challenges of the novel ecosystems are going to remain, and likely increase. We know that it's not as simple as them being good or bad.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Some analysts believe that, ironically, the move was driven by his fear of prosecution. \nHere is a list of former South Korean presidents whose political careers ended dramatically.\nBefore he became South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee spent some three decades as a pro-independence activist against Japanese rule. \nBut his presidency was polarising. \nWhile some respect him for having laid the foundations for a modern country after World War Two, critics condemn his authoritarian streak. Shortly after his inauguration in 1948, he implemented laws to curtail political dissent; he has also been blamed for the killing of civilians during the Korean War. \nThe opposition rejected Rhee's re-election in 1960 and accused him of rigging the vote. This escalated into violent student-led protests, which saw some demonstrators shot dead by police, and ultimately forced Rhee to resign. \nRhee left the country for Hawaii in May that year, where he died in 1965.\nBorn to a poor rural family in the early years of the Japanese occupation, Park Chung-hee joined the military and was posted to Manchuria (a historical region of north-eastern China) where he served until the Japanese surrendered.\nPark led a coup in 1961 to overthrow Rhee's successor, Chang Myon, and later became president. Park led the country for 18 years through a period of rapid economic development known as the \"miracle on the Han river\". It was during this time that the government opened doors to foreign investment, while also helping to develop now-famous conglomerates like Hyundai, LG and Samsung.\nHowever, he moved towards greater authoritarianism later in his term. In 1972, he suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly and made himself \"president for life\". \nDespite Park's economic achievements, South Korea in the 1970s was rocked by growing protests against his iron-fisted rule, where dissenters were brutally punished.\nPark was assassinated at a dinner party in October 1979 by his own spy chief and lifelong friend Kim Jae-kyu. \nMilitary commander Chun Doo-hwan gained power in 1980 after yet another coup. He presided over a brutal military crackdown in the south-western city of Gwangju, which at the time was the centre of an uprising against martial law in South Korea. More than 200 pro-democracy demonstrators were either killed or disappeared.\nDuring Chun's term, the country saw growth rates hovering around 10% each year. However, he is mostly remembered as a dictator who was unapologetic till the end. \nIn 1983, Chun survived an assassination attempt orchestrated by North Korea forces, who bombed a ceremony he was at during a state visit to Myanmar. The attack killed 21 people and injured dozens more. \nIn 1988, Chun picked his coup comrade Roh Tae-woo, also a former general, as his successor. \nThe pair were convicted in 1996 of corruption, as well as their roles in the coup and the Gwangju massacre. Defending the coup while on trial, Chun said he \"would take the same action, if the same situation arose\". \nChun was handed a death sentence - which was later commuted to life imprisonment - while Roh was sentenced to 17 years in jail. Both men were pardoned in 1997 after serving just two years in prison.\nBorn to a poor family, Roh Moo-hyun educated himself and passed the bar exam to become a lawyer without having attended law school. He was appointed a judge in 1977 but later left the bench to become a human rights lawyer, where he advocated for student activists accused of being pro-communist.\nIn 2002, Roh won the presidential election as an underdog, with early polls giving him just 2% of the vote. He tried to shape South Korea as a \"middle power\" among other stakeholders in the region, and championed a so-called sunshine policy of engaging North Korea with trade and aid shipments. \nAfter leaving office in 2007, he returned to his hometown in the south-east and ran a duck farm. However, he took his own life 14 months later, as corruption investigators closed in over allegations he accepted $6m in bribes.\nPublic opinion on Roh improved considerably after his death. Polls by Gallup Korea have consistently ranked him the most beloved president in the country's history.\nFormer Hyundai CEO Lee Myung-bak entered politics in 1992 and was elected mayor of Seoul a decade later. He won the election by a landslide in 2007, even though a business scandal from his days at the automobile conglomerate resurfaced in the days leading up to the vote.\nLee led the country through the global financial crisis and won its bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics. His term ended in 2013, and he was succeeded by the country's first female president Park Geun-hye, who is the daughter of assassinated former leader Park Chung-hee. \nThe younger Park drew on her father's reputation as the man who pulled South Korea out of poverty. However, a corruption scandal involving a confidante, Choi Soon-sil - the daughter of a Shamanistic cult leader - led to her impeachment in 2016 and arrest a year later.\nFive years after leaving office, Lee too was charged with bribery and later found guilty of creating slush funds of tens of millions of dollars, and taking bribes from various sources, including Samsung. \nPark was handed a 22-year sentence and Lee 15 years, but both have since been pardoned.

Form: F - Fell, P - Pulled up, U - Unseated rider.)\nVerdict: Lots with chances but Senior Chief could still be improving, while Hewick looks primed to run well.\n1 Senior Chief 2 Hewick 3 Stumptown 4 Iroko\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Paul Townend\nForm: 311-P8 Age: 9 Weight: 11-12\nConvincing victor last year, having won the Irish National 12 months earlier, and could well be in the shake-up again. Pinpointed two months ago by 20-time champion jockey AP McCoy - who advises the owner - as the pick of JP McManus' stellar squad. Would be the first horse carrying top weight to triumph since the legendary Red Rum in the 1970s.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Venetia Williams Jockey: Charlie Deutsch\nForm: F-1P66 Age: 11 Weight:11-9\nThrives in different conditions, at Haydock in the mud \u2013 scene of five of his seven career victories, including back-to-back runnings of the Betfair Chase. Past three runs have been disappointing. Owned by flamboyant former banker Rich Ricci, you might not get rich backing this one although trainer did triumph with 100-1 outsider Mon Mome in 2009.\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 125-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Patrick Mullins\nForm: 73-411 Age: 8 Weight: 11-8\nOwner Stewart Andrew clearly thinks he's a rocket - he eyed Cheltenham Gold Cup, but trainer preferred to go for the National. Would be an emotional winner as Andrew's wife Sadie died in December 2022, five days after watching Nick Rockett in his first race. A winner of the Thyestes Chase then Bobbyjo Chase, where Intense Raffles was runner-up, but that rival better off at the weights here. Jockey rides for trainer father.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Brian Hayes\nForm: 1-P625 Age: 9 Weight: 11-8\nWould be a poignant winner as the last horse bought for owners Cheveley Park Stud by joint boss David Thompson at the end of 2020, just 19 days before his death. Runner-up in Irish Gold Cup to Galopin Des Champs at 66-1 when finishing ahead of subsequent Cheltenham winners Fact To File and Inothewayurthinkin. Drying ground should suit.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: John Joseph Hanlon (IRE) Jockey: Gavin Sheehan\nForm: 232571 Age: 10 Weight: 11-7\nAn \u00a3800 bargain buy who has won big races including the King George VI Chase, Bet365 Gold Cup, Galway Plate and American Grand National. Trainer, nicknamed 'Shark', has taken horse into local pub to celebrate victories, and believes he could be sent off favourite. Well backed in lead-up to race, would be suited by dry spell with good going right up his street.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Henry de Bromhead (IRE) Jockey: Rachael Blackmore\nForm: 443-26 Age: 12 Weight: 11-3\nLooked a potential winner last year in closing stages before finishing third. Triumphed in 2021 Cheltenham Gold Cup for trainer, who won National a month later with stablemate Minella Times as Rachael Blackmore became first female jockey to win the race. Could easily be prominent again for her although would be some effort to become only third horse to complete Gold Cup-National double.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Sean O'Keeffe\nForm: 2-5351 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nShowed bundles of promise when winning the Supreme Novices' Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival four years ago but much of that has been unfulfilled. Won for the first time in two years last time out at Thurles. Not the most obvious victor in trainer's talented team and no guarantee at all that he will appreciate this marathon distance.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Jonathan Burke\nForm: 0-8P43 Age: 9 Weight: 11-2\nWhile powerful trainer has other hopefuls, including last year's winner, don't let this one go under the radar. Third under top weight to Intense Raffles in last year's Irish Grand National before winning Bet365 Gold Cup at Sandown. Breeding and form point to potential for big run. Minella horses take their name from a Tipperary family hotel run by racehorse trader John Nallen.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Jordan Gainford\nForm:  U58708 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nBoasts some decent form including Irish Gold Cup win, when Minella Indo was second, albeit that was three years ago. Has run well at this meeting before, including a good second to Jonbon over shorter distance last year. Trainer seeking fourth victory in race, but suspicion is age, weight and longer trip may be against this one.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Keith Donoghue\nForm: -U1111 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nSecured fourth straight victory of the season by winning Cross Country Chase at Cheltenham Festival in fine style last month. That is the same race Tiger Roll won before his 2018 and 2019 National triumphs. Stumptown's trainer went to town at Cheltenham by landing the Gold Cup with Inothewayurthinkin, who was then made hot favourite for this but skips the race.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 8-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Freddie Gingell\nForm: 83-222 Age: 9 Weight: 11-1\nPart-owned by former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, Hitman has been a bit hit and miss. Has a habit of coming second - finishing runner-up in 11 of his 26 races - and this distance is a real unknown. Talented 19-year-old jockey credits much of his success to his mother Kim who died in 2020 from cancer aged 43.\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 150-1\nTrainer: Nigel Twiston-Davies Jockey: Sam Twiston-Davies\nForm: 1P-132 Age: 9 Weight: 11-1\nJockey rides for trainer father, who has landed the race twice before. Winner of Midlands Grand National last year. Owner Bryan Burrough hoping for second success, 42 years after his colours were carried to victory by the Jenny Pitman-trained Corbiere. It's a tough ask but had a convincing victory over fences at Ascot earlier in season and stamina looks assured.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: James Reveley\nForm: 6-2383  Age: 10 Weight: 11-0\nForm has dipped since reaching top of his game two or three years ago. Won jump racing's festive showpiece, the King George VI Chase at Kempton, in 2022 and was second a year later. In between, finished runner-up in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Will take a brave man or woman to pick this one after an 11-race losing run. Stable jockey rides Kandoo Kid.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 50-1\nTrainer: Nicky Henderson Jockey: James Bowen\nForm: 9-5515  Age: 11 Weight: 10-13\nBit of an enigma. Was on a 10-race losing run when won well at Cheltenham on New Year's Day. Maybe he was just in the party mood. Green and gold colours of owner JP McManus look more likely to succeed elsewhere, although there is a breeding positive - Chantry House's sire Yeats was also dad to 2022 National winner Noble Yeats.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Harry Skelton\nForm: 210-32 Age: 10 Weight: 10-12\nNamed after owner Max McNeill's late father and ex-professional golfer Ted, who was three under par through five holes to lead The Open at Royal Portrush in 1951. Will the gelding be above or below par? Fourth in the Scottish National two years ago but well behind Minella Cocooner and Nick Rockett in last season's Bet365 Gold Cup.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Mark Walsh\nForm: 286411  Age: 8 Weight: 10-12\nAnother powerful weapon in the armoury of Cheltenham Gold Cup-winning trainer, who also has Stumptown and Vanillier. A beaten favourite for both the Galway Plate and Kerry National but form of his Leopardstown win in December reads well and now takes a big step up in trip. Named after a 1970s film about a 12th Century knight, could he put his rivals to the sword here?\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 12-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Harry Cobden\nForm: P23-18 Age: 9 Weight: 10-11\nDecent third in Topham Chase over National fences last year. Won Coral Gold Cup, formerly the Hennessy, at Newbury in November. Only one horse, Many Clouds, has gone on to also win the National, though trainer thinks he can do it. He won in 2012 with Neptune Collonges and says the grey Kandoo Kid is the \"ideal horse for the race\".\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 20-1\nTrainer: Oliver Greenall & Josh Guerriero Jockey: Jonjo O'Neill Jr\nForm: 2-2F42  Age: 7 Weight: 10-11\nA Cheltenham Festival winner in 2023. Second at Aintree meeting 12 months ago to subsequent Gold Cup winner Inowthewayurthinkin when nominated by owner JP McManus as his 'National horse for next year'. Joint-trainer Oliver Greenall's father Lord Daresbury is former racecourse chairman who has an Aintree stand named after him. Co-trainer Josh Guerriero won Foxhunters' Chase over National fences as amateur jockey in 2008.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 9-1\nTrainer: Tom Gibney (IRE) Jockey: JJ Slevin\nForm: 11-902 Age: 7 Weight: 10-10\nSounds like a deadly serious lottery, and has a deadly serious chance. Winner of the Irish Grand National last year. Nearly all of his races have been on soft or heavy ground. The grey runs in the 'double green' colours of owner-breeders Simon Munir and Isaac Souede. Showed his wellbeing when second, despite carrying more weight, to Nick Rockett at Fairyhouse in February.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Henry de Bromhead (IRE) Jockey: Darragh O'Keeffe\nForm: 1P-169 Age: 9 Weight: 10-10\nPulled up in last year's Irish National but marked himself out as a candidate for this race when winning well at Cheltenham in October. Subsequently sixth in the Coral Gold Cup at Newbury when he was staying on, which could be a good sign for the test ahead. Owned by the Lucky In Life Syndicate. Will the horse live up to their name?\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Richard Phillips Jockey: Harry Bannister\nForm: F03106 Age: 11 Weight: 10-10\nPreviously based in Ireland, where he won the Midlands National last summer at Kilbeggan. Having second run for amiable Gloucestershire trainer, who does a nice line in impressions. He helped buy the horse with John Rosbotham, a friend of 55 years with whom he dreamed in the school playground of having a National runner, and it runs for a syndicate of 12 called the Dozen Dreamers.\nRating: 4/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey:  Sam Ewing\nForm: 212433 Age: 7 Weight: 10-9\nFive of his six wins have come at roughly half the distance of this race. Looks an uphill task on the face of it, but interestingly mentioned as a potential surprise package by the trainer \u2013 who has won three times previously - when weights for the race were announced in February. Would probably benefit from soft ground.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Nigel Twiston-Davies Jockey: Tom Bellamy\nForm: 5-324P Age: 7 Weight: 10-9\nOwner David Proos hoping to go two better after his family silks were carried to third by Rinus in 1990. No forlorn hope based on his second to Kandoo Kid in Coral Gold Cup at Newbury. One for alliteration fans - could Broadway Boy follow Mon Mome, Party Politics and Red Rum as a nifty-sounding National winner for trainer, who has triumphed twice before?\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Jody McGarvey\nForm: U50029 Age: 10 Weight: 10-9\nEleventh in last year's race, when hampered late on, having previously finished eighth and pulled up. Prominent on each occasion before fading. Winner of the Troytown Chase in 2023. Will probably be spotted towards the front again but takes a leap of faith to see him stay there and become only the fourth grey horse to win the National.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Paul O'Brien\nForm: 3PP-P0 Age: 8 Weight: 10-9\nLooked to be heading for big things after winning Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham in 2023 but career over the bigger obstacles has not been straightforward and pulled up on three of his past four runs. Jockey called up for first ride in race after original bookings Bryony Frost (riding in France) then Johnny Burke (on Minella Cocooner instead) were unavailable\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Danny Mullins\nForm: 37-008 Age: 8 Weight: 10-7\n'Caught the eye' of last year's winning trainer when the weights were revealed in February. Finished seventh in 2024 when appeared to run out of steam. That could be perceived as a stamina doubt, although might see out the trip better now a year stronger and stable's Hedgehunter won in 2005 after a tired late fall the previous year.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Jonjo & AJ O'Neill Jockey: Nick Scholfield\nForm: 5P-241 Age: 9 Weight: 10-9\nIntriguing contender who finished fourth in the Welsh Grand National before ending a two-year losing run with victory at Uttoxeter. Finished third to subsequent National winner Corach Rambler at Cheltenham Festival two years ago. Formerly owned by Tory peer Michelle Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman before being sold last year to Martin Tedham, who sponsors the trainer's yard.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Sean Flanagan\nForm: -P6913 Age: 10 Weight: 10-6\nThis was my selection in 2023, when he ended up finishing second to Corach Rambler for shrewd trainer. Was 14th last year on softer ground but comfortable Punchestown win in February showcased his credentials. Nearly took the wrong route at Cheltenham last month before recovering to finish third in Cross Country Chase. Chance again if the satnav is working.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Michael Keady Jockey: Ciaran Gethings\nForm:  F22999  Age: 8 Weight: 10-6\nRunner-up in the Kerry and Munster Nationals when trained by Willie Mullins but switched stables last month. Now based in the Flat racing capital of Newmarket. Trainer set up on his own five months ago and is looking for first win over jumps in biggest steeplechase of all. Has to be a doubt over whether this contender possesses the same ability and stamina as some of his rivals.\nRating: 4/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Nicky Henderson Jockey: Nico de Boinville\nForm: 141122 Age: 8 Weight: 10-6\nNovice chaser looking to break duck for trainer, who is one of the greats but has poor record in this race \u2013 with no win from 43 previous runners. Sound jumper who should like the ground. Need an omen? One of the owners, Paul Humphreys, was born on same day as Grand National legend Red Rum. Their syndicate once included the late John Sillett, Coventry City's FA Cup-winning manager.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Philip Hobbs and Johnson White Jockey: Micheal Nolan\nForm: 45U4-1 Age: 13 Weight: 10-6\nThe obstacles should not be an issue, having finished eighth and fourth in the past two runnings of the shorter Topham Chase over the National fences. However, this is a longer and stiffer task. No 13-year-old horse has won the National since Sergeant Murphy 102 years ago and hard to see an equine teenager being celebrated this time around.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 150-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Sean Bowen\nForm: -33713  Age: 10 Weight: 10-5\nThis race has been the long-term plan, says the trainer, who has been successful three times before. And he has been dealt a nice hand with the horse sneaking in towards the bottom of the weights. Rider is actually allergic to horses, but is on the verge of becoming British champion jockey and steps in for injured Jack Kennedy.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Ben Pauling Jockey:  Beau Morgan\nForm: 5-2P77 Age: 10 Weight: 10-5\nA family affair as 20-year-old jockey rides horse owned by his mother Georgia. The expected sunny conditions should suit as six of his seven wins have come on good ground. Second in the Ultima Chase at last year's Cheltenham Festival, he ran three times over hurdles this season before finishing a distant seventh in the Grimthorpe Chase at Doncaster.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 80-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Danny Gilligan\nForm: 352P4B Age: 8 Weight: 10-4\nUnlikely to need a Duffle Coat on Merseyside this weekend with sunny spells forecast and temperatures expected to reach 18C.

        "article_text": "Cosmetics company Lush and car repair chain Kwik Fit are among firms which have warned they will raise prices due to an increase in employers' National Insurance (NI).\nOther firms have told the BBC they will reduce how much profit they make, freeze hiring or in some cases cut jobs to cover the higher costs.\nFrom Sunday, employers will have to pay NI at 15% on salaries above \u00a35,000, instead of 13.8% on salaries above \u00a39,100 currently.\nThe Treasury said the billions raised will be spent on public services, including the NHS.\nLush told the BBC that with 3,600 employees in the UK and Ireland, it would have to find an extra \u00a32.7m per year.\nKasey Swithenbank, Lush's retail head for the UK and Ireland, said: \"We are going to be taking small incremental price changes.\n\"We are taking an approach where we look at certain categories at key points of the year so hopefully our customers don't feel the full burden straight away.\"\nKwik Fit, which employs about 5,000 people, estimates the NICs rises will cost it \u00a35m.\nThis will have a knock-on effect on prices, and recruitment, said Mark Slade, its managing director.\n\"We are really careful to make sure KwikFit is always competitive and benchmarked against the people around us - but the reality is that includes increasing prices.\"\nHe added: \"There will be some people who aren't replaced over the coming year and that will be in the senior levels.\"\nBBC Breakfast contacted around 200 UK businesses and charities in March, across different industries, from sole traders to large companies to get a sense of the impact of the increase in employer National Insurance Contributions.\nSome 121 completed the questionnaire and around 100 of these businesses told us they had at least an approximate idea of how much increases in employer NICSs would cost them.\nThe costs ranged from \u00a31,000 to \u00a339m depending the size of the business and the number of employees.\nAround 60 of the businesses which were planning to increase the staff count before announcement said the Budget had affected these plans.\nBBC Breakfast's questionnaire asked employers to choose from a list of actions they would take to manage increases in NICs. \nBusinesses most frequently told us they would choose a combination of these things.\nAllison Kirkby, chief executive of BT, said the tax changes, which will cost the firm \u00a3100m, will mean it speeds up job cuts it was already planning.\nShe added that BT is \"delighted\" with tax relief on infrastructure investment in the Spring Statement and UK planning reforms.\n\"At the moment, like the country, we are focused on getting BT back to growth,\" she said.\n\"Predictability on taxation, on regulation and on planning is super helpful for the investment that goes into infrastructure like ours, which is the digital backbone of the country.\"\nAngela Burns is the chief executive of the Webb Hotel Group, a group of four hotels based in Sutton Coldfield in the West Midlands.\nIt employs just under 300 people, and she says the NICs rises alone will cost \u00a3200,000 a year, with additional minimum wage and pension costs taking that to \u00a3600,000.\n\"It's really tough because our labour force is the main expense in our business,\" she said.\n\"As soon as it was announced in the budget in October, we started to look at restructuring, and as people have left, we haven't re-employed. So we've actually cut our workforce down from about 320 to about 280 now to prepare ourselves.\"\nShe said prices would have to be moved \"slightly upwards\". \n\"But it's a balancing act as to what customers are prepared to pay,\" she added.\nGreg Strickland, general manager of trampoline activity firm Jump Xtreme in Bolton, said the changes added \u00a330,000 of costs \"overnight\".\nHe said it had  cut 16 hours per week off some 40-hour contracts to cover the cost.\nMeanwhile Andrew Lane, managing director of Union Industries in Leeds said the firm, which makes industrial doors, shares about half its post-tax profit with employees.\n\"This is going to hit them,\" he said. \"There will be less money to distribute to our employee-owners.\"\nThe government has predicted the changes will raise between \u00a314.6bn and \u00a318.3bn a year over five years when compensation for public sector employers is taken into account.\nA Treasury spokesperson told the BBC the government was \"pro-business\" and that it knew the \"vital importance of small businesses to our economy\".\nThey said October's budget \"took difficult decisions on tax to stabilise the public finances, including the NHS which has now seen waiting lists fall five months in a row\".\nThey added: \"We are now focused on creating opportunities for businesses to compete and access the finance they need to scale, export and break into new markets.\"\nAdditional reporting by Oliver Smith & Jennifer Meierhans\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

Lush and Kwik Fit warn tax rise will push up prices12 hours agoShareSaveTom Espiner & Emma SmithBBC business reportersShareSaveGetty ImagesCosmetics company Lush and car repair chain Kwik Fit are among firms which have warned they will raise prices due to an increase in employers' National Insurance (NI).Other firms have told the BBC they will reduce how much profit they make, freeze hiring or in some cases cut jobs to cover the higher costs.From Sunday, employers will have to pay NI at 15% on salaries above \u00a35,000, instead of 13.8% on salaries above \u00a39,100 currently.The Treasury said the billions raised will be spent on public services, including the NHS.Lush's Kasey Swithenbank said the company would be looking at \"small incremental price changes\"Lush told the BBC that with 3,600 employees in the UK and Ireland, it would have to find an extra \u00a32.7m per year.Kasey Swithenbank, Lush's retail head for the UK and Ireland, said: \"We are going to be taking small incremental price changes. The government expects about 940,000 firms to pay more, 250,000 companies to pay less, and 820,000 to see no change.The threshold when employers start paying the tax on each employee's salary will be reduced from \u00a39,100 per year to \u00a35,000.But Employers Allowance - the amount employers can claim back from their National Insurance bill - has been raised from \u00a35,000 to \u00a310,500.BBC Breakfast contacted around 200 UK businesses and charities in March, across different industries, from sole traders to large companies to get a sense of the impact of the increase in employer National Insurance Contributions.Some 121 completed the questionnaire and around 100 of these businesses told us they had at least an approximate idea of how much increases in employer NICSs would cost them.The costs ranged from \u00a31,000 to \u00a339m depending the size of the business and the number of employees.Around 60 of the businesses which were planning to increase the staff count before announcement said the Budget had affected these plans.How will firms manage the rises?BBC Breakfast's questionnaire asked employers to choose from a list of actions they would take to manage increases in NICs. \"But it's a balancing act as to what customers are prepared to pay,\" she added.Greg Strickland, general manager of trampoline activity firm Jump Xtreme in Bolton, said the changes added \u00a330,000 of costs \"overnight\".He said it had  cut 16 hours per week off some 40-hour contracts to cover the cost.Meanwhile Andrew Lane, managing director of Union Industries in Leeds said the firm, which makes industrial doors, shares about half its post-tax profit with employees. \"Kwik Fit boss Mark Slade says the National Insurance changes will affect prices and hiring.Kwik Fit, which employs about 5,000 people, estimates the NICs rises will cost it \u00a35m.This will have a knock-on effect on prices, and recruitment, said Mark Slade, its managing director.",

It's even harder careering along on the American Hills of the 47th US president.\nWhen Trump returned to the White House in January, his direction of travel was clear: he set out to repair relations with Russia. \nThere were Trump/Putin phone calls, high-level US-Russia negotiations. At one point Washington voted with Moscow against a UN resolution that identified Russia as the \"aggressor\" in Russia's war against Ukraine.\nWhenever the Trump administration exerted pressure, it was always on Kyiv, never on the Kremlin.\nBut a week or so ago the rollercoaster ride began.\nAfter Vladimir Putin had proposed replacing President Volodymyr Zelensky's administration with \"external governance\" in Ukraine under the auspices of the UN, President Trump made it known that he was \"angry\" with Putin.\n\"I was disappointed in a certain way, some of the things that were said over the last day or two having to do with Zelensky,\" Trump commented on 30 March. \"Because when [Putin] considers Zelensky not credible, he's supposed to be making a deal with him. Whether you like him or you don't like him.\"\nAfter a day playing golf with Trump, the president of Finland, Alexander Stubb, told the Guardian newspaper: \"I think America, and my sense is also the president of the United States, is running out of patience with Russia.\"\nTrump threatened to impose secondary tariffs of up to 50% on Russian oil exports if Russia was found to be dragging its heels on a Ukraine peace deal. \nA bi-partisan group of US senators has gone even further. \nThey've drawn up a bill that would impose 500% secondary tariffs on countries that purchase Russian oil, gas and other resources.\nUp to this point the Russian press had been welcoming the thaw in relations between Moscow and Washington. The Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper last month ran a headline stating that US and Russian officials had \"started speaking the same language\".\nThis week things changed.\nOn Wednesday, Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper accused the Trump administration of \"administrative insanity\u2026 inexperience\u2026 immaturity\".\nIt criticised the administration's \"bragging and arrogance\" and \"its desire to declare 'huge breakthroughs' when the first steps have barely been taken\".\nThe same day, Komsomolskaya Pravda declared: \"On Ukraine talks, Donald's mood changes as often as the wind.\"\nSigns, perhaps, of a cold wind blowing between Moscow and Washington?\nAnd yet when Trump announced his sweeping tariffs this week, Russia wasn't on the list. \nInstead, US authorities had organised a sanctions waiver for a key Kremlin official: Putin's foreign investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev. \nDmitriev flew into Washington for talks with the Trump administration.\nA sign, perhaps, of Russia and America getting on with the business of\u2026 getting along?\nBut on Friday, another warning from Washington to Moscow. This time at a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels.\n\"President Trump's not going to fall into the trap of endless negotiations about negotiations,\" said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\"We will know soon enough, in a matter of weeks, not months, whether Russia is serious about peace or not.\"\n\"If they're not,\" he continued, \"then we'll have to re-evaluate where we stand and what we do moving forward about it.\"\nThis followed criticism of Russia by America's Nato allies. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Putin \"continues to obfuscate, continues to drag his feet\".\n\"He could accept a ceasefire now, he continues to bombard Ukraine\u2026 We see you, Vladimir Putin, we know what you are doing.\"\nEarlier on Friday there were rumours that Trump and Putin were about to speak again on the phone. These were followed by more rumours: the White House had changed its mind.\nThe Kremlin said that there were no plans for a conversation.\nBut there are reports that American companies are planning to take part in this year's St Petersburg Economic Forum.\nOkay. Stop the ride. I need to get off.\nMy conclusions from all of this.\nTrying to follow each twist and turn on the US-Russia rollercoaster can leave you giddy and confused.\nSometimes it's better observing from a distance. It often helps in order to identify the bigger picture. \nWhich is this: for months Donald Trump's team avoided criticising Putin and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \nKey White House officials, like special envoy Steve Witkoff, have repeatedly embraced and repeated Kremlin talking points. True, Washington says it's growing impatient with Russia and has threatened tougher sanctions on Moscow. But it hasn't imposed any. Not yet.\nWill it? \nIs the Trump administration prepared to pressure Moscow into ending the war? And would the Kremlin allow itself to be pressured into doing so? \nIt's a key question as Russia's war on Ukraine continues.",

        "article_text": "South Korea's Constitutional Court has ruled Yoon Suk Yeol abused his power by declaring martial law last December, and permanently removed him from office.\nBefore that, South Korea was not somewhere you might expect a military takeover - a peaceful and proud democracy, admired across the globe for its K-dramas and technological innovation.\nSo, when President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law, ordering his army to seize control, he stunned the country and the world. Everyone, from regular Koreans to world leaders, was left with the same burning question:\nWhat was he thinking?\nYoon underestimated the resistance from the public, his military and members of parliament. He cancelled the order after just six hours. \nThe BBC has spoken to some of those closest to the president \u2013 his friends, confidantes, and political aides - to understand what drove this once successful and principled prosecutor, famed for his belief in right and wrong, to trigger an authoritarian takeover: a decision that would upend his country, tarnish its international reputation and destroy his career.\nFrom a young age, Yoon was \"obsessed with winning\", his oldest friend, Chulwoo Lee, told me in the weeks after martial law. \n\"Once he decides something, he drives it forward in a very extreme way.\"\nMr Lee was in the same primary school class as Yoon. The pair later went on to study law together, before Yoon became a prosecutor. \nAt school, he was the biggest boy in the class, Mr Lee said, which meant he always sat at the back so as not block the other pupils' view. \nHe was popular and clever, Mr Lee added, keen to counter a myth that Yoon struggled academically because it took him nine attempts to pass the bar exam.\nYoon attended college in the early 1980s, when South Korea's military dictator Chun Doo-hwan ruled the country using martial law. \nWhen the military massacred protesters in the city of Gwangju, the nation was horrified. Angry students took to the streets, but according to Lee, Yoon \"didn't participate much\". \n\"He wasn't particularly interested in the student movement or politics,\" Lee said, but he did have \"a strong belief in justice\".\nMr Lee remembers walking through campus one day, when they saw a girl being interrogated by two plain clothes policemen. Yoon immediately started shouting at them. \n\"Because he was so big and angry, the officers were frightened. They practically ran away,\" he said. \"His temper was uncontrollable.\"\nDecades later, Mr Lee would find himself on the receiving end of his friend's temper. \nAs a state prosecutor, Yoon cemented his reputation as an explosive character who was almost obsessively guided by an innate sense of right and wrong. \nBut over the years, Lee worried his investigations were becoming unnecessarily aggressive. When he called Yoon to tell him so, \"he threw the telephone across the room\" in anger.\nBy then, Yoon was already famous, having investigated the intelligence service in 2013 for corruption, against the orders of his boss. He was suspended from his job, but according to Mr Lee, who defended him, the public viewed him as brave for defying political pressure. \nWhen testifying, Yoon famously declared: \"I do not owe my loyalty to anyone.\"\nThis was evident again when he went on to prosecute and jail South Korea's impeached conservative president Park Geun-hye in 2018, making him a darling of the left. \nIt won him the job of chief prosecutor for the left-leaning government at the time. But rather than curry favour, he launched an investigation into one of its ministers. It was then that Mr Lee phoned to warn his friend \"he was crossing a bridge of no return\", which incensed Yoon. The pair did not talk for over a year.\nBut this dogged, non-partisan approach won him support.  \"I was rooting for him because he always did the right thing rather than what his boss told him to do. I felt there should be more people like him,\" said one friend, Shin*, who asked to stay anonymous. \nShin, who refers to Yoon as his older brother - a term of affection in South Korea - claims he was different to many prosecutors at the time, who sold their influence by marrying into rich and powerful families.\nBut by investigating the government, Yoon had picked a fight he couldn't win, and he was pushed out of his job as chief prosecutor. Such side-switching set him up as a hero and villain to both sides of the politician divide, giving him a unique appeal.\nStill, the decision to run for president was not an easy one, Shin said. \nThe pair met regularly to brainstorm a game plan. They worried about Yoon's lack of political connections. \n\"If you've been a politician your whole life you have people backing you. Without these allies, Yoon knew he was going to be a very lonely president,\" Shin said.\n\"I greatly regret choosing him as our candidate\", Yoon's campaign strategist Kim Keun-sik admitted to me in the aftermath of martial law.\nKim was initially enamoured by Yoon's principled approach to the law, but said he quickly grew concerned. \"He didn't listen to any of our advice. He only did as he pleased - he was stubborn to the core.\" \nHe would make decisions spontaneously, in private, preferring to take advice from the friends he went drinking with, Kim said. \"We kept having to clear up his mess.\"\nYet despite these warning signs, he was selected as the presidential candidate for South Korea's conservative People Power Party. \n\"We knew he was a risk, but we thought he gave us the best chance of beating our opponent,\" Kim said.\nAfter being endorsed by the party, Yoon's politics lurched rapidly to the right. \nAccording to his friends, he was bombarded by very right-wing politicians and journalists who \"planted ideas in his mind.\" He developed an extreme hostility towards the opposition party, believing it had links to North Korea. \n\"I felt very sad, because he was changing,\" said Shin. \"He wanted to win, and the wrong advice went to his head. He started to think he was engaged in a war.\"\nBy now, Yoon's schoolfriend Lee was alarmed. \n\"He came into politics with such a wide spectrum of support. I hoped he would unite the country. But he moved so quickly to the right and was losing support almost every day.\" \u202f\nThe problem, Lee said, was that those on the far right were fanatically supportive. The more backing Yoon lost, the more he believed he had to rely on these loyalists, and the further right he slid.\nIt was a self-defeating cycle. Yoon won the election by the narrowest margin in South Korea's history \u2013 0.7%.\nAfter his victory, Mr Lee messaged his school friend to cut ties, concerned about the direction he would take the country. \"I congratulated him and said I would see him after he had served his term.\"\nBy the time he entered office, Yoon had not only alienated his oldest friend, but many moderate voters, and he had set himself up for a clash with the powerful opposition, that controlled the parliament. \nHe brought his prosecutorial instincts into politics. Yet the very traits that made him a formidable prosecutor would hamper him as president.\n\"Usually politicians with no experience listen to their aides a lot, but Yoon wanted to take the wheel,\" said one of his political advisers, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \nThe aide, who worked in the president's office, said Yoon would argue his points \"loudly and forcefully\", making it \"uncomfortable\" to voice an alternative opinion.\nIn the early days of his presidency, most of his team pressed him to sit down with the opposition leader, to resolve their differences and find a way to govern effectively, but Yoon refused, the aide said. \n\"He viewed the opposition leader, Lee Jae-myung, as a criminal.\" \nInstead, Yoon sided with a small faction within the presidential office who wanted him to \"fight the party head on\".\nFairly quickly, those pushing for dialogue either left or were pushed out, leaving Yoon surrounded by people who agreed with him, and lower-level bureaucrats, too scared to speak out.\nThis bullish leadership led him to make a strategic miscalculation \u2013 he overlooked the need to be liked by voters. He pushed ahead with unpopular policies, and refused to apologise for his wife, who had antagonised the public by accepting luxury gifts.\n\"He didn't care enough what people thought of him; whether they thought he was doing a good job or not,\" said his friend Shin, who remembers struggling to convince Yoon to dress smartly in the early days of the campaign. \nYoon feared that pandering to the public might prevent him achieving his goals, and hoped people would eventually recognise he was doing a good job, Shin explained.\nThe opposite turned out to be true. \nTwo years into his term, his party suffered a bruising defeat in parliamentary elections, handing the opposition party an even bigger majority. Yoon was left hamstrung, unable to enact his agenda.\n\"It's arrogant to say you don't want to be popular, that you don't want approval ratings,\" said Shin, labelling this Yoon's \"biggest mistake\". \n\"He's a funny, likeable person. He could have been a popular president.\"\nPerversely, Yoon seemed untroubled by his party's election defeat. \n\"He said he could still give executive orders and accomplish a lot. He told me not to worry\", said Linton, a conservative politician and one of the president's close confidantes at the time.\nAccording to various testimonies, this was about the time Yoon's martial law plot began to take shape.\nBy now, he appeared to be fully immersed in unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, peddled by influential far-right YouTubers whose content he was consuming. He believed the opposition was taking orders from North Korea, or at least those who idolised the regime, though he never presented any proof.\nLinton said Yoon talked repeatedly of how the opposition party was being run by Marxists, once comparing them to the Chinese Communist Party. He thought that, if in power, they would turn South Korea into an authoritarian communist state and bankrupt the country. \n\"I got this speech at least 15 to 20 times.\"\nThe stronger the opposition got, the more headstrong Yoon became, using his presidential veto to block parliament's decisions. In return the assembly slashed his budgets, impeached an unprecedented number of his political appointees, and tried to investigate his wife for corruption.\nAccording to Linton, Yoon was \"livid\". \"They are trying to bring me down, the government down, and end our democracy - and we can't put up with it,\" he told him.\nOn 3 December, he finally snapped.\n\"He saw martial law as a method for punishing the opposition. He felt that somebody had to stand up to them,\" Linton said. \n\"Once he makes a decision he doesn't hesitate,\" he added, suggesting it was unlikely Yoon had fully thought his plan through. \"It was a poor decision, and he is paying the consequences now, but I think he sincerely thought he had the country's best interests at heart.\"\nIn a roundabout way, his schoolfriend Chulwoo Lee agrees: \"He had this delusion he could save the nation from communist threats, but I have no sympathy for him; he has jeopardised our democracy.\"\nAs misguided as he was, Yoon did what he thought was right with little care for the consequences, echoed Shin. \n\"This was exactly how he lived his 30 years as a prosecutor. In this sense, martial law was something only Yoon could have done.\"",

        "article_text": "The Masters was first contested in 1934 and won by American Horton Smith\nThe 89th Masters takes place 10-13 April, with defending champion Scottie Scheffler among a field featuring an in-form Rory McIlroy looking, once again, to complete the career Grand Slam.\nBBC Sport will have live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra across all four days.\nThere will also be live text commentary, in-play clips, video highlights, reaction and analysis on the BBC Sport website and app.\nRound one: Thursday, 10 April \nRound two: Friday, 11 April \nRound three: Saturday, 12 April \nRound four: Sunday, 13 April \nThe tee times and groupings for rounds one and two will be announced on Tuesday, 8 April.\nMcIlroy has won four majors but none since 2014 and is yet to win the Masters, while Scheffler's two major triumphs have come at Augusta National \nThe general feeling in the golfing world is that if a player finishes above both Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy this week then they will probably be donning the Green Jacket.\nAmerican Scheffler is the world number one and turning into something of a Masters specialist. He is looking for a third victory in four years, while McIlroy is seeking to win the title for the first time.\nScheffler had a standout year in 2024, winning nine events including the Masters, and while he has not enjoyed the same stellar start to 2025, he is yet to finish outside the top 20 in five previous appearances in the first men's major of the year.\nMcIlroy, ranked second, needs this title to become just the sixth player to win the career Grand Slam of all four majors. It will be his 11th attempt to join a pantheon of greats including Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Ben Hogan, Gene Sarazen and Gary Player.\nFor the first time, the Northern Irishman has won twice on the PGA Tour before arriving at Augusta, including last month's prestigious Players Championship, which has only intensified the hype.\nBut there are potential winners everywhere in the 96-man field.\nSwedish sensation Ludvig Aberg finished runner-up to Scheffler last year in a debut major to remember. Could he go on to emulate Jordan Spieth, who finished second in his debut year, before winning the title 12 months later in 2015?\nEngland's Tommy Fleetwood will be encouraged by his joint third last year, while his compatriot Matt Fitzpatrick is a proven major winner and Wolverhampton's Aaron Rai is making his Masters debut after rising through the rankings.\nScotland's Bob MacIntyre is making his first start in three years but made the cut in his first two attempts, with a best finish of joint 12th. He arrives in Augusta with five top-15 returns in 2025.\nXander Schauffele has had four top-10 finishes in his previous six Masters and is coming off the back of a breakthrough 2024 in the majors where he won his first and second titles.\nCollin Morikawa, ranked one place below Schauffele at fourth in the world, also enjoys Augusta and has had three top-10s in his past three starts, finishing joint third in 2024.\nUS Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley is enjoying something of a renaissance in his career and is 14th in the world rankings.\nThe 38-year-old has never finished inside the top 20 at Augusta but won his seventh PGA Tour title at last year's BMW Championship and has had two top-10s this season, making the cut in all seven events he has played.\nLIV Golf is well represented, with a dozen players from the Saudi-backed circuit heading to Georgia.\nJon Rahm won this title in 2023 and perhaps has a better chance of adding to his tally than Dustin Johnson (2020), Patrick Reed (2018) and Sergio Garcia (2017) who are all recent champions.\nChile's Joaquin Niemann has won twice on the LIV circuit this year and is once again being touted as a potential winner, while Bryson DeChambeau showed playing the 54-hole LIV tournaments had not harmed his major aspirations as he won his second US Open title last year\nAnd finally... although he is not a favourite to win, many eyes will be on Germany's Bernhard Langer this week as the 67-year-old makes his 41st and final start on the 40th anniversary of the first of his two wins.\nFive-time Masters champion Tiger Woods will not be playing at Augusta National this year because he is still recovering after rupturing an Achilles tendon in March.\nOn 1 April the 15-time major champion wrote on X: \"I can't believe I am saying this, but a few weeks after rupturing my left Achilles, the sleeping in a hyperbaric chamber plus the explosive lifts, my doctors and trainers have me ready to play the Masters next week! Can't wait! See y'all on the course.\"\nHowever, minutes later, he added the message: \"P.S. April Fools my Achilles is still a mess :)\"\nWoods had surgery on the injury, which also kept him out of the PGA Tour's flagship Players Championship, on 11 March.\nHe had been hoping to make his comeback at Augusta, having not competed in a PGA Tour event since last July's Open at Royal Troon.\nThe 49-year-old then had his sixth back procedure in 10 years in September 2024.\nWoods planned to return at the Genesis Invitational in February but withdrew following the death of his mother, Kultida.\n\nThe BBC weather forecast for Augusta, Georgia is predicting drizzle and light rain on the Monday and Wednesday practice days of Masters week, with a sunnier day on Tuesday and maximum temperatures of 15C.\nThere is little to no rain and light winds forecast for the Championship days. The temperature is set to warm up throughout the week with a maximum of 18C for the final round on Sunday.\nMasters tradition dictates that the new champion is helped into his Green Jacket by the previous year's winner\nIt is arguably the most sought-after jacket in sport.\nThe great Bobby Jones, founder of the Augusta National Golf Club in 1933 and co-founder of the Masters which began in 1934, came up with the idea of a members' jacket.\nThe American amateur, who won seven majors, took his lead from Royal Liverpool, after winning The Open in 1927. He liked the red hunting jacket worn by the club's former captains.\nRed, yellow and 'Georgia peach' colours were all floated between Jones and his business partner Clifford Roberts before the latter, inspired by the colour of the leaves on the azalea bushes that dominate Augusta National, suggested green.\nThe idea was that members wore the jacket and were therefore easily recognisable by spectators visiting the course.\nSam Snead was the first Masters winner to be awarded a Green Jacket, in 1949.\nIt is made of an inexpensive wool-polyester mix and costs about \u00a3195 to make each one. The colour is known as 'Pantone 342'.\nEach jacket is kept permanently in the Champions Locker Room and only worn during Masters Week, strictly within the confines of Augusta National's clubhouse.\nInitially, only first-time winners were allowed to remove the jacket from the property and then just for the first 12 months. Recently, winners have been given a replica jacket they can take away.\nThe Par 3 Contest is a relaxing Wednesday-afternoon event with families and friends heavily involved\nFirst played in 1960, the Par 3 Contest has become the traditional fun curtain-raiser to the Masters.\nIt will start around 17:00 BST on Wednesday, 10 April. Most players have their wives, girlfriends, children, or even grandchildren as caddies and dressed in the traditional white boiler suits.\nNon-competing past champions such as Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Tom Watson still play in the nine-hole event that criss-crosses DeSoto Springs Pond and Ike's Pond.\nFamously, no player has won the Par 3 Contest and then gone on to win the Green Jacket in the same year.\nBBC Sport will have live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra across all four days.\nThere will also be live text commentary, in-play clips, video highlights, reaction and analysis on the BBC Sport website and app. \nMonday, 7 April\n21:00-22:00 BST - BBC Radio 5 Live preview show, also on BBC Sounds and via BBC Sport website\nThursday, 10 April\n12:30-01:00 - live text commentary on round one on BBC Sport website, with in-play clips\n20:00-01:00 - live radio commentary on 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds\nFriday, 11 April\n12:30-01:00 - live text commentary on round two on BBC Sport website, with in-play clips\n20:30-22:00 - live radio commentary on 5 Live and BBC Sounds\n22:00-01:00 - live radio commentary on 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds\nSaturday, 12 April\n17:00-01:00 - live text commentary on round three on BBC Sport website, with in-play clips\n21:00-01:00 - live radio commentary on 5 Live and BBC Sounds\nSunday, 13 April\n17:00-01:00 - live text commentary on round four on BBC Sport website, with in-play clips\n20:00-01:00 - live radio commentary on 5 Live and BBC Sounds\n",

        "article_text": "Yoon Suk Yeol, who was officially removed from office on Friday, follows a line of former South Korean leaders who have had their reputations marred or terms interrupted by scandal. \nAmong them are presidents who have faced indictment, exile and imprisonment.\nYoon, who was South Korea's public prosecutor, in fact led a probe that landed former president Park Geun-hye in prison. \nNow apart from being impeached, Yoon is also being investigated for treason over his botched martial law attempt last December. Some analysts believe that, ironically, the move was driven by his fear of prosecution. \nHere is a list of former South Korean presidents whose political careers ended dramatically.\nBefore he became South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee spent some three decades as a pro-independence activist against Japanese rule. \nBut his presidency was polarising. \nWhile some respect him for having laid the foundations for a modern country after World War Two, critics condemn his authoritarian streak. Shortly after his inauguration in 1948, he implemented laws to curtail political dissent; he has also been blamed for the killing of civilians during the Korean War. \nThe opposition rejected Rhee's re-election in 1960 and accused him of rigging the vote. This escalated into violent student-led protests, which saw some demonstrators shot dead by police, and ultimately forced Rhee to resign. \nRhee left the country for Hawaii in May that year, where he died in 1965.\nBorn to a poor rural family in the early years of the Japanese occupation, Park Chung-hee joined the military and was posted to Manchuria (a historical region of north-eastern China) where he served until the Japanese surrendered.\nPark led a coup in 1961 to overthrow Rhee's successor, Chang Myon, and later became president. Park led the country for 18 years through a period of rapid economic development known as the \"miracle on the Han river\". It was during this time that the government opened doors to foreign investment, while also helping to develop now-famous conglomerates like Hyundai, LG and Samsung.\nHowever, he moved towards greater authoritarianism later in his term. In 1972, he suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly and made himself \"president for life\". \nDespite Park's economic achievements, South Korea in the 1970s was rocked by growing protests against his iron-fisted rule, where dissenters were brutally punished.\nPark was assassinated at a dinner party in October 1979 by his own spy chief and lifelong friend Kim Jae-kyu. \nMilitary commander Chun Doo-hwan gained power in 1980 after yet another coup. He presided over a brutal military crackdown in the south-western city of Gwangju, which at the time was the centre of an uprising against martial law in South Korea. More than 200 pro-democracy demonstrators were either killed or disappeared.\nDuring Chun's term, the country saw growth rates hovering around 10% each year. However, he is mostly remembered as a dictator who was unapologetic till the end. \nIn 1983, Chun survived an assassination attempt orchestrated by North Korea forces, who bombed a ceremony he was at during a state visit to Myanmar. The attack killed 21 people and injured dozens more. \nIn 1988, Chun picked his coup comrade Roh Tae-woo, also a former general, as his successor. \nThe pair were convicted in 1996 of corruption, as well as their roles in the coup and the Gwangju massacre. Defending the coup while on trial, Chun said he \"would take the same action, if the same situation arose\". \nChun was handed a death sentence - which was later commuted to life imprisonment - while Roh was sentenced to 17 years in jail. Both men were pardoned in 1997 after serving just two years in prison.\nBorn to a poor family, Roh Moo-hyun educated himself and passed the bar exam to become a lawyer without having attended law school. He was appointed a judge in 1977 but later left the bench to become a human rights lawyer, where he advocated for student activists accused of being pro-communist.\nIn 2002, Roh won the presidential election as an underdog, with early polls giving him just 2% of the vote. He tried to shape South Korea as a \"middle power\" among other stakeholders in the region, and championed a so-called sunshine policy of engaging North Korea with trade and aid shipments. \nAfter leaving office in 2007, he returned to his hometown in the south-east and ran a duck farm. However, he took his own life 14 months later, as corruption investigators closed in over allegations he accepted $6m in bribes.\nPublic opinion on Roh improved considerably after his death. Polls by Gallup Korea have consistently ranked him the most beloved president in the country's history.\nFormer Hyundai CEO Lee Myung-bak entered politics in 1992 and was elected mayor of Seoul a decade later. He won the election by a landslide in 2007, even though a business scandal from his days at the automobile conglomerate resurfaced in the days leading up to the vote.\nLee led the country through the global financial crisis and won its bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics. His term ended in 2013, and he was succeeded by the country's first female president Park Geun-hye, who is the daughter of assassinated former leader Park Chung-hee. \nThe younger Park drew on her father's reputation as the man who pulled South Korea out of poverty. However, a corruption scandal involving a confidante, Choi Soon-sil - the daughter of a Shamanistic cult leader - led to her impeachment in 2016 and arrest a year later.\nFive years after leaving office, Lee too was charged with bribery and later found guilty of creating slush funds of tens of millions of dollars, and taking bribes from various sources, including Samsung. \nPark was handed a 22-year sentence and Lee 15 years, but both have since been pardoned.

Jockey rides for trainer father.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Brian Hayes\nForm: 1-P625 Age: 9 Weight: 11-8\nWould be a poignant winner as the last horse bought for owners Cheveley Park Stud by joint boss David Thompson at the end of 2020, just 19 days before his death. Runner-up in Irish Gold Cup to Galopin Des Champs at 66-1 when finishing ahead of subsequent Cheltenham winners Fact To File and Inothewayurthinkin. Drying ground should suit.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: John Joseph Hanlon (IRE) Jockey: Gavin Sheehan\nForm: 232571 Age: 10 Weight: 11-7\nAn \u00a3800 bargain buy who has won big races including the King George VI Chase, Bet365 Gold Cup, Galway Plate and American Grand National. Trainer, nicknamed 'Shark', has taken horse into local pub to celebrate victories, and believes he could be sent off favourite. Well backed in lead-up to race, would be suited by dry spell with good going right up his street.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Henry de Bromhead (IRE) Jockey: Rachael Blackmore\nForm: 443-26 Age: 12 Weight: 11-3\nLooked a potential winner last year in closing stages before finishing third. Triumphed in 2021 Cheltenham Gold Cup for trainer, who won National a month later with stablemate Minella Times as Rachael Blackmore became first female jockey to win the race. Could easily be prominent again for her although would be some effort to become only third horse to complete Gold Cup-National double.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Sean O'Keeffe\nForm: 2-5351 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nShowed bundles of promise when winning the Supreme Novices' Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival four years ago but much of that has been unfulfilled. Won for the first time in two years last time out at Thurles. Not the most obvious victor in trainer's talented team and no guarantee at all that he will appreciate this marathon distance.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Jonathan Burke\nForm: 0-8P43 Age: 9 Weight: 11-2\nWhile powerful trainer has other hopefuls, including last year's winner, don't let this one go under the radar. Third under top weight to Intense Raffles in last year's Irish Grand National before winning Bet365 Gold Cup at Sandown. Breeding and form point to potential for big run. Minella horses take their name from a Tipperary family hotel run by racehorse trader John Nallen.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Jordan Gainford\nForm:  U58708 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nBoasts some decent form including Irish Gold Cup win, when Minella Indo was second, albeit that was three years ago. Has run well at this meeting before, including a good second to Jonbon over shorter distance last year. Trainer seeking fourth victory in race, but suspicion is age, weight and longer trip may be against this one.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Keith Donoghue\nForm: -U1111 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nSecured fourth straight victory of the season by winning Cross Country Chase at Cheltenham Festival in fine style last month. That is the same race Tiger Roll won before his 2018 and 2019 National triumphs. Stumptown's trainer went to town at Cheltenham by landing the Gold Cup with Inothewayurthinkin, who was then made hot favourite for this but skips the race.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 8-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Freddie Gingell\nForm: 83-222 Age: 9 Weight: 11-1\nPart-owned by former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, Hitman has been a bit hit and miss. Has a habit of coming second - finishing runner-up in 11 of his 26 races - and this distance is a real unknown. Talented 19-year-old jockey credits much of his success to his mother Kim who died in 2020 from cancer aged 43.\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 150-1\nTrainer: Nigel Twiston-Davies Jockey: Sam Twiston-Davies\nForm: 1P-132 Age: 9 Weight: 11-1\nJockey rides for trainer father, who has landed the race twice before. Winner of Midlands Grand National last year. Owner Bryan Burrough hoping for second success, 42 years after his colours were carried to victory by the Jenny Pitman-trained Corbiere. It's a tough ask but had a convincing victory over fences at Ascot earlier in season and stamina looks assured.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: James Reveley\nForm: 6-2383  Age: 10 Weight: 11-0\nForm has dipped since reaching top of his game two or three years ago. Won jump racing's festive showpiece, the King George VI Chase at Kempton, in 2022 and was second a year later. In between, finished runner-up in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Will take a brave man or woman to pick this one after an 11-race losing run. Stable jockey rides Kandoo Kid.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 50-1\nTrainer: Nicky Henderson Jockey: James Bowen\nForm: 9-5515  Age: 11 Weight: 10-13\nBit of an enigma. Was on a 10-race losing run when won well at Cheltenham on New Year's Day. Maybe he was just in the party mood. Green and gold colours of owner JP McManus look more likely to succeed elsewhere, although there is a breeding positive - Chantry House's sire Yeats was also dad to 2022 National winner Noble Yeats.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Harry Skelton\nForm: 210-32 Age: 10 Weight: 10-12\nNamed after owner Max McNeill's late father and ex-professional golfer Ted, who was three under par through five holes to lead The Open at Royal Portrush in 1951. Will the gelding be above or below par? Fourth in the Scottish National two years ago but well behind Minella Cocooner and Nick Rockett in last season's Bet365 Gold Cup.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Mark Walsh\nForm: 286411  Age: 8 Weight: 10-12\nAnother powerful weapon in the armoury of Cheltenham Gold Cup-winning trainer, who also has Stumptown and Vanillier. A beaten favourite for both the Galway Plate and Kerry National but form of his Leopardstown win in December reads well and now takes a big step up in trip. Named after a 1970s film about a 12th Century knight, could he put his rivals to the sword here?\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 12-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Harry Cobden\nForm: P23-18 Age: 9 Weight: 10-11\nDecent third in Topham Chase over National fences last year. Won Coral Gold Cup, formerly the Hennessy, at Newbury in November. Only one horse, Many Clouds, has gone on to also win the National, though trainer thinks he can do it. He won in 2012 with Neptune Collonges and says the grey Kandoo Kid is the \"ideal horse for the race\".\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 20-1\nTrainer: Oliver Greenall & Josh Guerriero Jockey: Jonjo O'Neill Jr\nForm: 2-2F42  Age: 7 Weight: 10-11\nA Cheltenham Festival winner in 2023. Second at Aintree meeting 12 months ago to subsequent Gold Cup winner Inowthewayurthinkin when nominated by owner JP McManus as his 'National horse for next year'. Joint-trainer Oliver Greenall's father Lord Daresbury is former racecourse chairman who has an Aintree stand named after him. Co-trainer Josh Guerriero won Foxhunters' Chase over National fences as amateur jockey in 2008.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 9-1\nTrainer: Tom Gibney (IRE) Jockey: JJ Slevin\nForm: 11-902 Age: 7 Weight: 10-10\nSounds like a deadly serious lottery, and has a deadly serious chance. Winner of the Irish Grand National last year. Nearly all of his races have been on soft or heavy ground. The grey runs in the 'double green' colours of owner-breeders Simon Munir and Isaac Souede. Showed his wellbeing when second, despite carrying more weight, to Nick Rockett at Fairyhouse in February.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Henry de Bromhead (IRE) Jockey: Darragh O'Keeffe\nForm: 1P-169 Age: 9 Weight: 10-10\nPulled up in last year's Irish National but marked himself out as a candidate for this race when winning well at Cheltenham in October. Subsequently sixth in the Coral Gold Cup at Newbury when he was staying on, which could be a good sign for the test ahead. Owned by the Lucky In Life Syndicate. Will the horse live up to their name?\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Richard Phillips Jockey: Harry Bannister\nForm: F03106 Age: 11 Weight: 10-10\nPreviously based in Ireland, where he won the Midlands National last summer at Kilbeggan. Having second run for amiable Gloucestershire trainer, who does a nice line in impressions. He helped buy the horse with John Rosbotham, a friend of 55 years with whom he dreamed in the school playground of having a National runner, and it runs for a syndicate of 12 called the Dozen Dreamers.\nRating: 4/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey:  Sam Ewing\nForm: 212433 Age: 7 Weight: 10-9\nFive of his six wins have come at roughly half the distance of this race. Looks an uphill task on the face of it, but interestingly mentioned as a potential surprise package by the trainer \u2013 who has won three times previously - when weights for the race were announced in February. Would probably benefit from soft ground.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Nigel Twiston-Davies Jockey: Tom Bellamy\nForm: 5-324P Age: 7 Weight: 10-9\nOwner David Proos hoping to go two better after his family silks were carried to third by Rinus in 1990. No forlorn hope based on his second to Kandoo Kid in Coral Gold Cup at Newbury. One for alliteration fans - could Broadway Boy follow Mon Mome, Party Politics and Red Rum as a nifty-sounding National winner for trainer, who has triumphed twice before?\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Jody McGarvey\nForm: U50029 Age: 10 Weight: 10-9\nEleventh in last year's race, when hampered late on, having previously finished eighth and pulled up. Prominent on each occasion before fading. Winner of the Troytown Chase in 2023. Will probably be spotted towards the front again but takes a leap of faith to see him stay there and become only the fourth grey horse to win the National.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Paul O'Brien\nForm: 3PP-P0 Age: 8 Weight: 10-9\nLooked to be heading for big things after winning Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham in 2023 but career over the bigger obstacles has not been straightforward and pulled up on three of his past four runs. Jockey called up for first ride in race after original bookings Bryony Frost (riding in France) then Johnny Burke (on Minella Cocooner instead) were unavailable\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Danny Mullins\nForm: 37-008 Age: 8 Weight: 10-7\n'Caught the eye' of last year's winning trainer when the weights were revealed in February. Finished seventh in 2024 when appeared to run out of steam. That could be perceived as a stamina doubt, although might see out the trip better now a year stronger and stable's Hedgehunter won in 2005 after a tired late fall the previous year.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Jonjo & AJ O'Neill Jockey: Nick Scholfield\nForm: 5P-241 Age: 9 Weight: 10-9\nIntriguing contender who finished fourth in the Welsh Grand National before ending a two-year losing run with victory at Uttoxeter. Finished third to subsequent National winner Corach Rambler at Cheltenham Festival two years ago. Formerly owned by Tory peer Michelle Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman before being sold last year to Martin Tedham, who sponsors the trainer's yard.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Sean Flanagan\nForm: -P6913 Age: 10 Weight: 10-6\nThis was my selection in 2023, when he ended up finishing second to Corach Rambler for shrewd trainer. Was 14th last year on softer ground but comfortable Punchestown win in February showcased his credentials. Jockey is qualified aircraft pilot although nearly took wrong route at Cheltenham last month before recovering to finish third in Cross Country Chase. Chance again if the satnav is working.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Michael Keady Jockey: Ciaran Gethings\nForm:  F22999  Age: 8 Weight: 10-6\nRunner-up in the Kerry and Munster Nationals when trained by Willie Mullins but switched stables last month. Now based in the Flat racing capital of Newmarket. Trainer set up on his own five months ago and is looking for first win over jumps in biggest steeplechase of all. Has to be a doubt over whether this contender possesses the same ability and stamina as some of his rivals.\nRating: 4/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Nicky Henderson Jockey: Nico de Boinville\nForm: 141122 Age: 8 Weight: 10-6\nNovice chaser looking to break duck for trainer, who is one of the greats but has poor record in this race \u2013 with no win from 43 previous runners. Sound jumper who should like the ground. Need an omen? One of the owners, Paul Humphreys, was born on same day as Grand National legend Red Rum. Their syndicate once included the late John Sillett, Coventry City's FA Cup-winning manager.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Philip Hobbs and Johnson White Jockey: Micheal Nolan\nForm: 45U4-1 Age: 13 Weight: 10-6\nThe obstacles should not be an issue, having finished eighth and fourth in the past two runnings of the shorter Topham Chase over the National fences. However, this is a longer and stiffer task. No 13-year-old horse has won the National since Sergeant Murphy 102 years ago and hard to see an equine teenager being celebrated this time around.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 150-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Sean Bowen\nForm: -33713  Age: 10 Weight: 10-5\nThis race has been the long-term plan, says the trainer, who has been successful three times before. And he has been dealt a nice hand with the horse sneaking in towards the bottom of the weights. Rider is actually allergic to horses, but is on the verge of becoming British champion jockey and steps in for injured Jack Kennedy.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 25-1\nThe Grand National jockey who's allergic to horses \nTrainer: Ben Pauling Jockey:  Beau Morgan\nForm: 5-2P77 Age: 10 Weight: 10-5\nA family affair as 20-year-old jockey rides horse owned by his mother Georgia. The expected sunny conditions should suit as six of his seven wins have come on good ground. Second in the Ultima Chase at last year's Cheltenham Festival, he ran three times over hurdles this season before finishing a distant seventh in the Grimthorpe Chase at Doncaster.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 80-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Danny Gilligan\nForm: 352P4B Age: 8 Weight: 10-4\nUnlikely to need a Duffle Coat on Merseyside this weekend with sunny spells forecast and temperatures expected to reach 18C. Unlikely too that this grey will prove good enough to triumph despite low weight. Runner-up in last summer's Galway Plate and has finished second several times but only managed to wrap up one win from his past 27 races.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 100-1\nLatest horse racing results",

I'd had so many rejections along the way,\" he says.\n\"So when someone said yes, I cried because it's everything I ever wanted.\"\nBefore Jack published debut novel Look Up, Handsome, he'd written other, self-published titles.\nBut he felt an entirely different emotion when he found out that those works had appeared on LibGen - a so-called \"shadow library\" containing millions of books and academic papers taken without permission.\nAn investigation by The Atlantic magazine revealed Meta may have accessed millions of pirated books and research papers through LibGen - Library Genesis - to train its generative AI (Gen-AI) system, Llama.\nNow author groups across the UK and around the world are organising campaigns to encourage governments to intervene.\nMeta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is currently defending a court case brought by multiple authors over the use of their work. \nLlama is a large language model, or LLM, similar to Open AI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.\nThe systems are fed huge amounts of data and trained to spot patterns within it. They use this data to create passages of text by predicting the next word in a sequence.\nDespite the systems being labelled intelligent, critics argue LLMs do not \"think\",  have no understanding of what they produce and can confidently present errors as fact.\nTech companies argue that they need more data to make the systems more reliable, but authors, artists and other creatives say they should pay for the privilege.\nA Meta spokesperson told BBC Newsbeat it had \"developed transformational GenAI powering incredible innovation, productivity and creativity for individuals and companies\".\nThey added that \"fair use of copyrighted materials is vital to this\", and that the company wants to develop AI that benefits everyone.\nAs well as concerns over copyright and accuracy, AI systems are also power-hungry, prompting environmental fears, and worries they could threaten jobs.\nWhile Jack's debut novel wasn't part of the LibGen dataset, he did find some of his self-published books had been taken.\nHe says he wasn't surprised because he'd seen so many fellow authors affected, but that it did spur him on to want to do something about it.\n\"There's always something you can do. You can't just say 'oh well'. You've got to speak up and fight back,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat.\nMeta says open source AI like Llama will \"increase human productivity, creativity, and quality of life\". \nBut Jack says it poses a real risk to creatives like him.\n\"It's annoying that the first thing AI comes for are creative jobs that bring you joy. \n\"We're so undervalued already, and we're even more undervalued now with AI coming in.\"\nJack says going up against a company like Meta, which is worth more than a trillion dollars, doesn't feel like a fight he can take on alone.\n\"How much control can you take back when your work has already been taken?\n\"How do we live with that and how do we get protected from that?\"\nHe's one of a growing number of writers calling on the government to intervene, with a demonstration planned on Thursday near Meta's London office, as well as action online.\nAbie Longstaff works at the Society of Authors, a union representing writers, illustrators and translators, and tells Newsbeat they have been raising concerns about the risks of AI for years.\n\"We all feel that level of helplessness,\" she says. \"But we're all fighting so hard.\"\nShe says her work has also been stolen and used to train AI, something she believes has an impact on future publishing opportunities.\n\"Large language models work by prediction, they work by looking at patterns. They want our voice, they want our expression, they want our style. \n\"So you can as a normal person go onto one of these sites and say 'please can you write me a book in the style of Abie Longstaff' and they'll write it in my style, in my voice.\"\nBecause their works have been scraped though, writers won't get any compensation or recognition if it's used this way.\n\"We want to see compensation, we want to see that it's more transparent,\" Abie says.\n\"The company has taken our books and used it to make money. It has money, but instead of paying us for our intellectual property instead of licensing a word, it's taking it all for free.\"\nThe Society of Authors as well as other unions like the Writers' Guild are encouraging writers to get in touch with their MPs to raise their concerns in government.\nIn December, the government shared a consultation in a bid to navigate the issue between copyright holders being in control and paid for their work and AI companies having \"wide and lawful access to high-quality data\".\nOne proposal was giving tech companies automatic access to works such as books, films and TV shows to train AI models unless creators opted out.\nBut Abie thinks that's the wrong way round.\n\"It's like saying you've got to put a note on your wallet saying no-one steal it,\" she says. \n\"It should be the AI companies asking us if they can use our work.\" \nWriting is something Jack had always dreamed of doing - and still does, despite the challenges he's currently facing.\n\"It's still my dream to be an author and hopefully write full time. It's incredibly difficult now, it's going to be more difficult with AI coming in.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "article_text": "On a quick drive around the small Ohio town of Delta, you can spot nearly as many Trump flags as American stars-and-stripes banners.\nAnd at the petrol station near the Ohio Turnpike, the pumps bear relics of the last administration, with slogans slamming Trump's predecessor: \"Whoever voted for Biden owes me gas money!\"\nThis is Trump country - the Republican ticket easily won here in November's presidential election by a margin of almost two-to-one. And while the markets are in turmoil following Trump's unveiling of expansive global tariffs this week, plenty of people in Delta and hundreds of Midwestern towns like it still back the president's plans.\nThose plans, to impose tariffs of between 10% and 50% on almost every country, have upended global trade and led to warnings that prices could soon rise for American consumers. Trump, meanwhile, has said the move will address unfair trade imbalances, boost US industry and raise revenue.\nFor some in Delta, the president's argument about fairness resonates.\n\"I don't want people in other countries to suffer, I really don't,\" said Mary Miller, manager of the Delta Candy Emporium, which sits in the middle of the village's Main Street. \"But we need to have an even playing field.\"\nMiller, a three-time Trump voter, believes other countries haven't played fair on trade. And like many here, she prefers to buy American-made goods.\nAs she watches over her stock of multi-coloured confectionaries, many of them made in the US, and weighs up how they might be impacted by fresh import taxes, she recalls how decades ago she heard that one of her favourite brands was moving its factories abroad. She hasn't bought another pair of Levi's jeans since.\nMiller is unfazed by the possibility of price increases, which many economists say these new tariffs will bring.\n\"Sometimes you have to walk through fire to get to the other side,\" she said.\n\"If tariffs bring companies and business back to hard-working American people like the ones who live here, then it's worth it.\"\nThese sentiments are common in Delta, a village of around 3,300 people less than 100 miles (160km) south of Detroit, even as other Midwestern towns brace for sharp shocks. \nThe automotive industry, with its complicated global supply chains, seems particularly vulnerable to the impact of major new tariffs, with companies in Michigan to the north and Indiana to the west already announcing factory shutdowns and job cuts.\nBut on the outskirts of Delta, there is a cluster of steel businesses that have been here since the 1990s and which may be better placed in a new era of American protectionism.\nOne of these businesses, North Star BlueScope, has urged Trump to expand tariffs on steel and aluminium.\nAt the same time, however, it has asked for an exemption for the raw materials it needs, such as scrap metal.\nNorth Star BlueScope did not respond to interview requests, but in a back room at the nearby Barn Restaurant, a few local steelworkers who had just finished the night shift were drinking beers together early on Friday morning.\nThe workers, who asked not to be named, mostly laughed and shrugged when asked about the sweeping new tariffs that were announced by Trump at the White House on Wednesday.\nIt was a pretty clear indication that this economic news is unlikely to ruin their weekend.\nOutside the restaurant, some Delta locals considered the possible upsides of these import taxes.\n\"Nobody's frantic. We're not going to lose any sleep over it,\" said Gene Burkholder, who has a decades-long career in the agriculture industry.\nAlthough he owns some stocks, Mr Burkholder said they were long-term investments and he was not obsessing over the sharp drops in the two days following the president's announcement.\n\"If you have some spare cash, maybe it's a good time to buy some shares while they're cheap,\" he said.\nA couple of booths over, as she finished eating breakfast with her son Rob, Louise Gilson said - quietly - that she did not really trust the president.\nBut Gilson, along with many people here, said she wanted to see action. She wholeheartedly agreed when another diner commented: \"Trump may be wrong, but at least he's trying.\"\n\"The other people wouldn't have done squat,\" she said, referring to the Democratic Party.\nThe Gilsons agreed that the big local industrial employers have generally been good neighbours, contributing to the local economy, charities and the wider community, even as they have seen some less desirable effects of industrial development and worry about unequal sharing of the economic pie.\nAnd as they recounted Delta's history, they described a gradual erosion in quality of life that they believe has made many people willing to roll the dice even when economists say Trump's tariff plan comes with stark risks.\n\"It was a good little town to grow up in,\" Rob Gilson recalled. But he said it now seemed less safe and friendly than when he was growing up in the 60s and 70s. \n\"It seems like the heart of America is gone,\" he said.\nDelta, Louise Gilson added, \"is the kind of place where 25% or 30% of the people are struggling with their demons\".\nAnd while these issues have little to do with tariffs, the challenges faced by people in towns like Delta may go some way to explaining why many are willing to give President Trump the benefit of the doubt, even as markets plunge on faraway Wall Street.",

        "article_text": "Jonny Bairstow and James Anderson will not face off this season after Yorkshire were promoted and Lancashire relegated\nThe 2025 County Championship begins on Friday - and, remarkably for early April, the weather is set to be glorious.\nBut which county sides will sparkle this season and whose outlook is gloomy?\nThe BBC's local radio county cricket commentators and online journalists - who will be providing ball-by-ball radio and live text commentary throughout the season on the BBC Sport website and app - take a look at each club's prospects... \nCounty Championship preview: Who can stop Surrey?\nJennings 'job' is to win Lancashire silverware\nBears must spread wickets around - Hannon-Dalby\n2024 season - Eighth in Division Two\nDave Fletcher - BBC Radio Derby\nGiven Derbyshire finished bottom of Division Two in 2024, things can surely only improve. \nThey did at least win a game last year, unlike 2023, but it was another bitterly disappointing watch for the County Ground faithful.\nThey were not helped by an opening round washout against Gloucestershire last season which meant they were playing catch-up from the off.\nThat appears unlikely to be repeated so a quick start \u2013 against the same opposition - is essential.\nThey have added Australian opening batter Caleb Jewell to the squad and he will be joined by returning Kiwi quick bowler Blair Tickner, whose spell last season was all too brief.\nThere's a new captain at the helm, too, although it is a familiar figure. Wayne Madsen, who led the side to promotion in 2012, takes over from David Lloyd after his solitary campaign leading the side.\nTickner's return and the presence of experienced bowlers such as Zak Chappell and Pat Brown can only benefit newcomer Harry Moore.\nAlready in the England system, the much talked-about 17-year-old will be starting his first full season in the senior side having already shown he can more than hold his own at that level.\nWinter signings Jack Morley and Martin Andersson will be better for having been with the group last season.\nThe big challenge remains the ability to take 20 wickets a match, something Mickey Arthur's side have to do if they are to repeat the relative riches of his first season in charge in 2022.\nMatthew Potts' Durham appearances this season may be limited by England call-ups\n2024 season - Fifth in Division One\nMartin Emmerson - BBC Radio Newcastle\nDurham finished fifth on their return to Division One last season and in general more than held their own. They might be able to improve on that this year. We'll see.\nThey weren't helped by the loss of their entire opening game - at home to Hampshire in April \u2013 but there was only really Surrey who turned them over.\nThat was towards the end of the season and the week Surrey retained their title - and they beat a weakened Durham side struggling with injuries.\nFrom a batting point of view they have added Emilio Gay to the ranks. He joined towards the end of last season from Northants, while Will Rhodes chose to leave Warwickshire after seven seasons, despite the offer of a new contract. \nThey will help boost a line-up which includes the leading batter in Division One last season, in South African David Bedingham. He scored 1,331 runs, including a club-record 279 against Lancashire in September. He also became the first Durham batter to score centuries in four consecutive innings.\nOpener Michael Jones has left for Lancashire. His outings last season were limited due to selection choices, so he took the decision to head back home.\nBowling is the key issue. They've had no luck with overseas players in recent seasons. Scott Boland lasted part of one game before returning home to Australia in April. Neil Wagner managed just one game too. Veteran Peter Siddle came in and did well in his four games, while West Indian Chemar Holder didn't particularly pull up any trees in his three matches. Keeping their bowlers fit will be key.\nIt remains to be seen how much of a good signing Sam Conners will be. The bowler has joined from Derbyshire. While he boasted 50 championship wickets in 2022, he took 27 the following year, but only played five Championship matches last season. Australian seamer Brendan Doggett will play County Championship matches in April and May. The 30-year-old seamer plays for South Australia and has 157 first-class wickets to his name.\nThen there's the likes of ever-dependable all-rounder Ben Raine. Matthew Potts is important to the team too, when England allow him to be available. Seventeen-year-old James Minto looks a good prospect and fellow bowler Daniel Hogg will be looking to push on after a career-best 7-66 against Notts in Chester-le-Street.\n2024 season - Fourth in Division One\nVictoria Polley - BBC Radio Essex\nThere's been change at the top for Essex over the winter with Chris Silverwood returning to the club as director of cricket. \nEssex won successive titles (Div 2 & 1) in his previous tenure as head coach, including a first County Championship win in 25 years, before England came calling. \nWith his assistant Anthony McGrath taking over from then up until last season, it will hopefully be a more seamless transition than these changes can sometimes be.\nDean Elgar was vital at the top of the order last season but who will open alongside him is the big question? Do Essex give a chance to teenager Charlie Allison who has impressed in the white-ball formats? They have other options in the likes of Nick Browne or Robin Das, or even bumping Paul Walter or Michael Pepper up higher.\nJordan Cox was also key with the bat last season but has had a torrid winter, denied an England Test debut by a thumb injury. International opportunities could affect his availability.\nAn international call-up still eludes bowler Sam Cook but England's loss is very much Essex's gain - alongside Jamie Porter and Simon Harmer, it's a potent bowling attack.\nIt would've been strengthened with the signing of Shardul Thakur but his late involvement in the IPL has ruled him out of a move to Chelmsford, and Essex continue to hunt for a replacement.\nIt's been six years since Essex last won a County Championship title and they continue to punch above their weight in competing at the top end of the table. \nThey might not have the squad size and budgets of other counties but there's still plenty of talent and experience among the Essex ranks. Can Silverwood add more silverware to his Essex collection on his Chelmsford return?\n2024 season - Sixth in Division Two\nNick Webb - BBC Radio Wales Sport\nThe arrival of Richard Dawson as head coach after the unexpected departure of Grant Bradburn is the main change at Sophia Gardens, with the squad looking remarkably similar to last season. \nThe second One-Day Cup triumph in four years put a gloss on an otherwise disappointing 2024 campaign as Glamorgan showed only marginal improvement in the T20 Blast and fell away in the latter stages of the Championship promotion race.\nKey factors in the Championship will be finding a consistent opening partnership to go with the settled top order of Sam Northeast, Kiran Carlson, Colin Ingram and Chris Cooke, as well as getting the most out of a seam attack lacking raw pace. \nEddie Byrom, unlucky with injury in several seasons, is the most likely starter up top but his partner could be one of four or five candidates. \nSri Lankan Asitha Fernando is likely to partner Timm van der Gugten with the new ball in the opening stages of the season, while it will be interesting to see if on-loan England off-spinner Shoaib Bashir makes an impact as cover for Mason Crane early on when pitches usually don't help the twirlers.\nThere is little doubt that young all-rounder Ben Kellaway will become a regular in all formats sooner or later, but being thrown in as a red-ball opener was maybe a step too far. \nHis ambidextrous spin is a unique selling point added to some hard hitting in the middle order. \nOverall the county needs to manage a fair degree of change in the medium term, with a fair few of their stalwarts well past the 30 mark.\nJames Bracey played two Test matches for England in 2021\n2024 season - Seventh in Division Two\nEd Seabourne - BBC Radio Bristol\nGloucestershire approach the 2025 season with a renewed sense of ambition, keen to ensure this campaign isn't looked back on as the previous September's hangover.\nWhilst 2024 will always be remembered for the remarkable run to the county's first T20 Blast trophy, head coach Mark Alleyne made no bones about the fact he was disappointed to have ended so far behind the promotion spots in the County Championship.\nDespite the final positioning, significant strides forward were made on the batting side. \nWicketkeeper James Bracey is following a stellar year that saw him achieve the rare double of 1,000 runs and 50 dismissals, and there is increasing competition for spots in the top order.\nThe signing of Australian all-rounder Cameron Green for five matches will only add to that, and there is even hope he will be allowed to bowl towards the end of his stay.\nThe club possesses a group of promising young pace bowlers, including recent England Lions call-ups Zaman Akhter and Ajeet Singh Dale, and newly appointed Championship skipper Cameron Bancroft has spoken of his excitement in working with them.\nThe departure of Zafar Gohar, however, means the squad is without a proven red-ball spinner, and, especially with the dry spring, the serious question will be whether there is enough variety in the attack in its current form to force wins on a consistent basis.\n2024 season - Second in Division One\nKevan James - BBC Radio Solent\nTrying to improve on their second-place finish in the Championship last season may depend on a dip in form from Surrey, but also how Hampshire cope without being able to call upon two very influential players.\nJames Vince, the captain and leader of the batting line-up, has decided red-ball cricket is no longer for him. Mo Abbas, taker of 180 wickets over the past four seasons, has been moved on.\nVeteran Mark Stoneman looks a shrewd signing to partially or maybe fully offset the hole left by Vince.\nOn the bowling front, exciting prospects Sonny Baker and John Turner will be given more responsibility. They will certainly add pace.\nA disappointing T20 campaign will hopefully be turned around by the addition of two hard-hitting South Africans in Lhaun-dre Pretorius and Dewald Brevis.\nPretorius, 19, was the top run scorer in the recent SA20 competition, while Brevis finished the tournament with the top strike rate of 180.\nBy all accounts Pretorius has the potential to be world class very quickly.\n2024 season - 10th in Division One (relegated)\nMatt Cole - BBC Radio Kent\nThe summer of 2024 was a pretty dismal affair for both club and supporters. In the Championship they found themselves outgunned, particularly in the bowling department, and never really looked like they were escaping the drop from Division One they'd so narrowly avoided the year before.\nPerhaps more worrying was the T20 Blast campaign. The Spitfires - perennial contenders for the knockout stages - won just four of 14 games and finished bottom of the South Group. The One-Day Cup didn't add much encouragement for supporters desperate for something to hope for.\nKent come into the new season though with Adam Hollioake replacing Matt Walker as head coach. It's the former Surrey and England all-rounder's first time in the role for a county side and players and supporters alike have received the appointment with some excitement.\nThe playing ranks have been bolstered by new signings \u2013 Chris Benjamin moving from Warwickshire hoping to reinvigorate his career as an all-formats batter.\nKent's bowling was the major cause for concern last season, both injuries and lack of form making them look toothless at times. A double signing of seamers just before the start of the campaign is looking to address that \u2013 recent Test debutant for Pakistan, Kashif Ali, and experienced South African pace man Keith Dudgeon are in place for the first part of the campaign.\nThey've also added Corey Flintoff \u2013 son of Andrew, brother of Rocky \u2013 to the squad, the fast-bowling all-rounder joining on a rookie contract.\nWith Aussie bowlers Wes Agar and Tom Rogers returning for the T20 Blast, it appears more of an evolution than a revolution at Canterbury this summer.\nBut if Hollioake can get the best out of the squad they could be among the front-runners for promotion back to the top division of the Championship and a return to upsetting the big budget sides in the Blast.\nRocky Flintoff played four County Championship matches for Lancashire last season\n2024 season - Ninth in Division One (relegated)\nScott Read - BBC Radio Lancashire\nSince winning the County Championship title in 2011, Lancashire have been relegated four times. \nOn the previous three occasions they've won promotion straight back to Division One. \nThey'll be expected to continue that trend this season and will start as firm favourites. \nEven without James Anderson for the first month, the Red Rose have a healthy blend of senior professionals and young players making their way in the game. \nThe overseas signings of Marcus Harris and Anderson Phillip look like excellent business. \nPhillip, for the first 11 games, will provide some extra pace, Harris for the entire season to open the batting. \nThe arrival of the Australian opener will also allow Luke Wells to bat at six giving Lancashire some much-needed experience in the middle order. \nLancashire have some fine young players who endured a tough season for the club last year. A year on from that, the likes of Matty Hurst, George Balderson and George Bell should prosper. \nFor Hurst, almost 700 runs at an average of 32 in his debut season for a relegated team was an impressive return. \nThere will also be plenty of opportunities for Tom Aspinwall and Rocky Flintoff, who does not turn 17 until next week.\nAnderson not ruling out playing for three more years\nBancroft's winning experience 'boosts' Gloucestershire\nBairstow named new Yorkshire red-ball captain  \n2024 season - Fifth in Division Two\nRichard Rae - BBC Radio Leicester\nThe return of Peter Handscomb, who made 894 runs in 14 Championship innings at an average of 74.5 last season, the signing of Shan Masood from June onwards, the presence at the top of the order of the talented Rishi Patel and the fact most of the bowlers have legitimate claims to be described as all-rounders, should mean Leicestershire are not short of runs this season. \nNor, if the likes of Patel, Sol Budinger, Rehan Ahmed and Louis Kimber find form, will they score those runs slowly.\nThe big question is whether they have the firepower to bowl teams out twice. \nLast season, Leicestershire took the lowest number of wickets (139) in Division Two by some distance, and some supporters have argued the signing of New Zealand-born Netherlands international Logan van Beek adds to their ranks of bowling all-rounders rather than gives the Foxes the cutting edge they need to break games open.\nTall young left-arm prospect Josh Hull has that potential, but has spent the close season struggling with injury.\nThere is hope in the pre-season performances of the likes of veteran Chris Wright and the promising Tom Scriven, while Ben Green's return from Somerset for the first seven Championship matches adds depth.\n2024 season - Third in Division Two\nKevin Hand - BBC Radio London\nThe signing of New Zealand batter Kane Williamson is something of a coup for a county that are operating under strict financial restrictions imposed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).\nThe rearrangement of the budget for wage allocation within the squad meant a number of players were released last season, including the tough decision to let the popular former England opener Mark Stoneman go.\nWith the evergreen opener Sam Robson aging well and Leus de Plooy a gun player in all formats, Middlesex have a top order to be feared -  probably for the first time since Robson, Nick Gubbins and Nick Compton formed a top three that played a huge part in the 2016 Championship winning side.\nThe mark of the Middlesex team under former director of cricket Angus Fraser, who took charge in 2009, was the regular ability to blast through teams with the ball.\nIn the absence of the retired Tim Murtagh, Middlesex struggled to rattle through the wickets last year and captain Toby Roland-Jones bore a heavy burden on that front. \nIt was refreshing to see the right-armer clear of injury for the season and his team will desperately need that once more if they are to be promoted.\nThe former England international will have his workload eased this year by the arrival of South African seamer Dane Paterson, another crucial addition to the squad that could make a significant difference to a side that looked on course for promotion for most of last season.\nThe signings of Williamson and Paterson to bolster the Championship side are a clear indication that Middlesex want success to return in the shape of promotion this year.\nDarren Lehmann was Australia head coach between 2013 and 2018\n2024 season - Fourth in Division Two\nAndrew Radd - BBC Radio Northamptonshire\nThe arrival of Australian Darren Lehmann as head coach at Wantage Road has triggered a wave of pre-season positivity in a squad left feeling somewhat bruised by the events of the past couple of years.\nAfter being relegated from Division One in 2023 they failed to register a Division Two win in 2024 until September, by which time Lehmann's predecessor John Sadler had lost his job following defeat in the T20 Blast quarter-finals.\nWith opener Emilio Gay and fast bowler Jack White both heading north, to Durham and Yorkshire respectively, there will be opportunities for others to shine. \nYoung batters Krish Patel (who opened his account with five boundaries on first-class debut at Headingley last September) and Aadi Sharma have much to offer, while the seam attack has been bolstered by the signings of Dom Leech, left-armer Liam Guthrie and \u2013 for the four Championship fixtures in May \u2013 Harry Conway from South Australia. \nGeorge Scrimshaw and the hugely promising Raphy Weatherall suffered injuries last season and will be eager to re-establish themselves.\nMuch will depend \u2013 certainly in four-day cricket - on the tried-and-trusted trio of Luke Procter, Ben Sanderson and Rob Keogh. \nIndian leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal had a major impact towards the end of 2024 and returns this year for a longer second-half stint.\nOther key figures across all formats will be Saif Zaib, who \u2013 to the relief of supporters \u2013 agreed a contract extension until at least the end of 2027, plus a couple of upwardly-trending all-rounders in Justin Broad, son of former tennis star Neil and named the county's Media Player of the Year last season, and Gus Miller.\n2024 season - Eighth in Division One\nDave Bracegirdle - BBC Radio Nottinghamshire\nYazz knew what she was on about, didn't she? 'The Only Way Is Up' was not only a catchy hit single but is also a good place to approach Nottinghamshire's hopes for 2025.\nHead coach Peter Moores has emphasised that it's important to learn from what went wrong last year, as well as draw a line underneath it. \nAs a brief reminder, Notts narrowly avoided relegation from Division One of the County Championship, finished bottom of their group in the T20 Blast and barely raised a pulse in the One-Day Cup.\nSo what might be different this time around?\nThe only domestic signing sees Conor McKerr join from Surrey but with Josh Tongue now fully fit, those two bolster a fast-bowling unit that promises untold riches. \nIf Notts can keep Olly Stone healthy, alongside overseas recruits in Australia's Fergus O'Neill and Pakistan's Mohammad Abbas, throw in the evergreen Brett Hutton and the raw pace of Rob Lord, then their resources seem well stocked.\nTeenagers Farhan Ahmed and Freddie McCann both made their county debuts towards the back end of last season and already carry the weight of expectation.\nThe prodigious spinning fingers of 17-year old Ahmed have already marked him out as a generational talent, while 19-year-old team-mate McCann hit two centuries in just seven innings.\nSome astute observers are already wondering if Kyle Verreynne is the best wicketkeeper-batter in the world right now. The county fought off a lot of competition to secure the services of the South African for the whole campaign.\nThat just leaves the top order. While Trent Bridge members may not see too much of England's Ben Duckett once again, there are guaranteed runs from skipper Haseeb Hameed and the gifted Joe Clarke, both as good as any in the county game.\nShoaib Bashir will join Glamorgan on loan for the first three County Championship games of the season\n2024 season - Third in Division One\nAnthony Gibson - BBC Radio Somerset\nWith a strong and settled squad of players shrewdly captained by Lewis Gregory, and terrific team spirit, Somerset go into the new season with every hope of marking the club's 150th anniversary with a first County Championship.\nInjuries permitting, Matt Henry will be back to lead a powerful seam attack, balanced by the spin of Jack Leach, rising star Archie Vaughan and, once he returns from a loan spell at Glamorgan or his England duties are over, Shoaib Bashir. \nAmong the batters, the only real question is who will partner Vaughan at the top of the order, Sean Dickson being the most likely answer. \nThe three Toms - Lammonby, Abell and Banton - will once again make up the engine room of the batting, with James Rew ready to reinforce his reputation as one of the most promising wicketkeeper-batters in the country.\nUnlike the infinitely talented Will Smeed, who is happily returning to the red-ball fold, Tom Kohler-Cadmore will focus on the white ball and the Blast, so that the firepower which has seen Somerset reach Finals Day in each of the past three seasons remains very much intact.\nFor Somerset's team of youngsters to have reached the One-Day Cup Final last year was a surprise, but they can by no means be discounted. James Rew's younger brother, Thomas, will surely come into that side, and what a prospect he is.\nLast year was a case of so near and yet so far - in contention for all three trophies, ending up with none. \nThe team will have learned from that, and if they can graft staying power onto all their other strengths, this could, at last, be Somerset's season.\nTom Lawes is one of a number of exciting all-rounders at Surrey\n2024 season - First in Division One (champions)\nMark Church - BBC Radio London\nThere is no reason Surrey cannot win a fourth Championship title on the spin this summer. \nThey obviously know how to put all the parts together over the course of a season and the squad is much the same. \nThe addition of Matt Fisher is exciting and there will be international call-ups. But the spine of the side is solid and experienced and if someone is missing, the gap gets filled without anybody noticing.\nOne to keep an eye on is Tom Lawes. He has all the talent in the world with both bat and ball, and if he produces consistently, it would not be a surprise if he were representing England soon. He will be aiming for a permanent spot in the Championship XI but as always there is healthy competition for places.\nThere is one certainty. In terms of the Championship, Surrey will want to be better than last season. \nThey are always looking to improve, and they know everybody else is trying to catch them. \nThey will be tested, especially by the likes of Essex and Hampshire but they know how to win the Championship, and they still have all the players that have managed that in the past three years. It is a good recipe to have.\n2024 season - First in Division Two (promoted)\nAdrian Harms - BBC Radio Sussex\nThere's much excitement and anticipation on the south coast, as Sussex return to Division One after almost a decade in Division Two.\nDuring that period they have never mounted a serious promotion bid, and it's taken change at the top, and the subsequent appointment of Paul Farbrace to galvanise the club.\nFarbrace has introduced a winning mentality that had been sadly lacking, and  crucially supplemented a talented group of younger players with, in his words, \"knarled old pros\" who know how to win, and battle when the going gets tough.\nHowever, this is essentially a young Sussex side most with no experience of first division cricket, and therefore the experience of Australian Daniel Hughes, skipper John Simpson and Ollie Robinson will be crucial particularly during the opening weeks of the season.\nBut don't think Sussex will be a soft touch and are back in Division One for the ride.\nProvided the top order can score enough runs, they have a match-winning spinner in Jack Carson and are especially difficult to beat at Hove, where they haven't lost since Farbrace took the helm.\nSussex have taken nine long years to return to Division One, and the feeling around the club is that's where they want to stay.\nJacob Bethell's game time at Edgbaston is likely to be limited this season\n2024 season - Seventh in Division One\nMike Taylor - BBC Radio WM\nA confusing winter followed a confusing summer. \nOften in 2024 it seemed something was going to happen for Warwickshire - they were front-runners in both white-ball tournaments, and frequently built strong early positions in Championship games. \nAnd then nothing happened. No white-ball final, only one four-day win. \nSeveral leading players had outstanding individual seasons - runs for the captain Alex Davies, wickets for Olly Hannon-Dalby, both for Ed Barnard, England calls for Jacob Bethell and Dan Mousley - but the total, somehow, came to less than the sum of the parts. \nA detailed high-performance review had seemed, from the outside, to have also come to no significant conclusion, the exit of performance director Gavin Larsen being unrelated, until head coach Mark Robinson suddenly left seven weeks ago.\nNow, there is both change and continuity. Ian Westwood, a known and trusted leader, is promoted to replace Robinson. \nThe patient, determined approach he showed as an opening bat and captain in testing circumstances should serve him well. \nA collection of overseas players also mixes the familiar and the new. Hasan Ali is already popular at Edgbaston, while Beau Webster has the qualities that should see him thrive mid-summer. \nHopefully all will avoid the bad luck with injuries that has so weighed Warwickshire down in recent years, and has hit Tom Latham before he even arrives.\nEdgbaston is always a busy place, but had become grumpy in the stands by last September, with so much promise unfulfilled. \nHaving seemed at times to be pushing on all fronts at once, they had gone nowhere. The club has a lot of moving parts but no shortage of talent. \nIf Davies and Westwood can steer the team in a clear direction, and maintain a strong challenge at least in one competition, it will be a year of progress.\n2024 season - Sixth in Division One\nGed Scott - BBC Sport online's Pears reporter\nA long, hard, emotional season eventually blossomed into some happiness for Worcestershire in 2024.\nIn between all the trauma of not being able to play their first home game at flood-hit Worcester until 25 May then came the devastating loss of one of their players, Josh Baker, at the tragically early age of just 20.\nBut the spirit the Pears showed in adversity could only be admired.\nThey gave a string of youngsters their chance in an unexpectedly progressive One-Day Cup campaign \u2013 and, either side of the mid-summer County Championship break, they produced three huge red-ball victories on the trot.\nThat not only helped them stay in the top flight, it was enough to catapult them up to sixth - their highest finish since two-division cricket began in 2000. Finishing above both neighbours Warwickshire and also Nottinghamshire, where four of their former players are now based, was a source of particular pride and pleasure.\nBuilding on that and again keeping their place in an always competitive division is now the challenge - although they will have to do so without the retired Joe Leach, as well as Kiwi Nathan Smith, who did well over the first half of last summer but then opted to join champions Surrey.\nBut they have another New Zealand fast bowler Jacob Duffy arriving from the second game onwards. They have three more incomers in Ben Allison from Essex, Nottinghamshire spinner Fateh Singh and Australian seamer Ben Dwarshuis for the T20 Blast.\nThey also still have that same marvellous team spirit to fall back on \u2013 and a real, genuine hunger.\nLong-term doubts remain over their future at New Road - but, in the short term, prospects at Worcester are brighter than people might think.\nJonny Bairstow will captain Yorkshire in the County Championship this season\n2024 season - Second in Division Two (promoted)\nJonathan Doidge - BBC Radio Leeds\nIt is likely to be a very interesting 2025 for Yorkshire.\nWith financial concerns now, apparently, assuaged at the very moment the team has returned to the top flight of the Championship, plus a new coaching staff and new red ball and T20 captains, there should rightly be an air of optimism.\nJonny Bairstow follows in his late father David's footsteps to steer the Championship challenge. He'd love to have a title as captain on his CV but aside from captaincy, his presence alone with the bat will be huge.\nSimilarly, Dawid Malan is going to be back playing more red-ball cricket, a major plus. Add to that potent opening pair of Adam Lyth and Finlay Bean, plus James Wharton, whose career began to blossom last year in particular, and more established batters like George Hill and that end of the team should be capable of setting up games.\nAs we know, that's no good without the ability to take 20 wickets and in that department there's plenty of encouragement. \nThe outstanding Ben Coad will again lead the line. Overseas input comes from, in particular, New Zealand's Ben Sears plus Will Sutherland (two matches) and Jordan Buckingham (four) also chipping in, while there's also George Hill, Jordan Thompson, off-season recruit Jack White, plus Matt Revis and Matt Milnes, who are on the road back from injury.\nDom Bess looks likely to be this coach's first pick among the spinners, though Dan Moriarty and Jafer Chohan will want a say in that.\nWith Bairstow donning the wicketkeeping gloves, Jonathan Tattersall and Harry Duke are going to have to wait for further opportunities, unless required as batters. You'd certainly have to feel for Tattersall after he led the team back up last season - but this is professional sport.\nWith One-Day Cup centurion Will Luxton awaiting another opportunity, there'll be upward pressure with the bat and I'd be backing Ben Cliff to put some serious pressure on the more senior bowlers in the squad. He could really take his own game to the next level as the season unfolds.\nIn summary, there's optimism that head coach Anthony McGrath can take the team to places it hasn't been for quite some time.",

Last season, Leicestershire took the lowest number of wickets (139) in Division Two by some distance, and some supporters have argued the signing of New Zealand-born Netherlands international Logan van Beek adds to their ranks of bowling all-rounders rather than gives the Foxes the cutting edge they need to break games open.Tall young left-arm prospect Josh Hull has that potential, but has spent the close season struggling with injury.There is hope in the pre-season performances of the likes of veteran Chris Wright and the promising Tom Scriven, while Ben Green's return from Somerset for the first seven Championship matches adds depth.Middlesex - 'Williamson signing a coup'2024 season - Third in Division TwoKevin Hand - BBC Radio LondonThe signing of New Zealand batter Kane Williamson is something of a coup for a county that are operating under strict financial restrictions imposed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).The rearrangement of the budget for wage allocation within the squad meant a number of players were released last season, including the tough decision to let the popular former England opener Mark Stoneman go.With the evergreen opener Sam Robson aging well and Leus de Plooy a gun player in all formats, Middlesex have a top order to be feared -  probably for the first time since Robson, Nick Gubbins and Nick Compton formed a top three that played a huge part in the 2016 Championship winning side.The mark of the Middlesex team under former director of cricket Angus Fraser, who took charge in 2009, was the regular ability to blast through teams with the ball.In the absence of the retired Tim Murtagh, Middlesex struggled to rattle through the wickets last year and captain Toby Roland-Jones bore a heavy burden on that front.

        "article_text": "Richard Burton was a global icon - famed for his powerful, baritone voice and passionate yet tumultuous relationship with fellow megastar Elizabeth Taylor.\nBut until now, few had ever heard of Philip Burton.\nPhilip was Richard's school teacher who spotted his potential, became his legal guardian, lent him his name and helped propel him to international stardom.\n\"It was a friendship built for the ages, an unlikely friendship,\" said Ed Talfan, a producer on new biopic Mr Burton, which was released in UK cinemas on Friday.\nThe film tells the story of Richard's difficult early life in Port Talbot, south Wales.\nPhilip, played by Toby Jones, is portrayed as a serious and cultured man who, alongside teaching English, writes and produces plays.\nScrappy young schoolboy Richard, played by Harry Lawtey, has ambitions to become an actor, so Philip teaches him to stand up straight and transforms his speaking voice by getting him to round his vowels, pronounce his consonants and project.\nBut in fact the two men's backgrounds were more similar than their demeanours ever suggested - and his role in Richard's life would prove to be transformative.\nPhilip grew up 30 miles (48km) from Richard in Mountain Ash, Rhondda Cynon Taf.\n\"Philip had a rather tragic and lonely childhood,\" said historian and Philip's biographer Prof Angela John, who acted as an informal consultant on the film.\n\"His father was killed in a pit accident when Philip was only 14... he wasn't that close to his mother and he'd been very close to his father.\"\nPhilip was an avid reader and theatre lover who won a scholarship to Cardiff University to read Maths when he was only 16. \n\"In a way he forged a whole new persona,\" said Angela.\n\"He had sort of ironed out his Welsh accent because unfortunately in those days, if you wanted to get on and if you wanted to be taken seriously in England... you had to sadly get rid of your accent.\"\nRichard, born Richard Jenkins in 1925, was twenty years Philip's junior.\nHe would have been one of 13 children, but two died in infancy.\nWhen Richard was two years old, his mother died from septicaemia after giving birth to a younger brother. \n\"He was a working-class young man growing up in, I think it's fair to say, abject poverty,\" said Ed.\nRichard ended up living with his sister, her husband who was a miner, and their two young daughters. \n\"The outlook for him was really, really tough. If you're a betting person, you'd have just said, 'well he's going to end up down the mines or at the steelworks',\" he said. \nAngela, who has written Behind the Scenes: The Dramatic Lives of Philip Burton, said Richard's family was \"large\" and \"caring\".\n\"So even though his father had drink problems and there wasn't that much money around, they gave whatever they could,\" she added.\nRichard and Philip's relationship really began after Richard was forced to leave school at 16 to support his family by getting a job.\nPhilip, who had taught Richard at school, decided to step in.\n\"[Philip] was able, as a result of several key figures in Port Talbot... to get Richard back into school, which is a pretty unusual thing to return to school when you've left,\" said Angela. \nWith conditions somewhat cramped at his sister's home, Richard moved into the house of Ma Smith, where Philip was a lodger.\n\"And then from that point Richard was being trained, in effect daily, by Philip,\" said Angela. \nPhilip became Richard's legal ward, taking full responsibility for him, and then Richard Jenkins changed his name to Richard Burton.\n\"That happened for several reasons,\" explained Angela. \n\"It's an awful thing to say these days, but [Richard] would be in a better position to have a name like Burton, which was seen less as a sort of working-class Welsh name.\n\"Also, in effect Philip was taking responsibility for Richard and was already a well-respected person in the theatre world himself, so it gave Richard again a further opportunity.\"\nIn the film, Richard's biological father, played by Steffan Rhodri, is suspicious of Philip's interest in his son, but happy to take a wad of cash in return for signing papers to hand over legal responsibility.\nPrevious biographies have gone further, suggesting Philip's interest in Richard was sexual. \n\"My take is perhaps rather different,\" said Angela.\n\"There is no evidence or proof whatsoever that there was any problem there or that Richard actually found it a problem. \n\"What I will say is that Philip was gay... much later in life when he lived in America he had one known long-term relationship, so I think in some instances this is people putting two and two together and making 25.\"\nEd was in agreement. \n\"The people I've spoken to and the people the team have spoken to who knew Richard and Philip personally, and from the vast majority of biographies, our takeaway is that Philip's motives were good, honest and pure,\" he said. \nPhilip's connections gave Richard his acting break, according to Angela.\nAfter building a reputation in the theatre, Richard made his screen debut in 1949 in The Last Days of Dolwyn.\nHe went on to be regarded by many as the finest actor ever to emerge from Wales, starring in films including Cleopatra and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\nIn 1960 he won a Tony Award for his performance as King Arthur in Camelot on Broadway. He was nominated seven times for an Oscar but never won.\nRichard was married five times, twice consecutively to Elizabeth Taylor.\nMeanwhile Philip went on to work on almost 200 radio programmes, producing work by Dylan Thomas.\nHe reinvented himself in the mid-1950s, moving to the US where he became the first director of the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in New York.  \nRichard and Philip remained close throughout their lives apart from a two-year period when they were not in contact. \n\"Philip wouldn't talk to Richard because he was so loyal to Sybil, Richard's first wife,\" said Angela.  \nShe said it was Elizabeth Taylor who, despite having not met Philip at this point, reunited the pair. \n\"[Richard] was trying to get his head around the Gielgud production of Hamlet and was having some difficulties with it... so [Elizabeth] phoned [Philip] and asked him if he would come to help Richard,\" Angela said.\nShe said Philip and Elizabeth's friendship continued after Richard's death in 1984 from a cerebral haemorrhage.\n\"When Philip was dying, Elizabeth went to visit him in hospital in Florida and the nurse on the ward said she nearly fell over when she saw who the visitor was,\" said Angela.\nPhilip died in 1995, at the age of 90. \nEd believes the story of their relationship will resonate with many.\n\"It's almost a cliche that everybody remembers a great teacher, but it's cliche for a reason because you only need one in your life and it's transformative,\" he said. \nAngela hopes the film will allow Philip to take his own place in history.\n\"It clearly helps to make Philip better known to the world, which I think he does deserve to be,\" she said. \n\"He deserves to be known in his own right because he actually was a remarkable man.\"\nRichard's daughter, Kate, said it was \"very emotional\" being on set and watching the \"extraordinary\" performances of the actors who portrayed her father and grandfather.\n\"Just seeing those two incredible actors play these two very important men in my life... it was the weirdest, strangest thing,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\"I thought this is looking really wonderful and very authentic. That was the thing that was making me the most happy.\"\nMr Burton, produced by Severn Screen, BBC Wales and Ffilm Cymru Wales, is in UK cinemas from 4 April 2025.",

With seven games left and 12 points to make up on fourth-bottom Wolves, the battle to stay up looks over. \nJorgen Strand Larsen's scrappy 84th-minute goal settled a tense encounter between the two relegation rivals after Pablo Sarabia had cancelled out a Town opener from Liam Delap.\nDefeat pushed the Tractor Boys closer to the drop in a game they simply had to win. Their fairytale rise from League One to the top flight in successive seasons looks certain to end with an immediate return to the Championship. \nWolves' comeback success at Portman Road crucially stretched them further clear of the bottom three and even Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna conceded their fight for survival looks bleak.\n\"I think it's certainly more than likely on the balance of probabilities,\" he said when asked about the prospect of relegation. \"Not that I don't think we can't finish the season strongly, but Wolves are a strong side and the chance of them losing all their games is really low. \n\"The likelihood is we'll fall short of our ultimate dream.\"\nWhen Ipswich won 2-1 at Wolves in December through Jack Taylor's last-gasp header - which ended Gary O'Neil's managerial reign at Molineux - they moved three points above Wolves.\nTown were still third bottom at the time, but just a point behind Crystal Palace, while second-bottom Wolves were four adrift of safety.\nFast forward five months and defeat at Portman Road leaves them needing one of the greatest of escapes. \nThe biggest deficit overcome by a side to stay up after 30 matches of a Premier League season was West Ham United in 2006-07. \nAt that stage, Alan Curbishley's men were eight points from safety, having been 10 behind a match earlier. Ipswich have a game less and a bigger gap.\nBradford City, in 1999-2000, and Fulham, in 2007-08, came from six points behind to survive with just five matches left, but it seems fanciful for the Tractor Boys to think of achieving that.\nJust seven of their 20 points have been won in Suffolk this season, a huge Achilles heel for a newly promoted side. Just one victory - 2-0 against Chelsea in December - has been celebrated at Portman Road and they have now lost six successive home league games for only the second time in their history, matching a wretched run in 1963 when they went on to be relegated too.\nLeicester have won nine points at home, while bottom club Southampton's sorry season is epitomised by the five points they have earned at St Mary's and they will be relegated if they fail to win at Tottenham on Sunday. \n\"You can look at different games, Liverpool, Fulham, [Aston] Villa we started really well, then came up short in terms of trying to break teams down, like the Crystal Palace game,\" reflected McKenna. \n\"We have had a few high energy games and the other teams have punished us. Today it was a spirited and committed performance but not enough to win. We are talking about small sample sizes. \n\"It's strange not to have more wins at home than away. I don't think there's one outstanding reason. If there was, we would have found it and sorted it.\"\nIn contrast, Wolves have earned 10 points from their seven home games since Vitor Pereira replaced O'Neil in December. \nUnder the Portuguese, Wolves have won more points than the three promoted sides put together - 23 from 15 games, scoring 19 goals and conceding 19.\nThe bottom three have won 16 points from a combined 43 games in that time (Ipswich eight, Southampton five and Leicester three). \nNo side has dropped more points from winning positions in the top flight this season than Ipswich (25) and they have simply not been competitive enough.\nThey have led against Fulham (twice), Manchester City, Aston Villa,(twice), Brentford, Leicester, Bournemouth, Manchester United and now Wolves and failed to win. \nEven Liam Delap's 12 goals have been unable to help them bridge the gap at this level. He has scored 38.71% of Ipswich's 31 this season - only Alexander Isak (41%), Mohamed Salah (39%) and Erling Haaland (36.8%) have higher figures in this campaign.\n\"There will be plenty of time to talk about it, analyse it and reflect on the positives and negatives,\" added McKenna. \n\"We knew coming into this nine-game block the balance of probabilities was really small, but we committed as a group to show the right values and show full commitment. \n\"We have Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Arsenal here after that, Newcastle at St James' Park and Everton in one of the last games at Goodison. \n\"We have some fantastic fixtures coming up for a club who haven't been into the Premier League for 22 years. \n\"I know today is a big setback and it hurts, but I know the players and supporters and everyone are going to muster up the energy to compete as well as we can in the last few games.\" \nThis video can not be played\nIpswich \u2018sad\u2019 as relegation looms \u2013 McKenna",

        "article_text": "Is it simply the modern language of football? Or just \"jargon\" dressing up the game's time-honoured glossary of terms in fancy new clothes?\nFrom a \"low block\" to a \"high press\", football's phrase book has gained countless new entries in recent years that have become part of the conversations before, during and after games.\nThese words alone spark debate from supporters to players past and present, from the cynics who dismiss them, to the newer generation who embrace them as an integral part of the football experience.\nBBC Sport pundits Pat Nevin and Chris Sutton, who have to decide which to use or avoid, have outspoken views on the subject.\nFormer Scotland forward Nevin says: \"I think it's just jargon used in every industry. It is showing someone you're in a little cosy club. You are saying 'we know about these things' and it makes you sound a bit cleverer.\n\"It is saying 'we're in the club, we're in the know - you're not'. I never use them, or if I do I immediately apologise or flag it up. \n\"For instance, I might say a team is defending really deep, then add 'or as they say in the modern parlance, a low block'.\"\nSutton said: \"It's just the evolution of the game. They're just different words aren't they? I'm not one who gets too stuck in the past - but there might be one I take real umbrage with.\"\nSo what are these modern terms? And what do they really mean?\nThe official description, according to statisticians Opta and data firm Second Spectrum, is when \"a defensive team has recently lost the ball and has not had time to re-organise its defensive shape. [The team] is out of position, and is either pressing or actively moving to get back into a stable defensive position\".\nNevin: \"The gold standard of the new jargon. It says you probably don't know what you're talking about, but you want people to think you are.\n\"I have never used it, other than facetiously. There should be a ban on it. Let's invoke a three-strike-and-out transitions law. \n\"Use it once as a co-commentator and you get a stern look, twice a yellow card, then three times you're on your way.\n\"What does it mean? You've given the ball away again. That's it.\n\"When coaches say they have to work on transitions, they should just not give the ball away and be better.\"\nSutton: \"I've always thought transition is when you win the ball back. It's a change isn't it? It's what the word means. Change from defending to attacking.\"\nA \"low block\", as defined by Opta, is the starting position of your team from your own goal.\nInterestingly, Nottingham Forest - third in the Premier League and heading towards the Champions League - are currently second-lowest with a starting position of 39.6 metres, sandwiched in between Southampton (39.8 metres) and Ipswich Town (39.4 metres) who are both almost certainly heading back to the Championship.\nNevin: \"Nottingham Forest suggests an exception and a successful strategy, but my overall definition is it means you're not good enough as a team, you can't get the ball out, so you defend deep.\n\"There you go - it's defending deep. It's just easier to say 'we're playing in a low block' rather than admit you're not good enough to play out so we have to sit back and play on the break.\n\"It's a fairly modern, generational thing. You can spot it a mile away. You can't wear a big sticker saying 'I've got my coaching badges' but this is almost telling people you've read the manuals and you've got your badges.\"\nSutton: \"It's the new phrase for defending your own box or defending deeply. I don't know where some of these phrases come from.\"\nThis is a defensive tactic where a team places its defenders higher up the pitch. Much focus has been placed on the \"high line\" Ange Postecoglou employs at Tottenham Hotspur, but the current highest line in the top flight is Manchester City at 45.9 metres.\nNevin: \"This is the one I'm absolutely fine with, because it is descriptive and perfectly explains what is happening to someone who may not know football very well. \n\"It's probably much older than the rest of the cliches and I would say it would have been used when I played.\"\nSutton: \"Fine by me. Making sure the distance between defenders and midfield isn't too great, teams can't play through out and you look to catch careless forwards offside. \n\"If you use this phrase, listeners or viewers will understand exactly what you mean.\"\nThis means defending high up the pitch to force the opposition into mistakes.\nNevin: \"New jargon. Been done for years. It's not a new Pep Guardiola thing. 'The Crazy Gang' at Wimbledon used to do it when I played and were brilliant at it.\n\"The old phrase was 'closing down'. You close the opposition down and get right in their faces high up the pitch. It's been rebranded as some new concept but every team used to do it.\n\"The recent great Barcelona sides were the high watermark, but it started in the 1970s when Johan Cruyff used to do it with Ajax. I did it for the first time in under-15s football at Celtic Boys Club.\n\"When I played, we usually did with a sign, which could be anything, but the favourite sign was 'when you see that big useless centre-back get the ball, all go in to try and make him give the ball away'.\"\nSutton: \"If someone talked to me about a 'high press' when I was playing, I would have thought they were telling me to iron my shirt.\n\"It's closing down and I suspect Herbert Chapman's great Arsenal side in the 1930s was doing this.\n\"It's a classic from people who think football didn't exist before 2010 and the '60s, '70s and '80s never happened. Do they think players of that era just stood around in a rigid 4-4-2 and didn't run or close down?\"\nWimbledon - pioneers of the high press?\nThis is when teams try to win the ball back quickly after conceding possession, to avoid being hit on the counter-attack by their opponents and potentially starting an attack of their own.\nNevin: \"It's not one I've come across too much but you press up to try and retrieve the ball immediately. Seems simple enough.\"\nSutton: \"I used this phrase north of the border and got absolutely rinsed by my fellow pundits. \n\"I meant when you won the ball back high up quickly by shutting down the opposition. Just another version of the press, and you're then on the counter-attack.\"\nHigh turnovers, as measured by Opta metrics, are \"the number of possessions that start in open play and begin 40 metres or less from the opponent's goal\".\nNevin: \"Of limited use. Winning the ball back high up the pitch.\"\nSutton: \"When someone mentions 'turnovers' to me I think of the apple things you used to buy in shops. \n\"You hear all this stats-based stuff now and it's basically winning the ball in the opposition half, that's all.\"\nSpurs boss Postecoglou called this \"the most useless statistic in world football. Seriously, it could fall off your backside, fall to somebody on the halfway line who scores and it's an assist. It doesn't impress me\".\nThe Opta definition is simple - the player who passes the ball to the player who scores.\nNevin: \"I like assists because I got far more assists than goals in my playing career, but Ange makes a great point. I used to keep a record of them. I agree with Ange, but as a phrase people do know what it means.\n\"I was always a bit miffed on the other side of that argument when I beat seven men, drew the keeper and passed it to John Aldridge to tap in at Tranmere.\"\nSutton: \"I take Ange's point. There could be a proper assist but what if the ball hits you on the backside? Is that really an assist? \n\"And what about when a player lets the ball run through his legs, or draws a defender out of position. That's one for the nerds and laptop crunchers.\"\nUsually the assist maker, Nevin celebrates a rare goal instead\nThis is measured by simply adding assists and goals.\nNevin: \"I hate the wording but I'm OK with the concept. I think the new purveyors of football parlance need to up their game a bit here. It needs a better phrase. Very simplistic this one, but I'm fine with what it stands for.\"\nSutton: \"It used to just be goals, but now this has been added. Next throw-ins and corners will be in there, all sorts of things. I think people do get what it means, though.\"\nTypically a striker (often wearing number nine) dropping deeper into midfield to link play, disturb the opponents' defence and make space for others, rather than playing in the traditional forward's role.\nNevin: \"I'm absolutely OK with this. The first time it was used to me was in 1982 at the European Under-18 championships when I was with Scotland. We won it in Finland and I was player of the tournament. We beat Czechoslovakia in the final so I was very happy with it.\n\"The coaches were Andy Roxburgh and Walter Smith. Andy ended up becoming Uefa's first technical director. He used a phrase 'unreal nine' or 'false nine'. It simply means no-one playing as as a traditional centre forward. It is a false striker.\n\"We rotated it with Scotland between myself, Ally Dick of Spurs and Gary Mackay of Hearts. We had two wide attackers and a false nine but all three of us could do all three jobs.\"\nSutton: \"What is the difference between a 'false nine' and 'number 10'? Think of Roberto Firmino at Liverpool. Someone who is essentially a forward who drops deep to show for the ball and link everything.\n\"At Blackburn when we won the title, we played 4-4-2 but a striker would drop deep when the opposition had the ball to attach themselves to a midfielder. Is that the same thing?\"\nThree phrases for the price of one. Effectively a defensive midfielder - or two - used by some teams to act as a shield for defence and link the whole side together. As the word means, \"a central point\".\nNevin: \"It's just a new name for the deep-lying central midfield player. In South America they would call that a 'five'. It is trying to pigeonhole all of them into one simple term.\n\"Chelsea play with two pivots, two 'sixes'. It's 4-3-3 with two deep-lying midfield players. It was used with Scotland when I played. Graeme Souness could do that easily and brilliantly.\n\"Chelsea do it all the time with Moises Caicedo and they have Enzo Fernandez, Romeo Lavia and are asking Reece James to do it as well.\"\nSutton: \"I don't know where this 'pivot' thing came from. It was a defensive midfielder, then a holding midfielder - and now we've got pivot.\n\"The 'pivots' I played with were Neil Lennon at Celtic and David Batty at Blackburn. Strong defensive holding midfield players.\"\nA full-back who moved into a more central possession when their team has the ball. Can be an extra midfielder and helps both attacking and defensive strategies.\nNevin: \"Stevie Clarke and myself did this at Chelsea. It can be described, as it used to be, as an underlapping full-back, someone stepping into midfield. [Inverted full--back] is an upgrade linguistically and one I don't mind.\n\"When I hear hybrid full-back, I can just say I won't be using that one and never will.\"\nSutton: \"I always think about left-footers playing on the right and vice-versa here, enabling them to step inside into midfield. We had Mark Bowen at Norwich City but we used to just call them attacking full-backs.\n\"As for hybrid' - that just makes me think of cars.\"\nThis is taken to mean the spaces between the edge of the penalty box towards the 'D' on either side of the area.\nNevin: \"Instantly droppable. Nonsensical. It only exists when a little gap opens up, basically just looking for a space between the striker and the midfielder. I don't think it's a very helpful phrase and is pretty meaningless.\"\nSutton: \"An absolute no-no. It's simply wrong. What a load of nonsense.\n\"How can you have a half-space? A space is a space is a space. If I dig a hole it's a hole. It is not a half-hole.\nThis phrase is believed to have originated in American football to describe an area of the field that forms around the quarterback on passing plays.\nNevin: \"Pockets of space is telling people to find space, It's just new words for the same thing.\"\nSutton: \"I get this a bit more. I think that's allowed. You can also call it a zone.\n\"I think this is the space in between the opposition defence and midfield, in the wider channels when teams play with three forwards and the highest forward will drop into spaces.\n\"As a description people will understand what you're talking about.\"\nBayern Munich and Germany's Thomas Muller has been bestowed with his own positional term\nThis is used to describe spaces between lines line of forwards and midfield players or midfield players and defenders.\nNevin: \"Teams never stand in straight lines, which is the silliness of all of this. If the formation has what you might call 'lines', you're trying to find the gaps and spaces between those lines.\n\"The last thing you do is go there between the line. You have to arrive when the ball arrives in there. That's the skill Cole Palmer is the best at it in the Premier League. Never stand there - always arrive there.\"\nSutton: \"I don't know who thought of this. Teams don't just line up in straight lines in a 4-3-3 or 4-4-2. \n\"The term itself presumably means you try to play through these so-called 'lines', mainly between the midfield and attack.\"\nAnd one to watch out for...\nThis was coined by, and has been used for, Bayern Munich's Germany attacker Thomas Muller and translates to \"space investigator\".\nMuller described himself as \"an interpreter of space\".\nNevin: \"I'll leave the German to others.\"\nSutton: \"Does what it says on the tin.\"\nThis video can not be played\nTonali's goal - a cross?

In that 10-year period, prize money for first-round losers increased from \u00a327,000 to \u00a360,000.But players have frequently pointed to the vast revenues generated by the Grand Slams, and feel they deserve a significantly larger return.In the year up to July 2023, the All England Club (AELTC) had a turnover of \u00a3380m. But once the costs of running the Championships were deducted, the operating profit was just under \u00a354m.Nearly \u00a349m of that went to the LTA, as the AELTC has agreed to pay the governing body 90% of its annual surplus until 2053.Costs include prize money, employing more than 8,000 seasonal staff, preparing and developing the site and supporting other grass court events.Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen said increased prize money would be particularly welcomed by lower-ranked players, who can struggle to make ends meet at other times of the year. \"I think that's going to benefit all the players, not only the top players, especially those that work hard during the year and need to get paid from the Grand Slams and have to survive,\" added the Chinese world number eight.

        "article_text": "Mountain gorilla conservation in Rwanda is a global success story, partly due to the significance and value placed on gorillas as part of the nation's culture and heritage, with annual celebrations of baby gorillas being born.\nIn a sunlit spot of mist-cloaked rainforest, a black, hairy mass of muscle descends surprisingly gracefully down a thick mossy vine. The huge silverback stretches out and settles in for a thorough grooming session from a female, totally unfazed by his human admirers. Two teenagers tumble into view, beating their chests and grimacing at each other, a tangle of limbs in mock combat, while an adorable baby gorilla peers shyly from her mother's arms at the unfolding family drama.\nSeeing mountain gorillas in the wild is a magical bucket list experience, but it wasn't always this way. Poachers decimated gorilla numbers in the 1960s and 70s, leaving them at risk of extinction. Then came the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Volcanoes National Park, home to most of Rwanda's mountain gorillas, became a battlefield as the civil war raged across the country, with population numbers struggling to rise above 300.\u00a0\nIt's hard to fathom how Rwanda has managed to tackle the challenges of its traumatic past in such a short space of time, let alone become a beacon of conservation success. Yet today, mountain gorillas are the only great ape whose numbers are not rapidly descending. WWF estimates that mountain gorilla numbers have risen 3% every year since 2010, moving them in the right direction from \"critically endangered\" to \"endangered\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species \u2013 and this success largely comes down to Rwanda's sustained conservation efforts, which include anti-poaching patrols, community engagement and regulated gorilla tourism, all of which have helped to protect habitats and ensure that local people benefit from the survival of these great apes.\nThree hundred and ninety-five baby gorillas have been born since 2005 in Rwanda, and each year since then these new arrivals have been celebrated in a uniquely Rwandan way. Kwita Izina, or \"to give a name\" in the country's national Kinyarwanda language, is Rwanda's huge annual gorilla naming ceremony that honours each gorgeous fuzzy baby born in Volcanoes National Park with a meaningful moniker. The ceremony, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, is inspired by the centuries-old Rwandan tradition where families and communities would gather together to name their newborns. Since Kwita Izina began, it has played a major role in raising awareness of gorilla conservation.\n\"It's a great story of success to mark this progress of a species that was in decline and on the edge,\" says Praveen Moman, founder of Volcanoes Safaris and the first international tour operator to kickstart gorilla tourism in Rwanda after the genocide. \"First it was small and local and symbolic, just for the rangers and those involved in conservation. Now the government has made this an international and recognisable event to highlight conservation success.\"\nRwandans place great significance on a person's name, and so the button-cute babies are given names based on their personality or events surrounding them at the time of their birth. Last year actor Idris Elba named a baby gorilla \"Narame\", meaning \"long life\", because its mother had previously lost two children; and primary school student Elvine Ineza named a female baby \"Nibagwire\", meaning \"multiply\" and chosen to wish the newly formed Sigasirie family continued growth.\nTens of thousands of people, including celebrities, conservationists and local communities, now come together at the foothills of the ancient volcanoes for the annual spectacle held every autumn (the confirmed date for 2025 has yet to be announced by the Rwanda Development Board). As well as the official ceremony, dominated by a house-high bamboo gorilla sculpture, there are hours of music, dances and performances from the warrior-like Intore dancers pounding the ground in time to drums to cultural villages showcasing Rwandan daily life.\nAs well as raising global awareness, Kwita Izina is also a cultural celebration of the country's collective efforts to protect the great apes and a way of saying thank you to the communities and conservationists who protect them. Irene Murerwa, chief tourism officer of the Rwanda Development Board tells the BBC that Kwita Izina serves the purpose of thanking the local community before everything else. \"It's because of the community and it's for them as well,\" she says.\nTiming a visit to Volcanoes National Park during Kwita Izina is highly worthwhile, but the meaning behind it is really what's key, according to Murerwa. \"It's not just the baby gorilla naming ceremony. It's the whole aspect of visiting. Guests can take advantage to understand how communities, tourism and conservation come together here,\" she says.\nA dramatic blend of striking volcanic mountains, ethereal montane forests and neat, terraced hills that roll endlessly across the countryside, Rwanda is tiny but one of the most densely populated countries in Africa. Space is limited, so people living near the gorillas must have incentives to protect them. \"If you want to save the gorillas you need to focus on the people, because these are tiny, fragile habitats, surrounded by some of the most densely populated areas of the world,\" says Moman.\nPlan your trip\nHow to get here:\n Fly into Rwanda's capital Kigali. From Kigali, it takes between two to three hours to drive to Volcanoes National Park's headquarters in Kinigi, Musanze, where the naming ceremony is also held. Lodges usually provide transfers or car hire and taxi services are available.\nWhen to go:\n The long dry season between May and October. Kwita Izina is usually held every autumn.\nWhere to stay\n: \nVirunga Lodge\n, \nWilderness Sabyinyo\n and \nRed Rocks Rwanda.    \nWhat to do:\n Gorillas are the star attraction but golden monkeys are also endemic here (permits are needed for both). If visiting during the week-long Kwita Izina festivities, organise tickets through your lodge or tour operator.\n\"Unless local people see some specific benefit from tourism and conservation, there's no reason why they should support the future of the gorillas, and equally importantly, the future of the habitat. What they need is farmland and bread on the table. From the small number of visitors, you need to make enough of an impact through the income and make sure that some of it is shared with the community.\"\nMore than 1.4 million travellers visited Rwanda in 2023, generating a record US$620m. At $1,500 per permit, watching gorillas is an eye-wateringly expensive experience. Yet, income from gorilla tourism provides vital funding for the continued protection of the park and animals within and, crucially, 10% of the park fee revenue goes to the people who live around the park margins to help build schools and houses, improve infrastructure and sanitation, provide clean water and support health centres. This impactful funding has transformed villages and encourages stewardship of the forests.\nTourism now also provides thousands of people with livelihoods. Greg Bakunzi, founder of Red Rocks Rwanda, a social enterprise integrating tourism, conservation and sustainable community development in and around the Volcanoes National Park, says, \"Kwita Izina helped to mobilise communities and people who were interested in conservation and tourism to be a part of the growing tourism industry.\"\nRed Rocks Rwanda offers safari tent accommodation, gorilla trekking and many immersive activities throughout the year for visitors, and Bakunzi now also hosts the annual Red Rocks Cultural Festival that aligns with the dates of Kwita Izina and features music, poetry, comedy, art, exhibitions and talks about conservation and community empowerment.\n\"I wanted to create a week-long event that could also integrate community conservation when travellers come for the naming ceremony,\" he says. \"The culture of the communities are intricately tied to the natural world surrounding them. They preserve not only the Virungu Mountain environment but also the historical cultures and traditional arts of the region, gaining access to sustainable sources of income from tourism.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Where people go to bars to drink milk\n\u2022 Is there such a thing as guilt-free safari?\n\u2022 The West African nation welcoming the world\nOver at the Gorilla Guardians Village in the small town of Kinigi, which is also home to the park headquarters, former poachers have swapped snares for stories. Visitors can immerse themselves in Rwandan dance, craft and food, make Rwanda's potent banana beer, learn traditional skills like fire-making and archery and hear the tales of the people who used to hunt in the forest. Also in Kinigi, upscale Sabyinyo Silverback Lodge is Rwanda's first community-owned lodge. The pretty stone cottages and access to gorilla trekking provide an income for many local people and also support healthcare, infrastructure and education projects, such as building homes for widows of the Rwandan genocide and new classrooms for children.\nEunice Umumararungu, assistant manager at Sabyinyo, told me, \"Everyone's job is vital to successful conservation. From the porters, trackers and guides to research partners, rangers and those who are involved in the tree planting initiatives \u2013 they are all ensuring future naming ceremonies as the gorilla population grows thanks to conservation efforts. Kwita Izina has helped all Rwandans from various communities to understand the value of gorillas and their contribution to the country's economic prosperity.\"\nCementing the region as a conservation hub is the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, which opened in 2022 just outside the park. As well as being an education and research centre for the next generation of conservation leaders, visitors can take quizzes to find out which gorilla matches their personality, leaf through Fossey's field notes in a highly realistic version of the acclaimed primatologist's research camp and explore 12 acres of beautifully landscaped grounds.\nGorilla families are doing so well now that Volcanoes National Park is being expanded to give them more space. In addition, a Conservation Master Plan, published later this year, will set out guidance for the protection and management of all Rwandan biodiversity. As people are seen as important stewards of conservation in this nation, those who will have to relocate out of the expanded national park will be supported with new livelihood opportunities and improved living conditions.\n\"Kwita Izina has really put our name on the map,\" says Bakunzi. \"It has brought us more global visibility and has shown people why conservation matters.\"\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

Solanke had three goals and two assists in the six games before that, and has the potential to go off against a doomed Southampton side.Subs benchDean Henderson, Crystal Palace, keeper, \u00a34.6m - Brighton (h)Morgan Rogers, Aston Villa, midfielder, \u00a35.5m - Nottingham Forest (h)Rayan Ait-Nouri, Wolves, defender, \u00a34.8m - Ipswich (a)Aaron Wan-Bissaka, West Ham, defender, \u00a34.5m - Bournemouth (h)Team total cost: \u00a394.5mPlayer to watchImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, William Saliba's new centre-back partner could be Poland's Jakub Kiwior, right Jakub Kiwior, Arsenal, defender, \u00a34.8mAre we about to get a cheap entry into one of the Premier League's best defences, with a double gameweek on the horizon?With Gabriel out for the season, Riccardo Calafiori injured, and Jurrien Timber and Ben White injury doubts, Kiwior could be the next man up.He has performed before when called upon.Team to targetAston Villa - Nottingham Forest (h), Southampton (a), DOUBLE GAMEWEEK - Newcastle (h), Manchester City (a)It's just picking the right Villa player for this run of games - everyone apart from Morgan Rogers seems a bit of a punt, with the usually reliable Ollie Watkins having been benched for two consecutive games in all competitions.With a Champions League quarter-final against Paris St-Germain crammed in between these games as well, it might be prudent to wait until the double before choosing your Villa assets.But both Marcus Rashford (\u00a36.6m) and Marco Asensio (\u00a36.1m) could be amazing differential picks.Related topicsLiverpoolAston VillaPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurArsenalNewcastle UnitedFootballIpswich TownPremier League indexPremier League tablePremier League fixturesMore on this storyFollow your Premier League club and get news, analysis and fan views sent direct to youPublished11 August 2023 Yes.That makes Trippier worth a punt in my opinion, even if he is nursing a potential groin issue.He took three set-pieces, made three crosses and two key passes in Wednesday's win over Brentford, so you're getting a defender who is pretty involved in attacking play.MidfieldersImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Double up on Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli?Mohamed Salah (vice-captain), Liverpool, \u00a313.8m - Fulham (a)Salah has failed to score in two of his past three games and his expected goal involvement (xGI) of 0.17 against Everton on Wednesday was the Egyptian's lowest all season.But this man has 44 goal involvements in 2024-25 so don't give up on him yet!There could come a time - especially if you are chasing your rivals - where going without Salah makes sense in a few weeks, as Liverpool won't have a double gameweek this season.But not yet.Jacob Murphy, Newcastle, \u00a35m - Leicester (a)FPL players may be looking at Anthony Gordon as the best Newcastle midfield option, with a double gameweek next week for the Magpies.But Murphy, at just \u00a35m, can easily match Gordon.He has nine assists now this season and has started every game since week 14. He has not finished a season with just one goal since 2020-21, so the law of averages means he is due.Djed Spence, Spurs, \u00a34.4m - Southampton (h)While Tottenham's form is nose-diving again, they face a Saints side with just 22 goals in 30 games - the league's lowest total.Spence seems to be holding down that right-back spot and, if they do keep a clean sheet, has a great chance of bonus.In Tottenham's recent back-to-back clean sheets, against Brentford and Manchester United, Spence earned the maximum three bonus points.Kieran Trippier, Newcastle, \u00a35.6m - Leicester (a)Am I getting suckered in with memories of prime Trippier from the past two seasons, when he had nine and 10 assists?",

In pharma, about 70% of global R&D takes place in the United States. So we're creating the next generation of breakthroughs and cures.\n\"But the production is heavily weighted outside the US.

If you look at the numbers there is disinvestment in research and development. It's been on a steady decline,\" he said.\nSo is the UK complacent when it thinks of itself as a life sciences super power?\n\"That's one way to put it.\"\nMr Ricks said countries like Germany spend nearly double of their health budget on medicines.\n\"The UK is not a large market. But what it could be is an exceptional market.\n\"You need three things to make our industry work.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has announced fresh import taxes on goods being imported to America in the latest escalation of the global trade war.\nThe UK has been hit with a 10% tariff on nearly all of its goods being brought into the US, which Trump says is a retaliation to UK tariffs on American goods, but uncertainty remains over the potential impact on British consumers.\nHere's how you and your money could be affected.\nThe tariffs Trump has just announced will be paid for by the businesses which import goods into the US.\nClarissa Hahn, economist at Oxford Economics, says this means that the initial impact of price rises will be on US consumers, as American firms are likely to pass on the extra costs to their customers.\nHowever, she adds people in the UK could subsequently be affected by the measures, which come into effect on 5 April.\nOne way is via the value of the pound and exchange rates, which dictate the cost to  UK businesses importing goods and raw materials from abroad. If import costs go up, these extra costs could be passed on to consumers through higher prices.\nFollowing Trump's speech on Wednesday, exchange rates between the dollar and pound fluctuated. If the value of the dollar strengthens as some economists have predicted, import costs could rise for UK firms importing goods.\nHigher prices in the UK could also \"prompt workers to demand higher wages\", which would further raise costs for businesses, according to Ahmet Ihsan Kaya, principal economist, at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. \nMs Hahn adds if the UK government decides to retaliate with tariffs of its own on US goods entering the UK, there is a risk UK prices could rise if British businesses pass on extra costs to customers.\nHowever, some economists have suggested prices could also initially fall as a result of Trump's decision to impose tariffs.\nSwati Dhingra, economist and member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, has suggested that firms which normally send their goods to the US, may instead send them to countries such as the UK which don't have such steep tariffs, potentially leading to a flood of cheaper goods in the UK.\n\"Tariffs of the proposed magnitude are likely to prompt firms that export to the US to lower their prices to retain demand for their products,\" she suggests.\nBritish companies exporting goods to the US are set to be the hardest hit from the latest measures.\nThe UK exported almost \u00a360bn worth of goods to the US last year, mainly machinery, cars and pharmaceuticals. Other industries, which are big exporters to the US, include fishing and electronics.\nIf US demand for UK products dwindles due to the extra charges importers face, this could hit profit margins and ultimately lead to UK job cuts unless British firms find new customers outside the US.\nAccording to the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank, Jaguar Land Rover and the Mini factory in Cowley, Oxford, appear to be the most exposed to US tariffs on cars.\nIt says more than 25,000 jobs in the UK car manufacturing industry \"could be at risk\" with a 25% tariff coming into effect on Thursday, with one in eight UK-built cars exported to the US.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is also heavily reliant on trade with the US, says Ms Hahn, of Oxford Economics. \nThe US makes up 40% of AstraZeneca's sales and 50% of GSK's. Although both British-headquartered firms have manufacturing facilities in America, raw ingredients for life-saving medicines and vaccines travel between the UK, EU and US. Under tariffs the firms could be hit with multiple tax charges as they cross borders to be developed.\nThere is also the issue of how tariffs work when they collide with pricing caps that both the NHS and other health organisations set for buying drugs in bulk.\nUK interest rates dictate the costs households have to pay to borrow money for things such as mortgages, credit cards and loans. Higher rates also boost returns for savers.\nThey are currently at 4.5%, but economists are predicting two more rate cuts by the end of the year.\nHowever, the Bank of England highlighted US tariffs as a reason why it avoided cutting rates further last month, saying economic and global trade uncertainty had \"intensified\". \nIf prices are pushed up for long enough to affect the rate of inflation - this could mean interest rates stay higher for longer.\nAndrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, said it was Bank's job \"to make sure that inflation stays low and stable\" and that would be \"looking very closely\" at the impact of tariffs.",

        "summary": "Ms Hahn adds if the UK government decides to retaliate with tariffs of its own on US goods entering the UK, there is a risk UK prices could rise if British businesses pass on extra costs to customers.However, some economists have suggested prices could also initially fall as a result of Trump's decision to impose tariffs.Swati Dhingra, economist and member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, has suggested that firms which normally send their goods to the US, may instead send them to countries such as the UK which don't have such steep tariffs, potentially leading to a flood of cheaper goods in the UK. Prices could go up, but could also go downThe tariffs Trump has just announced will be paid for by the businesses which import goods into the US.Clarissa Hahn, economist at Oxford Economics, says this means that the initial impact of price rises will be on US consumers, as American firms are likely to pass on the extra costs to their customers.However, she adds people in the UK could subsequently be affected by the measures, which come into effect on 5 April.One way is via the value of the pound and exchange rates, which dictate the cost to  UK businesses importing goods and raw materials from abroad. How Trump's tariffs might affect you and your money24 hours agoShareSaveMichael RaceBusiness reporter, BBC NewsShareSaveGetty ImagesUS President Donald Trump has announced fresh import taxes on goods being imported to America in the latest escalation of the global trade war.The UK has been hit with a 10% tariff on nearly all of its goods being brought into the US, which Trump says is a retaliation to UK tariffs on American goods, but uncertainty remains over the potential impact on British consumers.Here's how you and your money could be affected.1. If the value of the dollar strengthens as some economists have predicted, import costs could rise for UK firms importing goods.Higher prices in the UK could also \"prompt workers to demand higher wages\", which would further raise costs for businesses, according to Ahmet Ihsan Kaya, principal economist, at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Other industries, which are big exporters to the US, include fishing and electronics.If US demand for UK products dwindles due to the extra charges importers face, this could hit profit margins and ultimately lead to UK job cuts unless British firms find new customers outside the US.According to the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank, Jaguar Land Rover and the Mini factory in Cowley, Oxford, appear to be the most exposed to US tariffs on cars.It says more than 25,000 jobs in the UK car manufacturing industry \"could be at risk\" with a 25% tariff coming into effect on Thursday, with one in eight UK-built cars exported to the US.The pharmaceutical industry is also heavily reliant on trade with the US, says Ms Hahn, of Oxford Economics.",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump's tariffs have sparked falls in stock markets around the world - but how will they affect sport?\n\"It's potentially the difference between life and death.\"\nThe words of a \"hugely frustrated\" Lynn Calder - the head of Ineos Automotive, the car company owned by Manchester United minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe - when talking about the impact United States tariffs would have on the business.\nWith its manufacturing based in France, the company now faces the prospect of 25% tariffs being imposed on vehicles exported to the crucial American market, with Calder admitting it was \"vulnerable to tariffs\" and needed \"direct and urgent political intervention\"., external\nHer stark warning was a reminder of the effect the duties introduced by US President Donald Trump will have on the wide range of industries linked to sport through investment or sponsorship. \nGlobal stock markets have fallen as investors reacted amid fears of inflation, but beyond the wider economic turmoil, how else could the ripples of a trade war affect the world of sport?\nTrump's so-called 'Liberation Day' could have ramifications for a club such as Manchester United in other ways.\n\"It has $650m of loans from the US because the club is listed in New York,\" football finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport.\n\"If the Trump administration's tariffs have a positive impact on the US dollar and it strengthens, that means the value of those loans in sterling terms will increase, and this could hit United's accounts and have implications for Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR) that limit clubs' losses.\n\"In the 2022 accounts there was a \u00a358m cost due to foreign exchange movements on these loans. So the United board will be watching with interest as to what happens in terms of the market reaction to these tariffs as far as global exchange rates are concerned.\"\nThe US is set to stage some of the world's biggest sports events over the next few years, including the 2026 World Cup and 2028 LA Olympics and Paralympics. \nThese events are meant to provide overseas businesses with a key opportunity to raise their profile and boost sales in the US. \nKorean car manufacturer Hyundai Group, for instance, will look to take advantage of its sponsorship deal with football governing body Fifa during the Club World Cup this year, and then the World Cup in 2026. But could Trump's aggressive trade policies make such businesses think again?\n\"I suspect some sponsors are now re-assessing how they 'activate' such deals in the US, given the trade barriers that have now been imposed,\" says John Zerafa, a sports event bid strategist.\n\"Why would a sponsor spend millions of pounds doing so if it is now prohibitive to sell in America?\"\nMany sports teams and athletes are also sponsored by sportswear brands. \nWith most of these companies relying on materials and manufacturing in Asia - where Trump has directed some of the highest tariffs - it is no surprise that shares in the likes of Nike, Adidas and Puma have all fallen sharply, with fears that higher importing costs would be passed on to consumers.\nHowever Maguire says the impact should be limited. \"For a $100 (\u00a376.36) replica sports jersey sold in the US, manufacturing costs are likely to be in the region of $12-15 dollars at source, and maybe even lower,\" he says.\n\"So even if there's a 40% tariff when the goods are imported to the US, that'll only be around $4 more.\n\"Consumers are used to paying premium prices in sports retail. The manufacturer and retailer should absorb some of this, and it shouldn't impact on the amount being sold - or the commissions being earned by clubs that sell merchandise.\"\nThe European Sponsorship Association told BBC Sport that it was \"monitoring the situation closely and will actively seek the views of the sport sponsorship community\".\n\"As a representative body we will respond accordingly if there proves to be any sign of a material negative impact on the industry,\" it said.\nAmid talk of a trade war, Trump's tariffs have also raised questions over the atmosphere at the various sports events it is due to host, not least the Ryder Cup in the US later this year. \nWith European Union leaders highly critical of the policy, it would be little surprise if anti-European sentiment among the American fans is intensified.\nAnd then there's the 2026 World Cup, which the US is co-hosting alongside Mexico and Canada.\nIn January, Trump vowed to impose tariffs of 25% on imports from the neighbouring countries - America's two biggest trading partners - in a move he said was designed to address the entry of opioid drug fentanyl to the US, the large amounts of undocumented migrants that have come across US borders, as well as trade deficits.\nLast month Trump claimed the political and economic tensions between the US and its World Cup co-hosts would be good for the tournament. \"I think it's going to make it more exciting. Tension's a good thing,\" he said.\nHe also announced the formation of a World Cup taskforce, external which he will chair to ensure the tournament runs smoothly. Fifa has been approached for comment on their response to the US President's tariffs.\nBut Trump's protectionist policies raise serious questions over the three countries' willingness and ability to work together on security for instance, or to ensure fans can gain entry visas, and then pass easily across borders. \nWith imported materials such as steel and aluminium more expensive, there may also be concerns about the development of infrastructure for the tournament.\nTrump has also spoken provocatively about making Canada 'the 51st state', leading to the US anthem being booed by Canadian fans at NBA and NHL fixtures. \nCould the additional tensions over tariffs mean such scenes are repeated at the World Cup or even the Olympics?\n\"Nations and cities host global sports events for a variety of reasons, from enhancing reputation and driving global investment, to sending a message to the world that you are open, welcoming and ready to do business. It seems nothing could be further from the truth in terms of Trump's America,\" says Zerafa.\n\"It's not just tariffs. From forced repatriations, and hostility to the EU and Nato, to a possible takeover of Greenland and bad blood with Canada. All this makes it a very challenging backdrop for the World Cup 2026 and LA Games in 2028 to promote that narrative.\"\nThe IOC has been approached for comment. Insiders told BBC Sport they are confident that Trump's love of sport - and his desire for LA 2028 to be a successful global platform towards the end of his second term in office - will ensure that preparations for the Olympics are not derailed by geopolitics.\nWith retaliatory tariffs being imposed by other countries, a trade war could impact any person, team or league buying sports equipment that is made in the US, as well as American consumers of products manufactured overseas of course.\nThe Premier League exports its content to the US via its lucrative \u00a32bn TV deal with NBC, but because this is deemed a service rather than a product, the tariffs do not apply.\n\"As such there should be no consequences, unless there is some form of escalation in the trade relationship between the UK and the US,\" says Maguire. \n\"So the Premier League won't have to come to some sort of compromise with its broadcast partner.\"\nA bigger concern for the UK football industry will be consumers having less money to spend on tickets and TV subscriptions if fears of a recession come to pass.",

        "article_text": "Jonny Bairstow and James Anderson will not face off this season after Yorkshire were promoted and Lancashire relegated\nThe 2025 County Championship begins on Friday - and, remarkably for early April, the weather is set to be glorious.\nBut which county sides will sparkle this season and whose outlook is gloomy?\nThe BBC's local radio county cricket commentators and online journalists - who will be providing ball-by-ball radio and live text commentary throughout the season on the BBC Sport website and app - take a look at each club's prospects... \nCounty Championship preview: Who can stop Surrey?\nJennings 'job' is to win Lancashire silverware\nBears must spread wickets around - Hannon-Dalby\n2024 season - Eighth in Division Two\nDave Fletcher - BBC Radio Derby\nGiven Derbyshire finished bottom of Division Two in 2024, things can surely only improve. \nThey did at least win a game last year, unlike 2023, but it was another bitterly disappointing watch for the County Ground faithful.\nThey were not helped by an opening round washout against Gloucestershire last season which meant they were playing catch-up from the off.\nThat appears unlikely to be repeated so a quick start \u2013 against the same opposition - is essential.\nThey have added Australian opening batter Caleb Jewell to the squad and he will be joined by returning Kiwi quick bowler Blair Tickner, whose spell last season was all too brief.\nThere's a new captain at the helm, too, although it is a familiar figure. Wayne Madsen, who led the side to promotion in 2012, takes over from David Lloyd after his solitary campaign leading the side.\nTickner's return and the presence of experienced bowlers such as Zak Chappell and Pat Brown can only benefit newcomer Harry Moore.\nAlready in the England system, the much talked-about 17-year-old will be starting his first full season in the senior side having already shown he can more than hold his own at that level.\nWinter signings Jack Morley and Martin Andersson will be better for having been with the group last season.\nThe big challenge remains the ability to take 20 wickets a match, something Mickey Arthur's side have to do if they are to repeat the relative riches of his first season in charge in 2022.\nMatthew Potts' Durham appearances this season may be limited by England call-ups\n2024 season - Fifth in Division One\nMartin Emmerson - BBC Radio Newcastle\nDurham finished fifth on their return to Division One last season and in general more than held their own. They might be able to improve on that this year. We'll see.\nThey weren't helped by the loss of their entire opening game - at home to Hampshire in April \u2013 but there was only really Surrey who turned them over.\nThat was towards the end of the season and the week Surrey retained their title - and they beat a weakened Durham side struggling with injuries.\nFrom a batting point of view they have added Emilio Gay to the ranks. He joined towards the end of last season from Northants, while Will Rhodes chose to leave Warwickshire after seven seasons, despite the offer of a new contract. \nThey will help boost a line-up which includes the leading batter in Division One last season, in South African David Bedingham. He scored 1,331 runs, including a club-record 279 against Lancashire in September. He also became the first Durham batter to score centuries in four consecutive innings.\nOpener Michael Jones has left for Lancashire. His outings last season were limited due to selection choices, so he took the decision to head back home.\nBowling is the key issue. They've had no luck with overseas players in recent seasons. Scott Boland lasted part of one game before returning home to Australia in April. Neil Wagner managed just one game too. Veteran Peter Siddle came in and did well in his four games, while West Indian Chemar Holder didn't particularly pull up any trees in his three matches. Keeping their bowlers fit will be key.\nIt remains to be seen how much of a good signing Sam Conners will be. The bowler has joined from Derbyshire. While he boasted 50 championship wickets in 2022, he took 27 the following year, but only played five Championship matches last season. Australian seamer Brendan Doggett will play County Championship matches in April and May. The 30-year-old seamer plays for South Australia and has 157 first-class wickets to his name.\nThen there's the likes of ever-dependable all-rounder Ben Raine. Matthew Potts is important to the team too, when England allow him to be available. Seventeen-year-old James Minto looks a good prospect and fellow bowler Daniel Hogg will be looking to push on after a career-best 7-66 against Notts in Chester-le-Street.\n2024 season - Fourth in Division One\nVictoria Polley - BBC Radio Essex\nThere's been change at the top for Essex over the winter with Chris Silverwood returning to the club as director of cricket. \nEssex won successive titles (Div 2 & 1) in his previous tenure as head coach, including a first County Championship win in 25 years, before England came calling. \nWith his assistant Anthony McGrath taking over from then up until last season, it will hopefully be a more seamless transition than these changes can sometimes be.\nDean Elgar was vital at the top of the order last season but who will open alongside him is the big question? Do Essex give a chance to teenager Charlie Allison who has impressed in the white-ball formats? They have other options in the likes of Nick Browne or Robin Das, or even bumping Paul Walter or Michael Pepper up higher.\nJordan Cox was also key with the bat last season but has had a torrid winter, denied an England Test debut by a thumb injury. International opportunities could affect his availability.\nAn international call-up still eludes bowler Sam Cook but England's loss is very much Essex's gain - alongside Jamie Porter and Simon Harmer, it's a potent bowling attack.\nIt would've been strengthened with the signing of Shardul Thakur but his late involvement in the IPL has ruled him out of a move to Chelmsford, and Essex continue to hunt for a replacement.\nIt's been six years since Essex last won a County Championship title and they continue to punch above their weight in competing at the top end of the table. \nThey might not have the squad size and budgets of other counties but there's still plenty of talent and experience among the Essex ranks. Can Silverwood add more silverware to his Essex collection on his Chelmsford return?\n2024 season - Sixth in Division Two\nNick Webb - BBC Radio Wales Sport\nThe arrival of Richard Dawson as head coach after the unexpected departure of Grant Bradburn is the main change at Sophia Gardens, with the squad looking remarkably similar to last season. \nThe second One-Day Cup triumph in four years put a gloss on an otherwise disappointing 2024 campaign as Glamorgan showed only marginal improvement in the T20 Blast and fell away in the latter stages of the Championship promotion race.\nKey factors in the Championship will be finding a consistent opening partnership to go with the settled top order of Sam Northeast, Kiran Carlson, Colin Ingram and Chris Cooke, as well as getting the most out of a seam attack lacking raw pace. \nEddie Byrom, unlucky with injury in several seasons, is the most likely starter up top but his partner could be one of four or five candidates. \nSri Lankan Asitha Fernando is likely to partner Timm van der Gugten with the new ball in the opening stages of the season, while it will be interesting to see if on-loan England off-spinner Shoaib Bashir makes an impact as cover for Mason Crane early on when pitches usually don't help the twirlers.\nThere is little doubt that young all-rounder Ben Kellaway will become a regular in all formats sooner or later, but being thrown in as a red-ball opener was maybe a step too far. \nHis ambidextrous spin is a unique selling point added to some hard hitting in the middle order. \nOverall the county needs to manage a fair degree of change in the medium term, with a fair few of their stalwarts well past the 30 mark.\nJames Bracey played two Test matches for England in 2021\n2024 season - Seventh in Division Two\nEd Seabourne - BBC Radio Bristol\nGloucestershire approach the 2025 season with a renewed sense of ambition, keen to ensure this campaign isn't looked back on as the previous September's hangover.\nWhilst 2024 will always be remembered for the remarkable run to the county's first T20 Blast trophy, head coach Mark Alleyne made no bones about the fact he was disappointed to have ended so far behind the promotion spots in the County Championship.\nDespite the final positioning, significant strides forward were made on the batting side. \nWicketkeeper James Bracey is following a stellar year that saw him achieve the rare double of 1,000 runs and 50 dismissals, and there is increasing competition for spots in the top order.\nThe signing of Australian all-rounder Cameron Green for five matches will only add to that, and there is even hope he will be allowed to bowl towards the end of his stay.\nThe club possesses a group of promising young pace bowlers, including recent England Lions call-ups Zaman Akhter and Ajeet Singh Dale, and newly appointed Championship skipper Cameron Bancroft has spoken of his excitement in working with them.\nThe departure of Zafar Gohar, however, means the squad is without a proven red-ball spinner, and, especially with the dry spring, the serious question will be whether there is enough variety in the attack in its current form to force wins on a consistent basis.\n2024 season - Second in Division One\nKevan James - BBC Radio Solent\nTrying to improve on their second-place finish in the Championship last season may depend on a dip in form from Surrey, but also how Hampshire cope without being able to call upon two very influential players.\nJames Vince, the captain and leader of the batting line-up, has decided red-ball cricket is no longer for him. Mo Abbas, taker of 180 wickets over the past four seasons, has been moved on.\nVeteran Mark Stoneman looks a shrewd signing to partially or maybe fully offset the hole left by Vince.\nOn the bowling front, exciting prospects Sonny Baker and John Turner will be given more responsibility. They will certainly add pace.\nA disappointing T20 campaign will hopefully be turned around by the addition of two hard-hitting South Africans in Lhaun-dre Pretorius and Dewald Brevis.\nPretorius, 19, was the top run scorer in the recent SA20 competition, while Brevis finished the tournament with the top strike rate of 180.\nBy all accounts Pretorius has the potential to be world class very quickly.\n2024 season - 10th in Division One (relegated)\nMatt Cole - BBC Radio Kent\nThe summer of 2024 was a pretty dismal affair for both club and supporters. In the Championship they found themselves outgunned, particularly in the bowling department, and never really looked like they were escaping the drop from Division One they'd so narrowly avoided the year before.\nPerhaps more worrying was the T20 Blast campaign. The Spitfires - perennial contenders for the knockout stages - won just four of 14 games and finished bottom of the South Group. The One-Day Cup didn't add much encouragement for supporters desperate for something to hope for.\nKent come into the new season though with Adam Hollioake replacing Matt Walker as head coach. It's the former Surrey and England all-rounder's first time in the role for a county side and players and supporters alike have received the appointment with some excitement.\nThe playing ranks have been bolstered by new signings \u2013 Chris Benjamin moving from Warwickshire hoping to reinvigorate his career as an all-formats batter.\nKent's bowling was the major cause for concern last season, both injuries and lack of form making them look toothless at times. A double signing of seamers just before the start of the campaign is looking to address that \u2013 recent Test debutant for Pakistan, Kashif Ali, and experienced South African pace man Keith Dudgeon are in place for the first part of the campaign.\nThey've also added Corey Flintoff \u2013 son of Andrew, brother of Rocky \u2013 to the squad, the fast-bowling all-rounder joining on a rookie contract.\nWith Aussie bowlers Wes Agar and Tom Rogers returning for the T20 Blast, it appears more of an evolution than a revolution at Canterbury this summer.\nBut if Hollioake can get the best out of the squad they could be among the front-runners for promotion back to the top division of the Championship and a return to upsetting the big budget sides in the Blast.\nRocky Flintoff played four County Championship matches for Lancashire last season\n2024 season - Ninth in Division One (relegated)\nScott Read - BBC Radio Lancashire\nSince winning the County Championship title in 2011, Lancashire have been relegated four times. \nOn the previous three occasions they've won promotion straight back to Division One. \nThey'll be expected to continue that trend this season and will start as firm favourites. \nEven without James Anderson for the first month, the Red Rose have a healthy blend of senior professionals and young players making their way in the game. \nThe overseas signings of Marcus Harris and Anderson Phillip look like excellent business. \nPhillip, for the first 11 games, will provide some extra pace, Harris for the entire season to open the batting. \nThe arrival of the Australian opener will also allow Luke Wells to bat at six giving Lancashire some much-needed experience in the middle order. \nLancashire have some fine young players who endured a tough season for the club last year. A year on from that, the likes of Matty Hurst, George Balderson and George Bell should prosper. \nFor Hurst, almost 700 runs at an average of 32 in his debut season for a relegated team was an impressive return. \nThere will also be plenty of opportunities for Tom Aspinwall and Rocky Flintoff, who does not turn 17 until next week.\nAnderson not ruling out playing for three more years\nBancroft's winning experience 'boosts' Gloucestershire\nBairstow named new Yorkshire red-ball captain  \n2024 season - Fifth in Division Two\nRichard Rae - BBC Radio Leicester\nThe return of Peter Handscomb, who made 894 runs in 14 Championship innings at an average of 74.5 last season, the signing of Shan Masood from June onwards, the presence at the top of the order of the talented Rishi Patel and the fact most of the bowlers have legitimate claims to be described as all-rounders, should mean Leicestershire are not short of runs this season. \nNor, if the likes of Patel, Sol Budinger, Rehan Ahmed and Louis Kimber find form, will they score those runs slowly.\nThe big question is whether they have the firepower to bowl teams out twice. \nLast season, Leicestershire took the lowest number of wickets (139) in Division Two by some distance, and some supporters have argued the signing of New Zealand-born Netherlands international Logan van Beek adds to their ranks of bowling all-rounders rather than gives the Foxes the cutting edge they need to break games open.\nTall young left-arm prospect Josh Hull has that potential, but has spent the close season struggling with injury.\nThere is hope in the pre-season performances of the likes of veteran Chris Wright and the promising Tom Scriven, while Ben Green's return from Somerset for the first seven Championship matches adds depth.\n2024 season - Third in Division Two\nKevin Hand - BBC Radio London\nThe signing of New Zealand batter Kane Williamson is something of a coup for a county that are operating under strict financial restrictions imposed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).\nThe rearrangement of the budget for wage allocation within the squad meant a number of players were released last season, including the tough decision to let the popular former England opener Mark Stoneman go.\nWith the evergreen opener Sam Robson aging well and Leus de Plooy a gun player in all formats, Middlesex have a top order to be feared -  probably for the first time since Robson, Nick Gubbins and Nick Compton formed a top three that played a huge part in the 2016 Championship winning side.\nThe mark of the Middlesex team under former director of cricket Angus Fraser, who took charge in 2009, was the regular ability to blast through teams with the ball.\nIn the absence of the retired Tim Murtagh, Middlesex struggled to rattle through the wickets last year and captain Toby Roland-Jones bore a heavy burden on that front. \nIt was refreshing to see the right-armer clear of injury for the season and his team will desperately need that once more if they are to be promoted.\nThe former England international will have his workload eased this year by the arrival of South African seamer Dane Paterson, another crucial addition to the squad that could make a significant difference to a side that looked on course for promotion for most of last season.\nThe signings of Williamson and Paterson to bolster the Championship side are a clear indication that Middlesex want success to return in the shape of promotion this year.\nDarren Lehmann was Australia head coach between 2013 and 2018\n2024 season - Fourth in Division Two\nAndrew Radd - BBC Radio Northamptonshire\nThe arrival of Australian Darren Lehmann as head coach at Wantage Road has triggered a wave of pre-season positivity in a squad left feeling somewhat bruised by the events of the past couple of years.\nAfter being relegated from Division One in 2023 they failed to register a Division Two win in 2024 until September, by which time Lehmann's predecessor John Sadler had lost his job following defeat in the T20 Blast quarter-finals.\nWith opener Emilio Gay and fast bowler Jack White both heading north, to Durham and Yorkshire respectively, there will be opportunities for others to shine. \nYoung batters Krish Patel (who opened his account with five boundaries on first-class debut at Headingley last September) and Aadi Sharma have much to offer, while the seam attack has been bolstered by the signings of Dom Leech, left-armer Liam Guthrie and \u2013 for the four Championship fixtures in May \u2013 Harry Conway from South Australia. \nGeorge Scrimshaw and the hugely promising Raphy Weatherall suffered injuries last season and will be eager to re-establish themselves.\nMuch will depend \u2013 certainly in four-day cricket - on the tried-and-trusted trio of Luke Procter, Ben Sanderson and Rob Keogh. \nIndian leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal had a major impact towards the end of 2024 and returns this year for a longer second-half stint.\nOther key figures across all formats will be Saif Zaib, who \u2013 to the relief of supporters \u2013 agreed a contract extension until at least the end of 2027, plus a couple of upwardly-trending all-rounders in Justin Broad, son of former tennis star Neil and named the county's Media Player of the Year last season, and Gus Miller.\n2024 season - Eighth in Division One\nDave Bracegirdle - BBC Radio Nottinghamshire\nYazz knew what she was on about, didn't she? 'The Only Way Is Up' was not only a catchy hit single but is also a good place to approach Nottinghamshire's hopes for 2025.\nHead coach Peter Moores has emphasised that it's important to learn from what went wrong last year, as well as draw a line underneath it. \nAs a brief reminder, Notts narrowly avoided relegation from Division One of the County Championship, finished bottom of their group in the T20 Blast and barely raised a pulse in the One-Day Cup.\nSo what might be different this time around?\nThe only domestic signing sees Conor McKerr join from Surrey but with Josh Tongue now fully fit, those two bolster a fast-bowling unit that promises untold riches. \nIf Notts can keep Olly Stone healthy, alongside overseas recruits in Australia's Fergus O'Neill and Pakistan's Mohammad Abbas, throw in the evergreen Brett Hutton and the raw pace of Rob Lord, then their resources seem well stocked.\nTeenagers Farhan Ahmed and Freddie McCann both made their county debuts towards the back end of last season and already carry the weight of expectation.\nThe prodigious spinning fingers of 17-year old Ahmed have already marked him out as a generational talent, while 19-year-old team-mate McCann hit two centuries in just seven innings.\nSome astute observers are already wondering if Kyle Verreynne is the best wicketkeeper-batter in the world right now. The county fought off a lot of competition to secure the services of the South African for the whole campaign.\nThat just leaves the top order. While Trent Bridge members may not see too much of England's Ben Duckett once again, there are guaranteed runs from skipper Haseeb Hameed and the gifted Joe Clarke, both as good as any in the county game.\nShoaib Bashir will join Glamorgan on loan for the first three County Championship games of the season\n2024 season - Third in Division One\nAnthony Gibson - BBC Radio Somerset\nWith a strong and settled squad of players shrewdly captained by Lewis Gregory, and terrific team spirit, Somerset go into the new season with every hope of marking the club's 150th anniversary with a first County Championship.\nInjuries permitting, Matt Henry will be back to lead a powerful seam attack, balanced by the spin of Jack Leach, rising star Archie Vaughan and, once he returns from a loan spell at Glamorgan or his England duties are over, Shoaib Bashir. \nAmong the batters, the only real question is who will partner Vaughan at the top of the order, Sean Dickson being the most likely answer. \nThe three Toms - Lammonby, Abell and Banton - will once again make up the engine room of the batting, with James Rew ready to reinforce his reputation as one of the most promising wicketkeeper-batters in the country.\nUnlike the infinitely talented Will Smeed, who is happily returning to the red-ball fold, Tom Kohler-Cadmore will focus on the white ball and the Blast, so that the firepower which has seen Somerset reach Finals Day in each of the past three seasons remains very much intact.\nFor Somerset's team of youngsters to have reached the One-Day Cup Final last year was a surprise, but they can by no means be discounted. James Rew's younger brother, Thomas, will surely come into that side, and what a prospect he is.\nLast year was a case of so near and yet so far - in contention for all three trophies, ending up with none. \nThe team will have learned from that, and if they can graft staying power onto all their other strengths, this could, at last, be Somerset's season.\nTom Lawes is one of a number of exciting all-rounders at Surrey\n2024 season - First in Division One (champions)\nMark Church - BBC Radio London\nThere is no reason Surrey cannot win a fourth Championship title on the spin this summer. \nThey obviously know how to put all the parts together over the course of a season and the squad is much the same. \nThe addition of Matt Fisher is exciting and there will be international call-ups. But the spine of the side is solid and experienced and if someone is missing, the gap gets filled without anybody noticing.\nOne to keep an eye on is Tom Lawes. He has all the talent in the world with both bat and ball, and if he produces consistently, it would not be a surprise if he were representing England soon. He will be aiming for a permanent spot in the Championship XI but as always there is healthy competition for places.\nThere is one certainty. In terms of the Championship, Surrey will want to be better than last season. \nThey are always looking to improve, and they know everybody else is trying to catch them. \nThey will be tested, especially by the likes of Essex and Hampshire but they know how to win the Championship, and they still have all the players that have managed that in the past three years. It is a good recipe to have.\n2024 season - First in Division Two (promoted)\nAdrian Harms - BBC Radio Sussex\nThere's much excitement and anticipation on the south coast, as Sussex return to Division One after almost a decade in Division Two.\nDuring that period they have never mounted a serious promotion bid, and it's taken change at the top, and the subsequent appointment of Paul Farbrace to galvanise the club.\nFarbrace has introduced a winning mentality that had been sadly lacking, and  crucially supplemented a talented group of younger players with, in his words, \"knarled old pros\" who know how to win, and battle when the going gets tough.\nHowever, this is essentially a young Sussex side most with no experience of first division cricket, and therefore the experience of Australian Daniel Hughes, skipper John Simpson and Ollie Robinson will be crucial particularly during the opening weeks of the season.\nBut don't think Sussex will be a soft touch and are back in Division One for the ride.\nProvided the top order can score enough runs, they have a match-winning spinner in Jack Carson and are especially difficult to beat at Hove, where they haven't lost since Farbrace took the helm.\nSussex have taken nine long years to return to Division One, and the feeling around the club is that's where they want to stay.\nJacob Bethell's game time at Edgbaston is likely to be limited this season\n2024 season - Seventh in Division One\nMike Taylor - BBC Radio WM\nA confusing winter followed a confusing summer. \nOften in 2024 it seemed something was going to happen for Warwickshire - they were front-runners in both white-ball tournaments, and frequently built strong early positions in Championship games. \nAnd then nothing happened. No white-ball final, only one four-day win. \nSeveral leading players had outstanding individual seasons - runs for the captain Alex Davies, wickets for Olly Hannon-Dalby, both for Ed Barnard, England calls for Jacob Bethell and Dan Mousley - but the total, somehow, came to less than the sum of the parts. \nA detailed high-performance review had seemed, from the outside, to have also come to no significant conclusion, the exit of performance director Gavin Larsen being unrelated, until head coach Mark Robinson suddenly left seven weeks ago.\nNow, there is both change and continuity. Ian Westwood, a known and trusted leader, is promoted to replace Robinson. \nThe patient, determined approach he showed as an opening bat and captain in testing circumstances should serve him well. \nA collection of overseas players also mixes the familiar and the new. Hasan Ali is already popular at Edgbaston, while Beau Webster has the qualities that should see him thrive mid-summer. \nHopefully all will avoid the bad luck with injuries that has so weighed Warwickshire down in recent years, and has hit Tom Latham before he even arrives.\nEdgbaston is always a busy place, but had become grumpy in the stands by last September, with so much promise unfulfilled. \nHaving seemed at times to be pushing on all fronts at once, they had gone nowhere. The club has a lot of moving parts but no shortage of talent. \nIf Davies and Westwood can steer the team in a clear direction, and maintain a strong challenge at least in one competition, it will be a year of progress.\n2024 season - Sixth in Division One\nGed Scott - BBC Sport online's Pears reporter\nA long, hard, emotional season eventually blossomed into some happiness for Worcestershire in 2024.\nIn between all the trauma of not being able to play their first home game at flood-hit Worcester until 25 May then came the devastating loss of one of their players, Josh Baker, at the tragically early age of just 20.\nBut the spirit the Pears showed in adversity could only be admired.\nThey gave a string of youngsters their chance in an unexpectedly progressive One-Day Cup campaign \u2013 and, either side of the mid-summer County Championship break, they produced three huge red-ball victories on the trot.\nThat not only helped them stay in the top flight, it was enough to catapult them up to sixth - their highest finish since two-division cricket began in 2000. Finishing above both neighbours Warwickshire and also Nottinghamshire, where four of their former players are now based, was a source of particular pride and pleasure.\nBuilding on that and again keeping their place in an always competitive division is now the challenge - although they will have to do so without the retired Joe Leach, as well as Kiwi Nathan Smith, who did well over the first half of last summer but then opted to join champions Surrey.\nBut they have another New Zealand fast bowler Jacob Duffy arriving from the second game onwards. They have three more incomers in Ben Allison from Essex, Nottinghamshire spinner Fateh Singh and Australian seamer Ben Dwarshuis for the T20 Blast.\nThey also still have that same marvellous team spirit to fall back on \u2013 and a real, genuine hunger.\nLong-term doubts remain over their future at New Road - but, in the short term, prospects at Worcester are brighter than people might think.\nJonny Bairstow will captain Yorkshire in the County Championship this season\n2024 season - Second in Division Two (promoted)\nJonathan Doidge - BBC Radio Leeds\nIt is likely to be a very interesting 2025 for Yorkshire.\nWith financial concerns now, apparently, assuaged at the very moment the team has returned to the top flight of the Championship, plus a new coaching staff and new red ball and T20 captains, there should rightly be an air of optimism.\nJonny Bairstow follows in his late father David's footsteps to steer the Championship challenge. He'd love to have a title as captain on his CV but aside from captaincy, his presence alone with the bat will be huge.\nSimilarly, Dawid Malan is going to be back playing more red-ball cricket, a major plus. Add to that potent opening pair of Adam Lyth and Finlay Bean, plus James Wharton, whose career began to blossom last year in particular, and more established batters like George Hill and that end of the team should be capable of setting up games.\nAs we know, that's no good without the ability to take 20 wickets and in that department there's plenty of encouragement. \nThe outstanding Ben Coad will again lead the line. Overseas input comes from, in particular, New Zealand's Ben Sears plus Will Sutherland (two matches) and Jordan Buckingham (four) also chipping in, while there's also George Hill, Jordan Thompson, off-season recruit Jack White, plus Matt Revis and Matt Milnes, who are on the road back from injury.\nDom Bess looks likely to be this coach's first pick among the spinners, though Dan Moriarty and Jafer Chohan will want a say in that.\nWith Bairstow donning the wicketkeeping gloves, Jonathan Tattersall and Harry Duke are going to have to wait for further opportunities, unless required as batters. You'd certainly have to feel for Tattersall after he led the team back up last season - but this is professional sport.\nWith One-Day Cup centurion Will Luxton awaiting another opportunity, there'll be upward pressure with the bat and I'd be backing Ben Cliff to put some serious pressure on the more senior bowlers in the squad. He could really take his own game to the next level as the season unfolds.\nIn summary, there's optimism that head coach Anthony McGrath can take the team to places it hasn't been for quite some time.",

        "summary": "A double signing of seamers just before the start of the campaign is looking to address that \u2013 recent Test debutant for Pakistan, Kashif Ali, and experienced South African pace man Keith Dudgeon are in place for the first part of the campaign.They've also added Corey Flintoff \u2013 son of Andrew, brother of Rocky \u2013 to the squad, the fast-bowling all-rounder joining on a rookie contract.With Aussie bowlers Wes Agar and Tom Rogers returning for the T20 Blast, it appears more of an evolution than a revolution at Canterbury this summer.But if Hollioake can get the best out of the squad they could be among the front-runners for promotion back to the top division of the Championship and a return to upsetting the big budget sides in the Blast.Lancashire - 'Red Rose favourites for promotion'Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Rocky Flintoff played four County Championship matches for Lancashire last season2024 season - Ninth in Division One (relegated)Scott Read - BBC Radio LancashireSince winning the County Championship title in 2011, Lancashire have been relegated four times. Last season, Leicestershire took the lowest number of wickets (139) in Division Two by some distance, and some supporters have argued the signing of New Zealand-born Netherlands international Logan van Beek adds to their ranks of bowling all-rounders rather than gives the Foxes the cutting edge they need to break games open.Tall young left-arm prospect Josh Hull has that potential, but has spent the close season struggling with injury.There is hope in the pre-season performances of the likes of veteran Chris Wright and the promising Tom Scriven, while Ben Green's return from Somerset for the first seven Championship matches adds depth.Middlesex - 'Williamson signing a coup'2024 season - Third in Division TwoKevin Hand - BBC Radio LondonThe signing of New Zealand batter Kane Williamson is something of a coup for a county that are operating under strict financial restrictions imposed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).The rearrangement of the budget for wage allocation within the squad meant a number of players were released last season, including the tough decision to let the popular former England opener Mark Stoneman go.With the evergreen opener Sam Robson aging well and Leus de Plooy a gun player in all formats, Middlesex have a top order to be feared -  probably for the first time since Robson, Nick Gubbins and Nick Compton formed a top three that played a huge part in the 2016 Championship winning side.The mark of the Middlesex team under former director of cricket Angus Fraser, who took charge in 2009, was the regular ability to blast through teams with the ball.In the absence of the retired Tim Murtagh, Middlesex struggled to rattle through the wickets last year and captain Toby Roland-Jones bore a heavy burden on that front. It is a good recipe to have.Sussex - 'Experienced players will be crucial'2024 season - First in Division Two (promoted)Adrian Harms - BBC Radio SussexThere's much excitement and anticipation on the south coast, as Sussex return to Division One after almost a decade in Division Two.During that period they have never mounted a serious promotion bid, and it's taken change at the top, and the subsequent appointment of Paul Farbrace to galvanise the club.Farbrace has introduced a winning mentality that had been sadly lacking, and  crucially supplemented a talented group of younger players with, in his words, \"knarled old pros\" who know how to win, and battle when the going gets tough.However, this is essentially a young Sussex side most with no experience of first division cricket, and therefore the experience of Australian Daniel Hughes, skipper John Simpson and Ollie Robinson will be crucial particularly during the opening weeks of the season.But don't think Sussex will be a soft touch and are back in Division One for the ride.Provided the top order can score enough runs, they have a match-winning spinner in Jack Carson and are especially difficult to beat at Hove, where they haven't lost since Farbrace took the helm.Sussex have taken nine long years to return to Division One, and the feeling around the club is that's where they want to stay.Warwickshire - 'Bears have no shortage of talent'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jacob Bethell's game time at Edgbaston is likely to be limited this season2024 season - Seventh in Division OneMike Taylor - BBC Radio WMA confusing winter followed a confusing summer. Wayne Madsen, who led the side to promotion in 2012, takes over from David Lloyd after his solitary campaign leading the side.Tickner's return and the presence of experienced bowlers such as Zak Chappell and Pat Brown can only benefit newcomer Harry Moore.Already in the England system, the much talked-about 17-year-old will be starting his first full season in the senior side having already shown he can more than hold his own at that level.Winter signings Jack Morley and Martin Andersson will be better for having been with the group last season.The big challenge remains the ability to take 20 wickets a match, something Mickey Arthur's side have to do if they are to repeat the relative riches of his first season in charge in 2022.Durham - 'Bowling the key issue'Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Matthew Potts' Durham appearances this season may be limited by England call-ups2024 season - Fifth in Division OneMartin Emmerson - BBC Radio NewcastleDurham finished fifth on their return to Division One last season and in general more than held their own. It was refreshing to see the right-armer clear of injury for the season and his team will desperately need that once more if they are to be promoted.The former England international will have his workload eased this year by the arrival of South African seamer Dane Paterson, another crucial addition to the squad that could make a significant difference to a side that looked on course for promotion for most of last season.The signings of Williamson and Paterson to bolster the Championship side are a clear indication that Middlesex want success to return in the shape of promotion this year.Northamptonshire - 'Lehmann arrival brings positivity'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Darren Lehmann was Australia head coach between 2013 and 20182024 season - Fourth in Division TwoAndrew Radd - BBC Radio NorthamptonshireThe arrival of Australian Darren Lehmann as head coach at Wantage Road has triggered a wave of pre-season positivity in a squad left feeling somewhat bruised by the events of the past couple of years.After being relegated from Division One in 2023 they failed to register a Division Two win in 2024 until September, by which time Lehmann's predecessor John Sadler had lost his job following defeat in the T20 Blast quarter-finals.With opener Emilio Gay and fast bowler Jack White both heading north, to Durham and Yorkshire respectively, there will be opportunities for others to shine.",

        "article_text": "From Drop to A Minecraft Movie, these are the films to stream at home and watch at the cinema this month.\nDavid Cronenberg's latest sci-fi-tinged drama stars Vincent Cassel as Karsh, an inventor who looks a lot like Cronenberg himself. Grief-stricken by the death of his wife (Diane Kruger), Karsh develops camera systems that can be buried with corpses, so that their relatives can watch them on monitors as they decompose. The invention catches on, but one night some graves containing these high-tech \"shrouds\" are desecrated, so Karsh and his brother-in-law (Guy Pearce) have to work out who was responsible. This may sound like the kind of scenario that the director of Scanners and The Fly might use to justify lots of gory body horror, but The Shrouds is a \"restrained, even elegant\" film inspired by Cronenberg's own bereavement, says Steve Pond at The Wrap. \"It's a deeply personal look at loss that finds plenty of time to get creepy but never loses sight of the fact that it's a movie about grief\u2026 Its focus, which never wavers, is always on the feeling of loss, not the sight of gore.\"\nReleased on 18 April in the US\nThree of Hollywood's brightest young stars get together in On Swift Horses, a handsome period romance directed by Daniel Minhan and adapted from Shannon Pufahl's novel. Daisy Edgar-Jones plays Muriel, the fianc\u00e9e of an upstanding Korean War veteran, Lee (Will Poulter). He is looking forward to a traditional family life in California in the go-getting 1950s, but when his younger brother Julius (Jacob Elordi) comes to stay, Julius's gay relationships and gambling sprees help Muriel to understand why she is attracted to women and drawn to betting on horse races. Graham Guttman at Screen Rant calls the film a \"quietly devastating [story of] great pain and even greater love, all of which is portrayed beautifully by the film's all-star cast\", adding: \"On Swift Horses, with its sweeping romance and epic nature, feels outside of time, transcending any issues to become something deeply affecting.\" On the other hand, the BBC's Caryn James considers it \"a disappointment [that] works much better as an idea than as a film\".\nReleased on 25 April in the US and Canada, and on 30 April in France\nOn a remote island in Eastern Europe, fanged and furry monsters called Ochi lurk in the forests. A farmer (Willem Dafoe) is obsessed by hunting them, but when his shy teenage daughter (Helena Zengel) finds an injured baby Ochi, it turns out to be a big-eyed, pointy-eared beastie that bears a striking resemblance to Gizmo from Gremlins and Grogu from The Mandalorian. The girl then defies her father and takes the creature back to its family \u2013 a journey that is visualised using practical rather than digital effects. \"The Legend of Ochi, the rare A24 family film, is a charming throwback to adventure movies of the 80s like The Neverending Story and The Dark Crystal,\" says Brian Tallerico at RogerEbert.com, \"complete with original puppetry that reportedly contains not an ounce of CGI manipulation. It feels like a family film made by flesh-and-blood people in an era when computers are doing so much of the work.\"\nReleased on 25 April in the US, the UK, Canada and Ireland\nRyan Coogler has already put his own personal stamp on the sports drama (Creed) and the superhero blockbuster (Black Panther), and now, with Sinners, the writer-director takes on gothic horror. His favourite leading man, Michael B Jordan, plays two gun-toting twin brothers, Smoke and Stack, who go back to their rural hometown in 1930s Louisiana, only to find that the local blues music \"can pierce the veil between life and death\". The town is soon infested with vampires \u2013 but don't think of Sinners as a straightforward vampire chiller. \"The film is very genre-fluid,\" Coogler said in The Hollywood Reporter. \"It switches in and out of a lot of different genres. Yes, vampires are an element, but it's not the only supernatural element in the movie... I'm blessed to have found this medium that I can work out deep philosophical and existential questions that I may be struggling with while contributing to an art form that means so much to my family.\"\nReleased internationally on 18 April\nFirst dates can be awkward, but not many are as awkward as the one in Drop, a high-concept one-location thriller from Christopher Landon, the writer-director of Happy Death Day and Freaky. Meghann Fahy stars as a single mother, Violet, who agrees to have dinner with the eligible Henry (Brandon Sklenar) in a Chicago skyscraper's restaurant. Everything is going smoothly until someone in the restaurant starts sending threatening messages to Violet's phone. She is told that there is an intruder in her home, and that unless she poisons Henry, her five-year-old son will be killed. \"[Fahy's] dialled-in performance is thankfully matched by an overarching crispness to the proceedings,\" says Adrian Horton in The Guardian. \"Just enough flourishes, an enjoyable but not unbearable amount of stress, no wasted time, a perfect match of star, script and style. For those who sort for lean and limber in their thrillers, Drop is a date worth making.\"\nReleased internationally on 11 April\nWhen Alex Garland was making his last film, Civil War, his military advisor for the battle sequences was Ray Mendoza, an Iraq War veteran. This collaboration prompted Garland and Mendoza to co-direct another film, a faithful recreation of a battle which Mendoza himself was in, that plays out in real time over 90 minutes. D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai plays Mendoza (alongside Will Poulter, Joseph Quinn and Charles Melton) in what some critics are calling cinema's most authentic and immersive ever depiction of a wartime firefight. It's a film that pushes the \"war is hell\" concept \"to its logical, visceral and most infernal conclusion\", says Kevin Maher in The Times. \"This is a movie that's as difficult to watch as it is to forget. It's a sensory blitz, a percussive nightmare and a relentless assault on the soul.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US and Canada, 16 April in Spain, 17 April in Australia, Brazil and Germany, and 18 April in the UK\nIf you finished watching Peter Jackson's series, The Beatles: Get Back, and you wanted to know what John Lennon got up to after the Fab Four broke up, then One to One: John & Yoko could be the film for you. Directed by Kevin Macdonald (One Day in September, Marley) along with Sam Rice-Edwards, the documentary chronicles the 18 months in the early 1970s when Lennon and Yoko One lived in Greenwich Village, New York. It covers the only full-length concert Lennon played after his time in The Beatles \u2013 but that was just one of the couple's many endeavours during their stay in the Big Apple. \"Drawing on televised interviews, taped phone calls with agents and managers, and personal film footage,\" says David Hughes in Time Out, \"Macdonald charts the couple's determination to fight for any worthy cause that crosses their eyeline, from the Vietnam War to fundraising for remanded prisoners unable to afford bail. The pair's artistry, individually and collectively, seems to be matched only by their energy and moral clarity.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US, the UK and Ireland\nWhat if Die Hard was set at a meeting of the world's most powerful political leaders? And what if the US president in Air Force One was a woman? The answer to both of these questions can be found in G20, a gleefully over-the-top action thriller directed by Patricia Riggen. Viola Davis stars as US President Danielle Sutton, who is at a G20 summit in South Africa when a terrorist group takes the guests hostage. What the bad guys (led by Antony Starr from The Boys) haven't counted on is that the POTUS is an army veteran, and even when she's wearing a cocktail dress, she can fight with the best of them. \"It was the sort of thing you'd imagine as a kid, just playing the most heroic character you could possibly play,\" Davis told Variety. The only question the film doesn't answer is whether the sequel will be called G21.\nReleased on 10 April on Prime\nA Minecraft Movie is a children's adventure co-starring Jack Black, and adapted from a video game about a colourful fantasy world being threatened by infernal invaders. Does that sound familiar? If so, it's because the very same summary applies to The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Still, that was the second highest grossing film of 2023, so maybe A Minecraft Movie will be just as lucrative. The difference is that the new film, which also stars Jason Momoa and Jennifer Coolidge, has live-action actors in a CGI world. Also, it's directed by Jared Hess, the maker of such eccentric comedies as Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre. \"By some force of alchemy, his cockeyed look at things \u2013 a mix of deadpan delivery, garish colours, and exaggerated interactions \u2013 is weirdly perfect for this adaptation,\" says Jordan Hoffman in Entertainment Weekly. \"There's an 'anything goes' attitude here\u2026 [and] this loosey-goosey attitude is a breath of fresh air after so many family films that seem preordained by lore.\"\nReleased internationally on 4 April\nWith a dynamic that's not a million miles away from the central relationship in A Real Pain, Sacramento is an indie comedy about two mismatched male friends \u2013 one neurotic, the other annoyingly outgoing \u2013 embarking on a trip together. Glenn, played by Michael Cera, is even more anxious than usual because he is about to become a father, while the extrovert Rickey, played by Michael Angarano, is traumatised by the death of his own father. Could a weekend in Sacramento, California help them to overcome all of their issues? Angarano is also the co-writer, co-producer and director of a film that features both his ex-partner, Kristen Stewart, and his current partner, Maya Erskine. David Ehrlich at IndieWire says that Angarano \"graduates from overeager dilettante to unusually shrewd comic director\" with Sacramento. \"Its casual nature and outward lack of ambition belie how well it manages to convey the terror that change brings into our lives, the mania of trying to deny it, and the relief that comes from recognising that someone else in your world is changing with you.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US\nAng Lee's second film, The Wedding Banquet, was a romantic comedy about a gay Taiwanese New Yorker who marries a Chinese woman so that she can get a green card, only for his unwitting parents to mark the occasion with a lavish party. The film made Lee's name as a director when it was released in 1993, and it went on to be nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Now it has been remade by Andrew Ahn (Fire Island), with a stellar cast that includes Bowen Yang (Wicked), Lily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon) and Kelly Marie Tran (Star Wars: The Last Jedi). Ahn moves the story to Seattle, adds a subplot about fertility treatment, and rejigs the nationalities and generations so that the visiting relative is now a grandmother (Minari's Youn Yuh-jung) from South Korea. \"An intended marriage of convenience still lies at its heart,\" says Amber Wilkinson in Screen Daily, \"but the relationships are given a modern makeover as Ahn probes questions of commitment and celebrates the families we choose to make for ourselves\".\nReleased on 18 April in the US and Canada\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Liverpool's loss at Fulham was their first away league defeat under Arne Slot\nLiverpool's unbeaten run has come to an end but - barring a remarkable collapse - they will end the season as Premier League champions.\nDefeat at Fulham was the Reds' first in 26 league games and just their second of the campaign.\nBut with seven games remaining, Arne Slot's side require a maximum of 11 points more to secure the title.\n\"If you look at the goals we conceded, I think all three, we could have prevented them,\" Slot told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"That is not what we usually see and that is probably why we are where we are, because if you make these mistakes more often in this league, you would not have the amount of points we have.\n\"The second half is much more like the team we are. Conceding three goals in the manner we did is not of the standards of Liverpool. That's clear.\"\nDespite the setback at Craven Cottage,  a record-equalling 20th top-flight crown is surely a formality now?\nThey could even win the title as early as 20 April - if results elsewhere go their way - with no team in Premier League history throwing away a lead of this size at this stage of the season.\nThe Reds' dominance has been clear for all to see this campaign, and they lead second-placed Arsenal by 11 points.\nSlot is certainly expecting his side to bounce back and get the job done.\n\"We played a good game on Wednesday [against Everton] and we will show up against West Ham [on Sunday] as well,\" he told Sky Sports.\nThis video can not be played\n'Mo will show up' - Slot not worried by Salah's form\nWe've all heard the accusations and whispers this season from rival fans, haven't we?\n'This Liverpool team isn't actually that great.' 'The Premier League is a poor league this season.' 'Liverpool's class of 2024-25 wouldn't have won the title in another season.'\nSunday's loss will only add to those shouts. How fair is this, though?\nFirstly, it has to be said Liverpool's usual rivals are not having their best seasons.\nDefending champions Manchester City are on track for their worst campaign under Pep Guardiola, Manchester United are set for their worst season in Premier League history, Arsenal are nine points adrift of their points tally at this stage of last season, while Tottenham and Chelsea have suffered their own struggles as well.\n\"The other teams just haven't stepped up this season and Liverpool have been consistent all the way through,\" former Manchester United captain Gary Neville told Sky Sports prior to the Fulham match.\n\"The rest of them have fallen well below their standards - Arsenal, obviously Manchester City, United, Tottenham.\"\nIt's been a good season for Liverpool to hit full stride then. And Slot's men have certainly done that.\nEven if Arsenal were on the 71 points they had reached at this stage last season, when they were top of the table, Liverpool would still be two points ahead of them.\n\"I don't even think Liverpool have been outstanding this season, they've been efficient,\" ex-Manchester City defender Micah Richards told Sky Sports.\n\"They've been slower in build-up and more ruthless in front of goal.\"\nArsenal's much-lauded invincibles finished their title-winning campaign on 90 points back in 2004. Slot's men need 18 points from seven games to beat that.\nIn 32 Premier League seasons, only 14 sides have reached that mark and one of them - Manchester United in 1993-94 - did so in a 42-game season.\nLiverpool are also the only side to get 90-plus points and not win the title - doing so twice under Jurgen Klopp - meaning only 12 of the previous 31 league-winning sides posted in 90 points or more.\nMeanwhile, the average number of points for the team in second after their 31st game of a season is 65.4 - slightly higher than Arsenal's current 62 points - but there have been second-placed teams on much lower tallies at this stage, including Arsenal's 57 points in 2000-01.\n\"Liverpool want to reinstate the aura that they've had all season and finish strong,\" former Manchester City midfielder Izzy Christiansen told Sky Sports.\n\"However they end up winning it is almost up to them. They've been fantastic.\"\nYou can only beat what is front of you and Liverpool have done just that in formidable style - up until Sunday, anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool's 26-match unbeaten run ended by Fulham\nHow to win the Champions League: Liverpool 2019\n13 April: West Ham (H)\n20 April: Leicester (A)\n27 April: Tottenham (H)\n4 May: Chelsea (A)\n11 May: Arsenal (H)\n18 May: Brighton (A)\n25 May: Crystal Palace (H)\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "After graduating college Kelsey Krakora worked full time in a steakhouse, bartending and serving meals.\nShe had dabbled with selling clothes online, but only part-time. \nBut in 2021 that all changed for Cleveland-based Ms Krakora.\nShe switched to selling clothes on Whatnot and then Poshmark - online marketplaces where people can also use live video to sell items.\n\"My first live show with Poshmark was 27th November 2022. I sold zero things on my first show... but that didn't last long!\"\nNow she sells around 100 items per show, worth about $1,000 in sales (\u00a3773). \nHer shows are on average three hours long and she does between two and three a week.\n\"These events are inclusive, welcoming, you can shop in your PJs, and there's no need to head to the shopping mall,\" says Ms Krakora.\nLive shopping has been popular in the Asia-Pacific region for some time, where social networks such as China's Douyin regularly host live shopping streams, but now European and US brands are experimenting with this new way of selling their products.\nLive shopping is a close relative to shopping channels like QVC, where viewers are urged to call in and buy the products demonstrated by presenters. \nBut live shopping acts as a quicker shortcut from buyer to product, especially in the era of one-click purchases, made popular by online retailers such as Amazon.\nAlso, as younger generations increasingly cut the chord and can't access cable TV, shopping channels don't hold the same relevance as they once did.\nIt's estimated the live shopping market has reached $32bn, with the most active sectors being fashion, cosmetics and collectibles.\nA 2024 survey from digital commerce platform VTEX found that 45% of US consumers have browsed or purchased from live shopping events in the past 12 months. \n\nGuillaume Faure, chief executive of LiveMeUp, which provides live shopping video software, remembers when interest in live shopping surged.\n\"When Instagram introduced Reels, and when YouTube launched Shorts, we saw live shopping really take off.\" \nHe's noticed the popularity of tutorials and how-to videos in live shopping events, such as how hosts can teach shoppers how to apply a certain type of make-up, or arrange a variety of flowers to deliver the most evocative bouquet.\nHowever, some analysts think that live shopping is likely to have a limited appeal.\n\"Many companies have tried live shopping but it simply doesn't scale,\" says Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at Forrester Research.\n\"Maybe it works in China where they don't have the same kind of store density we have in the US, where it's better for consumers to go and try something on rather than watch a host try on a piece of clothing,\" she adds. \nJonathan Reynolds,  academic director of the Oxford Institute of Retail Management, University of Oxford, also highlights that the Chinese market is different.\n\"In China, so-called key opinion leaders (KOLs) like Li Jiaqi, the so-called 'Lipstick King, are well established,\" he says.\n\"Li has carefully built his personal brand to demonstrate his expertise and build consumer trust. KOLs are also working within much more sophisticated platform ecosystems,\" Mr Reynolds explains.\nEven Ms Krakora admits that not all products work on a live shopping stream.\nFor example, she prefers to shop for jeans in-person. \"I'm tall, and I have specific cuts of jeans that I wear,\" she says, \"and there are tried-and-true styles and brands I like.\"\nBruce Winder, a retail analyst in Toronto, also says that for some shoppers, the convenience of live shopping might be too attractive. \n\"Consumers may get addicted to the show or channel... and some consumers may not be able to stop watching and spending as they get caught up in the moment,\" he adds.\nDespite those potential pitfalls, major brands and platforms have jumped on the live shopping bandwagon.\nNordstrom, Kit Kat, Samsung and L'Oreal have sold products during these streams as hosts showcased new or discounted products, and joining Poshmark as the host for these events are Amazon, eBay, TikTok, YouTube and Instagram.\n\"Live shopping lets shoppers have a conversation with someone who knows the products being sold, and that generates a lot of excitement,\" says Manish Chandra, the chief executive and founder of Poshmark.\n\"It also creates a community where other shoppers are in the same show, and it's really a different experience than a traditional shopping trip.\"\nFor some brands live shopping has been a game-changer.\nHigh-end fragrance brand The House of Amouage partnered with Nordstrom in late 2024 to bring their live shopping events to the US.\nOman-based Amouage was following up on the success they enjoyed in China. In the 140 live streams they hosted with Chinese influencers on the social platforms Douyin and Taobao in 2023, they sold more than 3,000 units.\nThe firm's chief creative officer Renaud Salmon says it's helping the company learn about what its customers want. \n\"In the past, we would have used customer satisfaction surveys,\" says Mr Salmon, \"but with live shopping, we get feedback right away and I bring that back to my team to help refine our products.\"",

He has now granted a another 75-day extension until June broker a deal.\nThe US government has said TikTok poses a threat to national security because Chinese authorities might access its vast trove of user data, which Beijing denies.\nSpeaking on Air Force One on Thursday, Trump said \"multiple investors\" were closing in on a deal.\nHe also suggested the US could offer a deal where China agrees to approve a TikTok sale in exchange for relief from US tariffs on Chinese imports.\nSeveral potential buyers have cropped up in reports.\nAmazon has put in a last-minute offer to the White House to acquire TikTok, according to the BBC's US partner CBS. Amazon declined to comment.\nTrump has said he would be open to selling TikTok to Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, as well as Elon Musk, although the latter said he had no intention of buying.\nOther potential buyers include billionaire Frank McCourt, together with Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary - a celebrity investor on Shark Tank, the US version of Dragons' Den.\nAlexis Ohanian, who co-founded Reddit, said in a post on X last month that he had joined Mr McCourt's bid.\nThe biggest YouTuber in the world Jimmy Donaldson - AKA MrBeast - has also said he's looking to buy TikTok as part of a group of investors.\nTim Stokely, the British founder of OnlyFans, has also to offered to buy TikTok under his recently re-launched company, Zoop.\nComputing giant Microsoft, private equity giant Blackstone, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and search engine Perplexity AI are also reportedly in the running for a stake. \nThe White House has reportedly considered an option whereby ByteDance would keep ownership of TikTok's algorithm, but lease it to a new entity operating the video-sharing app within the US.\nIf no deal is reached by 5 April, the app could once again face a US ban and be pulled from app stores.\nTrump signed an executive order in January, which only delayed TikTok's ban by 75 days. \nHis order did not overturn the ban on the app passed into law by Congress and upheld by the US Supreme Court.\nTrump could allow the law to stand, but ask the Department of Justice to continue to ignore it.\nThe government would effectively be telling Apple and Google they will not be punished for allowing people to download TikTok on to their devices. \nTikTok returned to Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store in February, after the companies were reportedly told they would not face consequences for hosting it.\nTrump has also said he would \"probably\" extend the deadline, if needed.\nTikTok says it has 170 million US users who spent - on average - 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024.\nExperts say rivals such as Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts could benefit if Trump's efforts to broker a sale of TikTok don't succeed. \n\"Chief marketing officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok,\" said Kelsey Chickering, an analyst at market research company Forrester.\nOther potential winners include Amazon's Twitch, which made its name by hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok. Twitch is well known particularly to gamers, though its other content is expanding, too. \nOther Chinese-owned platforms, such as Xiaohongshu - known as RedNote among its US users - have also seen rapid growth in the US and the UK.\nAdditional reporting by Liv McMahon & Imran Rahman-Jones",

Amazon declined to comment.Trump has said he would be open to selling TikTok to Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, as well as Elon Musk, although the latter said he had no intention of buying.Other potential buyers include billionaire Frank McCourt, together with Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary - a celebrity investor on Shark Tank, the US version of Dragons' Den.Alexis Ohanian, who co-founded Reddit, said in a post on X last month that he had joined Mr McCourt's bid.The biggest YouTuber in the world Jimmy Donaldson - AKA MrBeast - has also said he's looking to buy TikTok as part of a group of investors.Tim Stokely, the British founder of OnlyFans, has also to offered to buy TikTok under his recently re-launched company, Zoop.Computing giant Microsoft, private equity giant Blackstone, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and search engine Perplexity AI are also reportedly in the running for a stake. His order did not overturn the ban on the app passed into law by Congress and upheld by the US Supreme Court.Trump could allow the law to stand, but ask the Department of Justice to continue to ignore it.The government would effectively be telling Apple and Google they will not be punished for allowing people to download TikTok on to their devices.",

        "article_text": "Alejandro Garnacho (second left) posed with Amad Diallo, Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund after Manchester United's FA Cup final win last season\nAlejandro Garnacho has a bit of history with Manchester City.\nLast season, he scored the opening goal as Manchester United stunned their local rivals in the FA Cup final - later posing with the trophy along with his youthful team-mates Amad Diallo, Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund.\nJust over two months later he was back on target at Wembley when he scored in the Community Shield against this weekend's Manchester derby opponents - the first of eight goals in his first 20 games of the season.\nBut then things took a downturn.\nGarnacho did not face City on 15 December after being dropped along with fellow forward Marcus Rashford.\nHead coach Ruben Amorim spoke about it being a selection issue following an evaluation of \"training performance, game performance, engagement with team-mates\".\n\"I pay attention to everything,\" he said. \"The way you eat, the way you put your clothes to go to a game.\"\nUnlike Rashford, who returned to the squad just once and did not play again before joining Aston Villa on loan in February, Garnacho was recalled immediately. \nSources said the issue came down to an interpretation of his reaction to receiving instruction as he waited to come on in a Europa League game\nAmorim believed Garnacho wasn't listening. Garnacho felt he was, while watching the game unfold.\nNew in the job, Amorim felt he had to lay down a marker. Garnacho's speedy return - and continued presence - confirms the matter has been dealt with and forgotten.\nBut his performance levels have dipped. In 21 appearances since the City game, Garnacho has scored one goal and created four.\nAnd after another frustrating performance against Nottingham Forest on Tuesday - during which he had six unsuccessful shots and was shown a yellow card for kicking the ball away in anger - his future became the focus of fan discussion.\nCan you name people to play for Man Utd & City?\nGarnacho has scored four goals in 29 Premier League appearances this season - making him United's third-top scorer. He has nine goals and eight assists in all competitions\nHe has created 26 chances - putting him outside top 50 in the Premier League.\nGarnacho has attempted 65 dribbles but only completed 20 - 75th among Premier League players.\nHis 68 shots in the league is the 11th highest total, but with a very low conversion rate of 5.9%.\nGarnacho is in the top 10 for carries ending in shots (24) and 20th for carries ending in a chance created (15).\nHe has completed 30.8% successful dribbles - the lowest of any Premier League player to have attempted 50 or more.\nGarnacho's possession won, interceptions, sprints and tackles have dropped under Amorim compared to under Erik ten Hag this season; but his possession won in the final third and distance covered per match stats have improved.\nSpeaking to sources around United, a few key points emerge.\nGarnacho's confidence is at a low ebb. Someone with high-level coaching experience, who understands the demands players face at a club of that stature, suggests he is 'nervous'. It is a trait first spotted when he was breaking into the first team.\nThe Argentine is viewed as a player who is at his best when his mind is free. The belief is he is now over-thinking, meaning he snatches at chances.\nUnited legend Paul Scholes - now a pundit - has previously described Garnacho as \"scruffy\" technically and said his decision-making is \"really poor\" at times.\nIt is acknowledged from sources inside the club that Garnacho is feeling the strain, and he was pictured slapping his head in frustration after one wasted shot on Tuesday.\nThis is the first extended dip of Garnacho's career. While to many he 'arrived' with his brilliant bicycle kick at Everton in November 2023, he actually made his debut in April 2022.\nTuesday's game was Garnacho's 132nd for United - 46 of which have been this season. If he stays injury free and remains at the club, he could become one of the youngest United players to reach 200 appearances.\nAll have come during tumultuous times at Old Trafford, and it is worth remembering, too, that he is just 20.\nAs a 'homegrown' player, Garnacho remains one of United's most valuable assets. \nThe Football Transfers website values him at \u00a355m - ninth in the list of under-21 players globally.\nIt is a year ago since United headed towards the summer transfer window in a delicate position with the Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and let it be known they would consider offers for any of their players, aside from Garnacho, Mainoo and Hojlund, who were 'untouchable'. \nThat status was quietly removed before the January 2025 window.\nGarnacho was the subject of sustained interest from Napoli and Chelsea. Garnacho and his camp were aware of it. They also knew that while they weren't pushing him out of the door, United's hierarchy were not exactly putting the lock and bolt on.\nQuite how close a deal came to being struck is not clear, but could certainly be unsettling for the player.\nGarnacho went from being a central component of Ten Hag's squad to becoming part of the answer to United's PSR problems, with any fee being banked as 'pure profit'.\nHe could hardly be blamed for wondering if his future lay elsewhere.\nGarnacho's 'heatmap' under Erik ten Hag in the Premier League this season\nGarnacho's 'heatmap' under Ruben Amorim in the Premier League this season\n1 of 2\nIt is clear Garnacho's best position - and his preferred role - is as a wide attacking player. \nBut it is a role that does not exist in Amorim's formation, where wing-backs provide the width and inside forwards the penetration. \nHe is trying to adapt - and Amorim's selections and recent quotes suggest he wants him to - but the process is not straightforward.\nOn Friday, he said: \"I think he is doing the right things. Like any player in our team, has to choose better, especially in the last third.\n\"Garnacho is improving the way he defends, the way he runs. He needs more goals and assists, that is clear. He wants to improve and is improving but is not in a great moment.\"\nLast month, the Portuguese said it was \"clear\" Garnacho had talent but he needed to \"learn to play a little bit in a different position\".\n\"He's finding the best way to play in this system. He's improving during training, and I think he changed the way he sees himself. I am trying to find the best position for him.\"\nThe decline in his effectiveness has been spotted elsewhere. After being a regular in the Argentina squad as part of the Copa America win last summer, he was left out for the most recent World Cup qualifiers.\nGarnacho's 26 chances created in the Premier League this season - including his only assist\nGarnacho is not hiding on the pitch, but does shun the limelight off it.\nHe has a young partner and child at home, with his wider family in Spain.\nSources told BBC Sport Garnacho is dedicated and showing maturity - reporting to training an hour before Amorim's start time of 10am for individual gym work.\nThough he does not tend to do many external interviews, he has worked hard on his English since he arrived in September 2020 and spent his first weeks in isolation because of Covid-19. \nHe does plenty of 'meet and greets' with fans and will sometimes stop on the way home from training to offer boots or other memorabilia to young fans.\nGarnacho is starting to gravitate towards the older players in the group. Within the squad, he is no longer recognised as a new kid on the block.\nGoing into Sunday's game there are questions around his future, but only time will tell if that lies at Old Trafford or elsewhere.\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

        "article_text": "Batteries for electric vehicles are notoriously difficult to recycle, but growing demand for the rare metals they contain is leading to innovative new ways of retrieving them from used power cells.\nI am standing in a lab where batteries go to be reborn. But first, they must be shredded.\nWhat arrives here is a dark powder called \"black mass\" \u2013 a substance derived from pulverising batteries almost to oblivion. Each particle is less than a millimetre across. Staff working for Altilium, a recycling firm in the south-west of England, are now tasked with extracting crucial materials from this pitch black disorder.\nThe powder contains some plastic and steel from the battery which must be separated out, but there are also sought-after materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and graphite. These are the prized ingredients with which the lab workers here can make a new battery.\nAs the climate crisis intensifies, the world is electrifying. Countries are increasingly shifting away from fossil fuels towards renewable sources of energy including solar panels and wind turbines. Homeowners are installing heat pumps in the place of old gas or oil boilers. And drivers are increasingly buying electric vehicles (EVs) powered by batteries.\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), nearly one in five cars sold in 2023 was electric. This was a 35% year-on-year increase compared to 2022 and brought the number of EVs on the world's roads to 40 million. The problem with this is that demand for batteries, and the materials required to make them, is soaring.\n\"One of the big challenges is that the minerals are kind of concentrated in certain places,\" says Christian Marston, president and chief operating officer of Altilium. Over half of the world's nickel comes from Indonesia, while two-thirds of all cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 both of which have ongoing human rights issues associated with mining operations.\nThat's why there's now a race to find other ways of sourcing those key minerals. Recycling batteries is one option, but is also notoriously difficult. Staff at Altilium, however, say they've cracked it.\nAltilium's facility is squirreled away in the unassuming English town of Tavistock. Getting here involves driving across the windswept expanse of Dartmoor, sometimes slowing to a crawl to wait for sheep to get off the road. When I arrive, I find Altilium's building on a mundane industrial estate with a tyre shop across the road \u2013 but what they're cooking up inside is anything but mundane.\nIn the lab I find racks of glass cylinders linked together by tubes, all filled with brightly coloured liquids \u2013 mostly vivid blues and greens \u2013 running the length of the room. Nearby, a technician wearing a white lab coat and safety glasses studies the workings of these contraptions.\nThis is Altilium's solvent extraction lab, where staff retrieve sought-after battery ingredients from the black mass they process here.\nIt all began in late 2020, but got off to a slow start. \"We lost two years because of Covid,\" says Marston ruefully.\nBut in mid-2022, he and colleagues took out a lease on the Tavistock facility \u2013 at the time, an \"empty shed\", says chief technology officer Ben Wickham. The team built several laboratories, and began developing their recycling process on a small scale. Three years later, they are commissioning a larger plant just outside nearby Plymouth, which will supply recycled materials to battery manufacturers.\nThe company is one of just a handful of firms around the world that are developing methods for recycling batteries sourced from old EVs. Such firms promise to bring us one step closer to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and also closer to a circular economy, in which almost nothing is thrown away.\n\"We have to remove that myth that batteries go to landfill,\" says Marston. As EVs have become more popular, more and more of them are now reaching the end of their useful lives. That means more exhausted batteries from those aging vehicles have become available. Recycling batteries prevents expensive \u2013 and toxic \u2013 materials getting into the environment.\nSome of the other companies working on battery recycling technology are located in the US. The Inflation Reduction Act passed by President Biden's administration in 2022, which funded climate actions, has helped to motivate such efforts. Li-Cycle, a company established in 2016 which recovers critical materials from lithium-ion batteries, has plants in Canada, the US and Germany, for instance.\nHype meter\nWhile lots of companies are working on battery recycling technologies, it's worth considering how much progress each of them have actually made to date. Altilium has, to its credit, actually manufactured battery cells using recycled materials from end-of-life electric vehicle batteries.\nBut this is still far from a conveyor belt churning out finished batteries ready for consumer use. Companies currently developing environmentally-friendly forms of battery recycling must show that they can compete with more polluting but established approaches, such as pyrometallurgy. Plus, processing of the black mass from old, shredded batteries often occurs in Asia today, partly because costs are lower there.\nRedwood Materials, a US company with campuses in Northern Nevada and South Carolina, was established in 2017 by one of the founders of electric car company Tesla, and has partnerships with carmakers Toyota, VW and BMW. Some older materials companies have also started experimenting, notably the Texas-based Ecobat Solutions. And many other firms are now also investing in battery recycling tech.\nDespite the interest, however, there's much progress to be made in the area. \"The current lithium-ion battery recycling market is still in a very early industrial stage,\" says Xiaochu Wei, a battery recycling researcher at Imperial College London in the UK.\nLast year, German chemicals firm BASF \"paused\" work on a battery recycling plant in Spain, though the company says it still intends to build the facility.\nPart of the challenge in this field is how complex batteries are to begin with, which makes recycling them tricky.\nEvery battery has two main components: the cathode and the anode. When providing power to, say, a motor, the anode releases negatively-charged electrons, which flow around a circuit until they return to the battery and are absorbed by the cathode. Electrons flow in the opposite direction when the battery is charging.\nIn an electric vehicle battery, the cathode and anode are both thin sheets of material. The two are wrapped around each other in a spiral, like a Swiss roll with incredibly thin layers. In many battery designs, the anode is made of graphite, the same kind of carbon used in the cores of pencils. The cathode, meanwhile, often contains a variety of metals, including nickel, lithium and cobalt.\nAlthough recycling such structures is difficult, opportunity lies in the large number of valuable materials available, all of which can be sold lucratively if extracted and purified. Somewhat frustratingly, those materials are rather closely intermingled, and many of them are dangerous: several of the metals are toxic to people and wildlife, and they also pose fire and explosion hazards.\nAltilium's battery shredding process recovers graphite, originally from the anode, alongside other minerals. Getting graphite back out of a battery used to require a high-temperature process called pyrometallurgy, but this produces significant emissions, which is partly why Altilium has adopted a water-based system called hydrometallurgy. Staff soak the black mass in sulphuric acid, which allows them to filter out the graphite. This can be sold back to battery manufacturers, after some additional processing.\nWhat's left is an acidic liquid with a variety of metals dissolved in it. Some of them \u2013 aluminium, copper and iron \u2013 are not very valuable. By tweaking the acidity, the team can force them to precipitate out as grey powder. This, Wickham says, could be sold as filler for building materials.\nNow the team is in a position to extract the valuable nickel, cobalt and manganese. It recovers these one by one, mixing the liquid with kerosene and special chemicals that pull the metals out of solution. This is the step I saw with the glass tubes full of coloured liquids.\nWickham explains that Altilium takes this approach because manufacturers are constantly changing the chemical makeup of batteries. \"Battery chemistry is moving fast,\" he says. Wickham argues that battery companies will increasingly rely on nickel, compared to other metals, because it stores more energy for a given volume. (Some emerging battery designs, however, are moving away from nickel because of its high price tag.)\nBy separating out individual metals, Altilium aims to supply battery manufacturers with the exact mixes they want for their new cathodes. The goal is to create a \"closed-loop EV battery supply chain\" in the UK, says Marston.\nMethods that reduce old batteries to their component raw materials will be essential for sustainable economies, says Anna Hankin, a senior lecturer in chemical engineering at Imperial College London in the UK, who is working on a project funded by Altilium alongside Wei. While it's possible to regenerate used batteries by replacing chemicals lost from individual components, \"at some point that process will stop working\", she says. \"There will come a point for every battery when its components need to be shredded.\"\nBesides easing the transition to net zero, Marston argues that recycling EV batteries will take us a step closer to a circular economy, where, as much as possible, raw materials would be reused and recycled endlessly. This would reduce the need for extractive industries such as mining, which often damage ecosystems and pose risks to human health.\nIn the case of EV batteries, instead of mining more lithium, nickel and other metals from the ground, we can keep reusing the supplies we already have. Researchers have estimated that, by 2040, over half the demand for lithium and nickel for these batteries could be supplied by recycling.\nIn the next five to 10 years, Wei says, recycling could provide \"a decent share\" of the raw materials needed to make EV batteries \u2013 somewhere between 10% and 40%, she estimates. It would help if battery manufacturers redesigned their batteries to make it easier for recycling facilities to separate out the key components, she adds.\nIf recycling takes off, the benefits could be significant. According to a 2024 IEA report, greater recycling of critical minerals could reduce the need for new mining by as much as 40% by mid-century. The IEA notes that many governments are creating policies to encourage recycling. For instance, in 2023 the European Union introduced a new Battery Regulation, which will introduce increasingly stringent requirements for \"recycling efficiency, material recovery and recycled content\", beginning in 2025.\nThis isn't just about being environmentally friendly: there are also geopolitical motivations. In the last 20 years, the international order of things has significantly destabilised, with shocks such as Brexit and the policies of US President Donald Trump impacting global trade and international cooperation. Countries that are overly dependent on imports of critical supplies face significant risks in this new world, says Marston.\nThe minerals used in EV batteries will be increasingly important for countries to continue functioning. \"The future economies will be the ones which control the critical minerals,\" says Marston. That means countries like the UK have a problem. \"The UK doesn't have these minerals at scale.\"\nIn Marston's view, recycling electric vehicle batteries ensures energy security. \"We see batteries which are in this country as a strategic asset in the UK,\" he says. Instead of sending them abroad to be recycled \u2013 possibly in a country with poor environmental and labour laws \u2013 he wants them to be recycled domestically. \"If you do the processing in the UK, you add the value in the UK,\" he says.\nThe challenge for all these companies is to scale up. Altilium is currently commissioning its new larger plant which should be able to operate continuously. If that proves successful, the company has plans for two progressively larger facilities.\n\"If we do battery recycling at scale, we have confidence that we can produce a material which is around 20% lower cost than commercial material,\" says Marston. \"That would look like 150,000 EV batteries per year.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Three years later, they are commissioning a larger plant just outside nearby Plymouth, which will supply recycled materials to battery manufacturers.The company is one of just a handful of firms around the world that are developing methods for recycling batteries sourced from old EVs. \"The current lithium-ion battery recycling market is still in a very early industrial stage,\" says Xiaochu Wei, a battery recycling researcher at Imperial College London in the UK.Last year, German chemicals firm BASF \"paused\" work on a battery recycling plant in Spain, though the company says it still intends to build the facility.Part of the challenge in this field is how complex batteries are to begin with, which makes recycling them tricky.Every battery has two main components: the cathode and the anode.

On the other side is former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp.\n\"Jurgen's preferred option for that summer was Julian Brandt, who was a great player,\" said former Liverpool director of research Ian Graham, who spoke to BBC Sport as part of a documentary released on BBC iPlayer about Liverpool's journey to winning the 2018-19 Champions League.\n\"Jurgen had obviously known him very well, coming from the Bundesliga, and knew the German market very well.\n\"We agreed that Brandt was a very good young player but not a standout in the same way that Mo was. From our data analysis point of view Mo was the best young wide forward in Europe, full stop.\n\"Roma were under pressure to sell because their finances were not in a good place, so we knew he was available for a good price.\n\"He played a forward and wide role that we needed to fill at the time, whereas Brandt was more of an attacking midfielder.\"\nGraham added: \"It's to Jurgen's credit that he engaged in that debate in an honest way with his eyes open to say, 'OK, I'm open to be convinced, show me that Mo is better'.\"\nKlopp didn't need much convincing and Liverpool signed Salah from Roma in June 2017 for \u00a334m.\nThe Reds believed the Egypt international would be a \"future superstar\" and so it has proved.\nSalah, who is yet to agree a new contract with Liverpool beyond this summer, has gone on to become a Liverpool legend. \nHe has scored 243 goals and registered 109 assists for the club in 393 appearances and, under Klopp, helped the Reds win the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and Fifa Club World Cup.\nHow to Win the Champions League\nLiverpool\nGraham was a consultant at Tottenham from 2007-2012 but \"they never really had the ambition to make more\" of data whereas he said \"Liverpool were the first team to have an in-house analytics department\".\nHe was at Liverpool from 2012 to 2023 and was a key part of the 'Moneyball' strategy - the statistical method Major League \u00adBaseball side Oakland Athletics used in the 1990s to recruit players - that Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group (FSG) adopted at the club.\n\"Moneyball is really the concept of, 'can we get more value for money out of our squad? Can we get more performance per pound spent? Because, if we can, that means we can compete with clubs with a higher budget than us',\" said Graham.\n\"We started off with about seven or eight different leagues, by the time I left we were probably taking data from about 60 different leagues so that we really understood what players could do on the pitch.\"\nGraham worked under former Liverpool sporting director Michael Edwards, who left the club in 2022 before returning as FSG's chief executive of football in 2024.\nThe pair were part of a transfer committee who, along with Liverpool's manager, would \"come to a consensus decision on the best players to sign\".\nLiverpool had appointed Klopp as manager in October 2015 and his willingness to engage in the use of data in recruitment was in contrast to his predecessor Brendan Rodgers.\n\"Previously, we had robust debates with Brendan about which players to sign and the two differences were our ideas about which players would improve Liverpool were very different to Brendan's ideas,\" said Graham.\n\"Brendan, understandably, put a big premium on Premier League experience whereas we felt those players were quite often overvalued by the market and players from other markets, like Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino, were undervalued.\"\nGraham explained that Rodgers \"came in with a preconception that the player he wanted to sign was the only solution for that position\" and that \"it was very difficult to persuade him otherwise\".\nIn Klopp, Graham said they had found the \"missing piece\" and, in some cases, \"a manager who seemed to see what the data saw\".\nHe added: \"He [Jurgen] is very happy to thank us for our suggestions to have stopped some of the less sensible signings, which at the time caused big arguments but, in retrospect, he could see this was a good process for signing players.\"\nThis video can not be played\nHow Jurgen Klopp almost didn't sign Salah\nKlopp had managed at Mainz and Borussia Dortmund in Germany, winning the Bundesliga in 2011 and 2012 with the latter.\nHis first trophy at Liverpool was the 2019 Champions League, with data playing \"a big part in signing\" nine of the 11 Liverpool players who started the final against Tottenham - in a game the Reds won 2-0.\n\"The club needed it and, from our point of view, the data approach needed it as well,\" said Graham on that piece of silverware.\n\"Looking back, it is a source of pride and is some validation that data can be of help. It adds to recruitment.\n\"Our data analysis means nothing without the scouts to understand the traditional way of viewing a player, without Jurgen to get the best out of the players, without the ownership to trust in the process and without the sporting director to make decisions based on what the data is telling him.\n\"Jurgen's impact on the Champions League win, it can't really be overstated. His presence at the club attracted some really great players, he got the best out of those players and - by the time of that final - we had a world-class first XI that was quite different to the team that he inherited.\"\nKlopp went on to end the club's 30-year wait for a top-flight title by guiding them to the 2019-20 Premier League crown.\nGraham said: \"Jurgen, coming from the German system, was much more happy to take that compromised approach and it worked out really well for Liverpool.\"\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

He looked around to see a young man at the window asking for condoms.\n\"I was on the first floor,\" he says, recounting the story from a few years ago. \"The lad had shimmied up a drainpipe on the outside of the building because he didn't want to go through the reception and ask.\"\nThe anecdote, in many ways, encapsulates the challenges over men's health \u2013 a combination of risk-taking behaviour and a lack of confidence and skills to engage with health services.\n\nIn the UK men are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs and have high cholesterol and blood pressure.\nThese are major contributors to the fact men have a lower life expectancy than women - by four years - and are nearly 60% more likely to die prematurely before the age of 75 with heart disease, lung cancer, liver disease and in accidents.\nProf Alan White, who founded the Men's Health Forum charity and set up a dedicated men's health centre at Leeds Beckett University, says the issue needs to be taken more seriously.\nHe cites the pandemic as an example, pointing out that 19,000 more men than women died from Covid. \"Where was the outrage? Where was the attention?\"\nHe says it is too easy to blame men's poor health on their lifestyles, arguing \"it's much more complex than that.\"\nHe says there are biological reasons \u2013 the male immune system is less able to fight off infection. But, as the story of the young man seeking condoms above demonstrates, they can also lack the skills to access health services.\nProf White says: \"Men are less health-literate, that is to say they don't develop the skills to talk about their health and recognise and act on the signs. Men's health is very static from their teenage years right through into their 40s generally \u2013 many go years without see a health professional.\n\"It is different for women. Getting contraception, having cervical screening and then childbirth means many women have regular contact with health services in a way men do not.\"\nMachismo is also a factor, says Mark Brooks, the policy adviser for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Men's and Boy's Issues, which has played a key role in influencing the government to draw up a men's health strategy.\n\"In society we have different expectations in regards to men. They are expected to man up and get on with things, to be strong and resilient.\"\nBut he says when it comes to men's health it is important to pay particular attention to the impact of deprivation. Life expectancy in the poorest 10% of areas is 10 years less than in the wealthiest \u2013 a larger gap than is seen for women \u2013 and in the most deprived areas a man is 3.5 times more likely to die before the age of 75.\n\"You cannot ignore the stark differences when it comes to left-behind communities and those working in blue-collar jobs like construction and manufacturing,\" he says. \"The way health services are designed isn't working for men.\"\nNHS health checks, which are offered every five years to those aged 40 to 74, are considered a crucial intervention when it comes to many of the diseases which are claiming the lives of men early. But fewer than four in 10 men take up the offer.\n\"Someone working in construction or on an industrial estate will find it very difficult to take time off whether that's for a health check or to go and see their GP.\"\nMr Brooks says he would like to see employees given a right to two hours' paid time off to go for health checks as well as seeing them delivered in places where blue-collar workers are employed, such as industrial estates.\nBut he says this is also an issue about employment - with some men in these roles scared to face up to health problems that develop in their 40s and 50s - ignoring early warning signs or hiding illnesses from bosses altogether because of what it may mean for their work.\nHe adds that job worries and financial concerns, along with relationship problems,  are a big driver in the high suicide rates seen among men. Three-quarters of people who take their own lives are men.\nDespite this, just a third of people sent for talking therapies are men, which may suggest that services are not doing enough to consider men's needs.\n\"How services are set up to recognise signs of depression and anxiety is not how men express them \u2013 they are more likely to display signs of anger, abuse alcohol or become withdrawn and push people away,\" says Prof White.\nEthnic differences are also important to recognise, he says. For example, black men in England are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, while men from Indian or Bangladeshi backgrounds are at particularly high risk of diabetes.\nBut none of this means men are not interested in their own health, says Prof Paul Galdas, a men's health expert at York University. \"Men will open up and want to be engaged, but to do that you have to base it around actions and activities.\"\nHe has helped develop a six-week mental fitness programme in partnership with the Movember men's health movement that has been trialled on NHS front-line workers following Covid. Now it is being used by Leeds United football club for its youth players.\nMen are provided with support to understand how behaviour affects moods, they are encouraged to track their habits and set goals for healthy activities.\n\"It can be about going for a walk, seeing friends, playing golf and developing problem-solving skills to protect mental health. Good mental health leads to good physical health.\"\nSimilar activity-based initiatives can be found in a number of local areas where charities, councils and local men's groups have worked together to set up schemes.\nThe Men's Sheds movement is perhaps the most well-known where men are encouraged to come together and bond and support each other while doing practical projects.\nProf White says now is the time to build on these foundations \u2013 something a national men's health strategy is vital for. He says it will help \"shine a spotlight\" on the issue in a similar way to the women's health strategy did back in 2022 \u2013 that led to the creation of a network of women's health hubs and women's health champions at the heart of government.\nBut he also wants it to act as a \"wake-up call\" for men themselves. He says there are some simple steps every man should consider. \n\"Look at your waist size \u2013 if you are carrying weight, if your tummy is too big try to do something. Get moving, get out and about and talk to people.\n\"Take every opportunity to get a health check or screened. And, if you notice changes to body or the way you are managing problems, seek help.\"",

        "article_text": "On a quick drive around the small Ohio town of Delta, you can spot nearly as many Trump flags as American stars-and-stripes banners.\nAnd at the petrol station near the Ohio Turnpike, the pumps bear relics of the last administration, with slogans slamming Trump's predecessor: \"Whoever voted for Biden owes me gas money!\"\nThis is Trump country - the Republican ticket easily won here in November's presidential election by a margin of almost two-to-one. And while the markets are in turmoil following Trump's unveiling of expansive global tariffs this week, plenty of people in Delta and hundreds of Midwestern towns like it still back the president's plans.\nThose plans, to impose tariffs of between 10% and 50% on almost every country, have upended global trade and led to warnings that prices could soon rise for American consumers. Trump, meanwhile, has said the move will address unfair trade imbalances, boost US industry and raise revenue.\nFor some in Delta, the president's argument about fairness resonates.\n\"I don't want people in other countries to suffer, I really don't,\" said Mary Miller, manager of the Delta Candy Emporium, which sits in the middle of the village's Main Street. \"But we need to have an even playing field.\"\nMiller, a three-time Trump voter, believes other countries haven't played fair on trade. And like many here, she prefers to buy American-made goods.\nAs she watches over her stock of multi-coloured confectioneries, many of them made in the US, and weighs up how they might be impacted by fresh import taxes, she recalls how decades ago she heard that one of her favourite brands was moving its factories abroad. She hasn't bought another pair of Levi's jeans since.\nMiller is unfazed by the possibility of price increases, which many economists say these new tariffs will bring.\n\"Sometimes you have to walk through fire to get to the other side,\" she said.\n\"If tariffs bring companies and business back to hard-working American people like the ones who live here, then it's worth it.\"\nThese sentiments are common in Delta, a village of around 3,300 people less than 100 miles (160km) south of Detroit, even as other Midwestern towns brace for sharp shocks.\nThe automotive industry, with its complicated global supply chains, seems particularly vulnerable to the impact of major new tariffs, with companies in Michigan to the north and Indiana to the west already announcing factory shutdowns and job cuts.\nBut on the outskirts of Delta, there is a cluster of steel businesses that have been here since the 1990s and which may be better placed in a new era of American protectionism.\nOne of these businesses, North Star BlueScope, has urged Trump to expand tariffs on steel and aluminium. At the same time, however, it has asked for an exemption for the raw materials it needs, such as scrap metal.\nNorth Star BlueScope did not respond to interview requests, but in a back room at the nearby Barn Restaurant, a few local steelworkers who had just finished the night shift were drinking beers together early on Friday morning.\nThe workers, who asked not to be named, mostly laughed and shrugged when asked about the sweeping new tariffs that were announced by Trump at the White House on Wednesday.\nIt was a pretty clear indication that this economic news is unlikely to ruin their weekend.\nOutside the restaurant, some Delta locals considered the possible upsides of these import taxes.\n\"Nobody's frantic. We're not going to lose any sleep over it,\" said Gene Burkholder, who has a decades-long career in the agriculture industry.\nAlthough he owns some stocks, Mr Burkholder said they were long-term investments and he was not obsessing over the sharp drops in the two days following the president's announcement.\n\"If you have some spare cash, maybe it's a good time to buy some shares while they're cheap,\" he said.\nA couple of booths over, as she finished eating breakfast with her son Rob, Louise Gilson said - quietly - that she did not really trust the president.\nBut Gilson, along with many people here, said she wanted to see action. She wholeheartedly agreed when another diner commented: \"Trump may be wrong, but at least he's trying.\"\n\"The other people wouldn't have done squat,\" she said, referring to the Democratic Party.\nThe Gilsons agreed that the big local industrial employers have generally been good neighbours, contributing to the local economy, charities and the wider community, even as they have seen some less desirable effects of industrial development and worry about unequal sharing of the economic pie.\nAnd as they recounted Delta's history, they described a gradual erosion in quality of life that they believe has made many people willing to roll the dice even when economists say Trump's tariff plan comes with stark risks.\n\"It was a good little town to grow up in,\" Rob Gilson recalled. But he said it now seemed less safe and friendly than when he was growing up in the 60s and 70s. \n\"It seems like the heart of America is gone,\" he said.\nDelta, Louise Gilson added, \"is the kind of place where 25% or 30% of the people are struggling with their demons\".\nAnd while these issues have little to do with tariffs, the challenges faced by people in towns like Delta may go some way to explaining why many are willing to give President Trump the benefit of the doubt, even as markets plunge on faraway Wall Street.",
