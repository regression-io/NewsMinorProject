        "article_text": "Listen to Sue read this article \nIn a busy, terraced house in Bradford, three sisters are animatedly chatting. It's a big day at their home: a beautician sits on their sofa, styling their hair and makeup. The room is warm with fun and laughter. It feels like a scene from a Jane Austen novel: three women in their late 20s, each of them bursting with personality, swapping stories.\nAnd like most Austen novels, the conversation often turns to marriage.\nThe sisters are preparing for a family wedding at the weekend - where the bride and groom are first cousins. Many people might find this unusual, but in their family and in some parts of Bradford, it's fairly common.\nAyesha, who at 29 is the oldest of the three sisters, also married her first cousin in 2017. She has two children with her husband and their marriage is happy, she says. It felt perfectly normal at the time to marry her cousin. Their mother, a Pakistani migrant, assumed it was what all three of her daughters would do.\nBut 26-year-old Salina, the youngest of the three, tells us she broke the mould by having what they call a \"love\" marriage, choosing a partner from outside the family. Salina tells us she is outgoing and ambitious; marrying a cousin simply did not appeal to her. Then there's Mallika, who at 27 is the middle of the three. She's still single and has already decided not to marry within her family.\n\"I said to my mum that I wouldn't judge my sisters but I wasn't going to do it,\" Mallika tells us. She says having an education has created opportunities for her. \"Before, even if you had an education, you wouldn't be expected to carry on with it. You would be thinking of marriage. Now the mindset is so different.\"\nIn the UK and across Europe, cousin marriage is coming under increased scrutiny - particularly from doctors, who warn that children of first cousins are more likely to experience an array of health problems.\nAnd there's now some new, potentially worrying data from Bradford to add into that mix.\nResearchers at the city's university are entering their 18th year of the Born in Bradford study. It's one of the biggest medical trials of its kind: between 2007 and 2010, researchers recruited more than 13,000 babies in the city and then followed them closely from childhood into adolescence and now into early adulthood. More than one in six children in the study have parents who are first cousins, mostly from Bradford's Pakistani community, making it among the world's most valuable studies of the health impacts of cousin marriage.\nAnd in data published in the last few months - and analysed in an upcoming episode of BBC Radio 4's Born in Bradford series -  the researchers found that first cousin-parentage may have wider consequences than previously thought.\nThe most obvious way that a pair of blood-related parents might increase health risks for a child is through a recessive disorder, like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell disease.  According to the classic theory of genetics laid out by the biologist Gregor Mendel,  if both parents carry a recessive gene then there's a one in four chance that their child will inherit the condition. And when parents are cousins, they're more likely to both be carriers. A child of first cousins carries a 6% chance of inheriting a recessive disorder, compared to 3% for the general population.\nBut the Bradford study took a much broader view - and sheds fresh light. The researchers weren't just looking at whether a child had been diagnosed with a specific recessive disorder. Instead they studied dozens of data points, observing everything from the children's speech and language development to their frequency of healthcare to their performance at school. Then they used a mathematical model to try to eliminate the impacts of poverty and parental education - so they could focus squarely on the impact on \"consanguinity\", the scientific word for having parents who are related.\nThey found that even after factors like poverty were controlled for, a child of first cousins in Bradford had an 11% probability of being diagnosed with a speech and language problem, versus 7% for children whose parents are not related.\nThey also found a child of first cousins has a 54% chance of reaching a \"good stage of development\" (a government assessment given to all five year-olds in England), versus 64% for children whose parents are not related.\nWe get further insight into their poorer health through the number of visits to the GP. Children of first cousins have a third more primary care appointments than children whose parents are not related - an average of four instead of three a year.\nWhat is notable is that even once you account for the children in that group who already have a diagnosed recessive disorder, the figures suggest consanguinity may be affecting even those children who don't have a diagnosable recessive disorder.\nNeil Small, emeritus professor at the University of Bradford and the author of the study, says that even if all of the children with recessive disorders visited their GP more than average, \"this does not explain the much wider distribution of excess health care usage in the consanguineous children\".\nThe study, he says, is \"exciting because it gives the opportunity for a much more accurate development of a response, targeting interventions and treatments\".\nIt is, of course, just one study, and the population of Bradford is not representative of the whole of the UK.\nNevertheless, it adds to a growing concern among scientists that has caught the attention of lawmakers across Europe. Two Scandinavian countries have now moved to outlaw cousin marriage entirely. In Norway, the practice became illegal last year; in Sweden, a ban will come into effect next year.\nIn the UK, the Conservative MP Richard Holden has introduced a private members' bill to outlaw the practice, adding it to the list of illegal marriages (alongside parents, child, siblings, and grandparents). But the Labour government says there are \"no plans\" to impose a ban. At present, the UK is still following the policy of \"genetic counselling\", in which first cousin-couples are educated about the risks of having children, and encouraged to get extra screening in pregnancy.\nBut amid concern about child health and strains on the NHS, some academics are asking whether a beefed-up approach to counselling is needed, with more funding and laser-focused intervention. And there are those who think it's time to follow the Scandinavian example and impose something bound to be difficult and controversial: an outright ban on cousin marriage.\nFor most in the UK, the prospect of marrying a cousin is largely alien. But it wasn't always so unusual. The father of evolution Charles Darwin married his first cousin, Emma Wedgwood. Their son, the Victorian scientist Sir George Darwin, went on to estimate that cousin marriages accounted for almost one in 20 aristocratic unions in 19th Century Britain. One of them was Queen Victoria, who married her first cousin, Prince Albert. The novel Wuthering Heights is full of fictional examples.\nBy the 20th Century the proportion of marriages between cousins had declined to about 1%. But it remains a relatively common practice among some South Asian minorities. In three inner-city Bradford wards, almost half (46%) of mothers from the Pakistani community were married to a first or second cousin, according to the most recent Born in Bradford data published two years ago.\nFor those who want to ban the practice, the public health argument is compelling. When announcing his private members' bill in December, Richard Holden highlighted the higher risk of birth defects. Later, on Talk TV, he pointed to data showing that infant mortality rates are higher for children born to cousin parents, with more heart, brain, and kidney problems due to recessive disorders. He also explained that health effects can be \"compounded\" when the practice persists through generations.\nThis risk to child health is one of the reasons Patrick Nash, a researcher and co-founder at the Pharos Foundation research institute, wants to see cousin marriage banned. In a paper published in the Oxford Journal of Law and Religion last year, Nash wrote that a ban would result in \"immediate\" health improvements, especially in communities where the practice is common. He said:  \"Banning cousin marriage would improve public health drastically and have no negative health implications of its own.\"\nOn the ground in Bradford, it's a more mixed picture. Prof Sam Oddie, a consultant neonatologist and researcher at Bradford Teaching Hospitals, has worked in the city for more than two decades. Over the years he has observed lots of severe genetic disorders. \"I've seen fatal skin conditions, fatal brain conditions, fatal muscle conditions\". He says it was \"immediately clear\" these conditions were occurring more in Bradford than elsewhere.\nHe remembers some tragic examples: families who lost several children, one after the other, to the same genetic disorder. \"That's very upsetting and very difficult for the family to get their heads around.\"\nBut crucially, Prof Oddie thinks the main risk to genetic health in Bradford is not cousin marriage, but a similar issue known as endogamy, in which people marry members of their close community. In a tight-knit ethnic group, people are more likely to share common ancestors and genes - whether or not they are first cousins, he says.\nEndogamy is not unique to Pakistani communities in the UK. It is an issue too in the UK's Jewish community and globally among the Amish and also French Canadians.\n\"It's often the case that the exact familial tie can't be traced, but the gene occurs more commonly within a certain group, and for that reason, both parents carry the affected gene,\" Prof Oddie says. \"It's an oversimplification to say that cousin marriage is the root of all excess recessive disorders in Bradford or in Pakistani communities. Endogamy is an important feature.\"\nRather than a ban, he stresses the power of education - or what he calls \"genetic literacy\". It's a phrase that crops up again and again from the people we speak to. For many years there's been a campaign in Bradford to inform people in the Pakistani community about their genetic risks. Couples are given specialist advice at their GP; at pregnancy classes, information is shared with expectant mothers.\nAnd in Bradford at least, some are taking the message on board. Back at the sisters' house, all three women we interview say that ideas around cousin marriage are slowly changing, in part due to an increased awareness of health risks. They live in the deprived, post-industrial Manningham area of the city. There's a distinct feeling of neighbourliness here. All of the front doors open directly onto the street, which is full of children playing. Occasionally the sounds of their laughter drift inside.\n\"It has to be something that happens gradually - it's slow, you can't rush it,\" says Salina, the sister who chose to have a love marriage. \"My mum was very young when she came [to the UK from Pakistan]. She had certain views but those changed because she loves us. I just explained to her, 'Mum, how does it benefit you to push cousin marriage?'.\"\nMallika, her older sister, agrees. \"It's also to do with social media and being exposed to different people,\" she says. \"You have new connections... contact with people outside our parents' eyes.\"\nEven Ayesha, the oldest sister who is in a cousin marriage, said she doesn't imagine either of her two children will marry their cousins.\nAt the time she married her cousin, she says, \"I didn't know any different. My parents were strong in their culture. As the generations move on, the culture is disappearing a bit.\"\nShe was aware of the genetic risks when she had her two children. Neither of them have a genetic illness.\n\"We did take that on board,\" she says, on the topic of genetic health. \"But I always feel like if it's going to happen, it's going to happen. If the child is going to be born with a disability then it will happen if you are married to a cousin or not.\"\nIndeed, in Bradford at least, the practice is in decline. The share of new mothers from across the Born in Bradford study who were first cousins with the father of their baby fell from 39% in the late 2000s to 27% in the late 2010s.\nThis is no coincidence, according to Professor John Wright, chief investigator on the Born in Bradford project. He points out that it is only recently that his team published evidence around the risks of cousin marriage in the UK.\n\"When we talked to the families 10 years ago it was very clear that people weren't aware of the risks but like all parents they want to do their best for their children. They want to have healthy children,\" he says.\n\"Education is the starting point and we've shown in Born in Bradford how powerful that is.\"\nAside from health concerns, there's another reason some people want to see cousin marriage banned: its impact on social cohesion. This is what's largely driving the debate in Scandinavia. In Norway, where cousin marriage was banned last year, lawmakers said the practice was linked to forced marriage, with some South Asian immigrant women coerced into unions with relatives.\nThey also looked at the link with so-called \"honour\" violence, according to Tonje Egedius, a journalist who covered the story for a Norwegian newspaper.\n\"[Police] claim that cousin marriage makes it easier for perpetrators to maintain honour in families,\" she says, \"and that marrying within the family is a contributing cause of honour-related violence and abuse\".\nJasmina Holten, a senior Norwegian police officer, said in an interview with Norwegian broadcaster NRK last year that some women coerced into cousin marriage found themselves trapped, with financial dependence on relatives. In those cases, divorce often means ostracism. A ban on cousin marriage could break down that abusive chain, she said.\nLikewise, Sweden's justice secretary Gunnar Str\u00f6mmer said his own country's ban on cousin marriage will liberate women from \"oppressive standards of honour\".\nThis cultural argument is becoming increasingly prominent. Proponents of a ban broadly see cousin marriage as an instrument of segregation, siphoning people off from the rest of society. Nash, from the Pharos Foundation, says that a ban on cousin marriage would help reduce ethnic segregation in places like Bradford.\nOthers are sceptical of the idea that you can force people to integrate through the sharp stick of legislation. They say that even if a ban goes ahead, some couples would continue to marry their cousins through illegal, unregistered unions - and that women in those marriages may feel they no longer have the protection of the state if the relationship goes sour.\nNazir Afzal, former Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North West of England, tells us that \"thoughtful legislation\" would \"offer protections\" to people coerced into cousin marriage. \"[But] we must respect cultural diversity and personal choice,\" he says. \"Cousin marriage is an important cultural practice in many parts of the world, and legislation should be sensitive to the social and familial values that underlie it.\"\nMore broadly, he suggests governments may want to think about boosting education and genetic screening for couples entering cousin marriage - rather than imposing \"blanket bans\".\nFor some, the idea of an outright ban raises the ugly image of certain minorities being targeted over others. Karma Nirvana, a charity that works to end honour-based abuse, described the backbench attempt to ban cousin marriage as \"a tool of political point-scoring, inciting hate and driving a wedge between communities\".\nRichard Holden's bill is awaiting its second reading in the House of Commons. Without government support it has never been likely to pass but its very existence and events in Scandinavia have resulted in cousin marriage being talked about far beyond the communities where it is prevalent.\nOf course, for those Britons in a cousin marriage, life goes on much as before.\nBack at the Bradford house, the beautician is putting her finishing touches to the hair of the three sisters, ahead of their big wedding at the weekend. Ayesha, the sister who is in a cousin marriage, is reflective and thoughtful about her own near decade-long relationship. \"There are difficulties - we've been through lots together, we have sacrificed a lot,\" she says about her husband. \"But we are happy together.\"\n\"I think even with love marriages you're going to have problems. They'll just be different ones.\"\n\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

They did not provide additional details about her or when she was appointed. \nMs Gleason declined to comment, CBS News reported.\nMusk has been leading an outside effort to aggressively curtail government spending through funding cuts and firings.\n\"They're playing a game,\" said Max Stier, president and CEO of the non-partisan Partnership for Public Service, an organisation that has provided past administrations with procedure and ethics guidance.\n\"If [Musk] were actually the administrator, then this issue about him needing Senate confirmation and his actually having to abide by the conflict of interest laws would be much clearer.\"\nExperts said that Musk has given the impression of being in charge of Doge by staffing the government entity with employees and engineers from his various companies, posting constantly about its work on X, appearing alongside Trump in the Oval Office to promote the cuts it has made to the federal workforce, and representing it on stage at the Conservative Political Action Committee gathering last week while wielding a chainsaw.\n\"We're in Alice in Wonderland right now,\" Mr Stier said. \"We're through the looking glass.\"\nTrump established Doge by renaming the United States Digital Service - an agency focused on digital and web infrastructure - to the United States Doge Service via an executive order.\nThe order establishes Doge's leadership structure, saying that \"there shall be a USDS Administrator\" that reports up to the White House chief of staff.\nIt does not name a specific individual for the role.

She noted it might run afoul of the appointment clause of the US Constitution, which sets out nominating procedures for agency leaders.\n\"It does seem to me if you have people that are not authorised to carry out some of these functions that they're carrying out that does raise an issue,\" she said. \n\"I would hope that by now we would know who is the administrator, who is the acting administrator and what authority do they have?\"\nExperts say that Musk's work does not fit the traditional definition of \"special government employee\", which has specific rules.\nThe White House has previously said that Musk \"is a special government employee and has abided by all applicable federal laws\". \nWilliam Resh, a professor who studies the executive branch at the University of Southern California, said typically such employees have been hired as advisers for their relative expertise.\n\"But they do not hold distinct executive power the way that a Senate-confirmed appointee would, or even a unilateral permanent appointments that a president can make,\" he said. \nWhile Musk appears to have made several moves regarding the federal workforce largely unencumbered, his recent demand that federal employees list five accomplishments in an email was met with pushback from some Trump-appointed agency leaders.\nThe directive was walked back as optional at some agencies, over concerns staff could reveal sensitive information and that the order violated federal policies.\nAsked whether this showed tension between Doge and Trump's other officials, Leavitt insisted that \"everyone is working together as one unified team at the direction of President Trump\".\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

When you are doing the changes if you have a football team who are playing well and winning games, it is easier for the fans and everyone to feel that. But in this moment we are in a difficult period inside of the club and inside of the pitch. We have to fight against this feeling.\n\"We have do our job and we try our best to help the team to perform better.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'I feel sorry for Rasmus Hojlund' - Troy Deeney\nUnited have scored 30 goals from 26 league games so far this season, with Rasmus Hojlund managing just two from 15 league starts.\nThe 22-year-old Denmark striker, who was signed from Atalanta for \u00a372 in August 2023, has scored seven goals in all competitions, with his last strike coming in the Europa League against Viktoria Plzen on 12 December.\n\"I think it's clear, we as a team, we are not helping Rasmus,\" Amorim added. \"We don't create a lot of chances.\n\"I think Rasmus has a lot of potential. If we improve the way we play the game, he will have more opportunities to score.\n\"He came here very young and, when you are very young, to be the number nine and play all the time sometimes is hard.\n\"We have to look at Rasmus as a player: he has the pace, he has the technique, he scores some goals that are really hard to score.\n\"Sometimes he doesn't choose the better runs, sometimes he's so anxious to touch the ball because he passes long minutes without the ball and he moves away from the goal.\n\"We address that in training.

In a video that appeared on social media last year, the DJ said: \"It's all false allegations.\"\nCulture Secretary Lisa Nandy said the allegations against Mr Westwood were \"very serious\" and there had been \"far too many instances of appalling behaviour in the media industry\".\nThe BBC board admitted it did not \"take adequate action\", saying: \"It is clear that in the past, the BBC has not only been too siloed but too deferential to high-profile individuals.\"\n\"The board also wants to take this opportunity to apologise on behalf of the entire BBC to anyone impacted by what the review has found,\" it added. \n\"Your voice has been heard, and the findings of the review will further fuel the drive to ensure it does not happen again.\"\nGemma White KC led the report commissioned by the BBC board in 2022. \nMore than 120 individuals contributed to the review and thousands of records from the time were examined.\nThe DJ's solicitors told Ms White:\nMr Westwood, who has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment, had a gig in Oyo state in Nigeria on Monday.\nThe report highlighted some staff felt uncomfortable raising grievances with management about the DJ.\nThose who spoke to Ms White referenced: \nShe noted evidence of senior management \"reacting firmly\" to public complaints about the DJ, along with \"evidence of their intention to create an environment in which employees would feel able to raise concerns\".\nBut the \"lack of formality adopted\" towards concerns raised about workplace misconduct, and the \"type of material broadcast on air\" were likely to have resulted employees not feeling confident that workplace conduct concerns about the DJ \"would be properly addressed.\"\n\nThe BBC board said: \"Beyond assessing any alleged criminality, which is a matter for the police, it is clear there were times where the BBC, on learning about concerns regarding Mr Westwood's behaviour, did not take adequate action.\" \nIt cited \"evidence of bullying and misogynistic behaviour on the part of Mr Westwood and the plain fact is that his general conduct was entirely incompatible with BBC values \u2013 not just now, but then\".\n\"The organisation fell short and failed people \u2013 including our own staff \u2013 who had a right to expect better from us,\" it added.\nThe report has cost approximately \u00a33.3m.\nIt found \"there was no widespread or significant or BBC knowledge of allegations or concerns about predatory sexual behaviour by Mr Westwood\".\nBut it said there were \"instances where the organisation missed opportunities that might have led to action.\"\nThe BBC says it has since improved its processes.\nNandy, whose government brief covers the BBC, said she met with director general Tim Davie on Tuesday to discuss the Tim Westwood report.\nA Metropolitan Police spokesperson told the BBC: \"A full file of evidence remains with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for their consideration.

Just continue and you are going to score many goals.\"\nChelsea back in top four with Southampton win\nPalmer started the season in red-hot form for the Blues, scoring 14 goals and creating six assists across his first 21 Premier League appearances. However, he has zero goal involvements since.\nMany Chelsea supporters, as well as Fantasy Football fans, had pencilled in Chelsea's home match against a Southampton side who sit bottom of the league and have the worst defensive record as the fixture where Palmer would restart his goalscoring form.\nAnd the former Manchester City man did find himself on the end of several chances, having seven shots - the joint-highest total for a Chelsea player in the league this season.\nPalmer missed two glorious opportunities when one-on-one in the first half with one effort saved by Aaron Ramsdale and another dragged wide. After the restart he blasted a cut-back over the bar.\nIn total, his chances accumulated to an expected goals (xG) figure of 1.07.\nAfter he had a late free-kick saved by Ramsdale, Palmer reacted by smiling, appearing to see the funny side of his barren run, which Maresca praised in his post-match press conference.\n\"It is how you react. He is reacting perfectly. He is smiling and he is happy. We have no doubt he will score more goals,\" Maresca said.\n\"He's a human being. All human beings, all big players, all the normal players, big club, big manager - we all go through  a bad moment.\n\"Even if he is young, he shared time in a big club and he knows that all the big players go through moments like this.\"\nPalmer joined Chelsea from Manchester City in September, 2023 and has since scored 39 goals across all competitions.\nPedro Neto has scored three Premier League goals this season\nStepping up on Tuesday were forwards Christopher Nkunku and Pedro Neto who both scored one and assisted another.\nWith striker Nicolas Jackson absent with a thigh injury, Neto, who was signed as a winger, once again played centrally in a false-nine role.\n\"We needed to find a solution,\" added Maresca. \"We tried one game with Palmer and we tried one game with Nkunku, Brighton away \u2013 didn't work well.\n\"So the week after, we tried with Pedro in the week and we saw that it could work. I think Villa away he did fantastic. He probably give us a threat in-behind.\nNeto scored Chelsea's second, running on to a Nkunku through-ball before calmly finishing past Ramsdale.\n\"He is not just receiving the ball at the feet,\" added Maresca. \"He also likes to attack in-behind something which Cole and Christopher struggle [to do].\"\nNeto has scored just three goals and created four assists in the Premier League this season, although two of those goals and two of those assists have come in the past four games.\nBefore the match with Southampton about 100 Chelsea fans protested against the club's ownership with banners and chants.\nIt has been nearly three years since the BlueCo consortium fronted by Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali acquired the club.\n\"The only thing I can say is that in this moment the fans have to trust,\" said Maresca.\n\"We're in the right process and the right direction.

        "article_text": "Fourth-tier Stade Briochin have already defeated Ligue 1 sides Nice and Le Havre on their way to French Cup quarter-final\nParis Saint-Germain will be in unfamiliar company in the Coupe de France quarter-finals on Wednesday when they take on Stade Briochin, a fourth-tier club that have gone from narrowly avoiding extinction to a series of giant killings.\nStade Briochin have beaten higher-level opposition in each of the past three rounds, with the piece de resistance coming in the last-16 when Ligue 1 Nice were dispatched in dramatic fashion. Fellow top-tier side Le Havre suffered the same fate in December.\nCentre-back Hugo Boudin was Stade Briochin's unlikely hero against Nice, scoring an 88th-minute equaliser before snatching a winner in the seventh minute of stoppage time.\nThe final whistle prompted a pitch invasion at the 11,000-capacity Stade Fred-Aubert in Brittany. For Stade Briochin coach Guillaume Allanou, whose association with the club stretches back three decades, it is a memory that will never fade.\n\"My first thought at this moment when all the fans were on the pitch was to search for my players,\" Allanou tells BBC Sport. \"I wanted to be with my staff and my players just together to celebrate this great moment.\n\"It was unbelievable. It was like we were not in our bodies. It was crazy, emotional. It's difficult to explain in words.\"\nThe Nice result saw Stade Briochin enter the pantheon of great Coupe de France upsets.\nThey are in good company, joining US Quevily, third-tier conquerors of Marseille in the 2012 quarter-finals, and Les Herbiers, another third division club who beat RC Lens on their way to the 2018 final. It was PSG who ended their fairytale run at the last hurdle.\nFourth-tier Calais famously made it to the final in 2000, beating reigning Ligue 1 champions Bordeaux in the semis, before losing to Nantes while US Jeanne d'Arc Carquefou, from the fifth level of French football, beat top-tier sides Nancy and Marseille to make the quarter-finals in 2008. \nPSG, again, were the side to put an end to their run.\nThis year, fourth-tier AS Cannes, formerly of the top flight and the club who gave Zinedine Zidane his breakthrough, have already reached the semi-finals after continuing their own remarkable run by beating Ligue 2 Guingamp on Tuesday. \nParis Saint-Germain are 13 points clear at the top of Ligue 1\nIf Stade Briochin can succeed where Les Herbiers failed and down the mighty Parisiens, Allanou feels it would eclipse all other giant-killings.\n\"These clubs have made a great story in the Coupe de France but if we can beat Paris St-Germain, it will be the biggest upset in the history of French football,\" Allanou states.\n\"Nobody can beat PSG in France, or even in Europe. So imagine if Stade Briochin did this? I can't dream of that - if it happens, it will be amazing.\"\nAllanou's history in football has been closely intertwined with that of Stade Briochin. As a teenage defender in the mid-1990s he played during the club's short-lived spell in Ligue 2 - the highest level they have reached.\nThe experience was bittersweet because it ended with Stade Briochin being relegated after facing liquidation.\n\"It's like a story of love with this club,\" he explains. \"The club is a big part of my life. All that I have lived in this club, all the experiences - good and bad - made me the man that I am today.\n\"I was young when I played in Ligue 2 and it was a great experience but a short experience. I remember I arrived to training one day and people said to me 'no there is no club any more, you can't train'. I just wanted to play football.\"\nThankfully, Stade Briochin were resurrected and Allanou had three separate spells at the club as a player, eventually ending his career there at the end of the 2013-14 season.\nThe association continued post-retirement and Allanou is now Stade Briochin's coach and their president. When the club again fell on hard times and faced folding altogether, he stepped in with some other former players to rescue it.\n\"The club was in a bad place,\" he recalls. \"It had a chief executive but he left and then no-one wanted to take it. There was no money, no ambition - so because there was a group of players who love this club and we didn't want the club to die, I became president. I didn't want to be a president but it happened and it's OK.\"\nIn the Brittany town of Saint-Brieuc, cup fever has certainly descended. On Saturday, Allanou and his players met fans in the town centre, where the shops have been decked out in the team's yellow and blue colours.\nIn a blow to the French football romantics, however, the match against PSG will take place at Roazhon Park, the home of Ligue 1 side Rennes. The financial benefits of filling the 30,000-seater stadium make it an understandable choice, though it is located nearly an hour away from Saint-Brieuc.\n\"We wanted to do a big match with a lot of people because we want this to be a big party for us,\" Allanou explains. \"It's a great atmosphere in the town.\n\"For all of my players it will be the match of their life. The difficulty for me as a coach is to make sure they are not scared to play in front of all these people against these big players.\n\"I just want them to live in the moment and play like I know that they can play.\"\nLed by fearsome France forwards Ousmane Dembele and Bradley Barcola, PSG have scored 94 goals in all competitions this season\nThey head into the Stade Briochin game on the back of a 10-0 aggregate demolition of Brest in the Champions League, while Sunday's 3-2 victory over Lyon took Luis Enrique's side 13 points clear at the top of Ligue 1.\n\"It is a big mountain for us,\" Allanou says. \"PSG is maybe the best team in the world right now. Luis Enrique has done a very good job with this team. I have so much admiration for him because PSG has a real identity of play.\n\"I love the football that he wants to play and also he has said that the team is more important than any [individual] player. I admire his work and I will say this to him, of course.\"\nStade Briochin captain James Le Marer is retiring at the end of the current campaign\nAllanou has several experienced players to call on. Goalkeeper Franck L'Hostis is a former France U20 international who came through at Monaco, while defensive midfielder Guillaume Beghin began his career at Lens and centre-back Benjamin Angouna played for Guingamp and has 15 senior caps for the Ivory Coast.\nThen there is captain James le Marer. Retiring at the end of this season, 33-year-old Le Marer is a one-club man who has shown levels of loyalty that Paolo Maldini and Ryan Giggs would be proud of.\nWhatever happens against PSG it has still been a fairytale swansong for the Stade Briochin skipper, who is already coaching the club's Under-16 team. Le Marer looks to be on his way to emulating Allanou's lifelong association with the Brittany outfit.\n\"James has a particular story with the club like me,\" Allanou says. \"He's been here since 13 years old and he will stop his career at the end of this season.\n\"It's the biggest match of his life and I'm happy that he can live this with me and with all the other players.\n\"The feeling is to appreciate this moment because I know that after the match the spotlight will probably be turned off.\"",

        "article_text": "Tom Rowland played five games for England U18s, alongside the likes of Marcus Smith, Tom Willis, Joe Heyes and Ted Hill\nTom Rowland remembers rooming with Joe Heyes.\nLeicester prop Heyes is now part of England's Six Nations squad, coming off the bench in each of their three games so far.\nBack then though, in Cape Town, in 2017, both Heyes and Rowland were England Under-18s.\nBoth were props. Both were highly rated. Both would start against South Africa Schools the next day.\nBut, in other ways they were different.\n\"Joe was the size he is now, he was just an absolute beast,\" remembers Rowland.\n\"He was something like 130kg (20st 7lb) aged 16.\n\"Someone like him was made to play in the front row.\"\nRowland wasn't though.\nTwo years earlier, he had been a blind-side flanker or number eight, carrying hard for Bristol's academy team.\nHowever, his coach, seeing the trend for more mobile props, suggested he swap the back row for the front row.\n\"I was only 90kg (14st 2lb) at the time,\" Rowland says.\n\"I enjoyed my gym work, but I never dreamed of being fast-tracked into being a prop.\"\nThe change of position demanded a change in physique.\nRowland was given two aims - to load up the weights bar and his plate.\nSix meals a day, five weights sessions a week.\nEnergy in, power out and, hopefully, bulk up.\n\"I found it pretty tough,\" says Rowland. \"It was a conscious effort making sure I got the food in.\n\"My strength and conditioning coach would always be on to me. You'd have to weigh in in the mornings, you would step on the scales and find you had lost a kilo because you haven't had enough dinner the night before.\n\"I always like to eat relatively 'clean', but it got to a point where they said 'you just need the calories, we don't mind if you are smashing a load of dessert'.\n\"It was always a bit of a battle for me.\"\nRowland made his Bristol debut in February 2017 as an 18-year-old schoolboy\nIt was a battle he won. In the short term at least.\nA couple of years after changing position, he had put on three stone and the England Under-18 loose-head prop shirt.\nRowland played five games, lining up alongside Marcus Smith, Tom Willis, Cadan Murley and Ted Hill, all of whom, like Heyes, are playing for England in this year's Six Nations.\nRowland is still playing, just at a lower level, in a different country and, intriguingly, at a lighter weight.\nThis April, he will be part of the first-ever 'Small Blacks' team \u2013 a New Zealand representative side with a catch., external\nAll its members play weight-restricted rugby, in which no player, whether front row or fly-half, weighs more than 85kg (13st 5lbs).\nIn New Zealand, the concept has taken root.\nIn 2024, 45 teams entered the national under-85kg Cup, with the final taking place at Sky Stadium in Wellington as a curtain-raiser to an All Blacks win over Australia.\nThe players are smaller and more uniform in stature, but the action is fast and hard.\n\"If no-one had a number on their back, you would struggle to know who is playing which position,\" says Rowland.\n\"I wouldn't say it's like sevens, the games can still be quite physical and forward dominated, but everything's done at just a much greater pace.\n\"Everybody is pretty fit so the collisions in the 70th minute are just as hard as those in the opening five minutes of a game. There's no real drop off.\n\"The skill level from one to 15 is great. Even as a prop, you are expected to have as good a catch and pass as anyone in the backline.\n\"The only thing where there's probably a big step down is the set-piece, especially the line-outs. You have a lot of guys who aren't used to jumping in a line-out.\n\"But in a way less focus around the set-piece makes it a bit more exciting, it speeds everything up.\"\nRowland is certainly quicker than he was. Back in his England age-grade days, he weighed in about 17st 5lb.\nNow 26, he plays four stone lighter, the weight he was as a 14-year-old.\n\"I can still enjoy the scrummaging side but I am also now fit enough and at a good weight to be mobile and contribute around the pitch.\n\"I get to carry lots, make tackles and I actually play 80 minutes in most games. I really enjoy not having to get dragged off at around 50 or 60 minutes because I can't breathe any more.\"\nEden Lizards, the side Rowland plays for, won New Zealand's inaugural National Under-85kg Cup in 2020\nRowland's initial weight loss came during the Covid lockdown. Unable to dislodge the likes of Yann Thomas and Jake Woolmore in the first team, he had been released by Bristol.\nWithout access to weights, but with a desire to keep fit, he started running every day.\nWhen restrictions eased and he met up with friends again, Rowland's body shape had changed so dramatically, they thought he was ill.\nRowland felt the opposite.\n\"The weight just flew off me and I felt so much better,\" he says. \"I had more energy - I did have to sell my whole wardrobe though and buy new clothes!\"\nIn 2021, he moved to a new country as well, taking advantage of the New Zealand passport he has through his mother.\nIn a different hemisphere, things turned upside-down.\nWhere once he was piling on pounds any which way he could, now he has to be mindful of passing a weigh-in a couple of hours before matches.\nSome players will, like boxers, shed weight in saunas the night before, tip the scales and then wolf down carbohydrate-heavy food in the dressing room. \nCramps can creep up on those who misjudge their pre-match routine.\nWhen the New Zealand under-85kg team play their first match, it won't be an issue though. At least not for Rowland and his Small Blacks team-mates.\nTheir two matches against the full Sri Lanka national team (ranked 40th in the world) in Kandy and Colombo are being played at a catchweight.\nA cap of 105kg (16st 7lb) has been applied to ensure there isn't a dangerous discrepancy between the hosts and tourists.\n\"It will be interesting to see if we'll be able to kind of hold our own, obviously being a bit lighter than that,\" says Rowland.\nWeight-restricted rugby's potential for growth may be mostly at the grassroots level, retaining players who feel that, while rugby is a game for all sizes, they would prefer a format with more evenly matched physiques.\n\"There would be definitely a pocket of players who would really kind of enjoy this grade of rugby. I think it's only going to be good for the game, and keep people playing,\" says Rowland.\n\"I think it's an idea that would go pretty well in Europe as well.\"\nIf it does, there are long-term hopes of staging a weight-restricted World Cup.\nRowland, who watched former team-mate Smith in action at Eden Park against the All Blacks in July, could, in theory, have a black-and-white decision to make; whether to turn out for England or New Zealand.\n\"Tough, tough question,\" he smiles.\nProbably still not as tough as that sixth meal of the day though.\nRowland (centre) preparing to pack down for Eden Lizards",

        "article_text": "Gene Hackman, who has died aged 95, started his acting career later in life but became one of Hollywood's most bankable stars.\nThe US actor, his wife Betsy Arakawa, 64, and their dog were found dead at their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nSanta Fe County Sheriff's office in New Mexico confirmed they were found \"deceased Wednesday\", but that officers  \"do not believe that foul play was a factor\".\nHackman had an illustrious five-decade career as an actor. \nHe won two Oscars and was nominated for another three, playing violent men, yet was equally at home in comedy.\nHe was once described as having the face of a truck driver, and was suited to character as well as leading roles. Having shot to fame in Bonnie and Clyde at the end of the 60s, he was rarely out of work - in films like The French Connection, Mississippi Burning and Superman.\nBut he retired from acting in 2004 on the advice of his heart doctor, and rarely gave an interview again - opting for a quiet life in New Mexico with his second wife, Betsy.\nEugene Allen Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, in 1930 and led a peripatetic childhood. \nHis parents divorced, and he was palmed off on various relatives until settling with his maternal grandmother in Danville, Illinois.\nHis father left the family when Hackman was still in his teens. \n\"When young Gene was 13, his father abandoned the family, driving away while his son was out playing in the street,\" reported The New York Times' late writer Robert Berkvist.\nHe went on: \"As his father passed by, Mr Hackman recalled years later, he gave him a wave of the hand.\n\"'I hadn't realised how much one small gesture can mean,' he once said. 'Maybe that's why I became an actor.'\"\nHackman's mother died in 1962 - she burned to death in 1962, after setting fire to her mattress with a cigarette while drunk.\nAs a teenager, Hackman was keen to branch out and lied about his age to join the Marines at the age of 16, serving nearly five years.\nHe was stationed in China where he worked as a radio operator, which led to later work as a disc jockey.\n\"I have trouble with direction,\" he once said of his short military career, \"because I have trouble with authority. I was not a good Marine.\"\nAfter briefly studying journalism and TV production at the University of Illinois, Hackman left to enrol at the Pasadena Playhouse in California in the 60s, where he and classmate Dustin Hoffman were voted the \"least likely to succeed\". \nUndeterred by this vote of no confidence, both actors decamped to New York where they shared a flat with another aspiring thespian, Robert Duvall.\nHackman managed to pick up a few minor stage roles, supplementing his income by taking on a variety of odd jobs. \nHe would often relate the story of how he was spotted by a former drill sergeant outside a New York hotel while he was working as a doorman. \nRecognising his former charge, the sergeant exclaimed that he knew Hackman would never amount to anything.\nThere was also a stint as an overnight cleaner in New York's Chrysler Building, something Hackman later described as the worst job he ever had.\nThere were parts in light comedies both off and on Broadway, which led first to minor television roles and then to some film work.\nHis first movie role was in the 1964 film Lilith, starring Warren Beatty. \nImpressed by his performance, Beatty cast Hackman as his brother, Buck Barrow, in Bonnie and Clyde in 1967.\nHackman received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor and was nominated again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970.\nBut then came The French Connection.\nIt was the part that made him.\nHe played the part of the maverick narcotics agent Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle who pursues a French drugs dealer, most notably in a famous sequence on the New York subway. \nIt brought him an Academy Award for best actor, and he reprised the role in The French Connection II in 1975.\nGene Hackman never looked back. \nWhether it was for critically-acclaimed movies such as The Conversation and Night Moves, or popular blockbusters like The Poseidon Adventure, he became a reliable box-office draw.\nOne of the great screen tough guys, he effortlessly switched to comedy in Young Frankenstein and played the sleazy supervillain Lex Luthor in Superman and Superman II. \nHackman was so upset about the producers' treatment of the director, Richard Donner, that he refused to take a part in the next sequel, although he later appeared in Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.\nThe 80s was another successful decade, notably for his appearance in Mississippi Burning, for which he was again nominated for a best actor Academy Award.\nIt was a powerful performance as an FBI agent, tasked, along with a rookie colleague, with investigating the racist murder of black civil rights workers in the early 60s. \nDirector Alan Parker referred to Hackman as \" a very intuitive and instinctive actor\".\nAnother Oscar for best supporting actor came in 1993 for Unforgiven - a Clint Eastwood Western - in which he played a sadistic sheriff, Bill Daggett. \nThe film also won best picture. The awards came three years after Hackman required bypass surgery following a heart attack.\nThere was a leading role as Edward \"Brill\" Lyle, the computer genius in the 1998 film, Enemy of the State, where he starred alongside Will Smith in a frightening tale of government surveillance.\nHackman's hard-edged screen persona made him ideal for the intelligent but ruthless characters in film adaptations of John Grisham novels - such as The Firm and Runaway Jury - in which, for the first time, he and former flatmate Dustin Hoffman appeared on screen together.\nHis versatility, and the luxury of being able able to choose scripts, led in 2001 to another great performance, in the offbeat comedy The Royal Tenenbaums, which drew rave reviews.\nBut he chose to bow out from acting in the political satire, Welcome to Mooseport in 2004.\nExplaining his decision, he told Reuters he didn't want to risk going out on a sour note.\n\"The business for me is very stressful. The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast,\" he said, \"and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it any more.\"\nA decade later, he did briefly come out of retirement to narrate two documentaries about the history of the US Marine Corps - but otherwise stuck to his plan.\nAfter quitting acting, he gained a new reputation as a writer of historical fiction.  \nHe co-wrote four books with Daniel Lenihan, Wake of the Perdido Star (1999), Justice for None (2004), Vermillion (2004) and Escape from Andersonville (2008). \nHe went on to deliver two solo writing efforts, Payback at Morning Peak (2011) and Pursuit (2013).\nHe spoke about why he had taken to his new job.\n\"I like the loneliness of [writing], actually. It's similar in some ways to acting, but it's more private and I feel like I have more control over what I'm trying to say and do,\" he told Reuters.\n\"There's always a compromise in acting and in film, you work with so many people and everyone has an opinion (laughs). \n\"But with the books, it's just Dan and I and our opinions. I don't know that I like it better than acting, it's just different. I find it relaxing and comforting.\"\n\nHackman married Faye Maltese in 1956. The couple had three children but divorced in 1986. \nFive years later he married Betsy Arakawa, who ran an upmarket furniture store in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nGene Hackman made more than 80 films, and still managed to become both a proficient golfer and respected painter. \nHe was also a mean performer on the racetrack, driving Formula Ford cars and taking part in the 1983 Daytona Endurance Race.\nThroughout his career, he gave few interviews and eschewed the celebrity lifestyle. \n\"If you look at yourself as a star,\" he said, \"you've already lost something in the portrayal of any human being.\"",

        "article_text": "After 25 years apart, all five original members of the British boyband Five are reuniting for a massive UK arena tour.\nThe group sold more than 20 million records in the late 1990s and early 2000s with tracks such as When The Lights Go Out, If Ya Gettin' Down and Slam Dunk (Da Funk).\nThe group - Sean Conlon, Ritchie Neville, Scott Robinson, Abz Love and Jason \"J\" Brown - haven't performed as a five-piece since they broke up in 2001, amid burnout, mental breakdown and backstage fights. \n\"This has been a long time coming and it really does feel right for all of us now,\" said Scott in a statement. \"I know I speak for all the boys when I say we can't wait to do this all over again. Hope you're ready!\"\nThe reunion announcement lands on the 25th anniversary of the band winning best pop act at the 2000 Brit Awards. \n\"We really can't wait to get back on stage together & see the fans, it's gonna go off!\" said Abz.\nFive were formed in 1997, in a gruelling audition process that saw more than 3,000 aspiring singers - including a pre-fame Russell Brand - audition for former Spice Girl managers Bob and Chris Herbert.\nThe group came together relatively naturally, however, after the members formed a unit during rehearsals and convinced record label executives with their chemistry.\n\"I remember Simon Cowell was there and he said, 'You're the band, I'm signing you to RCA Records on a five-album deal, this is happening very soon,\" Scott told journalist Michael Cragg in his book about the 2000s pop era, Reach For The Stars.\nThe group were quickly moved into a shared council house in Surrey to begin the process of bonding - but it didn't go entirely to plan.\n\"They wanted a band with edge and that's what they got,\" Ritchie said in Reach For The Stars. \n\"None of us are people that will be bossed around. So if you put five of those people together all the time and then they start annoying each other... eventually there's going to be eruptions.\"\nDespite those initial tensions, the group achieved huge commercial success. Their first song, Slam Dunk (Da Funk), went to number 10 in the UK; and the follow-up, When The Lights Go Out, achieved the same ranking on the US Billboard chart.\nOne of the first bands to utilise the talents of Swedish hitmaker Max Martin, they famously turned down the opportunity to record ...Baby, One More Time before Britney Spears turned it into an era-defining smash.\nUndeterred, they had further chart success with see-sawing song titles such as Everybody Get Up and If Ya Gettin' Down, and opened the 2000 Brit Awards by performing We Will Rock You with rock legends Queen.\nFor three consecutive years, they were named best band at the Smash Hits Poll Winners Party, while Scott picked up a hat-trick of best haircut awards. \nMeanwhile Ritchie's relationship with fellow teen star Billie Piper made them a permanent fixture in the tabloids and teen music magazines.\n\nIn 2001, Five played to half a million fans at Brazil's Rock In Rio festival, but the band was disintegrating due to a relentless touring schedule and personal conflicts.\nSean walked out during an interview to promote the 2001 single Let's Dance and never came back. His absence from the music video was officially explained as glandular fever but, in reality, he had suffered a mental breakdown.\nHis departure was formally announced later that year and, after releasing a greatest hits album, the band officially split up.\nScott said he decided to leave after being pressured to perform on TV while his young son was in a hospital's intensive care ward.\n\"I was crying in the corridor and I think [Ritchie] looked at the boys and said, 'This is done',\" he later recalled.\nIn the recent BBC documentary Boybands Forever, Cowell cited Five as the band that \"got away\", saying they had come tantalisingly close to becoming a major act in the US.\n\"The band ended before we really cracked America, and I honestly think we could have done that,\" former manager Chris Herbert agreed.\n\nFive reformed without Sean in 2006, but plans to record a new album were shelved after they failed to secure a record deal.\nA second reunion occurred in 2012, this time without \"J\" Brown, who declined to take part for \"privacy reasons\".\nAfter appearing in the ITV documentary The Big Reunion, the group toured with fellow 2000s pop survivors Atomic Kitten, Liberty X and B*Witched - until Abz abruptly quit in 2014.\n\"As of today I am no longer a member of @itsfiveofficial Thank you to all the fans who support us, I love you all,\" he wrote on social media at the time,.\nThe news apparently took his bandmates by surprise\n\"Wow what a way to find this out!\" replied Scott.\nAbz, who was born Richard Breen, announced he had rejoined the band earlier this week, with fans speculating his return could lead to a full reunion.\nThe news was confirmed by BBC Radio 2's Scott Mills on this morning's Breakfast Show.\nFive's 12-date tour will kick off in Brighton on 31 October 2025, with tickets on sale from Friday, 7 March.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim during the 2-2 draw at Everton on 22 February\nManchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says he and his players must take some responsibility for the club's present financial predicament.\nSpeaking less than 24 hours after United confirmed a second round of redundancies that will lead to up to 200 staff members losing their jobs, Amorim said that, as the \"engine\" of the club, his squad must do better.\nAfter losing more than \u00a3300m in the past five years, United find themselves 15th in the Premier League before their encounter with relegation-threatened Ipswich at Old Trafford on Wednesday.\nIt is their worst league campaign since the dark days of 1989-90, when Sir Alex Ferguson almost got the sack as United flirted with the relegation zone before eventually finishing 13th.\n\"We have to address all the problems in the club but one important piece of this moment is to understand how we get to this situation,\" said Amorim. \n\"It has a lot to do with the lack of success of the football team because we are the engine of any football club.\"\nIn the space of under two seasons, United have fallen from a third-place finish in Erik ten Hag's first season in charge to their current position.\nWhile Amorim and his squad might be insulated from the cost-cutting measures - staff at Old Trafford will no longer get free lunches in a move the club estimates will save \u00a31m - some of the people they work with every day will soon no longer be around.\n\"We know this year was really hard for everybody,\" said Amorim, who replaced Ten Hag in November.\n\"As a club, we did a lot of changes. When you are doing the changes if you have a football team who are playing well and winning games, it is easier for the fans and everyone to feel that. But in this moment we are in a difficult period inside of the club and inside of the pitch. We have to fight against this feeling.\n\"We have do our job and we try our best to help the team to perform better.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'I feel sorry for Rasmus Hojlund' - Troy Deeney\nUnited have scored 30 goals from 26 league games so far this season, with Rasmus Hojlund managing just two from 15 league starts.\nThe 22-year-old Denmark striker, who was signed from Atalanta for \u00a372 in August 2023, has scored seven goals in all competitions, with his last strike coming in the Europa League against Viktoria Plzen on 12 December.\n\"I think it's clear, we as a team, we are not helping Rasmus,\" Amorim added. \"We don't create a lot of chances.\n\"I think Rasmus has a lot of potential. If we improve the way we play the game, he will have more opportunities to score.\n\"He came here very young and, when you are very young, to be the number nine and play all the time sometimes is hard.\n\"We have to look at Rasmus as a player: he has the pace, he has the technique, he scores some goals that are really hard to score.\n\"Sometimes he doesn't choose the better runs, sometimes he's so anxious to touch the ball because he passes long minutes without the ball and he moves away from the goal.\n\"We address that in training.

        "article_text": "Ariana Grande, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Demi Moore were among the Oscar nominees who gathered in Los Angeles on Tuesday for the annual \"class photo\". \nAhead of the Academy Awards on Sunday (2 March), the nominees from all categories were invited to mingle over dinner and cocktails, as an eventful awards race reaches its conclusion.\nThe class photo, a highlight of the film calendar, is usually taken much earlier in awards season, at the nominees luncheon, but that event was cancelled this year due to the LA wildfires. \nHere are 12 things we spotted in this year's class photo:\nCynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande have spent the last few months crying, holding space and stroking each other's fingers as they promoted the screen adaptation of Wicked. \nThe two actresses have redefined the film press tour in recent weeks thanks to their absolute adoration for each other - an energy they will have to recreate later this year when they do it all again for the release of part two.\nBefore the photo was taken, instead of saying cheese, Erivo shouted: \"Everyone say 'Oscar nominee!'\"\nLast week, it was confirmed the pair will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony which will last a reported 10 minutes long. \nWicked is the closest thing the Oscars have this year to a box office smash in the shape of last year's Barbie, and they'll be hoping the medley will recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.\nWe're aware the weather is getting warmer and the sun is rising earlier as we hurtle towards Spring, but we are nevertheless always on the lookout for a colourful cosy jumper and we need to investigate the origin of this one as an urgent priority. \nThe woman with the impeccable sweater selection in the class photo is Maya Gnyp - a producer of I Am Ready, Warden - which is nominated for best documentary short. \nThe film follows Texas death row inmate John Henry Ramire in his final days.\nJoining Ariana and Cynthia on the front row were fellow acting nominees Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Mikey Madison and Monica Barbaro.\nSalda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes. \nAs a result, her fellow category nominees such as Barbaro, who plays Joan Baez in Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, have had to practise their best \"I'm just happy to be nominated\" faces this year. \nMadison, however, is a co-frontrunner in a tight race for leading actress. The Anora star is up against Demi Moore for The Substance in a category seen as a dead heat.\nJames Mangold, nominated this year for A Complete Unknown, is one of Hollywood's most respected and loved directors.\nSo why is he sitting on an aisle seat in the second-back row, away from all his pals, looking sheepish? \nIt's probably because he only just made the class photo by the skin of his teeth, arriving late to the event to an affectionate collective groan followed by cheers from his fellow nominees. \nDespite a distinguished Hollywood career, Mangold is a first-time nominee in the best director category, as are his fellow nominees Coralie Fargeat, Sean Baker, Brady Corbet and Jacques Audiard.\nIn a year where disappointingly few of the stars pulled funny faces or made eye-catching hand gestures while the photo was being taken, we applaud the team from Black Box Diaries for joining hands and celebrating.\nThey are the film's director Shiori Ito (second left), editor Ema Ryan Yamazaki (far right) and producers Hanna Aqvilin and Eric Nyari.\nThe movie, nominated in the documentary feature category, examines a sexual assault investigation in Japan. \nSitting in the back row, so far from the photographer that their faces are somewhat blurry and out of focus, are three of the biggest stars in this year's awards race.\nIn the centre is The Substance star Demi Moore, nominated for playing an ageing aerobics instructor who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself. \nShe is joined on either side by supporting actor nominees Guy Pearce (left), who is recognised for his role in The Brutalist, and Edward Norton, who is nominated for playing Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown. \nAlso hanging out in the front row were songwriter Bernie Taupin and singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile. \nThe pair are nominated in the best original song category for writing Never Too Late, the title track from Sir Elton John's recent documentary. \nSir Elton himself wasn't there, however, despite co-writing the song with the pair. \nIt's likely he will attend the Oscars on Sunday, but he won't be singing his song as the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony this year.\nInstead, Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony alongside the Wicked medley.\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet joined his fellow nominees just days after springing a surprise win at the SAG Awards for A Complete Unknown. \nIn his speech, the actor talked about his desire to be \"one of the greats\" of Hollywood.\nHowever, the actor has not been campaigning as aggressively as frontrunner Adrien Brody, and for the class photo, Chalamet took an aisle seat, leaned out and put his fist to his chest. \nSeated just in front of him are Anora's director Sean Baker and his producer wife Samantha Quan.\nAdding further star power to the blurry back row were best actor contenders Adrien Brody, Colman Domingo and Sebastian Stan. \nBrody is the frontrunner to win, for his role in the Brutalist as a Hungarian architect who moves to the US after World War Two and is taken under the wing of a wealthy businessman. \nSing Sing star Domingo plays a prison inmate who joins a performing arts programme, while Stan is nominated for portraying a young Donald Trump.\nThe Brits nominated in the acting categories this year are The Brutalist's Felicity Jones, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo, and Conclave's Ralph Fiennes.\nThe actor was on Fiennes form, sitting in the back row alongside Sing Sing's John \"Divine G\" Whitfield.\nFiennes is unlikely to win best actor, but if Conclave wins the top Oscar, he'll become the first actor ever to have appeared in four best picture winners.\nUnderstandably, not every nominee was available to attend the dinner - best supporting actor frontrunner Kieran Culkin was among the stars missing from the class photo.\nBut others were conspicuous by their absence, most notably Emilia P\u00e9rez star Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n.\nThe actress is persona non grata in Hollywood at the moment, after some historic tweets she posted resurfaced in recent weeks, severely damaging the film's awards chances in many categories. \nHowever, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself on Sunday - although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.\nSing Sing star Clarence Maclin was widely considered the most notable absence in the best supporting actor category this year.\nBut he is still nominated at the Oscars thanks to his story credit on the film, which means he is recognised in the best adapted screenplay category.\nMaclin was one of the real-life inmates at the Sing Sing jail, after being sentenced to 17 years in jail for robbery, aged 29, and was a member of the prison's Rehabilitation Through the Arts (RTA) programme. \nIn the class photo, Maclin, who plays a version of himself in Sing Sing, is either checking his watch or possibly about to sneeze. \nLook back on previous class photos:\n2024: 10 things we spotted from Margot Robbie to Billie Eilish\n2023: Brendan Fraser has a 'whale of a time\n2020: From Quentin Tarantino to a Frozen couple\n2019: Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper among stars\n2018: Cardboard cutouts and splashes of colour\n2017: Pharrell Williams dresses down\nNote: there were no class photos taken during Covid",

We're slowly bonding. Yesterday was a so-so day, just OK. But we got through all our run-plan. I was not doing set-up changes or directing where I want the car to go.\n\"Today was a bit more getting to explore a bit my interaction with my engineer.\"\nBoth Sainz and Leclerc had spins during the say - Sainz's at Turn One and Leclerc's at the final corner - just as they were starting flying laps.\nMercedes drivers George Russell and Andrea Kimi Antonelli were fourth and fifth fastest.\nMcLaren's Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris were 13th and 14th fastest.\nPre-season testing is a notoriously unreliable indicator of actual competitive performance because factors such as fuel loads and engine modes are not revealed by the teams and have a major impact on performance.\nAnd despite Sainz's fastest time, Williams team principal James Vowles underlined that his team were not fast enough to compete at the front this year.\n\"The top four are the top four,\" Vowles said. \"McLaren, Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes have all done good work over the winter.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nRed Bull's world champion Max Verstappen did not drive while team-mate Liam Lawson was in the car all day, ending up seventh fastest; Verstappen will drive on the final day on Friday.\nLeclerc said before running in the afternoon: \"It's only testing. Everyone is hiding their true performance but the feeling is pretty good. No bad surprises but too early to judge performances.\"\nNorris said in the news conference before driving in the second session: \"We have just tried to make the car quicker all round. Add more load.

        "article_text": "A dramatic day of high stakes diplomacy at the United Nations has exposed growing cracks in the transatlantic alliance since President Donald Trump returned to the global stage and massively shifted US foreign policy.\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine three years ago, Europe had no stronger partner than the United States.\nBut this week, in the halls of the General Assembly and at the Security Council, the US worked against its closest allies and sided with Russia, Belarus and North Korea to pass resolutions on the conflict in Ukraine.\nTo mark the third anniversary of Moscow's invasion, Ukraine sought a symbolic General Assembly resolution that would require the 193-member body to reaffirm Kyiv's territorial integrity and call for Russia to withdraw its forces in line with the UN charter.\nThat resolution did pass on Monday, but with less support than in past years. Many members abstained to avoid a tricky tension created by the US.\nWashington's diplomats had urged other countries to vote against the measure and to instead support their \"forward looking resolution\" that was only three short paragraphs. It took a neutral stance on the war, without blaming Russia, and called for a swift end with a lasting peace to follow.\nWashington not only introduced their measure in the General Assembly where every nation's vote is equal, but also in the more powerful Security Council. Resolutions there are legally binding - though sometimes hard to enforce - and there had never been council action on Ukraine because of Russia's veto power as a permanent member.\nThe move caught Europe off guard. One European diplomat told the BBC that the US behaved like a bully and did not take into account their stance on their continent's security.\nAnother who sits on the Security Council, Slovenia's ambassador Samuel Zbogar, told the BBC that Europe is struggling to adjust to the 180-degree change in the US position - and the speed at which Washington is moving.\nHe said the European Union will need to do some reflecting at the body's council meeting next week.\n\"Leaders will have to develop a plan on how the EU can actively be involved in finding peace, rather than reacting to what others are doing. It's up to us now in Europe to come forward,\" he told the BBC.\nThere were plenty of reactions in the halls of UN headquarters in New York, as European leaders worked to reconcile with the latest US position.\nThe UK's ambassador, Dame Barbara Woodward, and French UN Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere attempted to have the Security Council vote postponed, arguing that council members needed more time to consider the text and negotiate.\nInterestingly, the Chinese were willing to give more time for discussions, but the US and Russia, who are usually on opposite sides of issues on the council, both were against postponement.\nEuropean members of the council then tried to introduce amendments, as they had successfully done earlier in the General Assembly resolution which led to the US abstaining on its own resolution.\nIn the Security Council, the US threatened to block the proposed amendments to name Russia as the aggressor, reaffirm Ukraine's borders and call for a just peace. They said that it detracted from what Washington was trying to achieve and pursued a war of words rather than an end to the conflict.\nIn the end, the US didn't have to use its veto because Russia voted to block the amended language.\nThe US's neutral resolution then ultimately passed, breaking through three years of Security Council paralysis on the topic of Ukraine because of Russia's veto power.\nJust months ago, it would have seemed unthinkable that the first resolution adopted regarding the conflict would be one with such limited language - let alone that a resolution like this would be proposed by the US, condoned by Russia and passed without the full support of Europe's five council members.\nBut the US hailed the development, the first action by the council to call for an end to the war. Others were not so celebratory.\nRichard Gowan, UN Director of the Crisis Group, said after three years of deepening animosity between Russia and the US at the UN, the sight of the two powers coordinating to embarrass Europe was pretty stunning.\nHe said while everyone expected President Trump to be disruptive at the UN, this went beyond most people's expectations.\n\"The US lobbying against the European-Ukrainian resolution was very crude. US officials were reportedly threatening to cut aid to non-compliant states.

Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit. \nHaving confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes.\nThe US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. \nOn the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. \nHowever, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine.\nAsked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \"backstop\". \nHe said \"nobody will play around\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals. \nThe US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\". \n\"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\" he said. \nHe later added he had \"a lot of respect\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday.\nThe UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders. \nHowever, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\". \nThe deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back. \nAfter taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\". \nReferring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. \n\"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said. \nHe said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century. \n\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said. \nTrump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union. \nHe also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.\nAsked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\"\n\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"\nIn a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\". \nSince leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.\nIn his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way.\nHowever, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems.

        "article_text": "Ethan Kross is a world expert in the psychology of emotions, and he has identified a set of tools that can help us to tend our wellbeing.\nEver since he was a child, Ethan Kross has been \"an observer of emotion\" and the often counter-productive ways that we deal with difficult feelings. \"It seemed as if we were all just stumbling along, occasionally finding an accidental or Band-Aid solution to help us manage our emotional lives. Sometimes our improvised tools helped. Sometimes they made things worse. It seemed so haphazard, isolating, and inefficient,\" he says.\nAs a psychologist at the University of Michigan and director of the Emotion and Self-Control Laboratory, Kross hopes to change this sorry state of affairs. In his new book Shift: How to Manage Your Emotions So They Don't Manage You, he aims to equip us all with a set of tools that will help us to navigate our ups and downs more constructively.\nKross spoke to science writer David Robson about the benefits of \"negative\" feelings, creating safe spaces and emotional oases \u2013 and the surprising upsides of distraction.\nWhat are the most common misconceptions about emotions?\nOne big misunderstanding is that there are good emotions and there are bad emotions and that we should strive to live our lives free of all the bad emotions. This is an error, as far as I'm concerned: we evolved the ability to experience all emotions for a reason. Anger can motivate us to correct an injustice if there's still an opportunity to fix things. Sadness can lead us to introspect and make new meaning out of situations that have fundamentally been altered. Envy can motivate us to strive for things that we want to achieve. In the right proportions \u2013 that is such a key phrase \u2013 all emotions are useful.\nOne way of driving this point home is to think about physical pain, which is about as negative an emotional state as we can imagine. Many of us yearn to live lives free of any kind of physical pain. But some people are born without the capacity to experience pain, due to a genetic anomaly, and those kids end up dying younger than people who can experience pain. If they get their hand stuck in the fire, there's no signal that tells them to pull the hand away. The same principle is true for all our negative emotions.\nPeople often find it liberating to know that they don't have to strive to live a life without negativity. What you want to strive to achieve is just keeping these emotional experiences in check, and I think that's a much more tenable goal.\nMany people believe that their emotions are beyond their control. Where do you think this defeatist attitude comes from? And what are the consequences?\u00a0\nI think it depends on the facet of our emotional experiences that we're talking about. We often don't have control over the thoughts and feelings that are automatically triggered as we live our lives throughout the day, but we can control how we engage with those thoughts and feelings once they're activated, and that's where the promise of emotion regulation resides.\nBut if you don't think you can do something, then you're not going to make the effort to practice it. If you don't think exercising is going to make you more fit, for example, why on Earth would you devote effort to exercising? And if you don't think that you can use different strategies to manage your emotions, why would you ever avail yourself of them?\nSo how can we change our responses to difficult feelings?\nListening to music is one example of a tool that's underutilised. If you ask people why they listen to music, almost 100% of participants will say that they like the way it makes them feel. But if you then look at what people do when they are struggling with their emotions \u2013 such as the last time they were angry, anxious or sad \u2013 only a small minority report using music.\u00a0\nIt's just one category of what I call \"shifters\", which are the tools that can push our emotions around. And once you know how they work, you can be a lot more strategic in how you use them in your life.\nYou also describe how a change in environment can boost our wellbeing. We might have experienced this on holiday, but how can we apply this principle to our day-to-day lives?\u00a0\nAs you say, a lot of people feel restored when they go to an entirely different place that is free of associations with work. But we can't always take that vacation, and what I like to remind people is that there are often places locally that can shift our mood.\nWe talk a lot about getting attached to other people, and when things aren't going well, being in the presence of that figure can be a source of comfort and resilience. But it turns out we also become attached to places in our environment. Mine include the arboretum near my home, the tea house where I wrote my first book and one of my offices on campus. From the moment I am in that space, I have positive associations that help me manage my emotions.\nI think that they're not unlike the safe houses you have in spy movies or books. We all have these safe houses in our lives, and we want to be strategic about going to them when we're struggling. It's a way of managing ourselves from the outside in.\nYou can also curate your environment. We know that plants and images of green spaces can be restorative. So can photos of loved ones. We've done research where we expose people to pictures of loved ones while they're struggling with a problem. We find it speeds up the rate at which they \"repair\" following the experience.\u00a0\nIs the aim to be more conscious of what we can do to change how we're feeling \u2013 rather than just leaving it to chance?\nOne of my hopes for this book is that we can get people to be much more deliberate about incorporating these tools into our lives.\nI was surprised to find that distraction and avoidance can be a productive way of dealing with emotions. How so?\u00a0\nAvoidance \u2013 trying actively not to think about something by distracting yourself or engaging in other behaviours \u2013 is generally derided as an unhealthy tool. And there's no question that chronically avoiding things has been linked with negative outcomes; it's not an approach that I would advocate for anyone to adopt.\nBut we do not have to choose between either approaching or avoiding our emotions; we can be flexible and do both. There's research showing that people who are effective at both approaching and avoiding their emotions, expressing and suppressing, often fare well in the long term.\nWhat might that look like in our lives? Well, let's say you're triggered by something. You get emotional about an argument you have had with someone. One approach might be to address it right there at that moment, but it might make sense to take some time away from thinking about that problem or confronting it. I say that as the kind of person who, in general, does like to confront things right in the moment, just get to the bottom of it, and move on. But sometimes I've benefited from immersing myself in something totally unrelated for a day and then coming back to the problem. I might come back and realise it's not a problem at all, or I'll find that the intensity of the problem is diminished, and I can approach it from a broader perspective.\nHow should we deal with that killer of joy, social comparison?\nWe often hear that we shouldn't compare ourselves to other people. Good luck! We're a social species; part of the way we make sense of ourselves and our place in this world is to compare ourselves to others.\n\u00a0\nIt is true that we often engage in the kinds of comparisons that lead us to feel bad about ourselves, but you can reframe it in ways that make the comparison work for you rather than against you. If I find out that someone is outperforming me, I can say to myself, well, they were able to achieve that, so why can't I? Now it's almost like a target for something that I can shoot towards.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why we need to be more emotional to save the world\n\u2022 The untranslatable emotions you never knew you had\n\u2022 How climate change effects mental health\nDo you have a favourite strategy that you would typically turn to in times of difficulty?\nWhen I'm struggling, my first line of defence is to use distanced self-talk. I'll use my name and the second person pronoun \u2013 you \u2013 to silently coach myself through a problem, as if I'm advising a friend. (Read more: Illeism: The ancient trick to help you think more wisely.) And then I'll also engage in mental time travel. I'll ask myself, 'How am I going to feel about this in a day, 10 days, 10 months from now?' And I'll also go back in time. 'How does this compare to other difficult things I've been through?'\nOftentimes, those tools get me to where I want to be emotionally, but if they're not sufficient, I'll go to my emotional advisors, people in my network who are pretty skilled at empathising with me and advising me. And I'll go for a walk in a green space, or visit one of my emotional oases.\n*Ethan Kross's new book Shift: Managing Your Emotions So They Don't Manage You is published by Vermilion (UK) and Crown (US).\n** David Robson is an award-winning science writer and author.

        "summary": "In his new book Shift: How to Manage Your Emotions So They Don't Manage You, he aims to equip us all with a set of tools that will help us to navigate our ups and downs more constructively.Kross spoke to science writer David Robson about the benefits of \"negative\" feelings, creating safe spaces and emotional oases \u2013 and the surprising upsides of distraction.What are the most common misconceptions about emotions?One big misunderstanding is that there are good emotions and there are bad emotions and that we should strive to live our lives free of all the bad emotions. We often don't have control over the thoughts and feelings that are automatically triggered as we live our lives throughout the day, but we can control how we engage with those thoughts and feelings once they're activated, and that's where the promise of emotion regulation resides.Listening to music is one example of a tool that's underutilised \u2013 Ethan KrossBut if you don't think you can do something, then you're not going to make the effort to practice it. And if you don't think that you can use different strategies to manage your emotions, why would you ever avail yourself of them?So how can we change our responses to difficult feelings?Listening to music is one example of a tool that's underutilised. What you want to strive to achieve is just keeping these emotional experiences in check, and I think that's a much more tenable goal.Many people believe that their emotions are beyond their control. And there's no question that chronically avoiding things has been linked with negative outcomes; it's not an approach that I would advocate for anyone to adopt.Sometimes I've benefited from immersing myself in something totally unrelated for a day and then coming back to the problem \u2013 Ethan KrossBut we do not have to choose between either approaching or avoiding our emotions; we can be flexible and do both.",

        "article_text": "Leaked audio instructions by Greek rescue co-ordinators have cast further doubt on Greece's official version of events in the hours before a migrant boat sank along with up to 650 people onboard.\nThe Adriana went down in the early hours of 14 June 2023 in international waters \u2013 but within Greece's rescue zone - after leaving Libya days earlier.\nSurvivors later told the BBC that coastguards had caused their overcrowded fishing boat to capsize in a botched attempt to tow it and then forced witnesses to stay silent. \nThe Greek coastguard denied these claims and maintains it did not try to rescue those onboard because they were not in danger and said they had voluntarily wanted to reach Italy, not Greece.\nBut in a phone call that's now emerged an unnamed man speaking from inside a Greek rescue coordination centre is heard instructing the captain of the migrant boat to tell an approaching ship that those onboard do not want to reach Greece.\nThe coastguard has not commented on the audio but said it had handed over all available evidence to a Naval Court which is investigating the disaster.\nThe sinking was one of the worst-ever disasters known to have happened in the Mediterranean Sea.\nIt is estimated the boat was carrying up to 750 migrants when it set off from the port of Tobruk in Libya nearly a week earlier.\nEighty-two bodies were recovered, but the United Nations believes an additional 500 people - including 100 women and children who were in the hold of the boat - may have died.\nAudio recordings obtained by Greek website News247.gr reveal phone calls involving the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC) at the port of Piraeus, near the capital Athens.\nIn the first call, at 18:50 local time (15:50 GMT)  on 13 June, an officer is heard explaining to the man piloting the migrant boat that a large red vessel will soon be approaching to give supplies and that he should explain that the migrants do not want to reach Greece.\nOfficer 1:\nThe replies of the man captaining the migrant boat are not heard.\nIn a second call, 90 minutes later, at 22:10, a seemingly different officer from the same coordination centre, speaks to the captain of the Lucky Sailor (the \"big red ship\").\nOfficer 2: OK, captain, sorry before I couldn't hear you. I couldn't understand what did you say to me. You told me you gave them food, water and they told you that they don't want to stay in Greece and they want to go to Italy, they don't want anything else?\nLucky Sailor captain: Yes because I asked them by megaphone \"Greece or Italia?\" and everybody there screaming Italia.\nOfficer 2: Aah, OK, OK everybody screaming that they don't want Greece and they want Italy?\nLucky Sailor captain: Yes, yes, yes.\nOfficer 2: OK\nLucky Sailor captain: They are all like crowded people, very crowded, full deck.\nOfficer 2: OK, captain. So you have finished with the supplies?\nLucky Sailor captain: Yes, sir, yes.\nOfficer 2: Captain, I want this, I want this to write it in your logbook. The bridge logbook.\nLucky Sailor captain: Yes OK, we will write it.\nOfficer 2: OK?\nLucky Sailor captain: Yes\nOfficer 2: I want you to write it about that they don't want to stay in Greece and they want to go to Italy. They want nothing from Greece and they want to go to Italy.\nLucky Sailor captain: OK, yes, yes.\nAnother vessel, the Faithful Warrior, also gave some supplies to the migrant boat but no further conversations between its captain and the Greek authorities have emerged.\nThe Greek coastguard did not comment on the contents of the conversations but told the BBC it had submitted \"all the material it had in its possession, including the audio recordings and the diaries of events\" to the Maritime Court Prosecutor's Office, which is investigating.\nIt said it had rescued more than a quarter of a million migrants in danger at sea in the last decade and arrested more than a thousand smugglers, and that its humanitarian work had been recognised internationally.\nOur BBC investigation in the immediate days after the sinking challenged the Greek authorities' explanation for the disaster.\nAnalysis of the movement of other ships in the area suggests the overcrowded fishing vessel was not moving for at least seven hours before it capsized.\nThe coastguard has always insisted that during these hours the boat was on a course to Italy and not in need of rescue.\nLast year, a Greek court threw out charges against nine Egyptian men who were accused of causing the shipwreck. \nThe judges in the southern port city of Kalamata ruled they did not have jurisdiction to hear the case, on the grounds the vessel sank in international waters.\nThe indictment had showed that the defendants were being prosecuted on evidence that had already been contradicted by at least six survivors, who told the BBC the coastguard had caused their boat to capsize and then pressured them to frame the Egyptians.\nHuman rights lawyer, Dimitris Choulis, who represented some of the accused Egyptians said he was not surprised by what these recordings.\n\"We know about the coastguard's tactics of either pushing back or not rescuing people.\"\nHe claimed there had been \"an attempted cover up from day one.\"\n\"They [Greek authorities] told the story 'they did not want to be rescued' and so have insulted the memory of so many dead people,\" he told the BBC.\nHuman rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have said they have strong reservations about the integrity of the Greek investigation and have called for an international investigation.\nThe Greek Ombudsman - an independent authority removed from the government - has been looking at the allegations.\nThe disaster is also being examined by the Greek Naval Court.",

The model estimates the probability of each match outcome (win, draw or loss) by using betting market odds and the Opta Power Rankings. The odds and rankings are based on historical and recent team performances.\nThe model considers the strength of opponents by using these match outcome probabilities and simulates the remaining fixtures in the competition thousands of times. By analysing the outcome of each of these simulations, the model can see how often teams finished in each league position to create our final predictions.\nIt estimates that Liverpool are 100% certain to finish in the top four and Arsenal have a 99.8% chance.\nThey give Manchester City a 73.7% chance of qualifying for the Champions League for a 15th successive season - and that rises to 86.2% if a fifth spot (more on that below) is available.\nNottingham Forest are currently best placed after that - with a 40.6% chance of finishing in the top four - but it is then really tight between the other sides.\nBrighton, Fulham and Villa - who have played a game more than most sides because of their Liverpool match being rescheduled - are each given less than 10% chances of reaching the top four or five.\nThese figures were correct before Wednesday's games began.\nEach country's league earns a coefficient ranking based on how their teams perform in Uefa's three men's club competitions: the Champions League, Europa League and Conference League.\nCoefficient points are earned through match results - two for a win and one for a draw.\nThe points earned by clubs from the same domestic league are added up and divided by the number of clubs the league has in Europe.\nFor example, if the Premier League had 100 points, that would be split by the number of teams playing in Europe (seven), giving England a coefficient of 14.28.\nThis season, bonus points are available to clubs playing in the Champions League, which is advantageous to leagues with more clubs competing in it, such as Germany and Italy.\nCountries that finish in the coefficient table's top two earn an additional Champions League spot for the following season.\nThose spots are awarded to the teams who finish in the first position below the standard Champions League allocation in those leagues.\nIn the Premier League, the top four clubs automatically qualify for the Champions League via league position, so any additional place would go to the team in fifth.\nAdditional spots for the 2024-25 Champions League were given to Bologna and Borussia Dortmund, who finished fifth in Serie A and the Bundesliga respectively.\nAt present, the Premier League is in the driving seat, with six of its seven teams reaching the last 16 across all three Uefa competitions.\nManchester City's defeat by Real Madrid is the only blot on the landscape for England, with Spain in third place for now.\nHowever, Italy, who are second, endured a dismal time in February with AC Milan, Atalanta and Juventus all losing in the Champions League knockout play-off round - limiting Serie A's opportunity to gather more points.\nGermany's prospects appear difficult with Bayern Munich and Dortmund in the same half of the Champions League draw.\nLikewise France. Paris St-Germain and Lille are the representatives remaining in the Champions League, with Monaco and Brest exiting at the play-off stage.

        "summary": "However, that rule has been scrapped.This season, any team who win the Europa League or Champions League but do not qualify for the Champions League via their domestic league position will go into the Champions League.This raises the possibility of Manchester United or Tottenham, both through to the knockout stage of the Europa League but languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League, qualifying for the Champions League alongside the top four or five. By analysing the outcome of each of these simulations, the model can see how often teams finished in each league position to create our final predictions.It estimates that Liverpool are 100% certain to finish in the top four and Arsenal have a 99.8% chance.They give Manchester City a 73.7% chance of qualifying for the Champions League for a 15th successive season - and that rises to 86.2% if a fifth spot (more on that below) is available.Nottingham Forest are currently best placed after that - with a 40.6% chance of finishing in the top four - but it is then really tight between the other sides.Brighton, Fulham and Villa - who have played a game more than most sides because of their Liverpool match being rescheduled - are each given less than 10% chances of reaching the top four or five.These figures were correct before Wednesday's games began.How do countries earn an extra Champions League spot?Each country's league earns a coefficient ranking based on how their teams perform in Uefa's three men's club competitions: the Champions League, Europa League and Conference League.Coefficient points are earned through match results - two for a win and one for a draw.The points earned by clubs from the same domestic league are added up and divided by the number of clubs the league has in Europe.For example, if the Premier League had 100 points, that would be split by the number of teams playing in Europe (seven), giving England a coefficient of 14.28.This season, bonus points are available to clubs playing in the Champions League, which is advantageous to leagues with more clubs competing in it, such as Germany and Italy.Countries that finish in the coefficient table's top two earn an additional Champions League spot for the following season.Those spots are awarded to the teams who finish in the first position below the standard Champions League allocation in those leagues.In the Premier League, the top four clubs automatically qualify for the Champions League via league position, so any additional place would go to the team in fifth.Additional spots for the 2024-25 Champions League were given to Bologna and Borussia Dortmund, who finished fifth in Serie A and the Bundesliga respectively.Who is leading the coefficient table? Lyon, in the Europa League, are the only other French side left in European competition.Portugal has two of its five teams remaining but lost Sporting and Porto in the Champions League and Europa League play-offs.What about the Europa League winners?England could end up with seven Champions League teams next season.The winners of the Europa League, as well as the Champions League, are granted a spot.Under previous rules, any single league could only have a maximum of five clubs in the Champions League. Six points separate eight teams - how race for Europe is shaping upImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Chelsea forward Pedro Neto (left), Aston Villa manager Unai Emery (centre) and Brighton defender Adam Webster (right)Published26 February 2025Nottingham Forest remained third with a goalless draw against Arsenal as the race for European football took another turn on Wednesday.Manchester City went back above Chelsea into fourth with a 1-0 win against Tottenham Hotspur, after the Blues had temporarily gone above the champions with a comfortable victory over struggling Southampton on Tuesday.Brighton went level on points with seventh-placed Bournemouth with a 2-1 win against the Cherries, while Fulham boosted their chances of a European place by beating Wolves at Molineux.However, there was disappointment for Aston Villa after a 4-1 defeat by Crystal Palace.BBC Sport looks at who stands where in the race to secure Champions League football - and why England may have a fifth spot to fill next season.How does the Premier League table stand?Image source, Getty/BBC SportCity's hard-fought win on Wednesday meant they jumped above Chelsea into fourth - a guaranteed Champions League spot.Chelsea had moved above Bournemouth, Newcastle and City on Tuesday night, but now sit fifth - which could be enough for a spot in Europe's top competition next season.Villa's defeat meant they dropped to 10th, having started Tuesday eighth, while Bournemouth moved down one place to seventh.Wins for Brighton and Fulham lift those clubs up one place to eighth and ninth respectively.Which positions guarantee a European spot?The standard positions that earn European places in the Premier League are:Champions League: Top fourEuropa League: FifthA second Europa League spot is awarded to the FA Cup winners, and the Carabao Cup winners earn a Europa Conference League play-off spot.If the FA Cup winners secure European qualification by other means, then the sixth-placed team in the Premier League takes that spot.Similarly, if the EFL Cup winners earn a European place by another route, then England's Conference League place passes on to the sixth-placed team.And if both domestic cup winners gain European spots by other means, then the Europa League place goes to the team in sixth, and the Conference League spot to the side in seventh.Who is set to qualify for Europe as things stand?Opta's League Prediction model estimates the likelihood of teams finishing in each position. Could England get a fifth Champions League spot?At present, the Premier League is in the driving seat, with six of its seven teams reaching the last 16 across all three Uefa competitions.Manchester City's defeat by Real Madrid is the only blot on the landscape for England, with Spain in third place for now.However, Italy, who are second, endured a dismal time in February with AC Milan, Atalanta and Juventus all losing in the Champions League knockout play-off round - limiting Serie A's opportunity to gather more points.Germany's prospects appear difficult with Bayern Munich and Dortmund in the same half of the Champions League draw.Likewise France.",

        "article_text": "A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares.\nA man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, \"Where you from, ma'am?\"\n\"England.\"\n\"Hope you enjoy Estelle,\" he says.\n\"Do you?\" I ask.\n\"A lot better than where I was before.\"\nWelcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas.\nConcrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter.\nThe UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside.\nLooking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released.\nJust one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment.\nNo prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row.\nJimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery.\nHe's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison.\n\"I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives,\" he says. \"If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison.\"\nDelgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government.\nThe \"good time credit\" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well.\nCredits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation.\nOff the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison.\n\"They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life,\" he says. \"I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works.\"\nThe rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%).\nThe BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood.\n\"The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007,\" Ms Mahmood says. \"They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s.\"\nShe believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. \"It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime.\"\nThe Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet.\n\"The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007,\" says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. \"And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem.\"\nWhat would make a real difference, she says, would be diverting more people from incarceration in the first place: \"To shorten sentences, to reduce the use of recalls to prison, and to invest more heavily in rehabilitative programs in prison and in programs and services in the community.\"\nAs well as incentivisation, the UK government is also considering the use of \"diversion programmes\" - where offenders are sent on rehabilitation courses rather than to jail. This can apply to people with addiction issues or mental health problems. It's what they do here in Texas to reduce the burden on the courts and attempt to sort the root cause of the offence.\nMore people have been put to death in Texas than anywhere else in the US. Since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 593 prisoners have been executed. There are 176 people currently on death row - so it might seem strange the UK government could take a leaf out of their book.\nEven so, the justice secretary believes there is still much the UK can learn from what happens at Estelle.\n\"I don't think that the fact that they have the death penalty here means that we shouldn't be learning lessons from strategies that they've introduced that really work,\" Ms Mahmood says.\nIt's a plan with \"huge potential in the UK\" according to Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, who believes it will make prisons safer and more productive.\n\"It will help ensure prisoners are doing what is necessary to reduce the risk they will reoffend and create more victims,\" he says.\nBut not everyone agrees with incentivising convicted criminals to work towards an early release from prison.\nSamantha Nicholls' son was murdered in 2018. Twenty-two year old Joe Pooley was thrown into a river in Ipswich and held under the water. Three people were jailed for his murder in 2021. Joe's mother believes inmates should never be released before their sentence is complete.\n\"Prison is a punishment - you should do your time,\" she says. \"It needs to be a deterrent - you're there because you did something wrong.\"\nIt's clear the UK needs to find solutions to cut prison overcrowding \u2013 and find them fast. Even the recent prisoner early release scheme will barely keep pace with more offenders being jailed. New prison buildings will take years to come on stream. But does this Texan prison have the answers?\nThe challenge for ministers and the criminal justice system is how to stop the revolving doors on the UK's prisons - the reoffending and lack of prospects facing those who are released which draws them back into crime.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments. \nIt'll be delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.",

Could he still be rewarded with a best actor Oscar on 2 March?\nIt would be a major upset even for this extraordinary awards season if so, as the favourite for the prize, Adrien Brody, who plays a Holocaust survivor in Brady Corbet's The Brutalist, has won the Golden Globe, Bafta and Critics Choice Awards \u2013 all traditional harbingers of the Oscar. But then 29-year-old Chalamet took the SAG (Screen Actors Guild) prize for best actor on Sunday for his role playing a young Bob Dylan in James Mangold's biopic A Complete Unknown, accepting the award with an earnest speech that went viral.\nUntil that moment, he was at least winning the award for \"one of the most gonzo best actor campaigns in Oscar history\", as Variety describes it. Apart from the e-bike incident in London and poking fun at his \"loser\" awards face on Saturday Night Live, he chatted with Kendrick Lamar ahead of Lamar's performance at the Superbowl half-time show, and impressed on sports channel ESPN by making accurate college football predictions. (Some were moved to label him \"Lisan al-Gaib\" for this, in reference to the seer-like figure from Dune: Part Two, which along with A Complete Unknown, makes two best picture nominees in which Chalamet stars.)\n\"What I find most interesting is everyone's reaction to it,\" Variety's Chief Awards Editor, Clayton Davis, tells the BBC about Chalamet's campaign. \"It varies from, 'Oh my god, the guy is an artist and he's our generation's James Dean, our Marlon Brando,' to older people feeling like he's the epitome of Gen Z or TikTok.\"\nDavis believes that Chalamet's actions (not to mention the baby pink and acid green outfits, plus his celebrity partner Kylie Jenner's discreet support) mean that he is speaking directly to his peer group \u2013 and that can only benefit the Academy Awards. \"He's really speaking to Gen Z, and I would say, if anything, maybe he's going to be a great and needed lifeline to get Gen Z into the Oscars again, by consuming content differently,\" he says. \"And the Oscars have been trying to find a way to reach that TikTok generation that's going to care about a 100-year-old organisation.\"\u00a0\nWhat he has also done, Davis argues, is made an awards season campaign authentic for someone of his age.\n\"He's trying to redefine how it looks for someone like him, and I can appreciate that,\" he says. \"And as someone who likes to call themselves an Oscar historian, I'm used to the traditional. You go in, you kiss babies, shake a lot of people's hands, and you talk about your work. Taking your shirt off on the red carpet is different. And it may be jarring for a lot of people at first, and it may not work this time, but it doesn't mean that it won't work ever. When you're the first to do something, it always looks strange until it becomes the norm. We are in a transitional period in Hollywood across the board. Why wouldn't that also hit the Oscar campaign trail?\"\nThe actor's promotional appearances have impressed some Oscar watchers. A post on entertainment website Lainey Gossip praises Chalamet, describing his \"current Oscar campaign-non-campaign\" as \"one of the best, if not the best, of all time\u2026 if he gets it, he's doing to do it not by prescription, not by sucking up to the old people.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, in his SAG acceptance speech (which also went viral) Chalamet aligned himself with some of the most revered actors in cinema history, naming Marlon Brando and Daniel Day-Lewis as those he looked up to.\n\"I know the classiest thing would be to downplay the effort that went into this role and how much this means to me, but the truth is this was five years of my life,\" Chalamet said. \"I'm really in pursuit of greatness,\" he added. \"I know people don't usually talk like that, but I want to be one of the greats. I'm inspired by the greats. I'm inspired by the greats here tonight\u2026 I want to be up there.\" He also called Bob Dylan \"a true American hero\" in the speech, and, a week earlier at the Berlin Film Festival, referred to him as \"the man, the myth, the legend\".\n\"I love how Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet isn't sugarcoating how badly he wants to win the Oscar during his SAG speech,\" wrote Buzzfeed's Spencer Althouse on X.\nBut the perception that the Oscar demographic is older and thus needs a certain style of wooing is rapidly shifting, Clayton Davis says. \"They also added 4,000 new members in the last decade. And a lot of them are young, they're diverse, they're from different backgrounds,\" he explains. \"The Oscars have changed. The old guard, you're never going to get them on board, although when you respect someone like Bob Dylan and recognise his contribution, that speaks to older Academy voters, and they can in turn respect him [Chalamet] as an artist.\n\"They already embraced the movie; in that it's nominated for eight Oscars. He introduced Bob Dylan to Gen Z, who probably had never heard of this guy before. So, I think you've got to admire at minimum that he is bridging the generational divide.\"\nChalamet may be the youngest ever best actor winner in SAG's three-decade history, but the SAG prize was also Chalamet's first ever major award. He was first Oscar-nominated in 2018 at the age of 22 for Luca Guadagnino's love story Call Me by Your Name, Bafta-nominated in 2019 for Felix Van Groeningen's addiction drama Beautiful Boy, and Golden Globe-nominated last year for Paul King's Wonka.\nBut although his filmography speaks of taste and versatility, there are some reasons why an Oscar win for him is still unlikely this year. \"Voting for the Oscars closed already,\" Davis points out. \"I was most confident that he would win the SAG partly because they tend to be more populist in their choices. What it means for the Oscar race now is harder to discern. Is it a 'too little, too late' mentality? I remember last year when Lily Gladstone won the SAG best actress the day before Oscar voting closed, and after I'd concluded that Emma Stone was going to win the Oscar. We all switched our predictions to Lily, and Emma Stone still ended up winning in the end.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Why horror performances deserve more awards\n\u2022\u00a0The Brazilian film that could upset the Oscars\n\u2022\u00a0'Category fraud' is the latest Oscar scandal\u00a0\nNor are the statistics on Chalamet's side. No one who has won just the SAG best actor award has then gone on to win the Oscar. Male actors also tend to win their Academy Awards later in life \u2013 in an Oscar statistic probably not lost on either of them, Adrien Brody is still the youngest ever male best actor Oscar winner, for The Pianist in 2002 at the age of 29, the same age as Chalamet is now. (By contrast, the youngest ever best actress winner was aged 21 at the time.)\n\"I think that it's a barrier of entry for some people in terms of voting for him,\" Davis says. \"Some people feel like, 'We have time, Timmy's here. Timmy's very established.' If anything, at minimum this generation's Leonardo DiCaprio, right?\" he says. \"There is this sense of, 'We don't have to do it now.'\"\nThis may not be comforting to Chalamet, as DiCaprio was aged 41 when he finally got his best actor Oscar, on his fourth attempt, but Davis is prepared to predict that next year Chalamet will have another chance at the Oscar in a film he's starring in and producing: Marty Supreme, directed by Josh Safdie.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\"Timmy will be here probably next year\u2026 Marty Supreme sounds like it's going to be an amazing movie, even though we know nothing about it. He will probably do back-to-back nominations at minimum. And in a year when he played in the sequel to a sci-fi franchise and played Bob Dylan, that's a pretty killer resume for 2024,\" he says. \"And now in 2025, he's going to be sporting a moustache in a Safdie brother movie. I'm excited to see what he's going to continue to deliver.\"\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

That's when Mrs Webb, from Watford, became a fan.\nShe began a business with her husband, Harry, selling the cards online just before the pandemic. During lockdown, it \"really blew up\".\nMrs Webb started making YouTube videos under the name \"PokiChloe\" to reach new fans.\nThe couple joined forces with another Youtuber, Dean Leander - AKA PokeDean - to open a physical business.\nToday her Youtube channel, which mostly shows daily life in her Chorleywood shop, has more than 118,000 subscribers.\nIn recent years, Pok\u00e9mon cards have become valuable collectors' items and many shop visitors hope they too could be sitting on a gold mine.\nLast year, a Nottinghamshire man made \u00a355,000 when he sold a collection of cards from the 1990s and 2000s.\nBut a collector from Suffolk failed to sell his fourth print Charizard card when it did not reach its reserve of \u00a38,000.\nMrs Webb explained: \"It could be anything that makes a card collectable. \n\"It could be that they're rare... It could be that it's a really popular Pok\u00e9mon.\n\"Sometimes overnight prices change on cards and I can't tell you why that card is now valuable.\"\nSometimes cards worth up to \u00a3100,000 have been brought into the shop, although PokiChloe admits the big sums no longer surprise her. \n\"It's going to sound really awful: I'm very used to it now,\" she says. \n\"It is very surreal to think that this little bit of cardboard is worth that sort of money because to some people that's a deposit for a house - that could buy them two or three cars.\n\"But with what we do now we're exposed to it. Often it's just another day and another Pok\u00e9mon card.\"\nMany of the visitors who arrive at Collector's Cardhouse come with large binders tucked under their arms filled with cards they stashed away in their childhood. \nMany of these collections are, unfortunately, not worth anything. \nIf, however, PokiChloe does deem a card valuable, it then has to be \"graded\".\nThe process involves sending the card to a grading company who analyse it for signs of wear and then award it a graded score, usually out of 10, which denotes its quality and potential value.\nPokiChloe compared those cards that get a 10 to \"gold dust\".\n\"It has to be completely clean,\" she says. \n\"There can't be scratches on the holographic part, there can't be any whitening or damage on the back, it can't be creased. It has to be perfect like it's never been touched before.\n\"We had a Charizard that was graded a 10. It was a special card that was given out to employees at Creatures, who own Pok\u00e9mon. I think there's only 300 of them and we had a 10 and we sold it for just under \u00a340,000.\"\nMrs Webb said a common misunderstanding is that a card has to be old to be valuable.\n\"There are packs that you could open today from the shop that cost you about \u00a330,\" she says.\n\"If you got the best card in the set and it was graded a 10, you'd be looking at a couple of thousand.\n\"And they're cards that only came out a few years ago. So they're not even what we would call vintage. They're modern cards.\"\nA graded card, regardless of how damaged it is, is sealed in plastic to preserve its condition. \nMrs Webb said: \"We get people that send off cards that aren't in good condition. They just want to encapsulate it and keep it as a memory. So that's quite nice to see.\n\"I know the money is a big part of it and obviously people are blown away by the prices, but for some people it's about the memories, the nostalgia and just having some memories from when they were kids.\"\nNext year Pok\u00e9mon is celebrating its 30th anniversary. PokiChloe has ambitious plans for the future of Collector's Cardhouse.\n\"I want to keep this growing,\" she says.\n\"If you'd asked me about this five years ago I wouldn't have believed it.

        "article_text": "To reach north-east Syria, we cross a rickety floating bridge over the River Tigris. Our minibus rattles as it takes us from Iraqi Kurdistan through Syrian oil fields, where jacks pumping crude oil line the roads.\nThis part of Syria is controlled by Kurds, who call it Rojava - meaning western Kurdistan. Since 2012, after the outbreak of civil war, they have run it as a self-declared autonomous region, protected by Kurdish-led armed forces.\nBut Bashar al-Assad's regime never recognised it and, despite his fall from power, its future remains uncertain. \nAs well as more than a decade of civil war, the Syrian Kurds have faced years of conflict with its northern neighbour, Turkey - a battle they are still fighting.\nA decade ago, the Islamic State group (IS) swept through this region, capturing cities and villages with little resistance - until it reached the city of Kobane, next to the Turkish border, in September 2014.\nIS militants didn't manage to enter the city, but they imposed a brutal siege that lasted for months.\nKurdish-led factions, supported by the US-led military coalition, broke the siege in early 2015. This January, I join the city's residents as they mark the 10-year anniversary.\nAt the entrance to Kobane, women in their 50s, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, guard the checkpoints. Women played a crucial role in the fight against IS - many volunteered in the all-female Women's Protection Units (YPJ).\n\nAs we drive around the city, the scars of war are still visible, along with posters of young men and women who lost their lives.\nBut in the main square, the mood is festive. Young girls and boys, dressed in colourful Kurdish outfits dance hand in hand, singing as they celebrate.\nFor the older generation, though, it is a bittersweet moment. \"Last night I lit candles for my martyred brother and others killed in Kobane,\" says Newrouz Ahmad, a 45-year-old mother of four. \"It is a joyful day, but also a painful one. I wish he was here to see it.\"\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared victory over IS in north-east Syria in 2019. But freedom from IS hasn't brought lasting peace.\nTurkey and a coalition of Turkish-backed rebel groups known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) have launched several military operations against SDF-controlled territories since 2016, and captured a swathe of territory running along hundreds of kilometres of the border.\nTurkey considers the largest component in the SDF - the People's Protection Units (YPG) - an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for decades and is listed by Ankara as a terrorist organisation. The country wants to push the SDF back from its border.\nAs the Assad regime collapsed in late 2024, the Turkish-backed SNA launched a new offensive to capture territory west of the River Euphrates from the SDF.\nNow battles have reached areas near Kobane. A Kurdish commander in the city quietly tells me: \"Don't film here, we have built tunnels beneath the city to prepare for another siege.\"\nIn the city, the smell of gasoline fills the air, and the deafening sound of generators can be heard everywhere. Locals tell me that most of the power stations, refineries, and even telecommunications antennas have been destroyed by Turkish air strikes over the past two years.\nNewrouz Ahmad says that having \"defeated IS in Kobane\u2026 we won't allow Turkey and its proxies to occupy our city, we will defeat them too\".\nAt a restaurant, the moment people realise we are not locals, they surround us. I ask an old man with grey hair and a stick in his hands how old he is. I guess he is about 80, but the answer he gives embarrasses me. \"I am 60,\" he says.\nIt's clear that people here have been exhausted by war, having witnessed so much death and bloodshed.\nAnd now the threat of another battle is looming.\nTurkish-made drones and Turkish jets have targeted SDF positions and supply routes around the city. Even civilians protesting have been hit.\nIn a regional hospital, I find one of the wounded - Lea Bunse, a 28-year-old German peace activist who has been volunteering at a women's shelter in Rojava for over two years.\nShe shows me a video of an attack on a demonstration she says she was part of in January. The footage shows two projectiles dropping from the sky and hitting a crowd of people dancing.\nThe protest was held near the strategic Tishreen Dam, where fighting has been ongoing.  The SDF says six civilians were killed, and dozens more injured.\n\"An old man next to me was also injured,\" she tells me from her bed.\n\"I lost some blood\u2026 but when we got into the ambulance, another drone attack was carried out next to our ambulance,\" she adds.\nHuman Rights Watch has condemned an attack that hit a Kurdish Red Crescent ambulance as an \"apparent war crime\" by the Turkish-SNA coalition.\nThe Turkish foreign ministry told the BBC that \"reports claiming Turkey is involved in the attacks against civilians and critical infrastructure do not reflect the truth\" adding that the SDF sends civilians to a \"conflict-ridden area on purpose\" to use them as \"human shields\u2026 in order to not to lose control on the said dam\".\nIt accused the SDF of using \"violence and terror\" to pursue \"its own separatist agenda\", violating a ceasefire and stopping technical teams from getting access to the dam for repairs.\nSyria's new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, is stuck between a rock and a hard place.\nThe interim president - whose Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad - has been promising to form an inclusive government in Damascus, and he has asked all armed factions to lay down their weapons. Negotiations are reportedly being held with the SDF to find a solution for the north-east.\nBut the inclusion of the Kurdish factions puts Sharaa in a difficult position with one of his main allies \u2013 Turkey.\nAnd when Sharaa opened a conference for national dialogue on Syria's future on Tuesday, the Kurdish autonomous administration was absent - it said it had not been invited.\nSpeaking to me from a discreet location near an American base in Hassakeh province in the north-east of Syria, SDF commander Gen Mazloum Abdi tells me he has met Sharaa in Damascus before.\nBut the two sides have still not reached an agreement.\n\"In reality, we are still at war with Turkey and its proxies. Turkish jets and drones continue to bomb us,\" he says, adding: \"In Damascus, it remains unclear what steps the new government will take. Their statements are positive, but they are under pressure from Turkey to act against the areas under our control.\n\"But the US, France, and some Arab nations are pushing them to recognize Kurdish rights,\" he says.\nFor the US, SDF fighters have been the most reliable allies in the fight against IS.\nToday, hundreds of US troops remain in Kurdish-controlled areas, to counter IS sleeper cells.\nBut the Kurds now fear President Donald Trump might withdraw these troops, leaving the region vulnerable to any Turkish military operation, and a possible IS resurgence.\nIt's estimated that there are still about 40,000 IS family members and up to 10,000 jihadist fighters held in SDF-controlled camps and prisons in the north-east, says Gen Abdi.\n\"If Turkey attacks, we will have no choice but to redirect our forces,\" he warns. \"That would give IS an opportunity to attack prisons and free its fighters.\"\nThere is further uncertainty for the women who fought against IS in the all-female YPJ ranks.\nThe walls in the office of 29-year-old YPJ spokesperson Roksana Mohamed are covered with pictures of fellow female commanders killed in battle.\n\"So far, we haven't seen any roles given to women in Damascus' new leadership,\" she says. \"Why shouldn't a woman be defence minister?\"\nMs Mohamed says women fought for their rights in this region. They have been actively involved in every aspect of political, social, and military life.\n\"If our rights are not respected, how can we be expected to lay down our arms?\" she asks.\nSo while some believe stability in Syria is on the horizon, for the Kurds, the future remains unclear. Will they be recognised as partners in a new Syria, or face another existential battle?",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said he has a \"lot of respect\" for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, on the eve of their talks at the White House.\nAsked by the BBC if he would apologise for recently calling him a \"dictator\", he said he could not believe he had said this. He also called Zelensky \"very brave\".\nTrump was speaking after talks with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer about ending the war between Ukraine and Russia.\nHe predicted a \"very good meeting\" with Zelensky on Friday, saying efforts to achieve peace were \"moving along pretty rapidly\". \nThis week's meetings come after the Trump administration shocked its Western partners by holding the first high-level US talks with Moscow since Russia invaded Ukraine just over three years ago. \nAmerica's new president had appeared to blame Zelensky for the war and chided him for not starting peace talks earlier.\n\"You've been there for three years,\" he had said last Tuesday. \"You should have ended it... You should have never started it. You could have made a deal.\"\nBut this Thursday, speaking after meeting Sir Keir, Trump told reporters asking about his forthcoming talks with Zelensky: \"I think we're going to have a very good meeting tomorrow morning.

No cause of death was given. \nIn a wide-ranging career, Hackman won two Academy Awards for The French Connection and Unforgiven.\nThree of Hackman's children from a previous marriage confirmed the death of their father and Ms Arakawa in a statement to the BBC.\n\"He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just Dad and Grandpa. We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss,\" Elizabeth, Leslie and Annie Hackman said.\nWarning: This story contains details some readers may find upsetting\nThe Santa Fe County Sheriff's office confirmed the deaths.\n\"On 26 February, 2025, at approximately 1:45pm, Santa Fe County Sheriff's deputies were dispatched to an address on Old Sunset Trail in Hyde Park where Gene Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa, and a dog were found deceased,\" the office said.\nIn a news conference on Thursday afternoon, Sheriff Adan Mendoza said: \"It sounds like they had been deceased for quite a while, and I don't want to guess in reference to how long that was.\"\nHe added: \"There was no immediate sign of foul play. Haven't ruled that out yet.\n\"This is an investigation, so we're keeping everything on the table.\"\nA sheriff's detective who responded to the scene said that they believed the couple had been dead for some time because of Ms Arakawa's \"decomposition\" and \"mummification\" in the hands and feet.\n\"The male decedent also showed obvious signs of death, similar and consistent with the female decedent,\" said the search warrant.\nNear Ms Arakawa's head was a portable heater, which the detective determined could have been brought down in the event that she abruptly fell to the ground.\nA prescription bottle and scattered pills were on the bathroom countertop close to her body. The couple's German Shepherd dog was found dead in a bathroom closet near to Ms Arakawa.\nHackman was discovered wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a blue long-sleeve T-shirt and brown slippers. Sunglasses and a walking cane were next to the body.\nThe detective suspected that the actor had fallen suddenly.\nThe circumstances of their death were \"suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation\", said the search warrant, because the person who called emergency services found the front door of the property open.\nBut the detective observed no sign of forced entry into the home. Nothing appeared out of place inside. Neither was there any indication that belongings had been rummaged through, or that any items had been removed.\nTwo other, healthy dogs were discovered roaming the property - one inside and one outside. \nThe couple's 2,300 sq ft ranch-style home, part of a gated community, was valued at around $1m, according to tax records.\nThe local utility responded and found no sign of a gas leak in the area. The fire department detected no indication of a carbon monoxide leak or poisoning, according to the search warrant.\nThe detective spoke at the scene to two maintenance workers, one of whom had called the emergency services.\nThe two workers said they sometimes conducted routine work at property, but rarely ever saw the couple.\nThey indicated that they communicated with them by phone and text, primarily with Ms Arakawa.\nThe two workers said they last had contact with the couple two weeks beforehand.\nA recording of the 911 call obtained by the BBC shows the emotional caller telling a dispatcher how he found the two bodies.\n\"No, they're not moving,\" he says in the audio. \"Just send somebody out here really quick.\"\nThe person, who made the call while standing outside the property and peering in through a window, is heard saying \"damn\" repeatedly. \nHackman met Ms Arakawa when she was working part-time at a California gym in the mid-1980s, the New York Times has previously reported.\nHe won the best actor Oscar for his role as Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in William Friedkin's 1971 thriller The French Connection, and another for best supporting actor for playing Little Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood's Western film Unforgiven in 1992.\nA relative latecomer to Hollywood, Hackman's breathrough came in his thirties, when he was nominated for an Oscar for portraying Buck Barrow in 1967's Bonnie and Clyde - opposite Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway - and again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970.\nBoth films saw him recognised in the supporting actor category. He was also nominated for best leading actor in 1988 for playing the FBI agent in Mississippi Burning.\nHe played more than 100 roles during his career, including supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s.\nHackman featured opposite many other Hollywood heavyweights including Al Pacino in 1973's Scarecrow and Gene Wilder in 1974's Young Frankenstein.\nHis last big-screen appearance came as Monroe Cole in Welcome to Mooseport in 2004, after which he stepped back from Hollywood for a quieter life in New Mexico.",

        "article_text": "As the new US president makes massive governmental cuts, issues tariffs and leads an immigration crackdown, domestic and international tourism faces unprecedented changes.\nIn the United States, a new presidential administration always comes with policy shifts. But the dizzying speed with which President Donald Trump has issued executive orders and made sweeping federal changes during the first month of his second term has much of the world wondering what the long-term impacts of these changes might be, and what else is yet to come.\nBy threatening and instituting tariffs on longtime allies, moving to overhaul the US immigration system, promising \"mass deportations\" and empowering unelected billionaire Elon Musk to fire thousands of federal employees and potentially shutter entire agencies established by Congress, Trump has come out swinging in his second act. And while these policy shifts are likely to have far-reaching social, political and economic implications, experts say they will also have a huge impact on the US travel industry.\u00a0\n\"From immigration rules to trade wars, these changes will make travel to and within the US a lot more complicated and way less appealing. It's like putting up a giant 'Do not enter' sign just as the world is getting back into full travel mode,\" said Kristin Winkaffe, founder of travel firm Winkaffe Global Travel. \"If you make it harder for people to get visas, fewer people will come \u2013 it's that simple.\"\nThis already appears to be playing out with the US's northerly neighbour. As Trump continues to threaten tariffs against Canada, even proposing annexing the entire nation, some Canadians have started boycotting US travel. The US Travel Association has warned that a 10% reduction in Canadian visits could result in more than $2bn in lost spending and 14,000 job losses.\nYet, the new administration remains confident that its policy shifts will benefit travellers. \"President Trump has entrusted this team to work tirelessly to reaffirm American's [sic] complete confidence in the safety of our transportation systems,\" newly appointed US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. \"Our focus remains on ushering in a golden age of transportation while prioritizing the Department's core mission of safety and delivering innovative projects that move America.\"\u00a0\nWhile the full scale of Trump's policy changes are yet to be seen, experts and travel professionals are keeping a close eye on the specific ways they may reshape travel. We spoke to some of them to find out how these impacts might affect domestic and international travellers.\nPerhaps no mode of travel has been more scrutinised in recent weeks than the aviation industry. In the past month, four fatal plane crashes in the US have led confidence in air travel to drop from 71% of Americans believing air travel is safe in January 2025, to 64% in February, according to a recent AP survey.\u00a0\nTrump's recent policy changes aren't likely to improve this number. Air traffic control staffing was already under pressure nationwide and has been indicated as the cause of near-misses. Yet, even after investigations into the recent crash in Washington DC that killed 67 passengers found that air traffic control staffing was not at normal levels, Trump's administration began firing hundreds of Federal Aviation Administration employees last week. He has also fired the heads of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Coast Guard, and disbanded the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, leaving some wondering if aviation safety would continue to be a federal priority.\nThe State Department also suspended all processing of passports with the X identity marker, leaving many non-binary Americans potentially cut off from international travel. More than 15 countries \u2013 including Australia, Canada, Colombia and India \u2013 allow citizens to amend their gender to non-binary or third gender, so it is yet to be determined how these visitors will be treated upon entry.\nIn addition, more than 200 TSA employees have been laid off so far, and many expect screening times \u2013 especially among international visitors \u2013 to go up. Some LGBTQ+ travellers, in particular, are concerned about how recent policy changes will affect air travel.\n\"States like Texas, which is a hub for two of the three major US carriers, are looking at enforcing bathroom use in all public buildings (including airports) along the lines of the binary sex you were assigned at birth,\" said Lindsey Danis, creator of outdoor travel blog Queer Adventurers. \"Trans people would have to choose between complying with a law that would force use of the bathroom that aligns with their former gender or breaking the law and possibly being targeted for being in the 'wrong bathroom'.\"\nWith Trump threatening to tariff Canadian oil starting in March, experts expect gas prices to rise as much as $0.15 per gallon, potentially putting a damper on holiday road trips. Some believe that the president's focus on increasing domestic oil and gas production may temper the effects of tariffs on domestic gas prices, but that may take longer to see at the pump.\nEven those with electric vehicles may have more trouble charging. Earlier this month, the Trump administration paused the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program, a clean energy initiative that had allocated billions of dollars for states to create electric car charging stations since 2021.\u00a0\nThose hoping to drive to or through one of the US's spectacular national parks may also face extra challenges. President Trump recently fired 1,000 national park workers, leaving many to suspect that the staffing shortages will result in maintenance issues, shorter visitor centre hours and fewer amenities for travellers. Yosemite National Park, for instance, has already delayed its summer campground reservations.\nSimilarly, federal funding for train travel seems to be an area that the Trump administration has eyed cutting. As part of recent spending freezes (some of which were temporarily rescinded recently), the US Department of Transportation is under scrutiny, in particular for its rail-related spending. Experts think this is likely to affect the $22bn in annual Amtrak funding, the development of high-speed rail corridors and intercity passenger rail service and grants for railroad safety programmes (which work to improve dangerous railroad crossings).\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Alabama museum grappling with the 'Gulf of America'\n\u2022 The only land disputed between the US and Canada\n\u2022 The Overseas Highway: The US's 'floating highway'\nIt's not that rail is universally under attack, but some suspect that Trump may be looking to further privatise the industry. \"Right now, there's a bigger push for private companies to take the lead in rail investment, which could bring fresh ideas and innovation but also raises questions about accessibility,\" said public policy advisor Justin Goldsberry. \"Will ticket prices rise? Will service improve, or become limited in certain areas?\"\nThe leisure and hospitality industry is one of the US economy's biggest sectors, employing more than 10% of the American workforce. But policy uncertainty hasn't been good for business, especially from international business travellers.\n\"The US is one of the largest markets for business events (especially exhibitions), and leading US shows rely on a solid share of international and overseas attendees,\" said Kai Hattendorf, CEO at the global business events company HTF and former CEO of UFI The Global Association of the Exhibition Industry. \"Policy uncertainty is disruptive for the sector, as event businesses crave predictability as they are planning years out, working with destinations and all actors from the travel and hospitality ecosystem.\"\nHe points to tech event CES in Las Vegas this past January when visitors from certain countries, including China, were down significantly. Hattendorf is noticing a growing number of events reportedly cancelled due to funding pulled from US government agencies and divisions as they enact new policies.\nOther experts expect that as Trump's immigration crackdown looms, restaurants, hotels and \u2013 by extension \u2013 travellers are likely to feel the effects.\n\"The hospitality industry, one of the largest employers of immigrant workers, will take a direct hit if work visas like the H-2B become more restricted,\" said Neri Karra Sillaman, entrepreneurship expert at the University of Oxford and author of the forthcoming book Pioneers: 8 Principles of Business Longevity from Immigrant Entrepreneurs. \"Post-pandemic labour shortages nearly brought the industry to its knees. If we see another round of restrictions, expect rising costs, declining service and economic losses in major travel hubs like New York, Miami and Los Angeles.\"\nPresident Trump's executive order focusing on \"foreign terrorists and other national security and public safety threats\" also put visas for foreign nationals in jeopardy. The order directs the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State to implement enhanced vetting for both visa applicants and those currently in the country in order \"to ensure that those aliens approved for admission into the United States do not intend to harm Americans or [its] national interests\".\nThis means delays for those applying for visas, and visa appointments are likely to be delayed or suspended. Legal experts suspect particular scrutiny of those from high-risk countries, and most suspect a similar travel ban as was enacted in 2017 to be enacted once more.\n\"For international travellers, heightened visa scrutiny and extended processing times could mean fewer visitors and billions in lost tourism revenue,\" said Sillaman. \"If the US makes itself a harder place to visit or do business, the rest of the world isn't going to wait. Other countries \u2013 Canada, the UK, Australia \u2013 are already rolling out policies to attract the talent that America risks turning away.\"\nThis could be especially problematic because the US is entering what policymakers are describing as a \"mega decade\" of sporting events. In 2026 the US will co-host the FIFA World Cup in 11 American cities, followed by the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028, the Men's Rugby World Cup in 2031, the Women's Rugby World Cup in 2033 and the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City in 2034. Yet, a recent report by the US Travel Association put it bluntly: \"We're not ready to host the upcoming mega decade of events that will draw millions of domestic and international travellers.\"\nAs US Travel Association CEO and president Geoff Freeman writes, slow visa processing times are the \"single biggest deterrent to visiting the US\". According to the State Department, wait times for visitor visas from certain nations such as Colombia can run up to 700 days, making it impossible for many travellers to attend next summer's FIFA World Cup. According to an Oxford Economics study cited in the report, if unaddressed, these days could result in a loss of nearly $19bn in spending in the next two years.\n\"America is staring at a historic opportunity,\" Freeman stated. \"The question is whether we will seize the moment or fall maddeningly short.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

I love the fans, I think they're brilliant, I go round clapping them after every game.\n\"But post-game the ex-players, recently retired and long retired, and people from years and years ago... I just can't believe how out of touch they are.\n\"The spiel that I'm reading from people saying how off it we are. We won two games on the bounce and you're upset about it, I don't get it.\"\nWorld Cup-winning centre Will Greenwood was one of those to attack England's style, describing their performance as a \"tough watch\" and \"infuriating\", while claiming the team are playing \"so much within themselves\".\n\"For all of that the England players can say 'stuff off old geezer, we are two from three, we are up to 10 points and Ireland are only on 14',\" he added presciently., external\nFormer Ireland and British and Irish Lions captain Brian O'Driscoll was also unimpressed.\n\"I just don't get it, I don't know why there isn't a cohesion,\" he told ITV Sport., external\n\"It is stodgy, it is kick tennis, it is quite negative and it is fine to eke out one-point victories, but when those games go against you - which they will at times - you are going to get huge negative feedback.\"\nScotland were ahead of England in a raft of attacking stats, such as metres made and line breaks, while France, who also lost by a point at Allianz Stadium in the previous round, butchered several try-scoring chances.\nHowever, Genge insists England should be judged by results that leave them in touch with the top of the table with two games to play.\n\"It's like you're damned if you do, damned if you don't,\" he added.\n\"In the last 18 months, every time we've lost by a point we've been slandered, and on the weekend we win by a point and it's the same old story.\n\"Do you want to be part of a team that wins every single game by one point? \n\"Or would you rather be part of a team that loses every single week, 40 points to 39? \n\"I know what type of team I want to be.\"\nEngland take on Italy next on Sunday, 9 March. They have beaten the Azzurri in all 31 of the teams' previous meetings, but the visitors were only three points better in Rome last year.\nGenge says he and his team-mates are preparing for another tough encounter, despite Italy conceding 11 tries in a 73-24 defeat by France last time out.\n\"They beat Wales in Wales, they took a few scalps, so I don't think they're a team that people think is a guaranteed win anymore,\" said the Bristol prop.\nThis video can not be played\nScotland miss late kick to win as England hold on to win Calcutta Cup",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'I accept what I did was awful' - 'Steve'\nWarning: this article contains offensive language\nSteve was leaving the football ground when he shouted back at some away fans. Moments later he was in handcuffs and under arrest.\nHe had shouted a homophobic slur, committing a hate crime that led to him being charged with a Section 5 Public Order offence. The case ended up in court, where he pleaded guilty, and he was banned from attending football matches in the UK for three years.\nNow Steve - not his real name as he fears for the impact on his professional and personal life - is trying to make amends after coming through a fan education programme run by anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out.\nHere he shares his story with BBC Sport.\nA lifelong football fan, Steve had just watched his side play Chelsea and was leaving the stadium.\n\"I heard Chelsea fans shouting and I shouted back, 'Oi, you Chelsea rent boys', gave them a few gestures and thought nothing of it.  I thought I was just having a bit of back and forth with the away fans,\" he said.\nWhat followed is all a bit of a blur.\n\"I walked away and then all of a sudden I was surrounded by six security guards. And then from that point, a police officer arrested me and put the cuffs on.\"\nSince January 2022, the Crown Prosecution Service has defined the \"Chelsea rent boy\" chant - aimed at the west London club's players and supporters - as a homophobic slur and says that anyone singing it is committing a hate crime and could face prosecution.\n\"I'm in my 20s and I didn't really understand that [term],\" Steve said. \"I knew there was stuff around it, but I didn't really perceive why it was homophobic.\"\nSteve was eventually referred to Kick It Out, which runs a fan education programme where offenders learn about the different types of discrimination and the impact their actions can have on victims.\n\"I accept that [what I did] was awful, and now it's about repaying that, turning that into something positive. I've had a look at myself... I'm willing to make amends,\" he said.\n\"People are going to make mistakes, but you're judged on how you then move forward.\"\nHe said the session had changed him \"massively\".\n\"It's made me aware of how there's a fine line between what's considered banter and just abuse.\"\nThe Kick It Out course is run by Alan Bush, the charity's fan education and engagement manager, who has delivered more than 400 sessions in the past five years. In that time, 40 fans were referred to him by either police or clubs for using the Chelsea slur.\n\"We can't ban our way out of discrimination and we can't just ban football fans from football. All we do is we push it back into society,\" Bush said.\n\"Football has a responsibility to educate its fans... then fans say to other fans  'you can't say that, mate,  you'll end up in court' or 'you can't say that because that's wrong'. There's a chance they report, there's a chance that they challenge. And I just think that has to be a far better than just banning people.\"\nHe added that \"the vast majority have not understood the gravity of how offensive that [chant] can be, how that can cause harassment, alarm and distress to an individual\".\nTo illustrate his point, Bush tells the offenders the story of Lee Johnson, a passionate Tottenham fan who was forced out of football for nearly a decade after hearing the Chelsea chant inside White Hart Lane as a teenager.\n\"It completely shook me to my core,\" Johnson - who is now co-chair of the Proud Lilywhites, the LGBTQ+ supporters' association of Tottenham Hotspur - told BBC Sport. \n\"It felt like all of the lights had gone out and I was just isolated by myself. It just took me straight back to when I was younger at school. 'Rent boy' was one of the things I used to get [called].\"\nJohnson had often been a target for abuse in his home town. Football used to be an escape, somewhere he could \"get lost in the magic of the game\" but hearing homophobic chanting made him question everything.\n\"I was thinking 'Am I safe here?' If people around me knew that I was gay, would they be attacking me or be verbally abusive? Would they stop singing it about Chelsea and would they start singing it about me?\" he said.\n\"People were using a term that has caused a lot of harm to me over the years. It's very traumatic. I think it was still the first half and I just said to my friend, 'I can't be here'. It was a fight or flight response. I left and I didn't come back for nearly 10 years.\"\nSince 2023, the Football Association has also been able to charge clubs if their fans sing the chant.\nSeven charges have been brought against six clubs for homophobic chanting, according to English football's governing body. The clubs, which include Wolves, Leeds and Luton have been fined a total of \u00a3415,000.\nTwo charges raised against Tottenham Hotspur following their Premier League match with Manchester United on 29 September 2024 are yet to be decided.\nThe updated FA guidance, combined with the change in law, appears to be having the desired effect.\nFigures from Kick it Out show reports of mass homophobic chanting are falling, with 17 reported incidents last season, down from 43 in the 2021-22 season.\nSteve knows he has been part of the problem.\nHe has never considered himself homophobic but since he got arrested he has been through a spectrum of emotions.\n\"Fear. Annoyance. Despair. Guilt. But then came acceptance,\" he said.\n\"My journey has sort of been about personal growth. Now I want to make a difference going forward. I want to make football a better place.\"\nHe wants to make sure other do not repeat his mistakes, adding: \"Treat everybody with respect or you'll end up like me with a ban and a criminal record.\n\"Some people who are gay have walked away from football altogether and don't feel it's safe. So, if I can just stop one person from doing that. I'll be happy. Just think before you speak.\"",

        "article_text": "Great Britain toured Australia in 1996\nEngland v Australia: Women's Test\nVenue: Allegiant Stadium, Las Vegas Date: Saturday, 1 March (02:00 GMT, Sunday, 2 March)\nCoverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app\nLisa McIntosh is up-front with her thoughts on England's women facing world champions Australia in Las Vegas.\n\"Do you know? It makes me feel really proud,\" says the former Great Britain captain. \"But I'm not going to lie - I'm a bit envious.\n\"I'd have loved to have just turned up with my kitbag and got on the plane and played in Vegas. But I'm made up for them.\"\nWhen England's players step out at Allegiant Stadium in Vegas on Saturday night, McIntosh is part of the trailblazing group of women they can thank.\nTwenty-nine years ago, with minimal help, that group organised and self-funded a Great Britain tour to Australia - and beat the hosts. They remain the last British rugby league team to win an Ashes series.\nSo they know what it takes to defeat the Jillaroos.\n\"I think what England need to do is not fear them,\" McIntosh says. \"Australia are so good, that straight away people start to worry.\n\"But you go out there and you be confident. If you match them player for player, there's no reason why you can't beat them.\"\nBack in 1996, Great Britain's travelling party overcame the odds to defeat Australia.\nA series that was on a knife edge until its final seconds featured funding battles, scrambles for flights and accommodation, a tour manager carrying \u00a329,000 in a briefcase, disappearing kit and emotional phone calls home.\nThen came the forging of lifelong friendships, belated Hall of Fame recognition - and a victory shield that vanished.\nBut first came the fight just to get on to the pitch.\nPaula Clark was the team physio, Nikki Carter the tour manager, and Jackie Sheldon the assistant coach\n\"It was basically about two weeks before we were due to go that we actually knew we were going,\" says Jackie Sheldon, Great Britain's assistant coach in 1996.\nSheldon was secretary of the Women's Amateur Rugby League Association (Warla), which then oversaw the British women's game, when it received an invitation in 1995 to tour Australia.\nAccepting the offer was the easy part. Then came the trickier aspects. For a start, there wasn't a Great Britain women's team.\nSo with Warla chair Anne Thompson, Sheldon set up a committee to hire a head coach, find players and form a backroom team. With no budget, everyone had to be persuaded to take on the roles unpaid.\n\"These people who got involved were professional people,\" Sheldon says. \"And they were all giving their time for free.\n\"I would go: 'This is what I want, and I haven't got any money. Will you come on board?' And they'd say: 'Yeah.' Because they believed in what we were trying to do.\"\nIan Harris, a coach who worked in local authority sports development, took charge of the team, with Sheldon and Thompson as his assistants, and a squad of 26 was put together. Now they had to find \u00a370,000 to pay for the tour.\nSheldon, herself then a council sports development officer, got to work. \"We were not funded by anywhere,\" she says, \"so I wrote a grant application to the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, and we got something like \u00a334,000 from them. And each of the players were given a target of about \u00a31,000 to raise.\"\nAs the summer of 1996 approached, the plans were coming together.\nThen with just weeks to go, the team's tour manager dropped out - and chaos loomed.\nSheldon and Thompson knew Nikki Carter, a Hull Vixens player who had management experience from working at a care home. They asked if she would step in as tour manager.\n\"I was asked: 'Do you think you could help them out?'\" Carter says.\n\"I was like: 'What do you mean?' They said: 'Go to Australia with them.' I was like: 'Hmm, I'd love to. Best go and ask my boss, really.'\n\"But it suddenly started to unravel. Lots of things that should have been organised 12 weeks out from going to Australia weren't actually organised.\"\nThe touring party had no flights, no accommodation, no kit.\nSheldon says: \"The previous manager, prior to Nikki, had been tasked with securing the flights, and he didn't secure them and didn't tell us, so it was only about three weeks beforehand that it all came out that we had no flights.\n\"My manager allowed me time in work to phone all the airlines to try to get, I think, 32 flights at three weeks' notice.\"\nAs Sheldon sorted flights, Carter sourced kit, chased hotels and helped to complete the fundraising. \"Most of the money was raised in the final eight weeks,\" she says. They needed to set up a bank account quickly for the tour. And in 1996, that was a problem.\n\"There was no bank account set up in Australia,\" Carter says, \"and it wasn't like now, where you could ring the bank and say: 'I'm going to put this money in there and I'm going to spend it from my bank account.'\n\"One of the girls on the tour, who played for Wakefield, was a bank manager. And she said: 'It's not possible to set the bank account up. It took too long.'\n\"So I ended up going to Australia with a briefcase with \u00a329,000 in cash and travellers' cheques, because there just was no other way. I carried that briefcase through the whole tour - everywhere I went, that went.\"\nThe Great Britain party made it to Australia, but there were more obstacles. Arriving at Sydney Airport, they were hit with an immediate transport problem. Their coach was only big enough to fit either all the players, or all the kit - but not both. Carter, meanwhile, was organising team meals on the fly.\n\"I think there was a lot of bartering,\" captain McIntosh says, \"trying to get good deals, where we'd get breakfast and tea included.\"\nThe team faced seven matches in 19 days: a Sydney Select side were thumped 86-0, before an Australian Capital Territory side were defeated 36-0 in Canberra, where the first Test against Australia was also held.\nGreat Britain lost that match 16-14, to a late penalty - amid controversy.\n\"We got a penalty in the last few minutes,\" McIntosh says. \"Karen Burrows converted it, but the officials disallowed it - they said it didn't go over.\"\nNext was a trip north to Brisbane, with the team booked in for an exhausting 12-hour, 700-mile-plus coach journey. Tour manager Carter intervened.\n\"We'd gone on the coach from Sydney to Canberra, but we needed to fly to Brisbane,\" Carter says.\n\"So we went to the airport and I said: 'Would you be able to get us 32 flight tickets from Canberra to Brisbane tomorrow?' And the guy at the desk looked at me a bit strange. He tapped away and he said: 'Oh, yeah, yeah, we could do that.' Then I had to negotiate on all the luggage.\n\"And then I said to him: 'OK. How would I pay: Cash or travellers' cheques?' And this guy's face was a picture. So I paid for 32 flights with some travellers' cheques.\"\nIn Brisbane, the Great Britain and Australia players stayed in the same accommodation. \"They were like student dorms,\" McIntosh says.\nHere, there was another challenge for the tourists - keeping track of their kit.\n\"We were given each two shirts, so at the end of the tour, we had one to swap and one to keep so we could frame,\" McIntosh says. \"But the kit was laundered and a couple of shirts from our bag went missing, including my spare number 13 shirt.\n\"We never found out what happened to it, but we had our suspicions.\"\nBritain beat a Queensland XIII 22-8 to warm up for the second Test against Australia, and they won that key match 18-12 to level the series. Now it was back to Sydney for the decider.\nBut for some members of the squad with young children, being far away from home was proving tough.\n\"I rang home at certain times of the day because I knew the kids wouldn't be there,\" Carter says. \"My eldest daughter was six when I went. If I rang home, she would be crying down the phone, saying: 'I'm missing you, Mummy.' And it would then take days to recover from that phone call.\n\"There was that pang of guilt because I'm out here and I'm having a great time. At the same time, I've left my children at home - and as a mother, is that the right thing?\n\"It was hard and anybody in that position who says it wasn't, I think will be telling you porky pies.\"\nGreat Britain's team of 1996 are the only northern hemisphere women's side to have beaten Australia in a three-Test series\nAfter a 30-0 victory over a Presidents XIII in Sydney, Great Britain faced the deciding Test against Australia. It was a nail-biter.\nThe tourists built up a healthy lead, with McIntosh running half the length of the pitch for a fine individual try - but had to withstand a battering as Australia fought back. As the clock ticked down, Britain held a slender 20-18 lead.\n\"We were defending on our line for our lives for the last 10 minutes,\" McIntosh says. \"It just never seemed to end.\"\nThe captain has little memory of watching those closing minutes, having been concussed in a clattering tackle.\n\"When the final whistle went,\" McIntosh says, \"I said to Paula Clark, the team physio: Have we won?\n\"We didn't realise how significant it would be in time - winning the Ashes in Australia. It was just like: 'We beat the Aussies on their own turf and it was great.'\"\nLisa McIntosh and vice-captain Brenda Dobek would be later inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame\nThe Britain squad returned to a quiet reception at Heathrow. \"We came through the airport and it was like tumbleweed,\" McIntosh says.\nBut off the back of the series win, Sheldon convinced Sport England to fund a national women's rugby league development manager and was asked to take on the role. She would also be England's head coach through a 1998 tour to New Zealand, the World Cups of 2000 and 2003 and, in between, a return tour to Australia in 2002.\n\"The development dropped off after 2003, when I left,\" Sheldon says. \"GB was not a priority for the RFL at the time. It was re-established in 2007 when they started getting Sport England funding for it, but neither England nor GB have beaten Australia since 2002.\n\"You can see the difference in terms of what Australia started to do after that period.\n\"It's physicality, building the team, intensity of competition, and development of the women's game, so you've got breadth and depth of players coming through. It's an infrastructure you need, and you can see it in Australia.\"\nBelatedly, Great Britain's 1996 team have been recognised. Former referee Julia Lee, who officiated during the tour, began driving the Women in Rugby League project, a celebration of the sport's female pioneers.\nIn 2022, McIntosh joined team-mates Brenda Dobek and Sally Milburn as they became the first women inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame.\nLast October, Jane Banks and Michelle Land followed, while the 1996 side became the first team to be inducted.\n\"I think it's sad that it took so long, but I think it's fantastic that we're in a different place now,\" Carter says.\nOctober's ceremony in Wigan brought virtually the entire squad back together.\n\"There was a camaraderie that was built in '96,\" Carter says. \"We all met up for the Hall of Fame inauguration, and it was like we'd never been away from each other.\"\nGreat Britain's players made long-lasting friendships with the Australians too - which finally reunited McIntosh with one of her shirts.\n\"I never found the shirt that was taken during the tour, but I did get back the one that I swapped,\" McIntosh says. \"Their captain, who I swapped my shirt with, returned it to me.\"\nBut there's one major memento from 1996 that no-one can find.\nGreat Britain's team, mostly in Australia shirts, show off the shield that later went missing\nBritain's players, wearing the Australia shirts they had just swapped, posed for a team picture after winning the series.\nIn that special moment, they showed off their prize - a large shield.\nThree years ago, before an exhibition to celebrate their achievements, an appeal was put out to locate the shield. It hasn't turned up.\n\"We thought we'd brought it back, and that it was at the RFL,\" McIntosh says. \"But it's not.\"\nThe mystery remains unresolved. \"Lisa always said she reckoned I had it in my attic,\" Sheldon says. \"I've got just about everything else in my attic but not that shield.\"\nIf anyone does have it, they're sitting on a piece of history. \n\"It's in somebody's attic, because I can't see where else it would have gone,\" Carter says. \"So maybe everyone needs to look in their attic!\"",

        "article_text": "UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has met US President Donald Trump during his first visit to the White House. \nHere are some of the key moments as the pair took questions from reporters before and after the talks. \nSir Keir did not turn up to the meeting empty-handed. \nPart way through their opening remarks, the prime minister reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles III - an invitation for a second state visit.\nTrump appeared to be genuinely taken back for a few seconds, asking: \"Am I supposed to read it right now?\"\nAfter taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an \"honour\" to visit the \"fantastic\" country.\nHe added that King Charles was a \"beautiful man, a wonderful man\".\nDuring Trump's first term as president, he met King Charles's mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, during a three-day state visit in 2019.\nSir Keir said Thursday's invitation to host Trump once more for a second full state visit was \"unprecedented\".\nWhile cordial, the initial meeting in the Oval Office between Sir Keir and Trump left no doubt that the US president hoped to be firmly in charge.\nThe meeting was a pattern we've now seen six times with foreign leaders at the Trump White House, including with French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this week: Trump taking control of the room and using the opportunity to get his own messages, both domestic and international, across to the reporters there.\nDuring their half-hour session, Trump leaned forward and slightly towards Sir Keir - wearing a nearly identical, but slightly different coloured tie to Trump's -  dominating the conversation and taking charge of calling on reporters.\nA joint afternoon news conference later began with a slightly more diplomatic and matter-of-fact tone, with both Trump and Sir Keir standing at their respective lecterns and going to considerable lengths to lavish praise on the other. \nTrump joked he would have been president 20 years ago with Sir Keir's \"beautiful\" accent. \nAt one point, Sir Keir was asked about Trump's controversial call to make Canada \u2013 a member of the Commonwealth \u2013 the 51st state of the US.\n\"I think you're trying to find a divide that doesn't exist,\" Sir Keir replied.\nTrump interjected quickly with the words \"that's enough\" before moving on \u2013 again taking control of the room as he stood next to a visibly surprised Sir Keir.\nTo put it gently, Sir Keir and Trump are from different schools of politics - both in their style and substance.\nBut asked to name their similarities Trump said: \"He loves his country, and so do I.\"\nWhat else do they share? Trump said \"we like each other, frankly, and we like each other's country\".\nBut the \"common thread\" between the two men was that \"we love our country\", Trump said.\nSir Keir had a number of tricky topics to raise with Trump - from trade to US security guarantees for Ukraine - and at the beginning of their news conference he called his counterpart \"a very tough negotiator\". \nAsked if the prime minister had convinced him not to impose trade tariffs on the UK, Trump said \"he tried\", adding: \"He was working hard, I'll tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.\"\nBut he has said there was \"a very good chance\" of a trade deal \"where tariffs wouldn't be necessary\". \nSuch a deal, Trump said, could be made \"pretty quickly\". \nSir Keir spoke of a \"new economic deal with advanced technology at its core\". \nTrump said he was \"inclined to go along with\" the UK's Chagos Islands deal.\nThe UK is in talks with Mauritius about handing over the territory but continuing to lease one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which contains a UK-US military airbase.\nThe agreement has been mired in uncertainty after Trump's re-election as US president, given several US Republicans have argued it could deliver a potential security boost to China.\nBut during the meeting, Trump said he had a \"feeling\" the deal was going to \"work out very well\".\nLast week, Trump made headlines by calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a \"dictator\" in a social media post, echoing Russian claims about Kyiv's cancelled elections.\nAn election was scheduled for May 2024, but it was suspended because Ukraine has been under martial law since Russia began its full-scale invasion.\nAsked by the BBC's Chris Mason about his use of the word \"dictator\", Trump replied: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that.\"\nIn the news conference later, Trump also appeared to have softened his attitude to Zelensky, praising him as \"very brave\" and saying the pair got on \"really well\". \nTalking about the potential for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, Trump said \"progress towards peace\" would continue when Zelensky visits the White House on Friday. The two are expected to sign a major minerals deal.\nAt the Munich Security Conference last week, US Vice President JD Vance attacked the UK and other European democracies, warning that \"free speech is in retreat.\"\nAsked about the comments, Trump called on his deputy to defend himself. Vance argued \"there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British\" but also \"American technology companies and by extension, American citizens\".\nThat led to Sir Kier cutting in, saying \"we've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom - and it will last for a very, very long time\".\nHe rejected Vance's claim, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there\".",

        "article_text": "\"I swear to God I need help,\" said the man quietly on the other end of the line.\nThe Ethiopian, who calls himself Mike, said he is being held with 450 others in a building inside Myanmar, along the country's border with Thailand.\nThey are among the thousands of people who have been freed from the notorious scam compounds that have thrived on the border for years, in what appears to be the toughest action so far against the industry along the Thai-Myanmar border.\nBut many of them are now stranded in Myanmar in makeshift camps because the process of assessing them and arranging flights back to their own countries is so slow. \nThe armed militia groups who are holding them have a very limited capacity to support so many people \u2013 more than 7,000. One of them has said they have stopped freeing people from the compounds because they are not being moved to Thailand fast enough.\nThe BBC understands that conditions in the camps are unsanitary, food barely sufficient, and many of the freed workers, like Mike, are in poor health. He is suffering from panic attacks, after working for a year in a scam centre where he was routinely beaten.\nHe told us they got two very basic meals a day, there were only two toilets for 450 people, who he said were now relieving themselves wherever they could.\nMike described being invited a year ago to take up what he was promised would be a good job, in Thailand, requiring only good English language and typing skills.\nInstead he found himself subjected to a brutal regime, forced to work long hours every day to meet the target for defrauding people online set by his Chinese bosses.\n\"It was the worst experience of my life. Of course I was beaten. But believe me I have seen a lot worse done to other people.\"\nMike is one of an estimated 100,000 people who are believed to have been lured to work in the scam operations along the Thai-Myanmar border, most of them run by Chinese fraud and gambling operatives who have taken advantage of the lawlessness in this part of Myanmar. \nDespite horrifying accounts of abuse from those who escaped in the past, thousands still come from parts of the world where good jobs are scarce, enticed by promises of good money.\nChina, where many of the scam victims come from, has acted to shut down scam operations along its own border with Myanmar, but until this year neither China nor Thailand had done much about the Thai-Myanmar border.\nAriyan, a young man from Bangladesh, has come back to Thailand to try to help 17 friends who are still there. He said he made a promise to himself to do this after his own gruelling escape from one of the most notorious scam centres last October.\nHe showed us a brief, shaky video of the compound, still under construction in a remote, forested valley, where he was held, and remembers the terrible treatment he and his friends suffered at the hands of their Chinese boss.\n\"They gave us a target every week, $5,000. If not, they gave us two electric shocks. Or they put us in a dark room, with no windows. But if we earned a lot of money, they were very happy with us.\"\nAriyan had to approach men in the Middle East and lure them into transferring funds to fictitious investments. Using AI, the scammers made him appear on the screen to be an attractive young woman, altering his voice as well. \nHe says he hated doing it. He remembers one man who was willing to sell his wife's jewellery to fund the fraudulent investment, and wishing he could warn him. But he said the bosses monitored all their calls.\nThe release of the scam workers started more than two weeks ago after Thailand, under pressure from China and some of its own politicians, cut power and telecommunications links to the compounds on the border. \nIt limited banking access to the scam bosses and issued arrest warrants for some of the militia leaders who had been protecting the business.\nThat hit the business, but it also hit the ordinary Karen people who live nearby even harder, putting pressure on the militia commanders to show willingness in ending the abuses in the scam centres. They began helping those trying to escape, and completely evacuating some compounds.\nThe camp Mike is housed in is now being guarded by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, a breakaway insurgent faction of the ethnic Karen community. \nUntil recently, it was protecting the many scam compounds which have sprung up in its territory. You can see them easily as you drive along the Moei River which divides the two countries - unlikely expanses of new buildings over in war-torn Karen State contrasting with the rural landscape on the Thai side of the border.\nThailand insists it is moving as fast as it can to process the former scam workers and get them home. \nA group of 260 freed workers were brought over the Moei River on a raft earlier this month. And around 621 Chinese nationals were flown straight back to China with a police escort on chartered planes. Otherwise, the movement of freed workers to Thailand seems to have stalled.\nThe problem is that they are from many different countries, some of which are doing little to help get their people home. Around 130 of the first 260 who came over are from Ethiopia, which does not have an embassy in Bangkok. \nThe BBC has been told that some other African countries will only fly their people home if someone else pays. Most of the freed workers have nothing; even their passports were withheld by the compound bosses.\nThailand fears bringing over thousands of people it will then have to look after indefinitely. It also wants to screen them to find out which are genuine victims of human trafficking and which may have committed criminal acts, but does not have the capacity to do this with such a large group of people.\nDifferent ministries and agencies, including the army, are involved in managing this problem, and have to agree who does what. It does not help that several senior police and immigration officers have been transferred over their alleged involvement in the scam business.\n\"If this issue is not resolved, then we will not stop working on it \u2013 we must work seriously,\" said Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday in Bangkok. But she was referring to the wider problem of the scam business, not the growing humanitarian crisis among the freed workers.\n\"Unfortunately, it seems we're in a bit of a standstill,\" says Judah Tana, an Australian who runs an NGO which has for years been helping the victims of trafficking in the scam centres.\n\"We are hearing distressing information about the lack of sanitation and toilets. Many of the 260 who already came were screened for TB and tested positive. We are hearing from those who are still inside that people are coughing up blood. They are very happy that they have been liberated from the scam compounds, but our worry is that we're not engaging fast enough.\"\nThailand now seems ready to bring over one group of 94 Indonesians, as their embassy has been pushing for their release for several days and has booked flights to Indonesia for them.\nBut that still leaves more than 7,000 still inside Myanmar, unsure what will now happen to them.\nMike told me he and many others with him feared that if they are not allowed to cross into Thailand soon, the DKBA may hand them back to the scam bosses, where they could face punishment for trying to leave. \nOn Wednesday night his panic attacks and breathing were so bad, he said, they took him to hospital.\n\"I just want to go home,\" he said over the phone. \"I just want to go back to my country. That is all I am asking.\"",

The one step they could go further... is to really say, 'Yes it's our values, we believe it's the right thing to do, but it's also an economic imperative.\"\nThe fight over DEI in the US has raised questions about whether such policies in other countries will face similar challenges. \nCatherine Howarth, chief executive of the responsible investment charity ShareAction, said she thought that Apple - a global, consumer-facing firm - had made the bet that the benefits of pushing back against the shareholder proposal outweighed the risks. \n\"It's not popular with consumers and it's not popular with employees to abandon what were supposedly your principles in this area until very recently,\" she said.\n\"They think it would go down very badly - and it would - with their global consumer base.\"\nShareholders also rejected proposals that would have required Apple to report about its AI privacy practices, charitable giving and policies to combat child sex abuse. \nThey backed the board members supported by the company, as well as its executive compensation, including a pay package for Mr Cook worth more than $74m.

        "article_text": "Don't insult the leaders. Don't insult the ideology. And don't judge.\nThese are the rules tour guides read out to Western tourists as they prepare to drive across the border into North Korea, arguably the most secretive and repressive country in the world.\nThen there is the practical information. No phone signal, no internet, no cash machines.\n\"The North Koreans aren't robots. They have opinions, goals, and a sense of humour. And in our briefing we encourage people to listen to and understand them,\" says Rowan Beard, who runs Young Pioneer Tours, one of two Western companies which resumed trips to the country last week, after a five-year hiatus.\nNorth Korea sealed its borders at the outset of the pandemic, shutting out diplomats, aid workers and travellers, and making it nearly impossible to know what was happening there.\nSince then, it has further isolated itself from most of the world, relying on support from Russia and China. Many doubted whether Westerners would ever be allowed back.\nBut after years of cajoling and several false starts, Rowan and some other tour leaders were given the green light to restart operations. He pulled together a group of eager travellers in just five hours, desperate to not miss the opportunity. Most were vloggers and travel addicts, some wanting to tick the final country off their list, along with the odd North Korea enthusiast.\nLast Thursday the tourists, from the UK, France, Germany and Australia, drove over the border from China into the remote area of Rason for a four-night trip.\nAmong them was 28-year-old British YouTuber Mike O'Kennedy. Even with its reputation, he was startled by the extreme level of control. As with all trips to North Korea, the tourists were escorted by local guides, who followed a strict, pre-approved schedule. It included carefully choreographed trips to a beer factory, a school, and a new, fully stocked pharmacy.\nBen Weston, one of the tour leaders from Suffolk, likened visiting North Korea to \"being on a school trip\". \"You can't leave the hotel without the guides,\" he said.\n\"A couple of times I even had to let them know when I wanted to use the bathroom,\" said Mike. \"I've never had to do that anywhere in the world.\"\nDespite the chaperoning, Mike was able to spot snippets of real life. \"Everyone was working, it didn't feel like anyone was just hanging out. That was kind of bleak to see.\"\nOn his trip to the school, a group of eight-year-olds performed a dance to animations of ballistic missiles hitting targets. A video of the spectacle shows girls and boys with red neckties, singing, while explosions flare on a screen behind them.\nFor now, tourists are being kept well away from the capital Pyongyang. Greg Vaczi from Koryo Tours, the other tour company allowed back in, admits the current itinerary lacks the \"big-hitting monuments\" of Pyongyang. He suspects authorities have chosen Rason as their guinea pig because the area is relatively contained and easy to control.\nSet up as a special economic zone, to trial new financial policies, it operates as a mini capitalist enclave inside an otherwise socialist state. Chinese businesspeople run joint enterprises with North Koreans, and can travel in and out fairly freely.\nJoe Smith, a seasoned North Korea traveller and former writer for the specialist North Korea platform NK News, was there on his third trip. \"I feel like the more times you visit the less you know. Each time you get a little peek behind the curtain, which just leaves you with more questions,\" he said.\nJoe's highlight was a surprise off-agenda visit to a luxury goods market, where people were selling jeans and perfumes, along with fake Louis Vuitton handbags and Japanese washing machines, probably imported from China. Here, the tourists were not allowed to take photos - an attempt to hide this consumer bubble from the rest of the country, they suspected.\n\"This was the only place people weren't expecting us,\" Joe said. \"It felt messy and real; a place North Koreans actually go. I loved it.\"\nBut according to the experienced tour leaders, the group's movements were more restricted than on previous trips, with fewer opportunities to wander the streets, pop into a barbershop or supermarket, and talk to locals.\nCovid was often cited as the reason, said Greg from Koryo Tours. \"On the surface they are still concerned. Our luggage was disinfected at the border, our temperatures were taken, and about 50% of people are still wearing masks.\" Greg cannot work out whether the fear is genuine, or an excuse to control people.\nIt is thought Covid hit North Korea hard, though it is difficult to know the extent of the suffering.\nLocal guides repeated the government line that the virus entered the country in a balloon sent over from South Korea, and was swiftly eradicated in 90 days. But Rowan, who has been to North Korea more than 100 times, sensed that Rason had been impacted by the tough Covid regulations. A lot of Chinese businesses had closed, he said, and their workers had left.\nEven Joe, the experienced North Korea traveller, commented on how dilapidated the buildings were. \"Places were dimly lit and there was no heating, apart from in our hotel rooms,\" he said, noting a trip to a cold, dark and deserted art gallery. \"It felt like they opened the doors just for us.\"\nThe regime's photographs might make North Korea look clean and shiny, Joe said, but in person you realise \"the roads are awful, the pavements are wobbly, and the buildings are weirdly constructed\".  His hotel room was old-fashioned and filthy, he said, resembling \"his grandma's living room\". The whole window was cracked.\n\"They've had five years to fix things. North Koreans are so sensitive about what they show tourists. If this is the best they can show, I dread to think what else is out there\", he said. Most of the country is kept well hidden, with more than four in 10 people believed to be undernourished and needing help.\nOne of the few chances tourists in North Korea get to interact with local people is through their guides, who sometimes speak English. On these recent trips they were surprisingly well-informed, despite the regime's intense propaganda machine and information blockade. This is probably because they speak to the Chinese businesspeople who come and go, said Greg.\nThey knew about Trump's tariffs and the war in Ukraine - even that North Korean troops were involved. But when Joe showed a photo from Syria, his guide was unaware President Assad had been toppled. \"I carefully explained that sometimes when people don't like their leader, they rise up and force them out, and at first he didn't believe me.\"\nSuch conversations need to be delicately handled. Strict laws prevent North Koreans from speaking freely. Ask or reveal too much and the tourists might put their guide or themselves at risk.\nMike admits there were times this made him nervous. On a trip to a North Korea-Russia Friendship House, he was invited to write in the visitors' book. \"I went blank and wrote something like 'I wish the world peace.' Afterwards my guide told me that was an inappropriate thing to write. That made me paranoid,\" he said.\n\"Generally, the guides did a great job of making us feel safe. There were just a couple of moments when I thought, this is bizarre.\"\nFor Greg from Koryo Tours, these interactions bring a deeper purpose to North Korea tourism: \"North Koreans get the chance to engage with foreigners. This allows them to come up with new ideas, which, in a country this closed, is so important.\"\nBut tourism to North Korea is contentious, especially as travellers have been allowed back before aid workers and most Western diplomats, including the UK's. Critics, including Joanna Hosaniak from the Citizens Alliance for North Korean Human Rights, argue these trips mainly benefit the regime.\n\"This is not like tourism in other poor countries, where local people benefit from the extra income. The vast majority of the population don't know these tourists exist. Their money goes to the state and ultimately towards its military,\" she said.\nOne conversation has stuck in YouTuber Mike's head. During his trip to the school, he was surprised when a girl, after meeting him, said she hoped to visit the UK one day. \"I didn't have the heart to tell her that her chances were very, very slim,\" he said.",

Almost all of the cases - 101 - were in patients aged 17 and younger.\nThe US declared that measles had been \"eliminated\" in 2000, but the country has seen outbreaks in recent years amid a rise in anti-vaccine sentiment. The last US measles death was in 2015, according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\nThe current outbreak is centred in north-west Texas, with measles also recently found across the state's border in New Mexico, as well as Alaska, California, Georgia, New Jersey, New York City and Rhode Island, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).\nCurrently, there are nine cases reported in New Mexico, four of whom are children.\nKennedy, a vaccine sceptic in the past, said that measles outbreaks were common and there have been four measles outbreaks so far in the US this year.

Kennedy said altogether 20 people were in hospital to quarantine.\nFive people in Texas who were infected had been vaccinated, the department also said. \nNew Mexico's congressional delegation has pushed Kennedy to urgently address the current outbreak, urging him to \"launch a vaccination promotion campaign\" and rehire recently fired federal health workers, among other measures,  in a letter on Monday.\n\"Just last Friday, two dozen employees at the CDC charged with training public laboratory staffers and supporting outbreak response efforts were fired,\" the state's two senators and three House members, all Democrats, wrote. \n\"Those firings will worsen outbreaks and ultimately threaten the health of all Americans in the face of the next public health emergency.\" \nMeanwhile, areas affected by the outbreak are hosting free vaccination clinics, with the city of Lubbock, where the child victim died, holding hours-long clinics each day this week.\nThe Texas outbreak is believed to have started in a rural Mennonite community with low vaccination rates, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, and local media.\nMost US children receive two immunisation shots to protect against the illness, which together are 97% effective in protecting against measles, according to the CDC.\nVaccination rates in Texas are 94.3%, according to the CDC, which is below the 95% level that the Infectious Diseases Society of America says is needed to also protect those who are not immunized, commonly called \"herd immunity\".\n\"Measles was rare in the United States, but outbreaks are occurring in areas where vaccination rates have fallen,\" the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement. \"Most children who get measles are not up to date on recommended vaccines or are not old enough to get measles vaccine.\"",

        "article_text": "Ethan Kross is a world expert in the psychology of emotions, and he has identified a set of tools that can help us to tend our wellbeing.\nEver since he was a child, Ethan Kross has been \"an observer of emotion\" and the often counter-productive ways that we deal with difficult feelings. \"It seemed as if we were all just stumbling along, occasionally finding an accidental or Band-Aid solution to help us manage our emotional lives. Sometimes our improvised tools helped. Sometimes they made things worse. It seemed so haphazard, isolating, and inefficient,\" he says.\nAs a psychologist at the University of Michigan and director of the Emotion and Self-Control Laboratory, Kross hopes to change this sorry state of affairs. In his new book Shift: How to Manage Your Emotions So They Don't Manage You, he aims to equip us all with a set of tools that will help us to navigate our ups and downs more constructively.\nKross spoke to science writer David Robson about the benefits of \"negative\" feelings, creating safe spaces and emotional oases \u2013 and the surprising upsides of distraction.\nWhat are the most common misconceptions about emotions?\nOne big misunderstanding is that there are good emotions and there are bad emotions and that we should strive to live our lives free of all the bad emotions. This is an error, as far as I'm concerned: we evolved the ability to experience all emotions for a reason. Anger can motivate us to correct an injustice if there's still an opportunity to fix things. Sadness can lead us to introspect and make new meaning out of situations that have fundamentally been altered. Envy can motivate us to strive for things that we want to achieve. In the right proportions \u2013 that is such a key phrase \u2013 all emotions are useful.\nOne way of driving this point home is to think about physical pain, which is about as negative an emotional state as we can imagine. Many of us yearn to live lives free of any kind of physical pain. But some people are born without the capacity to experience pain, due to a genetic anomaly, and those kids end up dying younger than people who can experience pain. If they get their hand stuck in the fire, there's no signal that tells them to pull the hand away. The same principle is true for all our negative emotions.\nPeople often find it liberating to know that they don't have to strive to live a life without negativity. What you want to strive to achieve is just keeping these emotional experiences in check, and I think that's a much more tenable goal.\nMany people believe that their emotions are beyond their control. Where do you think this defeatist attitude comes from? And what are the consequences?\u00a0\nI think it depends on the facet of our emotional experiences that we're talking about. We often don't have control over the thoughts and feelings that are automatically triggered as we live our lives throughout the day, but we can control how we engage with those thoughts and feelings once they're activated, and that's where the promise of emotion regulation resides.\nBut if you don't think you can do something, then you're not going to make the effort to practice it. If you don't think exercising is going to make you more fit, for example, why on Earth would you devote effort to exercising? And if you don't think that you can use different strategies to manage your emotions, why would you ever avail yourself of them?\nSo how can we change our responses to difficult feelings?\nListening to music is one example of a tool that's underutilised. If you ask people why they listen to music, almost 100% of participants will say that they like the way it makes them feel. But if you then look at what people do when they are struggling with their emotions \u2013 such as the last time they were angry, anxious or sad \u2013 only a small minority report using music.\u00a0\nIt's just one category of what I call \"shifters\", which are the tools that can push our emotions around. And once you know how they work, you can be a lot more strategic in how you use them in your life.\nYou also describe how a change in environment can boost our wellbeing. We might have experienced this on holiday, but how can we apply this principle to our day-to-day lives?\u00a0\nAs you say, a lot of people feel restored when they go to an entirely different place that is free of associations with work. But we can't always take that vacation, and what I like to remind people is that there are often places locally that can shift our mood.\nWe talk a lot about getting attached to other people, and when things aren't going well, being in the presence of that figure can be a source of comfort and resilience. But it turns out we also become attached to places in our environment. Mine include the arboretum near my home, the tea house where I wrote my first book and one of my offices on campus. From the moment I am in that space, I have positive associations that help me manage my emotions.\nI think that they're not unlike the safe houses you have in spy movies or books. We all have these safe houses in our lives, and we want to be strategic about going to them when we're struggling. It's a way of managing ourselves from the outside in.\nYou can also curate your environment. We know that plants and images of green spaces can be restorative. So can photos of loved ones. We've done research where we expose people to pictures of loved ones while they're struggling with a problem. We find it speeds up the rate at which they \"repair\" following the experience.\u00a0\nIs the aim to be more conscious of what we can do to change how we're feeling \u2013 rather than just leaving it to chance?\nOne of my hopes for this book is that we can get people to be much more deliberate about incorporating these tools into our lives.\nI was surprised to find that distraction and avoidance can be a productive way of dealing with emotions. How so?\u00a0\nAvoidance \u2013 trying actively not to think about something by distracting yourself or engaging in other behaviours \u2013 is generally derided as an unhealthy tool. And there's no question that chronically avoiding things has been linked with negative outcomes; it's not an approach that I would advocate for anyone to adopt.\nBut we do not have to choose between either approaching or avoiding our emotions; we can be flexible and do both. There's research showing that people who are effective at both approaching and avoiding their emotions, expressing and suppressing, often fare well in the long term.\nWhat might that look like in our lives? Well, let's say you're triggered by something. You get emotional about an argument you have had with someone. One approach might be to address it right there at that moment, but it might make sense to take some time away from thinking about that problem or confronting it. I say that as the kind of person who, in general, does like to confront things right in the moment, just get to the bottom of it, and move on. But sometimes I've benefited from immersing myself in something totally unrelated for a day and then coming back to the problem. I might come back and realise it's not a problem at all, or I'll find that the intensity of the problem is diminished, and I can approach it from a broader perspective.\nHow should we deal with that killer of joy, social comparison?\nWe often hear that we shouldn't compare ourselves to other people. Good luck! We're a social species; part of the way we make sense of ourselves and our place in this world is to compare ourselves to others.\n\u00a0\nIt is true that we often engage in the kinds of comparisons that lead us to feel bad about ourselves, but you can reframe it in ways that make the comparison work for you rather than against you. If I find out that someone is outperforming me, I can say to myself, well, they were able to achieve that, so why can't I? Now it's almost like a target for something that I can shoot towards.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why we need to be more emotional to save the world\n\u2022 The untranslatable emotions you never knew you had\n\u2022 How climate change effects mental health\nDo you have a favourite strategy that you would typically turn to in times of difficulty?\nWhen I'm struggling, my first line of defence is to use distanced self-talk. I'll use my name and the second person pronoun \u2013 you \u2013 to silently coach myself through a problem, as if I'm advising a friend. (Read more: Illeism: The ancient trick to help you think more wisely.) And then I'll also engage in mental time travel. I'll ask myself, 'How am I going to feel about this in a day, 10 days, 10 months from now?' And I'll also go back in time. 'How does this compare to other difficult things I've been through?'\nOftentimes, those tools get me to where I want to be emotionally, but if they're not sufficient, I'll go to my emotional advisors, people in my network who are pretty skilled at empathising with me and advising me. And I'll go for a walk in a green space, or visit one of my emotional oases.\n*Ethan Kross's new book Shift: Managing Your Emotions So They Don't Manage You is published by Vermilion (UK) and Crown (US).\n** David Robson is an award-winning science writer and author.

        "article_text": "Mohamed Salah has lost two Afcon finals with Egypt \nWho would have thought a discussion on the brilliance of Mohamed Salah would spark a heated social-media row about the merits of the Africa Cup of Nations?\nWell that's what happened when Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher suggested Afcon was not considered a \"major tournament\".\nSo what did Carragher say? Who else has spoken out? And is Afcon disrespected by a European-centric view of world football?\nBBC Sport attempts to break down and explain the issues.\nSpeaking after Liverpool's 2-0 Premier League win at Manchester City on Sunday, pundits in the Sky Sports studio were discussing Salah's performance and whether this season could be one of the \"greatest\" individual campaigns.\nBBC Sport explored that discussion on Monday.\nThe debate then turned to whether Salah could be in line to win the Ballon d'Or - a prestigious annual award for the best player in the world.\nThe Ballon d'Or is voted for by 100 journalists from around the world, and was won last year by Manchester City midfielder Rodri.\nFormer Liverpool defender Carragher suggested Salah would have to win the Champions League in order to win the Ballon d'Or because Afcon is not recognised by voters as a \"major tournament\".\nHe added: \"I think the problem is the fact he's with Egypt, and he's probably not playing in the major tournament as such, or maybe got a great chance of winning, I think it's either the Champions League or the major tournament. Normally, the player who excels in that.\"\nCarragher's repeated use of the term \"major tournament\" irked fellow pundits Micah Richards and Daniel Sturridge. \nRichards stressed Afcon was a \"major tournament\", saying: \"A lot of people are at home saying 'They aren't taking it seriously.' Afcon is a big tournament.\"\nFormer Liverpool striker Sturridge said: \"It's a fact. If you win the Euros or Copa America it's deemed to be big - so the Afcon is at the same level.\"\nCarragher responded: \"Egypt are not going to win the World Cup are they?\" And when Richards tried to explain, he cut him off and said \"Oh God.\"\nClips of the exchange were shared widely across social media.\nOn Monday, Carragher attempted to clarify his comments on X, saying Salah was \"at a disadvantage playing for Egypt in terms of him winning the Ballon d'Or\".\n\"If Salah had an average season at LFC but won the Afcon & was MVP [Most Valuable Player] I don't think he would win the Ballon d'Or. Because I don't think Afcon carries the weight of other tournaments.\n\"But if Mbappe had an average season at Real Madrid but won the World Cup/Euros, he would still have a great opportunity.\"\nIs Salah set for greatest individual Premier League season?\nClub versus country dilemma for Afcon players\nEverything you need to know about Afcon 2023\nCarragher's comments drew criticism from a number of former players. \nWriting on X, former Aston Villa and Egypt captain Ahmed Elmohamady said: \"Jamie Carragher doesn't know what major tournaments [are] because he never won one. Afcon is a major tournament. So proud to [have] won it twice.\"\nFormer Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand said on his podcast that while he understood Carragher's point about the weight of Afcon on Ballon d'Or voting, he thought the comment was \"an ignorant thought process\" and Afcon should be \"respected more than it is\".\nCarragher - replying on Ferdinand's Instagram account - called his former England team-mate a \"clown\" and suggested he was \"playing to the gallery\".\nAfcon is held every two years and has typically been staged during European winter time.\nNo African nation has ever won the World Cup, and only one - Morocco at Qatar 2022 - has reached the semi-finals.\nIn a comparison of the wealth of the federations, Ivory Coast won $7m (\u00a35.5m) for winning Afcon 2023, Argentina won $42m (\u00a333.3m) for winning the last World Cup, and Spain won approximately 28m euros (\u00a323.4m) for winning Euro 2024.\nFormer AC Milan and Liberia striker George Weah is the only African player to have won the Ballon d'Or - having done so in 1995. \nSenegal and former Liverpool winger Sadio Mane - in 2022 - is the only African player to have finished in the top three in the voting in the 21st century. \nThe highest Salah has finished is fifth - in 2019 and 2022.\nIn 2021, former Arsenal and England player Ian Wright said some media coverage of Afcon was \"tinged with racism\", asking \"Is there ever a tournament more disrespected than the Africa Cup of Nations?\"\nTo get an idea of the value of Afcon, all you have to do is listen to some of the continent's greatest ever players. Legends such as Samuel Eto'o, Yaya Toure and Didier Drogba - or the big stars still in action, like Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Riyad Mahrez.\nThey have trophy cabinets full of medals and titles from European club football, but Afcon means everything to them.\nComparisons will always be made to the quality of the Euros and the Copa America, but - just like those tournaments - it's incredibly difficult to win the trophy for even the biggest names and biggest countries.\nI've lost count of the amount of times the tournament favourites have crumbled under the pressure, or in tough conditions against so-called smaller football nations.\nDrogba never won it despite playing in a golden generation of Ivory Coast talent. Salah is yet to lift the trophy, and I can still picture how devastated he was after losing the finals in 2017 and 2021.\nThe organisers also argue the interest in the tournament around the world is increasing all the time. And having been in Ivory Coast at the last edition, I feel that too.\nIt was one of the most exciting I've experienced with the dramatic storyline of the hosts sacking their manager in the group stage before making a remarkable comeback and winning the final. On the ground it certainly felt that it was bigger than ever before with more worldwide interest than ever before.\nYes, there have been many issues in the past that have damaged the reputation of the tournament. For example late changes to the location, such as when Egypt hosted in 2019 instead of Cameroon, who weren't ready. Or changes to the timing, for example with the next edition which was due to take place in June and July but will now start just before Christmas.\nThen there are difficulties with infrastructure, security or organisation. But similar issues have also impacted the Euros and the Copa America in recent years.\nI've always found complaints about the tournament taking place in the middle of the European season overblown. Yes it's frustrating for the clubs but why should African football be dictated to by the European game? Weather conditions also make hosting it in June and July impossible in certain areas of the continent.\nThe tournament may not get the respect it deserves in some parts of the world but after covering six Afcons I get the impression that's changing and that the next edition in Morocco, where football is booming right now, will be bigger than ever and may just have an impact on the Ballon d'Or voting.\nAfcon is being 'disrespected' - Wright\nClub World Cup dates 'disrespectful' to Africa\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Four in five cars should be electric and half of homes should have heat pumps within 15 years, say the government's independent climate advisers.\nBy law the UK must reach \"net zero\" - no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - by 2050.\nUK greenhouse gas emissions have more than halved since 1990, largely thanks to less electricity coming from fossil fuels and more from renewables. But the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says that to reach the 2050 target we will also need to change how we drive and heat our homes.\nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband said the government would consider the advice and respond in due course.\n\"We owe it to current generations to seize the opportunities for energy security and lower bills, and we owe it to future generations to tackle the existential climate crisis,\" he said.\nUnder UK law, the CCC provides independent advice on how much the UK should emit over five-year periods, known as \"carbon budgets\", and how it might get there.\nEach carbon budget is a stepping stone to net zero by 2050. The latest advice is that by 2040, emissions should be 13% of their 1990 levels, for the UK to stay on track.\nThe CCC advice is not policy, but the government has historically accepted it. If it does, the target will become legally binding, but government will still decide how to achieve it.\nMeeting these long-term goals will mean significant changes in the years ahead. One-third of emissions cuts between now and 2040 need to come from households making low-carbon choices, the CCC says.\nThis will mainly be through switching from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles and from fossil fuel boilers to heat pumps, making use of growing supplies of clean electricity. Smaller contributions will come from other choices, such as eating less meat and dairy.\nAs the graph below shows, these changes are ambitious. But they are deliverable, argues the CCC, without people having to scrap their existing boiler or car early.\nOther emerging technologies, like mobile phones and internet connections, have achieved similar rates of increases previously. \n\"For electric vehicles, the market is already pretty much at parity with internal combustion engine vehicles, so we think just naturally that will start to be a choice people make,\" Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of the CCC, told the BBC's Today programme.\n\"For heat pumps, we're saying it's different, the costs are still higher than a fossil fuel boiler and the government will need to act to help people get those technologies.\n\"But the rollout rate that we've looked at is similar to what happened to our neighbours in Ireland but also to much colder countries in Europe.\"\nEmissions cuts will be needed in other areas too, such as farming and flying, two of the hardest sectors to decarbonise.\nThe CCC no longer directly advises against net airport expansion, which it has previously. But it warns the costs of decarbonising aviation will need to be picked up by airlines, which will probably drive up ticket prices.\nIt says we will need to eat less meat and dairy too. In the CCC's pathway, sheep and cattle numbers fall by 27% by 2040, and the area covered by woodland rises from 13% to 16%.\nThe costs of tackling climate change have become highly politicised in recent years.\nThe CCC estimates most of the expense will be borne by the private sector and calculates the savings from moving to more efficient technologies should outweigh costs by the early 2040s.\n\"We are crystal clear in this analysis, in this carbon budget, for the first time we start to see the economy making savings from this investment, and they make savings over and above what we would do if we stay dependent on fossil fuels,\" Ms Pinchbeck told BBC News.\nThis should improve energy security and filter down to lower bills in the long term, the CCC argues, provided the government acts to make electricity cheaper. \nIt advises removing policy costs \u2013 funding for social and environmental schemes \u2013 from electricity bills. That would cut them by about 19% based on expected 2025 prices, the CCC says, making it more cost-effective for people to switch to electric vehicles or heat pumps.\nThese costs could instead sit on gas bills or general taxation.\n\"Regardless of what you think about climate change, what we are laying out today is a massive industrial revolution,\" said Ms Pinchbeck.\n\"It will save the economy money by 2040, it saves people money on their energy bills, it saves people money on their driving costs, but all of that is underpinned by a cheaper electricity price.\"\nAdditional reporting by Becky Dale\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\".Alexander Kirk from Global Witness added BP \"cannot be trusted to deliver the clean energy transition\", adding that it was \"focusing on short-term profits to shareholders while energy prices are high, with the rest of the world picking up the tab from its climate-wrecking products\".Global Witness drove a lorry around central London with messages criticising BP's decision.Sir Ian Cheshire, who has held many executive roles at companies such as B&Q owner Kingfisher and Barclays bank, questioned whether BP's latest move would work. \"The decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to \"capital-light partnerships\" in other green energy such as wind and solar.BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.But in 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.

It had one runway and an additional taxi-way, that was expanded so it could be used as a back-up in case the main runway was out of action.\nIt was never supposed to be for daily use.\nIn fact, in 1979 Gatwick's owners signed a legally binding agreement with the local council not to build another operational runway for at least 40 years. \nNow, though, Gatwick is keen to increase flights in and out, especially for short-haul destinations, by putting the back-up runway into regular use.\nIn the summer of 2023, it put in a planning application, including for additional buildings, flyovers to local roads and expanding rail links.\nHowever, the centre line of a runway that's in full operation, must be at least 210 metres from the centre line of any other runway.\nThe back-up runway needs to shift 12 metres northwards to meet that safety rule.\nJust because the government has given backing in principle for the privately-funded \u00a32.2bn scheme, doesn't mean it is ready for take-off.\nThere is strong opposition to the expansion of Gatwick among some local residents objecting to increases in traffic, noise and pollution. \nClimate campaigners oppose any airport expansion, pointing out that the extra flights will make it harder for the UK to meet its obligations to reduce emissions that are altering the climate.\nAnd in January MPs called on the government to delay the decision on expanding Gatwick until current noise levels were monitored adequately at the site.\nGatwick has until 24 April to submit more information to support its planning application, and respond with measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport.\nThen there will be a fresh consultation on the plans, before the government makes a final decision on 27 October.\nEven if Gatwick is given the go-ahead then, it could still face further hurdles.\n\"There remains the possibility that the final decision could be subject to legal challenge which would lead to further delay,\" Paul Maile, head of planning and infrastructure consenting at Eversheds Sutherland, told the BBC. \n\"It is probable that it will still be several years before work is likely to start, at the earliest,\" he said.\nGatwick has previously said it believed the new runway could be ready by the end of the decade.\nBut there is still a reasonable chance it might not happen at all.\nBy 2030 there will have been another general election, and a different government could overturn any previous decisions. Planning permissions and regulations may change, and climate targets could be ramped up - all of which would put the project at risk.\nIt will also depend on what the public want, says Prof Tony Travers of the London School of Economics.\nPoliticians are \"susceptible to public pressure\" so sometimes choose to slow or cancel infrastructure projects like this.\nWhile there are wider benefits of airport expansion, to the regional and national economy as well as the travelling public, those advantages don't usually prompt people to make placards and write to their MPs. Living under a flight path, on the other hand, does.\nRichard Threlfall, global head of infrastructure, government and healthcare at KPMG International, says other countries, which don't have such strong democracies as the UK, can \"just get on and do it\", when they want infrastructure built.\nIn the UK road bypasses, rail infrastructure, housing and other projects can be slowed or completely blocked, if enough people oppose them.\nBut this government has staked its reputation on overcoming opposition to projects that it believes will boost growth, indicating it wants to see airport expansion despite the objections.

        "article_text": "Beavers will be released into the wild in England after the government approved their reintroduction.\nThe decision follows years of trials and will see beavers make an officially approved return to waterways.\nHunted to extinction in Britain four hundred years ago, beavers have in the last two decades been making a comeback.\nBut some farmers are concerned that without proper management the large rodents could have negative impacts on food production.\n\nIt's thought that about five hundred beavers already live in England, some in the wild and others in enclosures. Many more are in Scotland, where wild releases are already permitted.\nConservationists call beavers \"ecosystem engineers\" because of how they redesign where they live. The dams they build slow the flow of rivers and streams and create habitats where other creatures can thrive. They've also been credited with reducing flooding further downstream. \n\"This is an incredibly exciting moment, a real landmark for nature recovery in England,\" Tony Juniper, the head of Natural England, told me next to a beaver dam in Devon. \n\"We're bringing back a missing animal that's been absent for centuries, and an animal that we know will bring huge benefits for the rest of the wildlife that is already depleted across much of England,\" he says.\nThe beavers will be released under a licensing system overseen by Natural England. \nIt says long term plans will need to be in place to avoid impacts on farming, food production and infrastructure. \nThat's something the National Farmers Union say is vital. It wants culling beavers  to be an option if they prove disruptive.\nNFU Deputy President David Exwood said that while beavers could provide certain benefits, \"we are concerned about the negative impacts beavers can have on productive farmland, as well as the management requirements, costs and risks involved\". \n\"Beavers can flood and waterlog fields, feed on agricultural crops like maize, as well as damage and fell trees such as cricket bat willow.\"\nWe met up with Tony Juniper of Natural England at the site of the pilot project for wild beaver release in England, the River Otter catchment in Devon. Beavers first appeared here more than a decade ago - it's not clear where they came from. They may have escaped from enclosures or have been illegally released, so called \"beaver bombing\".\nSince then the wild beavers have been allowed to stay, with their impact on the landscape and the way they interact with local farmland closely monitored.\n\"All of this open water is down to the beavers,\" Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust tells me as we splash our way through the boggy land.\n\"They want this water because it makes them feel safe and secure. It means that they can transport their food as well.\"\nAlong the River Otter Mr Burgess tells me the beavers have created wetlands that now host species such as great white egrets and kingfishers. Dragonfly numbers have soared as have frogs and toads. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.\nNot everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.\nClinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running. Though broadly supportive of the beavers' return there are concerns about whether enough thought has been given to managing their impacts.\n\"We've also seen farmland flooded, we've seen properties flooded. We've seen people's trees in their gardens felled,\" says John Varley, the chief executive of Clinton Devon Estates.\n\"There are positives with the beaver, huge positives, but there's also some quite significant negatives, particularly for small farmers.\"\nScotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. In some areas the beavers have been so successful at breeding that they have had to be relocated or as a last resort culled.\nThe first wild release of beavers in England is now expected to take place in the next few days. Dr Roisin Campbell-Palmer from the Beaver Trust, which is managing the release, told the BBC the male and female had been taken from \"conflict sites\" in Scotland and were now undergoing medical checks ahead of being moved south. \nAdditional reporting by Kevin Church.",

        "article_text": "From a lavish historical epic set in Sicily to a satire of Hollywood studios starring Seth Rogan, and the acclaimed final instalment of British Tudor drama Wolf Hall.\nIt's right there in the title \u2013 you can't keep a Marvel hero down. Or off the screen. After three seasons originally made for Netflix (running from 2015 to 2018), the new Disney+ series brings back the familiar cast of heroes, villains and everything in between. Charlie Cox is Matt Murdoch, aka Daredevil, the blind attorney with superhuman senses that he had once used to fight crime at night, before giving it up at the end of season three. Vincent D'Onofrio is Wilson Fisk, the former mob boss known as Kingpin, now the mayor. \"Why did you stop being a vigilante?\" Fisk asks Murdoch over a friendly cup of coffee at a diner. No matter. That hiatus won't last much longer, as the punching, kicking and mask-wearing action begins. Jon Bernthal is Frank Castle, or Punisher, a brutal vigilante who, unlike Daredevil, never gave it a second thought.\nDaredevil: Born Again premieres 4 March in the US and 5 March in the UK on Disney+.\nLuchino Visconti's 1963 classic film, The Leopard, is still one of the most opulent, romantic, political-historical epics of all time, with Burt Lancaster as the Prince of Salina, head of a fading aristocratic family, and Alain Delon as his revolutionary nephew, Tancredi. Both are caught between the past and the future in 1860s Sicily during the upheaval that unified Italy into one country. Netflix has adapted Giuseppe di Lampedusa's novel, the basis for the film, into this lavish six-part series, cast largely with Italian actors and shot in locations throughout Sicily. Kim Rossi Stuart plays the Prince, the leopard of the title, clinging to his old ways. Saul Nanni is Tancredi, whose love affair with Angelica (Deva Cassel) forms the romantic centre of the story, even while revolutionaries storm the streets and Tancredi has to choose his own path, with his uncle or with a new order.\nThe Leopard premieres 5 March on Netflix internationally\nIn his consistently droll voice, John Mulaney has leap-frogged through genres, from a series of priceless stand-up specials to appearing in \u2013 and writing \u2013 instant-classic Saturday Night Live sketches like Lobster Diner, and last year's John Mulaney Presents: Everybody's in LA, a series of six live talk-show episodes presented over consecutive nights. At once sending up and using the tropes of an old-time talk show, Everybody's in LA was such a critical and popular hit that Mulaney returns with this 12-episode series, each show live once a week. Everybody's Live promises a similar meta/retro mix as the last run, which had some amazing, funny guests \u2013 David Letterman and Bill Hader on the same episode, a surprise appearance by Will Ferrell \u2013 viewer call-ins, and offbeat topics like coyotes in Los Angeles. Richard Kind returns in the role of announcer/sidekick, along with Saymo the delivery robot, in a show that is both goofy and satirical.\u00a0\nEverybody's Live with John Mulaney premieres 12 March on Netflix internationally\nStephen Graham is everything everywhere all at once these days (no bad thing). He plays a Victorian-era boxer in A Thousand Blows, which just premiered, and is both star and co-creator with Jack Thorne (Harry Potter and the Cursed Child) of this psychological drama which has an unsettling theme. Graham plays Ed Miller, whose 13-year-old son, Jamie, is accused of murdering a girl who went to his school. Ashley Waters (Top Boy) plays a detective investigating the murder, and Erin Doherty (the crime boss in A Thousand Blows) is the psychologist assigned to treat Jamie. Each of the four episodes is shot in one continuous take, playing out in real time, which might add to the tension. The real test will be how effective that strategy is. Adolescence is directed by Philip Barantini, who made the one-shot approach so effective in the 2021 film Boiling Point (which, need we add, stars Stephen Graham).\nAdolescence premieres 13 March on Netflix internationally\nIn this drama that mixes elements of the police procedural with a family story of addiction, Amanda Seyfried plays Mickey Fitzgerald, a beat cop in Philadelphia assigned to the neighbourhood where she grew up, a place ravaged by the opioid crisis. When several women are serially murdered, she suspects the case might lead her to her sister, Kacey (Ashleigh Cummings), an addict and sex worker who has disappeared. The show weaves between past and present, with flashbacks to the sisters' fraught relationship and divergent paths, as Mickey deals with life as a single mother and with her increasing obsession with finding Kacey. The show has a lot to live up to. It is based on a bestselling novel by Liz Moore, who cowrote the series with its showrunner, Nikki Toscano. NPR called the book one of the Best of 2020, and if that's not enough, Barack Obama put it on his list of favourite books of the year.\nLong Bright River premieres 13 March on Peacock\nRidley Scott directed the first episode of this crime series, which becomes more than the typical drugs-and-criminals thriller thanks to its lead actors. Brian Tyree Henry (Atlanta, If Beale Street Could Talk) and Wagner Moura (Civil War) play old friends in Philadelphia with a small-time scam. Posing as agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency, they pretend to raid drug houses while really searching for cash to steal. By the end of episode one, they have targeted the wrong meth lab, and are on the run from both real government agents and the dealers whose business they literally blew up in an explosion. Henry and Moura bring unusual sympathy to the characters as the show combines the tension of their life-or-death danger with the stories of the people they care about and try to protect. Henry's character is especially affecting in his love for the stepmother who raised him (Kate Mulgrew). Peter Craig, a co-writer of The Batman and Top Gun: Maverick, created the series, which has a gritty texture that recalls The Wire.\nDope Thief premieres 14 March on Apple TV+ internationally\nEllen Pompeo and Mark Duplass star as Kristine and Michael Barnett in a series\u00a0 inspired by a tabloid-ready real-life case. The Barnetts adopt a seven-year-old Ukrainian orphan named Natalia Grace (Imogen Faith Reid), who has a rare form of dwarfism, and whose first adopted family has returned her. The trailer hints at a good deal of heightened drama, as Kristine begins to suspect that they do not know the truth about their child's age. \"Michael, I don't think she's a little girl,\" she says, a suspicion that eventually takes the couple all the way to court. Dule Hill plays a detective investigating the tangle of accusations and fears, and it is tangled. The actual events, which began in 2010, are so unusual and the saga so ongoing that it has already inspired three seasons of a documentary series on the Investigation Discovery Channel.\nGood American Family premieres 19 March on Hulu in the US and 7 May on Disney+ in the UK\nNetflix is calling this murder mystery from Shonda Rhimes's production company a\u00a0 \"screwball whodunit,\" with Uzo Aduba as Cordelia Cupp, a brilliant detective investigating a murder in the White House during a state dinner. With a comic tone and a cast of 157 suspects, it's Upstairs Downstairs at the White House with a corpse, as Cupp questions everyone from the assistant usher (Susan Kelechi Watson) and the pastry chef (Bronson Pinchot) to the president's mother-in-law (Jane Curtain) and oldest friend (Ken Marino). Randall Park plays an FBI agent who investigates with Cordelia, and as the trailer reveals, Giancarlo Esposito plays the murder victim, who had the important job of chief usher and was not popular with his staff. The show was created by Paul William Davies, a writer on Rhimes's White House-set series Scandal, who has gone for a very different tone here. His goal for the show was to \"Keep it FUN,\" he told Netflix. \"I want people to be entertained, I want them to laugh.\" The Residence arrives in a very different political landscape to the one in which it was created, and it will be interesting to see whether finding laughter in the White House now lands as escapist entertainment or tone-deafness.\u00a0\nThe Residence premieres 20 March on Netflix internationally\nViewers in the US have had to wait four months to see the series the Guardian called \"utter TV magic\" when it premiered on the BBC last November, but here it is. The second instalment of Wolf Hall, it is based on the last of Hilary Mantel's trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, the savvy but doomed advisor to Henry VIII.\u00a0Just as Mantel set the standard for historical novels, the first Wolf Hall series, adapted from the first two books, did the same for smart, beautifully made historical TV dramas. Nine years later, the ensemble that put that first part together is back, on screen and off, with Mark Rylance as Cromwell, Damian Lewis as Henry and Jonathan Pryce as Cardinal Wolsey. The series was adapted by Peter Straughn, who was nominated for an Oscar this year for Conclave (he's good at writing men in robes) and directed by Peter Kosminsky. The story picks up in 1536, the blood still fresh from Anne Boleyn's head rolling, and although history tells us how badly it all ends, watching the court intrigue unfold here in such ravishing detail is exhilarating.\nWolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light premieres 23 March on PBS in the US\nHollywood studios are an irresistible target of satire, from Robert Altman's 1992 gem The Player to Armando Iannucci's recent series The Franchise. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the co-creators of this series, have now made them the subject of a very funny romp, overflowing with cameos from real-life actors and directors. Rogan plays Matt Remick, a production executive who longs to greenlight art films. That's an unlikely goal after he is promoted to head of Continental Studios, with the mandate to make commercial hits. One project his corporate bosses insist on: a film based on Kool-Aid. If a product-inspired movie worked for Barbie, why not a soft drink? The first episode includes cameos from Martin Scorsese and Steve Buscemi. Paul Dano, Olivia Wilde, Charlize Theron, Anthony Mackie and many others play outsized versions of themselves. And the casting of the regular characters is inspired.

        "article_text": "Stargazers will be treated to a rare alignment of seven planets on 28 February when Mercury joins six other planets that are already visible in the night sky. Here's why it matters to scientists.\nPeer up at the sky on a clear night at the end of February and you could be in for a treat. Through out January and February six planets \u2013 Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune \u2013 have been visible in the night sky. During just one night \u2013 28 February \u2013 they will be joined by Mercury, a rare seven-planet alignment visible in the sky. It is a spectacle that will not be visible again until 2040.\nBut such events are not just a treat for stargazers \u2013 they can also have a real impact on our Solar System and offer the opportunity to gain new insights about our place within it.\nThe eight major planets of our Solar System orbit the Sun in the same flat plane, and all at different speeds. Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, completes an orbit \u2013 a year for the planet \u2013 in 88 days. Earth's year, of course, is 365 days, while at the upper end, Neptune takes a whopping 60,190 days, or about 165 Earth years, to complete a single revolution of our star.\nThe different speeds of the planets mean that, on occasion, several of them can be roughly lined up on the same side of the Sun. From Earth, if the orbits line up just right, we can see multiple planets in our night sky at the same time. In rare events, all the planets will line up such that they all appear in our night sky together along the ecliptic, the path traced by the Sun.\nMercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are all bright enough to be visible to the naked eye, while Uranus and Neptune require binoculars or a telescope to spot.\nIn January and February 2025, it has been possible to witness this event taking place. The planets are not exactly lined up, so they appear in an arc across the sky due to their orbital plane in the Solar System. During clear nights, all of the planets except Mercury should be visible \u2013 an event sometimes called a planetary parade. On 28 February, though \u2013 weather permitting \u2013 all seven planets will be visible, a great spectacle for observers on the ground.\n\"There is something special about looking at the planets with your own eyes,\" says Jenifer Millard, a science communicator and astronomer at Fifth Star Labs in the UK. \"Yes, you can go on Google and get a more spectacular view of all these planets. But when you're looking at these objects, these are photons that have travelled millions or billions of miles through space to hit your retinas.\"\nWhile fascinating to observe, do such alignments have any impact here on Earth? Or might they have a use for increasing our understanding of our Solar System and beyond?\nIn fact, says Millard, \"it's just happenstance that they happen to be in this position of their orbits\". And while there have been suggestions from some scientists that planetary alignments might cause impacts on Earth, the scientific basis for most of these claims is weak or non-existent.\nIn 2019, however, researchers suggested that planetary alignments could have an impact on solar activity. One of the main outstanding questions about the Sun is what drives its 11-year cycle between periods of peak activity, known as solar maximum (which we are currently in), and periods of weakest activity, solar minimum. Frank Stefani, a physicist at Helmholtz-Zentrum research centre in Dresden-Rossendorf in Germany, believes the combined tidal forces of Venus, Earth and Jupiter could be the answer.\nWhile the tidal pull of each planet on the Sun is extremely small, Stefani says that when two or more of the planets line up with the Sun \u2013 known as a syzygy \u2013 they might combine to cause small rotations inside the star, called Rossby waves, which can drive weather events.\n\"On Earth, Rossby waves cause cyclones and anticyclones,\" says Stefani. \"We have the same Rossby waves in the Sun.\" Stefani's calculations showed that the alignments of Venus, Earth and Jupiter would cause a periodicity to solar activity of 11.07 years, almost exactly matching the length of solar cycles that we see.\nNot everyone is so sure about the idea, with some noting that solar activity can already be explained by processes within the Sun alone. \"The observational evidence suggests that the planets directly causing the solar cycle just doesn't happen,\" says Robert Cameron, a solar scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System research in Germany, who published a paper on the subject in 2022. \"There's no evidence of any synchronisation.\"\nBut there are other, far less contentious, quirks of planetary alignments which certainly do have an impact on us: their usefulness for scientific observations, particularly in terms of exploring the Solar System.\nReaching the outer planets with a spacecraft is difficult because these worlds are so far away, billions of miles, and would take decades to reach. However, using the gravitational pull of a well-placed planet, such as Jupiter, to slingshot a spacecraft outwards can reduce the travel time dramatically, something no spacecraft has done better than Nasa's Voyager vehicles.\nIn 1966, a Nasa scientist called Gary Flandro calculated that there would be an alignment of the four outermost planets \u2013 Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune \u2013 in 1977 that would enable all four to be visited within a span of just 12 years, compared to 30 years if they were not aligned. This fortuitous alignment, which occurs only once every 175 years, led to Nasa launching the twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft in 1977 on a \"Grand Tour\" of the outer Solar System.\nVoyager 1 flew past Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980, eschewing Uranus and Neptune because scientists wanted to fly past Titan, Saturn's fascinating moon, and could not do so without ruining the slingshot effect.\nBut Voyager 2 used the alignment to visit all four planets, becoming the only spacecraft in history to visit Uranus and Neptune, in 1986 and 1989 respectively.\n\"That worked out fantastic,\" says Fran Bagenal, an astrophysicist at the University of Colorado, Boulder in the US and a member of the Voyager science team. \"If Voyager 2 had left in 1980, it would have taken until 2010 to get to Neptune. I don't think it would have won support. Who's going to fund such a thing?\"\nIt is not just within our Solar System that planet alignments are useful. Astronomers use alignments to probe many different aspects of the Universe, and none more so than in the discovery and study of exoplanets, worlds that orbit stars other than the Sun.\nThe dominant way of finding such worlds is known as the transit method: when an exoplanet passes in front of a star from our point of view it dims the star's light, allowing its size and orbit to be discerned.\nThanks to this method, we have discovered many planets in orbit around certain stars. Trappist-1, a red dwarf star located 40 light-years from Earth, has seven Earth-sized planets that all transit the star from our point of view. The planets in that system are actually in resonance with each other \u2013 meaning the outermost planet completes two orbits for every three orbits of the next planet inwards, then four, six, and so on. This means there are periods where multiple planets in the system align in a straight line, something that doesn't happen in our Solar System.\nUsing transits, we can study the existence of atmospheres on planets like these. \"If a planet with an atmosphere goes in front of a star, that alignment means the starlight goes through the planet, and the molecules and atoms in the planet's atmosphere absorb light at certain wavelengths,\" says Jessie Christiansen, an astronomer at the Nasa Exoplanet Science Institute at the California Institute of Technology.\nThis allows different gases such as carbon dioxide and oxygen to be identified. \"The vast majority of our atmospheric composition analysis is due to alignments,\" she says.\nMuch grander alignments can let us probe the distant Universe, namely the alignments of galaxies. Observing galaxies in the very early universe is difficult because they are so faint and far away. However, if a large galaxy or cluster of galaxies passes between our line of sight with a much more distant early galaxy, its large gravitational pull can magnify the light of the more distant object, allowing us to observe and study it, a process called gravitational lensing.\n\"These are huge alignments across the scale of the universe,\" says Christiansen. They are used by telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope to observe remote stars and galaxies such as Earendel, the most distant known star from Earth. The light viewed by the telescope from the star came from the first billion years of the 13.7-billion-year-history of the Universe and was visible only because of gravitational lensing.\nAnd then there are some more novel uses of alignments, such as probing the existence of extraterrestrial life, in solar systems where the exoplanets pass in front of each other from our point of view.\nIn 2024, graduate student Nick Tusay at Pennsylvania State University in the US used these alignments to\u00a0look for any spillover communications\u00a0being sent between worlds of the Trappist-1 system, such as how on Earth we send signals to planets like Mars in our solar system to talk to rovers and spacecraft. \"Any time that two planets are aligned might be interesting,\" says Tusay.\nOn this occasion the searches turned up short. But an alien civilisation looking towards our own Solar System might use similar alignments for the same purpose. While the planetary parade this month depends on your point of view \u2013 any two planets in our system can be aligned if you are positioned at the right angle \u2013 it's not impossible to imagine someone else on the other end, watching on.\n\"Perhaps another alien civilisation might see this as an opportunity to conduct their own investigations,\" says Tusay.\n* This article was originally published on 19 January 2025.

Trump has lauded the \"very big agreement\" as an opportunity for the US to get its \"money back\" after funding aid to Ukraine. \nBut Zelensky has instead referred to it as a \"framework agreement\" upon which he hopes further deals can be made.\nTrump has said he wants a quick end to the war in Ukraine and has sought to reset relations with Russia. After a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the two leaders sent delegations to Saudi Arabia in bilateral talks which excluded Ukraine. \nIn response, Zelensky accused the US of helping Putin \"break out of years of isolation\" and Trump of living in a \"Russian disinformation space\". \nUkraine is a country rich in natural resources. Kyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are there. But accessing some of these resources will not be completely straightforward. \nSome of the mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nThere are warnings too that Ukraine first needs to addresses its problem with unexploded mines before striking a deal with the US.\nA quarter of Ukraine's landmass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country.\nPutin has also said he is open to offering the US access to rare minerals, including from Russian-occupied Ukraine.\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will also be meeting both Trump and Zelensky separately this week to discuss the war in Ukraine.\nHe is due to arrive in Washington later on Wednesday.",

        "article_text": "Energy bills will rise by more than expected from April, following an announcement from the regulator Ofgem.\nBut Labour pledged in its manifesto: \"We will save families hundreds of pounds on their bills, not just in the short term, but for good.\" It also promised bills would come down by \"up to \u00a3300 by 2030\". \nResponding to the price cap rise, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said it was due to \"our reliance on the fossil fuel markets\" and added: \"We're acting to bring down bills for everyone with our mission for clean, home-grown power that we control.\"\nThe government wants to remove nearly all fossil fuels from UK electricity production by 2030. \nMore power is coming from renewable sources than ever before, so why isn't this translating into cheaper electricity bills?\nThere are a number of reasons, including the time and money it takes to make the power system greener, the question of who pays, and the way the electricity market is set up.\nThe UK's electricity is expensive.\nCompared with countries in the European Union, UK domestic electricity prices ranked fourth highest in the first half of 2024 - the most recent government data.\nThis is for consumers with medium usage, including taxes and subsidies.\nFor industrial electricity, the UK had the highest prices - for medium users - over the same period. \nThe UK has much higher electricity prices - both domestic and industrial - than other large economies outside Europe, such as the US and Canada.\nThe largest, and most variable, component of a UK customer's electricity bill is the \"wholesale\" price. This is the cost at which suppliers buy it from the companies that generate it.\nOther parts of the bill include \"network\" costs for operating, maintaining and upgrading the power grid, and \"policy\" costs, which include government levies to help fund environmental projects.\nThe main reason for the spikes in electricity bills over the past few years has been changes to wholesale costs. This is linked to an increase in international gas prices.\nThe price for wholesale electricity is set by a bidding process, with each generating company saying what it would be willing to accept to produce a unit of electricity.\nOnce built, the cost of generating power from renewables is very low, so these typically come in with the cheapest bid. Nuclear might come next.\nGas generators often have the highest costs, because they have to buy gas to burn, as well as paying a \"carbon price\" - a charge for emissions.\nThe wholesale cost is set by the last unit of electricity needed to meet demand from consumers. This means that even if gas only generates 1% of power at a given time, gas will still set the wholesale price.\nIn Great Britain, this generally happens more often than its European counterparts, where demand can be met more often without relying on gas.\n\"The main reason why electricity prices are currently high is because the cost of gas - which is what sets the electricity price - is also high,\" said a spokesperson from the Climate Change Committee, the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions.\nRenewables can generate electricity cheaply.\nBut building a wind farm on land - and particularly out at sea - comes with high up-front costs and the planning process is often lengthy.\nThe government needs to triple wind and solar capacity and to get developers to build this, it needs to provide certainty that they will get a return on their investment.\nIt does this by agreeing a fixed price - or strike price - that they will be paid for each unit of electricity they generate for 15 years into the future.\nIf the wholesale price is below this fixed price, the renewable generator gets paid a top up by a government-owned company; if the wholesale price is above the strike price, the generator pays the difference back.\nAny costs or savings are then passed onto consumers via bills.\nStrike prices were expensive, but have fallen considerably, apart from a small rise from 2022-24 linked to global supply chain pressures.\nAs more renewables are connected - and operational improvements mean the grid can be safely run on this type of power - there should be more times when gas is not setting the wholesale price.\n\"There are in practice very few hours at the moment in which gas does not set the price despite being a minority of the overall generation,\" said Adam Berman, director of policy at Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry.\n\"The more that you are able to have a renewable infrastructure that can deliver electricity at any hour of the day and in any circumstance, the more you are able to move away from gas setting the price.\"\nThe UK has an ageing electricity grid, which needs upgrading, partly to accommodate new renewable power sources. There are times when wind power is actually paid not to generate, because the grid cannot handle all the electricity that it could produce.\nThis adds to the network costs in a bill.\nIntermittent renewable sources also require backup for when it's not windy or sunny. In the short term, this role will be largely filled by gas, but eventually it could be met by storing renewable energy in batteries or by hydrogen power.\nGreat Britain's island location means it is more expensive than in continental Europe to build interconnectors - cables to connect electricity systems of neighbouring countries - to help meet periods of low output.\nSome analysts have also argued that placing extra social and environmental taxes on electricity bills - rather than gas bills or general taxation - makes electricity artificially expensive.\nThe government is reviewing the structure of the electricity market, alongside its push for clean power through renewables and nuclear. \nIn the long term, renewables \"will be bringing down overall energy bills, and specifically electricity bills, for the UK,\" argues Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London.\nBut savings in the short term are not guaranteed. A faster rollout of renewables could mean upfront costs - for things like upgrading the grid - being passed onto consumers more quickly. \nSome analysts have also expressed concern that a rush to secure enough renewables to meet the 2030 goal could mean less competitive \"strike prices\", locking in higher costs.\n\"If you think 10-15 years down the line, you are likely to see the cost for technologies like offshore wind decrease further\u2026 but potentially the rush to have to do this in the next couple of years means that you have to lock in a lot of these projects now to make sure that it can deliver [for 2030],\" said Pranav Menon, research associate at the Aurora Energy Research think tank.\n\"That does mean that you are going to push up against stretched supply chains, which could mean that cost to procure that [extra capacity] increases.\"\nBut a rapid roll-out of renewables would also reduce the UK's dependence on gas - the main cause of the price spike of the past few years - and so there could be benefits sooner if gas prices remain high.\nThe government said earlier in February that its plans would \"bring down bills for households and businesses for good\" and lowering them by \"up to \u00a3300 by 2030\" remains an objective.\nAdditional reporting by Chris Jeavans and Becky Dale\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

        "article_text": "Skywatchers are in for a treat this week as seven planets - Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Venus, Neptune, Mercury, and Saturn will all be briefly visible in the evening sky.\nThis phenomenon, known as a 'planetary parade' is a rare sight, and it will be the last time seven planets can be seen simultaneously so well until 2040.\nThe best chance to see as many planets as possible will be just after sunset on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. \nFour of the planets - Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Mars - will be visible to the naked eye. Saturn will be harder to see because it will be low in the horizon. You will need a telescope to spot the other two planets - Uranus and Neptune.\nA good view of the horizon and clear skies will offer the best chance of spotting them all. However, the window to see all seven planets will be very brief.\nDr Edward Bloomer, astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich said: \"There's a rare opportunity to have seven planets in essentially a convenient place for you to look for them.\"\nAs the sun sets, Saturn and Mercury will also be setting, making them particularly difficult to see.\n\"You really only have a few minutes after sunset to catch them before they drop below the horizon. After that, you'll still be able to see Venus, Jupiter, and Mars clearly for a much longer time,\" Dr Bloomer added.\nThe planets in our solar system orbit the Sun within roughly the same flat plane as the Earth.\nAs they orbit at different speeds and distances from the Sun, there are moments when they appear to line up from Earth's perspective creating a spectacular visual display, although the planets remain separated by vast distances in space.\nVenus and Jupiter will be the easiest to spot due to their brightness, while Mars will have a distinct reddish hue. \n\"Uranus is technically visible with the naked eye, but you'd need perfect eyesight and ideal conditions,\" Dr Bloomer explains.\nTo improve your chances of seeing as many planets as possible, Dr Bloomer advises heading to a location with a clear view of the horizon and minimal light pollution.\n\"If you just pop out of your kitchen into your back garden, you will take time to adjust to the light levels. Give it a bit of time - your eyes take about half an hour to fully adjust,\" said Dr Bloomer. \n\"Avoid looking at your phone, get comfortable, and ensure you have an unobstructed view of the horizon.\" \nWhile this is an exciting opportunity, Dr Bloomer encourages people to make a habit of gazing at the night sky. \n\"See how things change,\" he said, adding that observing the heavens is \"a chance to witness the ongoing mechanics of the solar system at work.\"\n\nOn Wednesday night, skies will be generally cloudier with showery rain at times.\nBy Thursday, expect a drier, clearer view of the night sky. Earlier in the evening is best, as mist and fog patches may develop further into the night.\nFor Friday high pressure is expected to dominate, keeping dry conditions for most with clear spells. Soon after sunset is most favoured as mist and fog patches may develop later. \nAdditional reporting by Sarah Keith-Lucas of BBC Weather",

You will need a telescope to spot the other two planets - Uranus and Neptune.Getty ImagesHow an artist imagines the planets in our solar system lined up in a row - of course it isn't quite that straightforwardA good view of the horizon and clear skies will offer the best chance of spotting them all. Four of the planets - Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Mars - will be visible to the naked eye. After that, you'll still be able to see Venus, Jupiter, and Mars clearly for a much longer time,\" Dr Bloomer added.The planets in our solar system orbit the Sun within roughly the same flat plane as the Earth.As they orbit at different speeds and distances from the Sun, there are moments when they appear to line up from Earth's perspective creating a spectacular visual display, although the planets remain separated by vast distances in space.Send us your pictures of the planetary parade.",

        "article_text": "Mohamed Salah has lost two Afcon finals with Egypt \nWho would have thought a discussion on the brilliance of Mohamed Salah would spark a heated social-media row about the merits of the Africa Cup of Nations?\nWell that's what happened when Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher suggested Afcon was not considered a \"major tournament\".\nSo what did Carragher say? Who else has spoken out? And is Afcon disrespected by a European-centric view of world football?\nBBC Sport attempts to break down and explain the issues.\nSpeaking after Liverpool's 2-0 Premier League win at Manchester City on Sunday, pundits in the Sky Sports studio were discussing Salah's performance and whether this season could be one of the \"greatest\" individual campaigns.\nBBC Sport explored that discussion on Monday.\nThe debate then turned to whether Salah could be in line to win the Ballon d'Or - a prestigious annual award for the best player in the world.\nThe Ballon d'Or is voted for by 100 journalists from around the world, and was won last year by Manchester City midfielder Rodri.\nFormer Liverpool defender Carragher suggested Salah would have to win the Champions League in order to win the Ballon d'Or because Afcon is not recognised by voters as a \"major tournament\".\nHe added: \"I think the problem is the fact he's with Egypt, and he's probably not playing in the major tournament as such, or maybe got a great chance of winning, I think it's either the Champions League or the major tournament. Normally, the player who excels in that.\"\nCarragher's repeated use of the term \"major tournament\" irked fellow pundits Micah Richards and Daniel Sturridge. \nRichards stressed Afcon was a \"major tournament\", saying: \"A lot of people are at home saying 'They aren't taking it seriously.' Afcon is a big tournament.\"\nFormer Liverpool striker Sturridge said: \"It's a fact. If you win the Euros or Copa America it's deemed to be big - so the Afcon is at the same level.\"\nCarragher responded: \"Egypt are not going to win the World Cup are they?\" And when Richards tried to explain, he cut him off and said \"Oh God.\"\nClips of the exchange were shared widely across social media.\nOn Monday, Carragher attempted to clarify his comments on X, saying Salah was \"at a disadvantage playing for Egypt in terms of him winning the Ballon d'Or\".\n\"If Salah had an average season at LFC but won the Afcon & was MVP [Most Valuable Player] I don't think he would win the Ballon d'Or. Because I don't think Afcon carries the weight of other tournaments.\n\"But if Mbappe had an average season at Real Madrid but won the World Cup/Euros, he would still have a great opportunity.\"\nIs Salah set for greatest individual Premier League season?\nClub versus country dilemma for Afcon players\nEverything you need to know about Afcon 2023\nCarragher's comments drew criticism from a number of former players. \nWriting on X, former Aston Villa and Egypt captain Ahmed Elmohamady said: \"Jamie Carragher doesn't know what major tournaments [are] because he never won one. Afcon is a major tournament. So proud to [have] won it twice.\"\nFormer Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand said on his podcast that while he understood Carragher's point about the weight of Afcon on Ballon d'Or voting, he thought the comment was \"an ignorant thought process\" and Afcon should be \"respected more than it is\".\nCarragher - replying on Ferdinand's Instagram account - called his former England team-mate a \"clown\" and suggested he was \"playing to the gallery\".\nAfcon is held every two years and has typically been staged during European winter time.\nNo African nation has ever won the World Cup, and only one - Morocco at Qatar 2022 - has reached the semi-finals.\nIn a comparison of the wealth of the federations, Ivory Coast won $7m (\u00a35.5m) for winning Afcon 2023, Argentina won $42m (\u00a333.3m) for winning the last World Cup, and Spain won approximately 28m euros (\u00a323.4m) for winning Euro 2024.\nFormer AC Milan and Liberia striker George Weah is the only African player to have won the Ballon d'Or - having done so in 1995. \nSenegal and former Liverpool winger Sadio Mane - in 2022 - is the only African player to have finished in the top three in the voting in the 21st century. \nThe highest Salah has finished is fifth - in 2019 and 2022.\nIn 2021, former Arsenal and England player Ian Wright said some media coverage of Afcon was \"tinged with racism\", asking \"Is there ever a tournament more disrespected than the Africa Cup of Nations?\"\nTo get an idea of the value of Afcon, all you have to do is listen to some of the continent's greatest ever players. Legends such as Samuel Eto'o, Yaya Toure and Didier Drogba - or the big stars still in action, like Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Riyad Mahrez.\nThey have trophy cabinets full of medals and titles from European club football, but Afcon means everything to them.\nComparisons will always be made to the quality of the Euros and the Copa America, but - just like those tournaments - it's incredibly difficult to win the trophy for even the biggest names and biggest countries.\nI've lost count of the amount of times the tournament favourites have crumbled under the pressure, or in tough conditions against so-called smaller football nations.\nDrogba never won it despite playing in a golden generation of Ivory Coast talent. Salah is yet to lift the trophy, and I can still picture how devastated he was after losing the finals in 2017 and 2021.\nThe organisers also argue the interest in the tournament around the world is increasing all the time. And having been in Ivory Coast at the last edition, I feel that too.\nIt was one of the most exciting I've experienced with the dramatic storyline of the hosts sacking their manager in the group stage before making a remarkable comeback and winning the final. On the ground it certainly felt that it was bigger than ever before with more worldwide interest than ever before.\nYes, there have been many issues in the past that have damaged the reputation of the tournament. For example late changes to the location, such as when Egypt hosted in 2019 instead of Cameroon, who weren't ready. Or changes to the timing, for example with the next edition which was due to take place in June and July but will now start just before Christmas.\nThen there are difficulties with infrastructure, security or organisation. But similar issues have also impacted the Euros and the Copa America in recent years.\nI've always found complaints about the tournament taking place in the middle of the European season overblown. Yes it's frustrating for the clubs but why should African football be dictated to by the European game? Weather conditions also make hosting it in June and July impossible in certain areas of the continent.\nThe tournament may not get the respect it deserves in some parts of the world but after covering six Afcons I get the impression that's changing and that the next edition in Morocco, where football is booming right now, will be bigger than ever and may just have an impact on the Ballon d'Or voting.\nAfcon is being 'disrespected' - Wright\nClub World Cup dates 'disrespectful' to Africa\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho heads down the tunnel after being substituted in the 3-2 win against Ipswich\nManchester United head coach Ruben Amorim said he would speak to Alejandro Garnacho after the winger went straight to the dressing room when he was substituted in the first half of the 3-2 win against Ipswich.\nAmorim replaced Argentina international Garnacho with defender Noussair Mazraoui two minutes before half-time following Patrick Dorgu's red card.\nIt was raining heavily at Old Trafford and Garnacho seemed to indicate he wanted to take his shirt off, so he headed down the touchline to the dressing room rather than take a place on the bench.\nIt is not known whether he stayed for the second half.\n\"I am going to talk with Garnacho about that,\" said Amorim.\nIn December, the 20-year-old attacker was dropped for the derby against Manchester City at Etihad Stadium along with Marcus Rashford, partly due to his poor performance in training and his attitude.\nUnlike Rashford, who has not played for United since and is now on loan at Aston Villa, Garnacho returned to first-team duties immediately.\n\"You are making a connection with Rashford,\" said Amorim, assessing Wednesday's situation.\n\"It was cold and wet.\"\nAmorim's decision was a tactical one stemming from the red card, allowing his team to largely keep their original shape with five at the back.\n\"The thinking was that we would play 5-3-1. That is a risk because he [Garnacho] is the one who can play one-v-one in pace,\" Amorim said. \"We had to choose someone to go out. It was my choice.\"\nThe Debrief: Man Utd edge Ipswich, Arsenal stutter & Liverpool go 13 clear\nMan Utd planning post-season matches in Asia\nModern players find criticism offensive - Ten Hag\nThis video can not be played\nNot perfect or pretty but Man Utd stayed in control - Amorin\nThis has been a tough week at United, with news that more staff members will be losing their jobs.\nUnited's victory therefore will come as little comfort to those directly affected, no matter how entertaining this game proved to be.\nA mid-season home win against opposition who look destined for a swift return to the Championship is not going to live long in the memory. \nHowever, the manner of the success, fighting back from the concession of a shambolic early opening goal and rallying again after a red card and another avoidable goal, was greeted with enthusiasm from the stands at the final whistle.\n\"The fans' support was amazing,\" said Amorim. \"I have felt that since day one.\n\"They want to see the team fight to the end, no matter what the situation. We did that today. All the things in the game were against us, but we fought through that. You feel the connection. It was a good win for us.\"\nPrivately, United officials accept this has been a traumatic week and that chief executive Omar Berrada did not find it easy on Monday to stand before staff and tell them the bad news that up to 200 jobs could go in the next four months.\nIt is perfectly believable when some currently working at the club say morale among the rank and file is at its lowest ebb.\nBut the conviction among those running United is absolute that the changes needed to be made.\nTheir problem is an understanding that off-field decisions are assessed through the prism of results at first-team level. And the results have been terrible.\nEarly in this contest, with Ipswich leading through the atrocious mix-up that offered Jaden Philogene a fourth-minute tap-in, the visiting fans offered their own pretty blunt assessment of United. The words were somewhat more industrial but effectively: \"You're really not very good.\"\nThat's fair enough when assessing opponents who are supposed to be challenging for major honours but started this game 15th in the table.\nYet those responsible for making key decisions are adamant faith in Amorim remains high. They feel what is currently being endured amounts to teething problems with a coach trying to implement a new system.\nAnother change, it is argued, will merely repeat past mistakes. The club have been in a malaise for years, it could be said, and the cycle has to be broken.\nHowever, there is also an acceptance this will not be straightforward.\nAmorim noted that this success - like the robust rearguard action that brought an FA Cup victory with 10 men at Arsenal and a defiant draw against champions-elect Liverpool - was not achieved in the manner he wants his side to play.\n\"We need to survive, but it is hard for me to play like we play in the second half because I feel the players are more comfortable defending the low block,\" Amorim said.\nAmazingly, United have now matched their best form under Amorim by going two Premier League games without defeat.\nThey are up to 14th but are nine points off the top half of the table and a distant 13 away from a Champions League place, even if the Premier League gets five places as expected.\nNo-one at Old Trafford expects Amorim's side to go on a huge winning run to the end of the season.\nHowever, there is a feeling that they can improve \u2013 and results in the FA Cup fifth-round tie with Fulham on Sunday and the Europa League last-16 tie with Real Sociedad are crucial to maintaining hopes of European qualification. Dorgu will miss the Fulham game through suspension.\nAmorim has learned already that the price of being associated with United is that any action of significance will be amplified. The glare of publicity is fierce.\nPlenty at the club noted within the reaction to this week's cost-cutting news at United that not many employers offer staff the free lunches that are being taken away. Other companies have made far more people redundant.\nBut the allure of United drives interest and therefore commercial revenues far beyond most comparable-sized businesses.\nThere is always attention on United, whether about matters on or off the pitch.\nDebate surrounding this game will not be about the result but about that ridiculous opening goal when Dorgu and Andre Onana practically waved Ipswich through to score.\n\"When everybody watched that ball, they thought 'here we go again',\" said Amorim.\nAnd there was much to discuss about Dorgu's red card.\nAmorim stressed he saw no malice, explaining: \"He doesn't want to harm anyone. Sometimes you overdo it.\"\nSo, Amorim's fourth home Premier League win as United head coach had plenty of drama about it.\nBut it will take far more than this to sweep away the dark clouds currently hanging over Old Trafford.\nSix points separate eight teams - how race for Europe is shaping up\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

        "article_text": "A second runway at Gatwick Airport has been backed by government, providing measures to reduce noise are put in place.\nTransport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was \"minded to approve\" the expansion. Some MPs, local authorities and residents are strongly opposed.\nThe airport wants to move its northern runway, which is currently only used for taxiing or as a back up, and make it operational by the end of the decade.\nThe transport secretary's support does not guarantee the expansion will go ahead as it would still need planning permission.\nIf permission is granted, work would start almost immediately, the BBC understands. The \u00a32.2bn expansion will be funded through private investment.\n\"I am issuing a minded to approve decision that provides some additional time to seek views from all parties on the provisions, prior to a final decision,\" Alexander said in a written ministerial statement on Tuesday.\nGatwick has until 24 April to respond to demands for it to include measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport, in its overall plans before a final decision will be made in October.\nStewart Wingate, Gatwick Airport chief executive, said following the latest announcement that the government has \"outlined a clear pathway to full approval later in the year\" and that the airport would \"engage fully\" in the process.\nThe Transport Secretary's support for expansion comes as the government is looking at ways to boost economic growth in a bid to boost living standards, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves backing a third runway at Heathrow last month.\nGatwick, in West Sussex, is Europe's busiest single runway airport, with more than 40 million passengers using it last year.\nOn Tuesday, Alexander told industry leaders aviation was good for economic growth and said she was \"not some sort of flight-shaming eco warrior\".\nThe growth arguments for expanding Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK's two largest airports, differ with the former catering for more freight traffic relating to international goods trade. \nAn extra runway at Gatwick would see capacity increased for holidaymakers and business travellers, particularly for short-haul destinations, as opposed to Heathrow's longer-haul flights.\nGatwick managers have said that with 55 take-offs and landings in a busy hour, the airport is \"full\".\nBeing able to use both runways could increase the number of departures by 50,000 a year by the end of the 2030s, the airport argued. \nIt said some 30,000 of those flights are planned to depart from the north runway which will only be used for departures and not landings.\nBut there is strong opposition to any expansion, particularly from climate campaigners.\nGreenpeace UK policy director Douglas Parr said the extension would not drive economic growth. \"The only thing it's set to boost is air pollution, noise, and climate emissions,\" he added.\nAlex Chapman, senior economist at left-of-centre think tank New Economics Foundation, also argued the move would not create new jobs, but would just shift them from other parts of the country.\n\"People are already perfectly able to catch cheap flights on holiday or travel for business,\" he added.\nUnion Unite general secretary Sharon Graham backed Gatwick having a second runway, but warned it would need \"to come with guarantees of well paid, unionised jobs and proper facilities for workers\".\nBronwen Jones, development director at Gatwick, said a second runway would be \"a win for everyone\".\nShe said it would create more flight slots across both runways. \n\"That allows us to offer new routes, new airlines, more frequencies on existing routes, so that passengers have more choice.\"\nSally Pavey, chair of Communities Against Gatwick Noise Emissions (CAGNE), is worried about \"uncontrollable noise, ramifications on the roads, decline in air quality... and climate change\".\n\"We can't keep ignoring climate change and it would be wrong to allow a new 'bucket and spade' runway, as we put it, at the expense of residents and the economy,\" she said. \nThe group would take legal action through a judicial review if the expansion goes ahead, she added.\nGatwick said it has committed to reducing noise levels to below those of 2019 - which CAGNE says was one of the worst years for noise.\nOn Wednesday the government's independent advisers, the UK climate change committee (UKCCC), recommended that to meet the country's climate goals the amount of planet-warming gases released by the country's aviation sector needed to fall by 17% compared to 2003 levels.\nSome of the pollution from flying, it said, could be reduced by switching planes to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and by capturing the planet-warming gases released.\nBut experts think it could be challenging to obtain the feedstock, like corn grain or food waste, needed to make SAF.\nThe UKCCC said the best way to reduce the industry's impact on climate change would be to significantly slow the demand for flying.\nAt current levels demand is expected to grow by 53% by 2040, while the UKCCC says this should be closer to 16%.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

        "article_text": "Italian cuisine may be one of the most recognised and loved in the world \u2013 often imagined as a collection of ancient recipes and local traditions preserved by skilful nonnas over the centuries. But now, a food historian is exposing common myths and false stories, arguing that the Italian cuisine as we know it is barely a few decades old.\nFood is no doubt an integral part of the country's culture and identity \u2013 so much so that Italians cherish Neapolitan pizza or pasta alla carbonara as much as the great historical and artistic treasures of the boot-shaped peninsula. Tales abound of centuries-old local feuds over what city has the best filled pasta, while every local cheese or cured meat is likely to boast links to the Renaissance or the Middle Ages.\nAlberto Grandi, food historian and professor of economic history at the University of Parma, has been debunking Italian food myths for years. In 2018, Grandi published Denominazione di Origine Inventata (Invented Designation of Origin: The Lies of Marketing on Typical Italian Products) and later launched a podcast called DOI. But it was a 2023 interview with Financial Times that put Grandi's work into the spotlight and sparked wide debates across Italy.\nGrandi claimed in the interview that pasta alla carbonara was invented in Italy just after World War Two using US Army provisions like bacon and powdered egg yolks, countering the common belief that the authentic recipe includes pork jowl and Roman pecorino cheese. This theory is backed by other authors, like Luca Cesari in The Discovery of Pasta: A History in Ten Dishes, but caused outrage in a country increasingly obsessed with maintaining the lore of Italian authenticity in food. The discussion evolved into a heated Italian-American dispute about the origin of the iconic dish. \u00a0\nGrandi's latest book, La Cucina Italiana Non Esiste (Italian Cuisine Doesn't Exist), written with his podcast co-host Daniele Soffiati and published in April 2024, stirred new controversies with its provocative title.\u00a0\nThe idea that many beloved recipes and products such as cheeses or cured meats have hundreds of years of history, Grandi and Soffiati claim, is pure fantasy. Food is constantly changing and evolving. No product or recipe has always been as we know it now, and most dishes have a shorter history than most people imagine.\nGrandi argues that migration is what made Italian cuisine what it is today. Millions of people left Italy in the 19th and 20th Centuries, emigrating to South America, North America and European countries. They were leaving behind a country that was poverty-stricken, where the diet was limited to a handful of products. Pellagra, a disease caused by lack of vitamin B3, was endemic in several areas of Italy at the end of the 19th Century.\u00a0\nThe Italians who landed on New York's Ellis Island left hunger and misery behind. And it was in the \"new world\", Grandi argues, that Italian immigrants found the wealth and ingredients to create the recipes that eventually popularised Italian food worldwide.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nHowever, many Italians are not familiar with this history. They might imagine that their beloved recipes were born in Italy, passed down, unchanged, from generation to generation and eventually exported abroad by Italian migrants. \"It might seem that the rest of the world didn't know how to eat until all of a sudden Italians arrived,\" says Grandi. He believes it's pure myth \u2013 popularised by social media \u2013 that nonnas taught Americans how to cook rich, genuine Italian food.\nPizza is the most famous example of this. Born as a cheap street food in Naples, in the 19th Century it was almost synonymous with poverty and filth. Pizza is \"a crust of leavened bread dough, oven-toasted, with a sauce of a bit of everything on top\", wrote Pinocchio author Carlo Collodi in 1886. He added that pizza had \"an air of complex filth that perfectly matches that of its vendor\".\nIt was in America, says Grandi, that pizza became \"red\". While fresh tomatoes were among the original toppings, Italian immigrants to the US popularised pizza prepared with tomato sauce, a product that industrialisation made easy to access and store. And it was in the US that pizzerias really started to take off. \u00a0\nScholars call this process \"the pizza effect\": when a product leaves its place of origin, gets profoundly transformed and then returns to its place of origin to be fully embraced in a completely different form.\nGrandi also angered Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese producers when he argued that parmesan has evolved for the better over the last few decades, and the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese that was eaten in Italy 100 years ago and earlier \u2013 a smaller wheel with a black rind \u2013 is now only made in Wisconsin.\nThe shift in the Italian culinary landscape started with the rapid expansion that occurred in Italy post-WWII. The boom brought new possibilities to millions of Italians. Cars, supermarkets and refrigerators meant that people who were limited to a daily local supply could travel to restaurants, buy new products and create new recipes. Tiramisu, says Grandi, is a great example of this: a dessert created in the late 1960s that is based on supermarket ingredients and only possible with a refrigerator. \u00a0\u00a0\nWith the new products and brands also came marketing. \"Television influenced our cuisine and gastronomical identity greatly,\" says Grandi. He argues that most of Italy's gastronomic traditions were invented by food marketers. Carosello, a short television programme that aired in Italy every night from 1957 to 1977, introduced new products and brands through stories, sketches and iconic characters. Carosello provided the consumer education upon which Italian home cuisine was then built, especially by mothers and grandmothers.\nGrandi's book explains that when industry-driven growth started to lose steam in the 1970s, Italy's economy pivoted to small companies, niche products and local excellence. Thousands of protected labels and regional products emerged and Italians doubled down on gastro-nationalism.\n\"Cuisine is no longer part of our identity,\" says Grandi, \"it is our identity.\" He argues that after decades of industry decline and economic stagnation, Italians have no faith in the future \u2013 that's why they \"invent the past\".\nIn less than a century, Grandi says, Italians went from being malnourished migrants to self-appointed custodians of ancestral traditions. The obsession for tradition has sparked searches for \"true\" recipes and \"correct\" ways of consuming food. Italians are ever more adamant to say that bolognese should be called rag\u00f9 alla bolognese and never served with spaghetti. You should also never put chicken (let alone pineapple) on pizza, cook pasta alla carbonara with cream or break spaghetti in two.\n\"I always say that every time anyone in the world adds cream to carbonara, somebody in Rome dies,\" says Grandi. \"Italians used to get upset when they were defined as 'pizza, pasta, mandolin, mafia',\" he adds. \"Now it looks like it's us Italians feeding those stereotypes.\"\nSocial media seems to have contributed to popularising these attitudes. The X account Italians mad at food, launched in 2015, showcases comments of furious Italians who are outraged and offended by how people in other nations choose to eat \"their\" cuisine. The account even sells t-shirts with quotes like \"carbonara is not an opinion\" and \"you break spaghetti, you break my heart\".\nContent creators on platforms like TikTok and Instagram have popularised a genre of video content showing Italians reacting to food \"blasphemy\", with creators and celebrities vigorously showcasing their disgust and indignation \u2013 with no shortage of drama and hand gestures.\nThe popularity of these memes is now so widespread that people might think all Italians feel offended by people's choice of pasta sauce.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\n\"Food as entertainment can be triggering, especially for Italians,\" says Aurora Cavallo, a young Italian chef known as Cooker Girl, with more than 1.3 million followers on both TikTok and Instagram. \"For many people in the world, food isn't just an object but something that carries a lot of significance,\" she adds. \"In my experience, Italians can be more sensitive not just towards recipes, but also towards how food is handled on screen.\"\nGrandi's relentless debunking of Italian food myths has made many people angry over the last few years, but he is adamant that he just wants to dispute the invented history of many products and recipes, not their quality.\nAs social media demonstrates, however, some Italians have convinced themselves that food dogmas are more important than innovations or accuracy.\n\"We don't need to make up stories about Italy's amazing products,\" says Cavallo, echoing Grandi. \"We shouldn't create a situation in which changing recipes is the end of the world because that's the opposite of how Italian food came to be.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Bangkok-born actor Dom Hetrakul plays a hotel spa therapist in The White Lotus season three. Here are his top tips for visiting Phuket, Koh Samui and Bangkok.\nSince its tourism boom in the mid-20th Century, Thailand has become synonymous with paradisical landscapes and top-notch hospitality. In recent years, however, the Southeast Asian country has risen beyond its reputation as a spiritual and adventure haven, partially due to acclaimed film productions and influential names drawing attention to its unique culture.\nToday, the country's cultural influence has reached nearly every industry, from fashion to sports to entertainment. For a prime example, look no further than the highly anticipated third instalment of HBO's series The White Lotus, which premiered 16 February 2025. Following successful stopovers in Hawaii and Italy, season three features Thailand as its latest lush backdrop for intrigue and social satire. The islands of Koh Samui and Phuket are the main filming locations (with a smattering of scenes shot in Bangkok), while an ensemble of Thai actors including Blackpink's Lisa Manobal, Patravadi Mejudhon, Tayme Thapthimthong and actor, model and businessman Dom Hetrakul join the star-studded cast.\nBangkok-born Dom Hetrakul has built a portfolio as an actor, model and TV presenter while juggling his job as a motorcycle trading businessman. He has starred in several local and international productions, including Bangkok Dangerous (2008), Twilight Over Burma (2015) and The Family (2023). Hetrakul's most recent screen venture is HBO's The White Lotus season three, where he plays a Thai hotel spa attendant.\n\"The series is a very deep and dark comedy so it's going to be fun when it comes to Thailand, which has a different background compared to Hawaii and Sicily,\" says Hetrakul, who plays Pornchai, the beatific hotel spa therapist at the Thai branch of the fictional White Lotus resort. \"We have strong values and beliefs influenced by our religious background, but we're still dynamic in a way. That might be something very distinctive when you get close to the Thai community [and why] everyone is looking at Thailand as one of the most famous destinations for tourism.\"\nHetrakul, who was born in Bangkok and calls the city home, balances his career in entertainment with a job in the motorcycle trading business. But his packed schedule has never stopped him from travelling and finding inspiration in his home country: \"Apart from acting, sports and motorcycles take me everywhere. To find inspiration you need to get out of your comfort zone, that [means] more places and people to meet.\"\u00a0\nHere are Hetrakul's favourite places in Bangkok, Phuket and Koh Samui. \u00a0\nHome to the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui where much of the season's hotel scenes were filmed, Koh Samui is perhaps the ultimate White Lotus set-jetting destination. Indeed, a good deal of the season's drama and privileged behaviour unfolds on the palm-laden island, located in the Gulf of Thailand.\nMost visitors arrive in Koh Samui via the Samui International Airport, but ferries and other means of transportation are available from Surat Thani Province. \"You can take a cruise about 45 minutes from the mainland,\" Hetrakul says.\nWhile its rugged coastline, majestic mountain ranges and long, sandy beaches make it a travel-worthy getaway, the island's wellness offerings have stimulated tourism in recent years; something keenly noted in season three, with the surprise return of fan-favourite spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) from The White Lotus season one, whose story arc involves learning Thai wellness techniques from Hetrakul's Pornchai so she can improve her practice in Maui.\nKoh Samui's luxurious spas, remote resorts and holistic health centres provide wellness and spiritual therapies and retreats for meditation, Ayurvedic treatments and massages, but Hetrakul suggests immersing yourself in yoga. \"In Koh Samui, they have a lot of different training experiences like Thai boxing and yoga,\" he says. \"But [I'd recommend] yoga by the beach every morning with yogis from around the world... That's a very healthy community.\"\u00a0\nAddress: Ko Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nThai people's love for food runs deep so no trip to Thailand is complete without indulging in the country's culinary delicacies. \"Over here, we eat all day, all night \u2013 daytime, office hours \u2013 we just order food and eat all the time,\" Hetrakul says. \"Restaurants have to open all day.\"\nTip:\nIf you wish to experience one of Thailand's more emblematic celebrations, consider visiting during Songkran (Thai New Year). The festivities run between 13-15 April 2025 and celebrate the end of summer, welcoming the rainy season with water-pouring traditions. \"The Songkran Festival is chaotic in the best sense, to be honest,\" says Hetrakul. \"It's not really the traditional, soft [kind of experience]; it's [high power] stuff.\"\nWhile you'll have to watch the upcoming episodes to see the exact dishes and restaurants featured in The White Lotus season three, Koh Samui is packed with delicious food options from Western-style restaurants (Hetrakul likes\u00a0Summer by Coco Tam, The Shack and Gusto Italiano) to local eateries like Hetrakul's favourite island haunt, Jun Hom. The unassuming beachside spot is recognised for its seafood and homemade traditional dishes like pineapple fried rice, silver sillago fish and yum tua pu(wing bean salad). \"Everything is from the local fisherman's market,\" Hetrakul says, citing the Fisherman's Village Night Market, another go-to spot for foodies in Koh Samui \u2013 and rumoured to be the setting for some of season three's Songkran Festival shenanigans. \"Those aromatic herbs, spicy chillies and coconut milk on all sorts of fish, crabs, and prawns \u2013 you name it \u2013 Jun Hom makes [it].\"\nWebsite: https://www.facebook.com/JunhomKohSamui\nAddress: 7/3 Mu 5, Mae Nam, Ko Samui, 84330\nPhone: +66 77 602 008\nWhether at exclusive high-voltage clubs or vibrant festivals by the ocean, Thailand's much-revered party scene lives up to the hype. Previews of season three offer glimpses at the White Lotus' take on Thai nightlife; neon lights, fireworks and dance performances spice up the intricate plot entanglements in the trailer.\nTip:\nNightlife is at the core of the Thai travelling experience. \"You'll see the nightlife in the White Lotus season three,\" says Hetrakul. \"For some [previous portrayals onscreen] you might have seen The Hangover II or The Beach \u2013 that's how crazy we go. It depends on how you [pick] the places. You have premium clubs at hotels, but also very affordable places.\" If you're in Bangkok, he recommends checking out the options [on] Sukhumvit Road, one of the world's longest roads, which runs from Thailand to Cambodia.\nHetrakul's top Thai party hotspot is Ko Pha Ngan island, about 38km from Koh Samui \u2013 eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted Phangan Mantra Inn located near Ko Pha Ngan's Haad Rin Beach in the trailer's party scenes. \"[Koh Pha Ngan] is famous for the Full Moon Party,\" says Hetrakul, referring to the monthly festival-style beach parties that take over Haad Rin Beach every full Moon night or the day after. Locals and visitors celebrate by gathering around stages lined up across the shore for performances of various musical genres.\nFor those wary of big crowds \u2013 the parties attract thousands of attendants \u2013 Hetrakul has an insider tip. \"Now, people are trying to host more parties, they call them the Half Moon Parties,\" he says. \"Full Moon is more exposed to the public, so you expect the crowds, but Half Moon [celebrations] are less packed.\"\nAddress: Koh Phangan District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nAbout 30km north-west of Koh Samui lies the Mu Ko Ang Thong National Marine Park, an enclave of 42 islands surrounded by turquoise sea. The archipelago's clear-water shores welcome The White Lotus guests, serving as a fitting introduction to Thailand's stunning seascapes.\nThough camping areas and bungalows are available on Ko Wua Talap, the park's largest island,\u00a0 Hetrakul recommends planning a day trip to the archipelago to explore luscious tropical forests, azure beaches and rugged landscapes apt for any type of visitor, from those seeking a calm, stress-free retreat to adventure enthusiasts. \"There are white-sand beaches and mountain ranges on the island itself, so you can enjoy a beach tour or hiking, depending on which of those small islands you prefer,\" says Hetrakul. \"[Ang Thong National Park is also] great for snorkelling, diving, kayaking, canoeing or camping.\" For wildlife lovers, if you're lucky enough, you may even come across cadres of cute-looking spectacled leaf monkeys.\u00a0\nAddress: Koh Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nConnected to the mainland via the 600m-long Sarasin Bridge, Phuket is Thailand's largest island. It's also home to various locations featured in The White Lotus season three, from the opulent Michelin Guide-recommended Ta Khai restaurant, where characters are seen dining (and whining), to the Anantara Mai Khao Phuket resort, whose lavish spa serves as a backdrop for the interactions between Hetrakul's Pornchai and Rothwell's Belinda.\u00a0\n\"Phuket's [highlights] are the nightlife and the beach \u2013 Patong beach, the bars and clubs,\" Hetrakul says. However, those who venture beyond will be rewarded with splendid natural views and zealously protected greenery.\n\"About an hour's drive from Old Phuket Town, in the north of the island, there is a well-preserved mangrove forest called Baan Tha Chatchai,\" the actor says. Here, community-based ecotourism is king; away from crowds, visitors can engage in activities such as kayaking and canoeing along shallow and still waterways. \"Deep in the jungle it's very calm, so you don't have to worry too much. [For example,] in the western part of Thailand, the waves are stronger, [but this is] a different current.\"\nLocal dishes such as mee hokkien (chewy egg noodles) or Phuket lobster top off an excursion to the area. \"They have a lot of restaurants around, some deep in the forest. It's very very traditional \u2013 truly local \u2013 food,\" Hetrakul emphasises. \"They have seafood, fresh vegetables and fruit. But to be warned, the food is mostly spicy.\"\nAddress: Within Phuket Marine National Park Operation Centre 2, 92/7 Moo 5 Mai Khao, Thalang, Phuket 83110\nThailand's cultural appeal doesn't stop at its beloved spicy food and notoriously wild festivals. For decades, sports, especially Muay Thai, have driven the country's soft power strategy; in early February, the Thai government launched a year-long campaign titled Grand Tourism and Sports Year 2025, aimed at leveraging the sports calendar to boost tourism. The national passion for Muay Thai is reflected in The White Lotus season three, as various characters chat about the fights and take in a match at Phuket's Bangla Boxing Stadium Paton.\u00a0\nAs a sports enthusiast \u2013 he practices Muay Thai \u2013 Hetrakul encourages visitors to soak up Thailand's sports tradition and learn about its origins. \"We do lots of [sports but] Muay Thai, previously called Thai boxing, has become mainstream,\" he says. \"If you're a fan of UFC (mixed martial arts) fights, most elite athletes are here for training. If they're talking about the striking, Muay Thai [has] one of the best striking techniques.\"\nWhile you can witness Thailand's most famous combat sport or book a class nearly anywhere in Thailand \u2013 \"there are a lot of Muay Thai camps around [the country],\" Hetrakul says \u2013 the actor recommends stopping by the Rajadamnern Stadium in his hometown of Bangkok. Located just a few blocks from the Wat Benchamabophit temple, Rajadamnern was Thailand's first venue uniquely dedicated to Muay Thai and was responsible for introducing the sports' official ranking system and rule book. The stadium is also recognised for its architecture and circular ring \u2013 the only one of its kind in the world.\u00a0\nThe venue hosts combat every night, but Hetrakul advises visitors to get tickets for Friday and Saturday when the most anticipated clashes are generally scheduled.\nWebsite: https://rajadamnern.com/\nAddress: 8 Ratchadamnoen Nok Rd, Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Bangkok 10100\nInstagram: @rajadamnern_stadium\nProminently featured in season three's storyline, Thai wellness and healing practices need no introduction. Nuad Thai, or Thai massage, for example, was inscribed in 2019 on Unesco's List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This manual therapy, aimed at realigning a person's body and energy, is one of Thailand's most popular and widespread cultural attractions; Hetrakul's Pornchai even performs Nuad Thai on Rothwell's Belinda when showing her his \"signature treatment.\"\nThe Buddhist temple Wat Pho, credited as the birthplace of Nuad Thai, is Hetrakul's recommendation to experience and learn about Thai massage. The complex, which houses Bangkok's largest reclining Buddha, was the city's first public education centre. Inside, the walls document centuries of knowledge on Thai healing techniques with a series of engraved marble slabs dated to the 19th Century.\u00a0\nAs home to the Watpho Thai Traditional Medicine School, today the temple lures visitors interested in undergoing massage therapy. \"It's a place [to receive] traditional Thai massage,\" says Hetrakul. \"[But] they can [also] certify you with the approval of the Ministry of Health. You just need time to apply if you're interested in traditional Thai massage.\"\nWebsite: https://www.watpomassage.com/EN/about\nAddress: 392 / 33-34 Soi Pen Phat 1, Grand Palace, Maharat Road Phra Nakhon district, Bangkok 10200\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Four weeks after giving birth to her second child, Congresswoman Brittany Pettersen cradled her baby son in her arms as she cast a crucial vote on the House floor.\nUnable to vote remotely due to congressional rules, the Colorado Democrat flew across the country to oppose a multi-trillion-dollar budget deal, which narrowly passed in the House of Representatives.\n\"Unfortunately, I wasn't given the opportunity to vote remotely after giving birth, but I wasn't going to let that stop me from representing my constituents,\" Pettersen said on Tuesday.\nThe congresswoman - the 14th lawmaker to give birth while in office - now leads a bipartisan push for more flexibility for members with growing families.  \nIn January, she introduced legislation allowing proxy voting for up to 12 weeks for members  who have \"given birth or whose spouse have given birth and pregnant members who are unable to travel safely or have a serious medical condition\". The bill has 137 bipartisan co-sponsors.\nProxy voting - where a lawmaker designates another to vote on their behalf - was temporarily allowed during the pandemic, but current House rules prohibit it. \nThe restriction allowed some to see the unintended benefits of proxy voting for those recovering from childbirth or illness, but critics argued the policy was being abused.  \nMore than 100 Republican members of the House of Representatives, including current Speaker Mike Johnson, filed lawsuit to end the practice, arguing it was unconstitutional.\nThe legal argument failed, but when Republicans regained control of the House in 2023, former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy ended proxy voting. \nPettersen and another Republican congresswoman who gave birth in 2023 continue to push for flexibility for new parents on Capitol Hill. \nCongresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican who gave birth in 2023, missed 137 votes in the weeks after she gave birth. Doctors had advised her not to travel while recovering from a difficult birth.\nLuna called the inability to proxy vote a \"slap in the face to every constituent\" who elected her. \n\"How is it not discriminatory to tell a duly elected member of Congress that she can't vote because she gave birth to a child?\" she said in a video statement  last month. \"New mothers in Congress should not be forced to choose their careers over children or choose children over careers.\"\nBut Republican leadership has yet to budge.\n\"I have great sympathy, empathy for all of our young women legislators who are of birthing age. It's a real quandary,\" Johnson said in a statement last month. \"But I'm afraid it doesn't fit with the language of the Constitution, and that's the inescapable truth that we have.\"\nJean Sinzdak, associate director at the Center for American Women and Politics, said the pushback, in part, is cultural: many of the leaders of institutions like congress are older men who are not concerned about the trials of young parents and families.\n\"It doesn't behove the leaders of these institutions to change this process because it's not affecting them directly,\"  Ms Sinzdak told the BBC.\nThe UK parliament now  allows proxy voting for members of parliament who are new parents, experiencing childbirth complications or need fertility treatment. The European parliament currently has no provisions to allow heavily pregnant members to vote if they can't physically make it to Strasbourg, the formal seat of the office.\nPettersen and Luna are now trying to bypass Johnson and put the legislation  to a floor vote - it is a tough road but it may be their best shot unless the thinking surrounding proxy voting changes.

Instead of just hugging the star, the woman appeared to have kissed his face, with Jin responding by turning his face away.\nThe kiss angered other BTS fans, one of whom filed a criminal complaint against her, leading police to launch an investigation. \nOn 13 June, 2024, the day after he was discharged from the army, Jin, whose real name is Kim Seok-jin, held a fan event where he hugged 1,000 fans and performed songs in front of 3,000 others.\nDuring the three-hour long \"hugathon\", fans who won the chance to embrace him queued up and went on stage one by one to meet the 33-year-old star.\nBut one of them caused an uproar when she appeared to kiss Jin's face. \nClips of the moment went viral on the internet. Videos show that Jin, taken aback by the move, tried to turn his head while hugging the woman before quickly moving on to the next fan. Fans could also be seen reacting angrily to her actions. \nShe later wrote on her blog later that she kissed him \"on his neck\" and \"the skin was very soft\".\nThe woman's identity has not been revealed but police added that they had identified her with the assistance from their Japanese counterparts. \nThe BBC has reached out to BTS' agency HYBE for comment. \nJin is the first BTS member to have been discharged from military duty. He was followed by J-Hope who was discharged in October. The other four - V, RM, Jimin, Jungkook and Suga - are still serving and the band is expected to reunite only in June 2025.\nK-pop idols are known for having a close relationship with their fanbases through various communication channels and events. It's common for artists to communicate with fans through social media livestream chats and in-person events to cultivate loyal fans.\nBut fans and agencies have increasingly been aware of some toxic fan cultures as well. For example, many artists have been vocal about the stress caused by \"sasaeng fans\", who are overly obsessed with their idols that would stalk and harass the artists.",

        "article_text": "Beavers will be released into the wild in England after the government approved their reintroduction.\nThe decision follows years of trials and will see beavers make an officially approved return to waterways.\nHunted to extinction in Britain four hundred years ago, beavers have in the last two decades been making a comeback.\nBut some farmers are concerned that without proper management the large rodents could have negative impacts on food production.\n\nIt's thought that about five hundred beavers already live in England, some in the wild and others in enclosures. Many more are in Scotland, where wild releases are already permitted.\nConservationists call beavers \"ecosystem engineers\" because of how they redesign where they live. The dams they build slow the flow of rivers and streams and create habitats where other creatures can thrive. They've also been credited with reducing flooding further downstream. \n\"This is an incredibly exciting moment, a real landmark for nature recovery in England,\" Tony Juniper, the head of Natural England, told me next to a beaver dam in Devon. \n\"We're bringing back a missing animal that's been absent for centuries, and an animal that we know will bring huge benefits for the rest of the wildlife that is already depleted across much of England,\" he says.\nThe beavers will be released under a licensing system overseen by Natural England. \nIt says long term plans will need to be in place to avoid impacts on farming, food production and infrastructure. \nThat's something the National Farmers Union say is vital. It wants culling beavers  to be an option if they prove disruptive.\nNFU Deputy President David Exwood said that while beavers could provide certain benefits, \"we are concerned about the negative impacts beavers can have on productive farmland, as well as the management requirements, costs and risks involved\". \n\"Beavers can flood and waterlog fields, feed on agricultural crops like maize, as well as damage and fell trees such as cricket bat willow.\"\nWe met up with Tony Juniper of Natural England at the site of the pilot project for wild beaver release in England, the River Otter catchment in Devon. Beavers first appeared here more than a decade ago - it's not clear where they came from. They may have escaped from enclosures or have been illegally released, so called \"beaver bombing\".\nSince then the wild beavers have been allowed to stay, with their impact on the landscape and the way they interact with local farmland closely monitored.\n\"All of this open water is down to the beavers,\" Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust tells me as we splash our way through the boggy land.\n\"They want this water because it makes them feel safe and secure. It means that they can transport their food as well.\"\nAlong the River Otter Mr Burgess tells me the beavers have created wetlands that now host species such as great white egrets and kingfishers. Dragonfly numbers have soared as have frogs and toads. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.\nNot everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.\nClinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running. Though broadly supportive of the beavers' return there are concerns about whether enough thought has been given to managing their impacts.\n\"We've also seen farmland flooded, we've seen properties flooded. We've seen people's trees in their gardens felled,\" says John Varley, the chief executive of Clinton Devon Estates.\n\"There are positives with the beaver, huge positives, but there's also some quite significant negatives, particularly for small farmers.\"\nScotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. In some areas the beavers have been so successful at breeding that they have had to be relocated or as a last resort culled.\nThe first wild release of beavers in England is now expected to take place in the next few days. Dr Roisin Campbell-Palmer from the Beaver Trust, which is managing the release, told the BBC the male and female had been taken from \"conflict sites\" in Scotland and were now undergoing medical checks ahead of being moved south. \nAdditional reporting by Kevin Church.",

        "article_text": "Amazon has become the third tech giant in as many months to announce a breakthrough in quantum computing - a technology that promises vast processing power but is beset by technical difficulties.\nThe firm has unveiled Ocelot a prototype chip built on \"cat qubit\" technology - an approach that derives its name from the famous \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\" thought experiment.\nThe chip seeks to address one of the biggest stumbling blocks to the development of quantum computers - making them error free.\nAmazon says, taken alongside other recent breakthroughs in the industry, its work means useful quantum computers are likely to be with us sooner than previously thought.\nBut how quickly these machines will be powerful enough to be practically useful for a range of commercial applications is a matter of debate among experts.\nOskar Painter of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Center for Quantum Computing at the California Institute of Technology, where the work was carried out, told the BBC that recent progress meant an \"aggressive date\" of a decade was now \"looking more and more realistic\". \n\"Five years ago I would have said maybe 20 or 30 years\", he said but added \"this timeline's come in quite a bit.\"\nUltimately AWS, which provides cloud computing services, would like to offer quantum computing services to its customers, but Mr Painter also said he believed the advanced machines could eventually help optimise the vast global logistics of Amazon's retail business.\n\"You know, a company like Amazon, you make a one percent improvement in that and you're talking large dollars right? Quantum computers could enable you to do that more effectively, more real time - and that's the real value there,\" he explained.\nQuantum computers solve problems by exploiting the strange properties of matter and energy at very small scales, as described by the science of quantum physics.\nQuantum computers won't replace so-called \"classical\" computers, but promise to be able to solve problems even the most powerful modern computers cannot - yielding new discoveries such as better batteries and new medicines.\nBut that potential is being held up by the problem of errors.\nQuantum computers are extremely sensitive to noise in their environment - vibrations, heat, electromagnetic interference from mobile phones and WIFI networks, or even cosmic rays and radiation from outer space can all cause them to make errors, which then need to be corrected.\nCat qubits are one attempt at solving this problem by engineering error resistance into the design of the qubits it uses.\nQubits are the fundamental elements of quantum computers, the equivalent of bits in the computers most of us use today.\nCat qubits are named in honour of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, whose cat-in-a-box question in 1935 helped illuminate some of the thinking behind quantum theory. \nAmazon believes the new chip, which has just five cat qubits out of a total of 14 key components, could reduce the costs of correcting quantum errors by up to 90%, compared to current approaches.\nThe technology of cat qubits isn't exclusive to Amazon, a French company named Alice & Bob carried out pioneering work on the tech and continues to evolve the technology.\nMazyar Mirrahimi director of research at the French national technology research institute, Inria said Ocelot was \"an important step forward towards hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation\".\nAmazon believes the new chip offers a path to scaling up to more powerful machines with this type of error proofing built in, but researchers admit there are many challenges ahead.\nMichael Cuthbert director of the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre welcomed the progress Amazon had made but told the BBC it remained to be seen the effect it would have on the speed with which the industry is able to develop really useful quantum computers:\n\"Error correction is a vital step necessary in the long-term development of quantum computing. It is the crucial step that turns quantum computing into a practical and commercial tool we can use to solve complex problems in chemistry, materials science, medicine, logistics and energy.\" \n\"Part of the challenge is how to scale the revolutionary technology efficiently \u2013 mechanisms that enable error correction without huge overheads in chip size, energy consumption and systems complexity are really welcome.\"\nAmazon researchers have published their findings in a research paper in the scientific journal Nature\nAmazon joins Microsoft and Google in announcing a new experimental chip. But is this flurry of announcements the result of clever research or clever PR? Or is it  coincidence, the tech equivalent of the saying buses always come in threes? \nHeather West follows the quantum computing industry as a research manager for the International Data Corporation and was briefed on the new chip by Amazon in advance of publication.\nShe describes Amazon's results as an \"advancement\" rather than a breakthrough. \nAll three recent announcements have focused on reducing errors, and she tells me the industry is \"pivoting\" from a focus on the number of qubits to a focus the \"ability to use these these systems at scale to solve real world life problems. And by doing so we need to be able to solve the error correction within the quantum systems\".\nHowever Mr Painter agreed \"100%\" that it wouldn't be easy to scale up today's experimental systems.

Beijing denies all of the allegations. \nIt is the first time Thailand has deported Uyghurs since 2015. \nThe deportation has been shrouded in secrecy after serious concerns were raised by the United States and United Nations.\nThai media reported that several trucks, some with windows blocked with sheets of black plastic, left Bangkok's main immigration detention centre in the early hours of Thursday morning.\nHours later, tracker Flightrader24 showed an unscheduled China Southern Airlines flight leaving Bangkok, eventually arriving in Xinjiang. It was not immediately clear how many people had been deported. \nThe Thai government later said it had decided to send the 40 Uyghurs back to China because it was not right that they had been held for more than a decade, but that no other third country had stepped forward offering to take them. That includes Turkey, which has given Uyghurs asylum in the past. \nEight Uyghurs remain in Thailand, including five who are serving jail terms for crimes they committed while in detention. \nThe government also said that Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was given assurances that the Uyghurs would be looked after if returned to China during her recent visit to the country. \nShe did not initially confirm any deportations had taken place when asked by reporters on Thursday.\n\"In any country in the world actions must adhere to the principles of law, international processes, and human rights,\" Shinawatra said.\nBeijing said that 40 Chinese illegal immigrants were repatriated from Thailand, but refused to confirm that the group were Uyghurs. \n\"The repatriation was carried out in accordance with the laws of China and Thailand, international law and international practice,\" the foreign ministry said. \nChinese state media said the group had been \"bewitched\" by criminal organisations and were stranded in Thailand after illegally leaving the country.\nThe returned group is made up of more than 300 Uyghurs who were detained at the Thai border in 2014 after fleeing repression in Xinjiang. \nMany were sent to Turkey, while others were deported back to China in 2015 - prompting a storm of protest from governments and human rights groups.\n\"What is the Thai government doing?\" asked opposition lawmaker Kannavee Suebsang on social media on Thursday.\n\"There must not be Uyghur deportation to face persecution. They were jailed for 11 years. We violated their human rights for too long.\"\nThe detention centre where the Uyghurs - who had been charged with no crime, apart from entering Thailand without a visa - were kept was known to be unsanitary and overcrowded. Five Uyghurs died in custody.\nIn a statement on Thursday, Human Rights Watch said the group now face a high risk of torture, enforced disappearance and long-term imprisonment.\n\"Thailand's transfer of Uyghur detainees to China constitutes a blatant violation of Thailand's obligations under domestic and international laws,\" said the organisation's Asia director, Elaine Pearson.\n\"Until yesterday [Wednesday], senior Thai officials had made multiple public assurances that these men would not be transferred, including to allies and UN officials.\"\nPhil Robertson, director of the Asia Human Rights and Labour Advocates (AHRLA) group, said that the deportations \"totally destroyed\" the \"charade\" that the current Thai government was different to the previous one \"when it comes to transnational repression and cooperating with authoritarian neighbours\". \nAmnesty International described the deportations as \"unimaginably cruel\".\nOn Thursday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned Thailand for the deportation and urged \"all governments in countries where Uyghurs seek protection not to forcibly return ethnic Uyghurs to China.\"\nHe accused China of having \"committed genocide and crimes against humanity targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other members of ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang\" in a statement published online.\nThe UN said it \"deeply regrets\" the deportations, a phrase echoed by the EU.\nMeanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK disagrees \"in the strongest terms\" with Thailand's decision.\nThere are about 12 million Uyghurs, mostly Muslim, living in Xinjiang, which is officially known as the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).\nThe Uyghurs speak their own language, which is similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. They make up less than half of the Xinjiang population.\nRecent decades have seen a mass migration of Han Chinese (China's ethnic majority) into Xinjiang, allegedly orchestrated by the state to dilute the minority population there.\nChina has also been accused of targeting Muslim religious figures and banning religious practices in the region, as well as destroying mosques and tombs.\nWith additional reporting by Thanyarat Doksone in Bangkok",

She said she wanted to see the company lead by making a more robust business case for the programmes. \n\"They've made the right moves. The one step they could go further... is to really say, 'Yes it's our values, we believe it's the right thing to do, but it's also an economic imperative.\"\nThe fight over DEI in the US has raised questions about whether such policies in other countries will face similar challenges. \nCatherine Howarth, chief executive of the responsible investment charity ShareAction, said she thought that Apple - a global, consumer-facing firm - had made the bet that the benefits of pushing back against the shareholder proposal outweighed the risks. \n\"It's not popular with consumers and it's not popular with employees to abandon what were supposedly your principles in this area until very recently,\" she said.\n\"They think it would go down very badly - and it would - with their global consumer base.\"\nShareholders also rejected proposals that would have required Apple to report about its AI privacy practices, charitable giving and policies to combat child sex abuse. \nThey backed the board members supported by the company, as well as its executive compensation, including a pay package for Mr Cook worth more than $74m.

However, they last played in the country in 2009, while they last went to Hong Kong in 2013.End of season timeline17 May: FA Cup final21 May: Europa League final25 May: Final Premier League games31 May: Champions League final2-10 June: International break15 June - 13 July: Club World Cup Mid-July: Pre-season matches begin9 August: Community Shield16 August: Start of 2025-26 Premier League seasonRelated topicsManchester UnitedFootball'A decade of mismanagement' - Man Utd reveal revenue dropPublished7 days agoTeam must take responsibility for Man Utd problems - AmorimPublished20 hours agoModern players find criticism offensive - Ten HagPublished10 hours agoMore on this storyLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan viewsGet Man Utd news notificationsPublished26 July 2022",

But the radioactive material is all produced by ageing reactors outside the UK, and sometimes the supply is interrupted.\nDr Tom Wallace-Smith, technical director of Bristol's Astral Systems, said they developed a technique that produces the material here in the UK.\nHe said this has the potential to \"eliminate the delays that have plagued\" cancer treatments.\nThe team in Bristol have come up with a whole new approach, using nuclear fusion rather than fission.\nAnd rather than requiring a new nuclear plant, which would cost about \u00a3400m to build, they can develop the material in small plants \"right by hospitals\" for about \u00a31m, Dr Wallace-Smith said.\nEvery year, radiologists scan about 300,000 patients using these radioactive radioisotopes, with consultants saying they would not be able to do their work without them.\nIn October, the world of nuclear medicine was hit by a major crisis. Outside the niche speciality, few noticed because doctors and health managers implemented a rapidly assembled rationing system for vital scans.\nBritain gets all of its supply from three reactors in Europe. In October two of them shut down for planned maintenance at the same time, and then the third sprung a fault.\n\"Something like 75% of our supply was lost,\" said Dr Stephen Harden, from the Royal College of Radiologists.\nAll patients needing urgent diagnostic scans were seen on time, but thousands of more routine check-ups were delayed.\nThe interruption only lasted three weeks, but it highlighted what Dr Harden called the \"ageing and fragile\" supply chain.\nHe explained: \"It makes a really strong case for making these radioisotopes in the UK.\"\nIn 2017 a UK Government report said six nuclear reactors made 85% of the radioisotopes used worldwide. By 2030, five of them will be retired.\nMany of these reactors were built in the 1960s and 1970s.  Building a new one is expensive and takes years. \nIn North Wales, there are plans to build such a reactor, which will cost \u00a3400m. \nLike all nuclear fission plants, they are controversial. Their raw material is uranium, and the radioisotopes they produce are, by design, radioactive.\nAstral Systems has developed technology that can now make the same radioisotopes used in hospitals, on demand.\nSmall reactors could be built for under \u00a31m, less than the price of the scanner that uses the radioactive product.\nNow, the team is building a new kind of fusion reactor, which will be able to produce any kind of radioisotope for research or medicine, right by the hospitals that need it.\nAt the Bristol Royal Infirmary, I watched as a patient lay on the scanner bed, ready for his session. He was fully clothed, but the vital preparation was internal.\n\"Three hours before the scan, we inject patients with a tiny amount of radioactivity,\" explained consultant radiologist, Dr Randeep Kulshrestha.\nThe radioisotope is tagged to substances that will go to whatever area doctors are interested in, for example the bones.\nThe camera will then pick up the radioactivity in such a way that doctors can see how, for example, a cancer has spread.\nDr Kulshrestha showed me pictures taken from an anonymous patient, where doctors suspected cancer had spread from his prostate to his bones.\nSadly for the person involved, the images are stark. Areas on the bones are lit up orange, where the cancer has grown on their bones.\n\"These radioisotopes form a vital part of the diagnostic process\", Dr Kulshrestha told me. \n\"We couldn't work without them these days.\"\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

It ripped the club apart.\"\nMillwall, who face London rivals Crystal Palace in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Saturday (12:15 GMT, live on BBC One), are still coming to terms with the loss of the popular keeper who everyone called 'Mati'.\n\"I remember seeing the news come through on social media,\" says Clarke. \"My son and I were in total shock.\"\nMillwall goalkeeper Sarkic dies aged 26\nWolves lead tributes to Matija Sarkic after death\nTen days before he died, Sarkic played for Montenegro against Belgium in a friendly in Brussels\nMarshall was at home with his partner Jasmine when his mobile phone started ringing early in the morning on 15 June 2024.\n\"It was 06:57. As I went to pick it up it rang off. It was Mati's father Bojan. I texted him 'is everything ok?' and he immediately rang back.\"\nTen days earlier Marshall had been at the King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels to see Sarkic produce a man-of-the-match performance in Montenegro's friendly against a Belgium, external side that included Kevin de Bruyne and Leandro Trossard.\nBelgium won 2-0 but Millwall's goalkeeper, who dreamed of playing in the Premier League, earned rave reviews for his display - with one report noting that it felt like Sarkic had \"come of age\".\n\"We spoke the day after the game,\" adds Marshall.\n\"We were making plans for the following season, how we were trying to push Millwall towards the Premier League and Mati towards the Premier League because that was the long-term goal.\n\"I told him to go and enjoy the summer and that we'd chat when we met up again at Millwall for pre-season training.\"\nIt was their last conversation together.\nSarkic was given permission to miss Montenegro's next game, a friendly against Georgia, to be best man at the wedding of his twin brother Oliver - the former Blackpool and Burton midfielder - in Guimaraes, northern Portugal, on 8 June.\nA week later Sarkic died in the coastal town of Budva on the Adriatic coast.\nHe had been on holiday with his partner Phoebe as well as former Aston Villa defender Oscar Borg and Borg's girlfriend.\nHis family were told he suffered sudden heart failure.\n\"After the phone call with Bojan I was traumatised,\" says Marshall. \"I broke down crying.\"\nSarkic is congratulated by his Millwall team-mates after saving a penalty at Birmingham City in September 2023\nSarkic was born in Grimsby in 1997 and spent his early childhood in London before moving to Brussels, where his father was Montenegro's ambassador.\nHe joined Anderlecht's academy at the age of eight and spent 10 years with them before returning to England in 2015 to sign for Aston Villa, where he first encountered Marshall.\n\"My first impression of Mati? A smart young man who was very clever, very well educated and who was eager to learn,\" says Marshall, who was Millwall's 2004 FA Cup final goalkeeper.\n\"Immediately we had a good rapport and a very good understanding of one another. I could see the potential in him.\"\nLoan spells at non-league Stratford Town and Havant & Waterlooville played a part in Sarkic's football education, as did a short stint at Wigan.\nBy now a pattern was beginning to emerge despite his career being at the fledgling stage. Sarkic was well liked wherever he went.\n\"He was just so popular with everybody,\" adds Marshall.\nHe made the permanent switch to neighbours Wolves in 2020, external without making a senior appearance for Villa.\nSarkic was fluent in English, French, Dutch and Montenegrin.

The following day a memorial service was organised by the Football Association of Montenegro and was attended by the country's president.\nSoon afterwards Millwall, whose owner and chairman John Berylson died from injuries sustained after his car overturned in July 2023, announced they would retire Sarkic's number 20 shirt.\nWhen the players returned for pre-season training on 26 June - 11 days after their team-mate's death - they joined all club staff for a minute's silence.\nSarkic's parents, Bojan and Natalie, brothers Oliver and Danilo, and partner Phoebe, were at The Den for the visit of Watford on the opening weekend of this season when Millwall paid tribute to Sarkic.\nWatford fans unfurled a banner which read: 'RIP Matija Sarkic'.\n\"It was hugely appreciated and a class act.

        "article_text": "Looking through the comments on her social media posts can be an emotional rollercoaster for Miah Carter.\nThe 21-year-old influencer posts makeup, body positivity and lip-sync content for her 3.3m followers on TikTok, but says her success online comes with constant abuse.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Miah said she received abusive comments \"every second, every day\u2026 the trolling I get is disgusting\".\nShe was speaking as Ofcom launched new draft guidance aimed at improving the experience of women and girls online.\nDame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom's chief executive, has said the draft guidelines issued on Tuesday will - if tech firms adopt them - be a \"proper blueprint\" for protecting women and girls online.\nThe broadcasting watchdog's guidance ranges from measures to tackle online misogyny to steps intended to address intimate image abuse.\nBut Samantha Miller, from the National Police Chiefs' Council, told Radio 5 Live the UK could not \"police its way through this\".\nSpeaking to Nicky Campbell on a special programme discussing women and girls' safety online, she said they needed \"all of the agencies to be part of this with us\".\n\"You have to have some control that when it gets to more extreme harmful behaviours, speeches, vilifications, especially based on gender,\" she said.\n\"It cannot be down to women to police this, it's got to be down to the platforms.\"\nOfcom's Online Safety lead Jess Smith said she \"completely agreed\".\n\"That's what the guidance we've put out today is trying to do,\" she said.\n\"Where stuff is illegal, the law of the country applies and we will take steps to enforce the rules.\"\nAsked about how confident she was that social media firms would improve women's safety online safeguarding minister Jess Phillips told the programme \"hope springs eternal.\"\n\"We have to see how well the tech companies actually respond to this,\" she said, adding: \"One of the people who abused me online owns one of them.\"\nShe previously told the BBC \"disinformation\" spread by X owner Elon Musk was \"endangering\" her.\nPhillips said she was \"tired of looking at ways to just put nicer plasters on a problem\" when dealing with the wider issue of women's safety.\n\"The government will intend to turn the lens around and have a real focus on prevention,\" she said.\nMiah told the BBC that messages left under her posts included comments encouraging her to take her own life, and personal attacks on her appearance.\n\"When I first started social media, my following came really quickly,\" she said. \"With that, the hate [comments] came coming in.\n\"Back then, I didn't understand it. I didn't know how to deal with my emotions. It really affected my mental health and I had suicidal thoughts.\n\"Now I've learned to ignore the comments and if I can be bothered, I delete them.\"\nOfcom has previously issued guidance to tech firms around protections for children online and on dealing with illegal online content.\nSpeaking to Radio 5 Live, Dame Melanie said the organisation would \"absolutely\" name and shame companies who didn't comply with their guidance, so the public would know which companies were \"not taking [user's safety] seriously\".\nThe regulator wants sites and apps to adopt these measures voluntarily in what they call \"a safety by design approach\". For example, they could adopt \"abusability\" testing to identify how a service or feature could be exploited by a malicious user.\nRules in the Online Safety Act, due to come into force this year, will compel social media firms to show that they are removing illegal content - such as child sexual abuse, material inciting violence and posts promoting or facilitating suicide. The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography.\nContent creator Harriet Maynard has also experienced abusive comments, which sometimes escalate into pile-ons - where a large number of people harass a person online.\nHer Instagram posts are aimed at a female audience and relate to issues around parenthood and lifestyle content.\nDespite having mainly female followers, when a video of Harriet's goes viral, she says she receives \"an influx of negative messages, primarily from men\".\n\"I normally don't let it bother me, but when you get a wave of online abuse, it can get you down.\n\"In a 'normal' workplace, if you were being bullied or harassed, then there'd be an HR department to deal with it accordingly. But for us making content online for a living, there's nothing like that.\"\nNicole Jacobs, domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales, welcomes the draft guidance.\n\"I'm pleased that Ofcom are stepping up to start the process of providing guidance to tech companies to tackle this,\" she said. \"It's now on these firms to implement these recommendations and ensure that perpetrators can no longer weaponise online platforms for harm.\n\"By taking meaningful practical action, not only will people be safer online, but it will demonstrate that tech companies are ready to play their part in tackling domestic abuse.\"\nProf Clare McGlynn, an expert in sexual violence, online abuse and the legal regulation of pornography, says she feels the guidance, which has no legal force, will struggle to make meaningful change.\n\"Experience shows that tech platforms do the absolute minimum necessary to comply with the law and little more. In the current climate, this is unlikely to change,\" she said.\n\"We urgently need to do more by strengthening regulation, making many of these recommendations legally binding. A dedicated Online Safety Commission which prioritises online harms would be a positive next step. \"\nSome of the suggestions to tech companies from Ofcom include:\nWhile a report from Ofcom shows women are five times more likely to suffer intimate image abuse and are more likely to report being negatively affected by harms experienced online than men, Dame Melanie said the guidance was not about \"women versus men or demonising men\".\n\"I think many men are really concerned about this as well. And that wider culture that's going on online, I just don't think it's healthy for anybody.\n\"The misogyny that's becoming normalised in some parts of the internet, that's not great for boys. It's not going to help them to form proper, strong, healthy relationships as they grow up. So I really hope men will get involved in this too.\"\nHarriet believes some of the suggestions by Ofcom would be ineffectual, such as popups on screen to make users consider if they wish to post abusive comments.\n\"I don't think these kind of people worry if they're going to offend someone by doing what they're doing. They hide behind their keypads. Complete cowards,\" she says.\nHowever, she would welcome more protections for women experiencing pile-ons if they were built into social media platforms, adding users should be able to protect themselves from \"pure abuse\".\nMiah feels the guidance may make some difference, if companies choose to follow it.\n\"I'd like to see tech companies do more,\" she says, \"[Ofcom has] a huge challenge, but real change is possible if they hold platforms accountable.\n\"Right now, reporting hate often leads nowhere - there needs to be stricter enforcement and actual consequences for harmful behaviour.\"\nIn a statement given to the BBC, Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, said: \"We remove any language that incites or facilitates serious violence, disable accounts, and work with law enforcement when we believe that there is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety.\n\"We continue to work with women's safety groups to understand the different ways harassment towards women can show up, while improving our technology to find and remove abuse more quickly.\"\nThe BBC has also contacted other social media companies, including TikTok and X, for comment.\nIf you have been affected by issues raised in this article, help and support can be found on the BBC action line website.\nRadio 5 Live's Nicky Campbell is being joined by a panel of experts and a studio audience to discuss women and girls' safety online, in public spaces and at home.

But we will also protect our consumers and businesses at every turn. They expect no less from us.\"\nTariffs are a tax on imports that is collected by the government and paid for by the companies bringing in the goods. \nTrump has vowed to use the levies to boost US manufacturing, raise money and push other countries to change policies he opposes. \nBut there are concerns such measures could fuel inflation, with warnings that Americans could face higher prices for goods as businesses may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers.\nSince taking office, he has raised tariffs of 10% on goods from China and taken steps to hit other imports with duties, including directing his staff to develop recommendations for custom \"reciprocal\" tariffs for each country.\nBut he has also suspended some of those plans, leaving many businesses and analysts guessing as to whether he is prepared to carry out his threats.\n\"The 25% threat that he threw out today is in line with the high end of the range that he previously indicated,\" said Tobin Marcus, head of US policy and politics at Wolfe Research. \n\"It's a number that's concerning - certainly should be concerning - for the trans-Atlantic trade relationship, but not totally out of the blue.\"\nAntonin Finkelnburg, of the Federation of German Wholesale, Foreign Trade and Services which represents businesses, told the BBC that a 25% tariff on EU goods entering the US would created a \"difficult\" but \"not an impossible\" situation for Germany's economy.\n\"We are worried but we shouldn't be afraid,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.\nGermany's car industry's products are popular in the US.\nMr Finkelnburg said many German car manufacturers were \"already producing in the American market, so they wouldn't be directly affected by the tariffs\", but said tariffs would still drive up prices.\n\"The car parts that are manufactured in to those cars are crossing the borders of Mexico and Canada several times so that already is driving the prices up,\" he added.\nEarlier this month, Trump ordered 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, America's top two trading partners. But he suspended the duties before they went into effect until 4 March, to allow for talks on border security. \nOn Monday, Trump said he expected tariffs of 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada to come into effect \"on schedule\". \nAt Wednesday's meeting, when asked for an update, he said the 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada would go into effect on 2 April.\nThat is the same day that the Commerce Department is supposed to deliver its wider recommendations for \"reciprocal\" tariffs. \nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters that \"the overall is April 2\" , distinguishing between tariffs tied to concerns about drug trafficking and migration from Mexico and Canada.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all headed lower in mid-day trade, while the peso and Canadian dollar gained.

        "article_text": "The Jane Austen-hits-LA comedy changed fashion, language and cinema. As it turns 30 and a new stage musical version opens, its writer and director discusses why it's so personal to her.\nBack in 1995, Clueless offered a cheeky update of Jane Austen's Emma in a Los Angeles high school and, without even seeming to try, revolutionised how we dress and talk. Tartan and preppy chic are still huge (note the blazer and mini-skirt wore by Taylor Swift in London last August, or the pop star's yellow-and-black combo at an MTV awards do in September). Meanwhile, \"As if!\", the catchphrase of its heroine Cher, which originated as a piece of Californian slang, has become ubiquitous. Will you be spared the phrase in this article? As if!\nBecause the film is brightly coloured and revolves around teenage girls, some critics at the time undersold the sharpness of its satire, which targets (among other things) white, west coast privilege, the plastic surgery industry, celebrity do-gooding, taboos surrounding menstruation, the cruelly low wages of teachers, and the kind of Nietzsche-reading liberal male who feels compelled to grow a goatee.\u00a0\nThe popularity of Clueless triggered a rash of insouciantly smart high-school-meets-classic literature movies (including 10 Things I Hate About You, Cruel Intentions, and Easy A, to name but a few). Just as importantly, it started a trend for films and TV shows that focussed on friendships between teenage girls. Thanks not only to the script but also a flawless cast and tip-top soundtrack (so\u00a0much Radiohead), audiences of all ages found themselves rooting for salty protagonists, Cher, Dionne and Tai, who dominate the proceedings in a way that hadn't been seen before in a mainstream US film. Yes, there's a rom-com element to the plot, but it's the tensions between the girls that generate the most heat. Cher's complex interactions with Dionne and Tai paved the way for Buffy and Willow's textured relationship in the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Also, not to be bitchy, but without Clueless there'd be no Mean Girls. And Olivia Wilde cited it as an inspiration for her riotous directing debut, Booksmart, itself a modern teen movie classic.\u00a0\nYet 70 year-old\u00a0Amy Heckerling, the film's writer-director, claims she had no idea Clueless would be a hit. \"Nobody is ever sure of that,\" she tells the BBC. \"Well, maybe some people are sure of it. Not me.\" Nor does she know if a new West End musical based on the film, for which she wrote the book, will click with audiences; it is currently running in previews ahead of an opening night in March. What matters, she says, is that she enjoyed working on both projects. She says of the musical, \"It will either work or it won't, but I'm loving doing it.\" As for the film, \"I have to admit, on that shoot I was happier than I've ever been. There were no big prima donnas. It was the closest I've ever come to imagining a movie in my brain and seeing it unfold\u00a0exactly\u00a0how I imagined.\"\nIn the last three decades there's also been a three-season Clueless TV show, a book series, and another go at a stage musical, which premiered on Broadway in 2018. Still, it's the original film we keep coming back to and that Heckerling, Zooming from her home in New York, wants to discuss.\u00a0\nAs in Austen's 1815 novel, the plot revolves around a self-absorbed daddy's girl. Cher (Alicia Silverstone; putty-soft and irresistible) bombs around Beverly Hills with best-friend Dionne (Stacey Dash; poised), obsessed with matchmaking and make-overs. Cher is determined to \"help\" a new girl at school \u2013 dishevelled New Yorker Tai (Brittany Murphy; volcanically beguiling) \u2013 and proceeds to treat Tai like a toy. That is, until Tai fights back and Cher, her mind blown, realises that Tai is her equal. Which is where Heckerling veers off from Austen (whose heroine is ultimately horrified by her protege's \"notions of self-consequence\"). Here's the truth about Clueless. It's not as good as Emma. It's way better.\u00a0\nHeckerling suspects that the film has such a loyal following (and keeps picking up new acolytes) because its \"two princesses\", Cher and Dionne, are so human: \"They rag on each other like real friends do.\" She thinks it's stayed relevant because space is given to characters who \"care about the environment\", including Cher's ex-step-brother, Josh, (played by sexy goofball Paul Rudd) and Cher's Greenpeace-supporting teacher, Miss Geist (a delightfully frazzled but unbowed Twink Caplan). Heckerling says, \"Having those people worry about stuff like that makes the audience relate to them. Well, that's what I've always assumed. I'm not a major activist, but I care about a lot of things.\" Heckerling is also proud of the film's many \"wonderful\" teens, some of them gay \u2013 like the closeted, blazingly charismatic Christian (Justin Walker) \u2013 others broke and scruffy, like lollygagging stoner Travis (Breckin Meyer).\u00a0\nBorn in the Bronx, to an often cash-strapped family, the pale and petite Heckerling has never felt like a top dog and happily acknowledges that her status as an outsider bled into Clueless's sly take on class conflict. She says that when she first went to California, to attend the American Film Institute, people made fun of how she talked. \"They'd go, 'Amy, you want some [she adopts a cartoonish New York accent] quawfee?' Their attitude was like, 'You're talking some old-fashioned, lower-class, New York language. What planet are you from?'\" On the one hand, it was wounding. On the other hand, she wanted to find a way to fight back: \"I didn't feel like I wanted to change how I spoke or who I was.\"\nAmy Heckerling's Five Culture Shifters\nFranz Kafka\n\nFranz Kafka changed modern literature\u2026 OK, maybe Joyce did that, too, but wouldn't you rather read Kafka? It's not even like reading, it's like entering a nightmare with a sense of humour. And I think most adolescents can relate to waking up from troubling dreams to find they've turned into horrible vermin.\nThe Twilight Zone\nWhen I was a teenager, everyone smoked pot daily, except me. I was addicted to The Twilight Zone, and pot made me worry the stories could come true. And some have. In Midnight Sun, it's always 120 degrees (49 Celsius) and the oceans dried up. How brilliant was Rod Serling?\nJames Cagney\n\nI first fell in love with Cagney when I was a toddler. He was a ball of energy, like Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck. When I was a teenager and interested in boys, he was my main crush. In film school, I appreciated his acting and I admire how he led his life.\u00a0\nA Clockwork Orange and 1984 (the books and films)\n\nI'm combining these because what I love is the language. I don't go a day without saying \"Free me glassies\". The future teen slang in A Clockwork Orange (Anthony Burgess) was stylish and thrilling. George Orwell's creation of \"Newspeak\" was genius. The language of 1984 was deliberately getting smaller because without words, there's no thinking, and therefore, no intelligent resistance.\nThat's when she started keeping a notebook of all the new words used by her fellow students and, in the years that followed, any socio-economic tribes she encountered. She says she was especially interested in the \"very\" words \u2013 technically known as adverbs of degree, such as 'totally', 'majorly' and 'way' \u2013 \"because those 'very' words really define who you are, where you live and what year it is\". Which, of course, came in super handy for Clueless. Via the film, Heckerling demonstrates her complete mastery of LA lingo. At the same time, she finds a way to do justice to her own clique, aka earthy New Yorkers.\nClueless immortalises a whole bunch of characters who use Big Apple vocabulary and/or talk with unapologetically broad New York accents; there's Tai, but also Christian, Cher's dad Mel (Dan Hedaya), and a driving examiner (Ron Orbach). Nor is it a coincidence that we're shown a hilarious clip of a \"Bronx-y\" Tony Curtis, looking most uncomfortable in Spartacus (or, in Cher-speak, \"Sporadicus\"). According to Heckerling, Curtis delivers his lines in the way he does (ie at a snail's pace) because he's trying to appear more \"classy\". It's a tactic she's tried herself. \"When you feel kind of insecure about your accent, you try to talk\u00a0more slowly, as though that will get the Bronx out of it.\" The subliminal message sent by Clueless: Don't try to hide who you are. Own it.\u00a0\nSome fans, however, have long believed Heckerling has herself concealed something very important about the film, namely Cher's Jewish identity. It's hard to ignore Cher's Jewish surname (Horowitz), or the mezuzah (a piece of parchment inscribed with verses from the Torah) on her family's front door. Yet, until now, Heckerling has been keen to shut down theories about Cher's ethnicity, pointing out that Cher's surname was originally meant to be Hamilton, and that Horowitz came from an ad lib by Wallace Shawn (as Cher's teacher).\u00a0\nHeckerling is proud of her own Jewish roots, and as well as being in love with the Yiddish language (note Dionne's use of the word kvelling), she believes representation is incredibly important. So why, when it comes to Cher, does Heckerling not want to confirm what seems obvious? Whatever Heckerling's intentions when she was writing the script, the character we see in the film is coded as Jewish. If you know what to look for, it's as plain as, well, that mezuzah. Like someone preparing to put down heavy luggage, Heckerling sighs. \"I didn't want to say Cher was Jewish,\" she explains, because \"when you're Jewish, there's always some group that's going to be mad at you\". Another sigh. \"So you don't want to make a big thing of it.\"\u00a0\nHeckerling claims that the most autobiographical scene in Clueless is the one in which Dionne (who, like Cher, has a somewhat kamikaze approach to driving) suddenly finds herself on the freeway and freaks out. Heckerling says that she identifies with the feeling of \"not being a very secure driver and suddenly you're in this situation where cars that are very big are coming right up and honking loudly. You're afraid to change lanes, because your car doesn't have the power to zip in and out and it's very frightening. I would often accidentally find myself on the freeway, just screaming till the exit was there!\"\nThe image of Heckerling in her puny car, screaming her head off, is a comical one, but also feels like an apt metaphor for this film-maker's relationship with Hollywood. Pre-and-post Clueless, she was often made to feel as if she didn't belong in the big league (studios were stingy about budgets; bigwigs tried to bury her projects; she was continually messed around when it came to distribution). Which is crazy. Heckerling is actually responsible for two all-time classic films \u2013 her 1982 debut, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, launched the careers of Sean Penn and Jennifer Jason Leigh and successfully tackled taboo topics like teen abortion. On top of that, Heckerling created the massively successful franchise, Look Who's Talking (inspired by her own daughter, Mollie). The good news is that Clueless, an iconic juggernaut if ever there was one, has allowed Heckerling to keep going. Here she is, 30 years later, still holding her ground and her nerve.\u00a0\nShe has plenty of projects in the pipeline. She and Mollie have written a script for Look Who's Talking 4 and are now waiting for feedback. She's also researching a historical Jewish figure (\"I've made a million notes\"). And she would kill to work with Benedict Cumberbatch. Like her own, dearly departed mother (\"the original Cumberbitch!\"), Heckerling \"worships\" the British actor. \"Whenever I'm feeling crummy I'll put on Sherlock, or the Richard III he did for The Hollow Crown [BBC series of Shakespeare history plays],\" she says. \"I can't stand being in the sun. Or the desert. But if he said, 'Let's do a Lawrence of Arabia remake,' I'd be there.\"\nSerious money has been pumped into the new West End musical. In London, you can't miss the posters, which show Cher, hands on hips, in her yellow tartan suit. Heckerling is pleased with the show because it \"doesn't feel like a different animal\" to the film. \"Some characters have a little more presence than others but, if you like the film, I think you'll feel the show is telling essentially the same story\". Scottish-singer songwriter KT Tunstall, known for hits like Suddenly I See, did the score, while Glenn Slater came up with the lyrics, and their idea has been to create songs that together sound like a 90s mixtape, aping the sound of era-defining acts from Radiohead to Green Day to NSYNC. Heckerling says that she and Slater spent a lot of time working together. \"Me and Glenn would go through the lyrics, with me telling him what the characters were feeling. I'd sometimes tell him, 'Woah, she wouldn't say this!' and changes were made. But, basically, I was so pleased with what he was doing.\"\u00a0\nShe's all too aware that theatre is a different medium. \"In films, you get to do close-ups of people, you can get into their\u00a0brains. In a musical comedy, the characters have to reach the last person in the audience with a song. Hopefully people will like the songs.\"\nThe interview is almost over. So much has changed, Heckerling confides, since she made the 1995 film. She's concerned, these days, about censorship and surveillance, \"I'm worried about how much trouble you can get in to right now. It seems like Big Brother is watching everything you do.\" She calls out, mischievously, \"Hi Big Brother! We're just talking about a silly film!\"\u00a0\nMemories of those \"wonderful\" days on the Clueless set spur her on. She says that many of her friends aren't working and \"don't even\u00a0want\u00a0to be working\". She tuts with amazement. \"It seems very strange to me. I can't imagine not wanting to\u2026\" She searches for the right word, keen as ever to avoid sounding presumptuous or highfalutin. She says, \"I will always want to be\u00a0creating. That's why you're alive, right?\"\nClueless, The Musical is London's Trafalgar Theatre until 27 September 2025.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

That was the New England Patriots in 2017. \nThe Philadelphia Eagles did not go to the White House after their victory in 2018.\nThe president said at the time that the players disagreed with his view \"that they proudly stand for the national anthem\", although the team or players never confirmed that as the reason. \nInstead, Trump invited a group of Eagles fans to a \"celebration of the American flag\".\nIn 2017, NBA champions the Golden State Warriors were uninvited from the White House event by Trump after star player Stephen Curry said he did not want to go. The Warriors were not invited when they won the NBA Championship again in 2018. \nThere were, however, some memorable sporting visits to the White House under Trump. He famously welcomed Clemson University's football team in 2018 with burgers from McDonald's, Wendy's and other fast food restaurants. \nLouis Moore, a professor of history at Grand Valley State University, told the BBC that these celebratory visits to the White House are political, even if they do not initially seem that way.\n\"For some guys [going to the White House] is a lifelong dream,\" he said. \"But in basketball and football and women's soccer,  it's definitely political. The idea not to go is political, and even the idea to go is political.\"\nHe added that the event has become even more political since Trump's first election victory in 2016.\n\"Early on in Trump's presidency, teams weren't going to the White House. Before that, there were no announcements,\" he said. \"But now you see people announcing that they're not going.\"\nMr Moore said that every presidential candidate since the 1930s has sought an athlete's endorsement.\n\"Presidents want to be around winners, and winners want to be around the president,\" he said.\nTrump is not the only president who has been snubbed by sports teams and players.\nNBA legend Larry Bird declined to visit Ronald Reagan in the White House after becoming an NBA champion with the Boston Celtics in 1984. \n\"If the president wants to see me, he knows where to find me,\" he said.\nIn 2013, Matt Birk of the Baltimore Ravens declined to visit the White House celebration because he opposed Barack Obama's stance on abortion.\nAccording to CBS Sports, Birk complained of an Obama speech where the president had said \"God bless Planned Parenthood\".",

        "article_text": "A trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer.\nSpeaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged \"a real trade deal\" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners. \nThe trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade. \nSir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an \"unprecedented\" second state visit to the UK.  \nReceiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a \"great honour\" and described the King as \"a wonderful man\".\nSir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was \"truly historic\". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit. \nHaving confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes.\nThe US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. \nOn the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. \nHowever, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine.\nAsked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \"backstop\". \nHe said \"nobody will play around\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals. \nThe US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\". \n\"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\" he said. \nHe later added he had \"a lot of respect\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday.\nThe UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders. \nHowever, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\". \nThe deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back. \nAfter taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\". \nReferring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. \n\"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said. \nHe said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century. \n\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said. \nTrump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union. \nHe also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.\nAsked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\"\n\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"\nIn a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\". \nSince leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.\nIn his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way.\nHowever, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems. \nThe head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce - a former Labour MP and minister - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that businesses will be encouraged by what he called an \"important first step\".\n\"In trade negotiations, relationships matter,\" says William Bain, adding that seeing the two leaders find common ground on their respective economies and trade is \"helpful\".\nHe added that a deal to keep tariffs low would most benefit automotive and pharmaceutical industries in the UK.",

There are different calculations on US spending in or related to Ukraine - and they produce a much lower figure.\nThe Kiel Institute is a German-based think tank tracking support going into Ukraine.  It calculated that the United States spent $119.7bn (\u00a394.3bn) on aid between January 2022 and December 2024.\nOthers have reached a higher figure - but with a broader definition of what counts as spending on Ukraine.\nThe US Department of Defense has provided a figure looking at all spending on Operation Atlantic Resolve - a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nIt says $182.8bn has been \"appropriated\" - a figure that covers US military training in Europe and replenishment of US defence stocks.\nEither way, both figures are considerably lower than claimed by the president.\nWe asked the White House about the basis for the $350bn claim. So far, it hasn't provided an explanation.\nPresident Trump has claimed: \"We've spent more than $300bn and Europe has spent about $100bn - that's a big difference\"\nShort answer: Figures suggest Europe has spent more when all aid is included and, as above, we can't find any evidence for the $300bn figure.\nThe United States is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. But Europe combined has spent more money than the United States, according to the Kiel Institute.\nThe figure includes aid directly from the European Union, but also from bilateral deals from European countries, both inside and outside the EU. It includes military, financial and humanitarian aid.\nThey calculate that between 24 January 2022 and the end of 2024, Europe as a whole spent $138.7bn on Ukraine. In the same period, the United States spent $119.7bn, according to their figures.\nNATO secretary general Mark Rutte made a similar argument, adding Canada into his calculation.\nMr Rutte said February 2025: \"In 2024, NATO Allies provided over 50 billion euros in security assistance to Ukraine \u2013 nearly 60% of this coming from Europe and Canada.\"\nWe asked for NATO's figures, but they said they were classified.\nThis is a claim President Trump made when he hosted President Macron. It prompted President Macron to disagree, saying both Europe and the US had given a mixture of grants and loans.\nShort answer: The EU has provided loans, but also grants. \nPresident Macron is correct, according to Kiel figures. But they suggest President Trump also has a point; the US has sent more grants, while the EU sent more loans.\nHowever, again, there are different figures out there.\nThe European Union says EU countries have provided around $145bn in aid so far and that just 35% of that has been loans. Like the United States Department of Defence, the EU has used a broader definition of what counts as aid to Ukraine.\nEU loans will have been on generous terms - so Ukraine will be repaying less interest than it would normally. In some cases, Ukraine isn't expected to pay anything, with repayments coming from revenues from frozen Russian assets.\nWhat we can say is that aid to Ukraine has been a mixture of loans and grants.\nThe UK is one of the biggest individual state donors to Ukraine.\nThe only countries to have spent more are the United States and Germany, according to Kiel data.\nBut the UK contributions are much smaller than the United States.\nThat raises a question for the UK and other European countries; if the United States withdraws a large part of its funding to Ukraine, can other states make up the difference?\nThat would require a significant increase in their contributions.\n\nAdditional reporting: Thomas Spencer and Tamara Kovacevic\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

        "article_text": "After the A Complete Unknown star's surprise SAG win, viral acceptance speech and attention-grabbing campaign, could he pip Adrien Brody to the post to win the coveted best actor prize?\nHe turned up to his premiere on an e-bike; crashed his own lookalikes contest; laughed at all the times he failed to win awards on Saturday Night Live; and on Valentine's Day he arrived in Berlin's sub-zero temperatures bare-shouldered, in a powder pink vest. Over the course of a few weeks and months, Academy Award nominee Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet has upended the idea of how awards honourees behave in order to secure votes. Could he still be rewarded with a best actor Oscar on 2 March?\nIt would be a major upset even for this extraordinary awards season if so, as the favourite for the prize, Adrien Brody, who plays a Holocaust survivor in Brady Corbet's The Brutalist, has won the Golden Globe, Bafta and Critics Choice Awards \u2013 all traditional harbingers of the Oscar. But then 29-year-old Chalamet took the SAG (Screen Actors Guild) prize for best actor on Sunday for his role playing a young Bob Dylan in James Mangold's biopic A Complete Unknown, accepting the award with an earnest speech that went viral.\nUntil that moment, he was at least winning the award for \"one of the most gonzo best actor campaigns in Oscar history\", as Variety describes it. Apart from the e-bike incident in London and poking fun at his \"loser\" awards face on Saturday Night Live, he chatted with Kendrick Lamar ahead of Lamar's performance at the Superbowl half-time show, and impressed on sports channel ESPN by making accurate college football predictions. (Some were moved to label him \"Lisan al-Gaib\" for this, in reference to the seer-like figure from Dune: Part Two, which along with A Complete Unknown, makes two best picture nominees in which Chalamet stars.)\n\"What I find most interesting is everyone's reaction to it,\" Variety's Chief Awards Editor, Clayton Davis, tells the BBC about Chalamet's campaign. \"It varies from, 'Oh my god, the guy is an artist and he's our generation's James Dean, our Marlon Brando,' to older people feeling like he's the epitome of Gen Z or TikTok.\"\nDavis believes that Chalamet's actions (not to mention the baby pink and acid green outfits, plus his celebrity partner Kylie Jenner's discreet support) mean that he is speaking directly to his peer group \u2013 and that can only benefit the Academy Awards. \"He's really speaking to Gen Z, and I would say, if anything, maybe he's going to be a great and needed lifeline to get Gen Z into the Oscars again, by consuming content differently,\" he says. \"And the Oscars have been trying to find a way to reach that TikTok generation that's going to care about a 100-year-old organisation.\"\u00a0\nWhat he has also done, Davis argues, is made an awards season campaign authentic for someone of his age.\n\"He's trying to redefine how it looks for someone like him, and I can appreciate that,\" he says. \"And as someone who likes to call themselves an Oscar historian, I'm used to the traditional. You go in, you kiss babies, shake a lot of people's hands, and you talk about your work. Taking your shirt off on the red carpet is different. And it may be jarring for a lot of people at first, and it may not work this time, but it doesn't mean that it won't work ever. When you're the first to do something, it always looks strange until it becomes the norm. We are in a transitional period in Hollywood across the board. Why wouldn't that also hit the Oscar campaign trail?\"\nThe actor's promotional appearances have impressed some Oscar watchers. A post on entertainment website Lainey Gossip praises Chalamet, describing his \"current Oscar campaign-non-campaign\" as \"one of the best, if not the best, of all time\u2026 if he gets it, he's doing to do it not by prescription, not by sucking up to the old people.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, in his SAG acceptance speech (which also went viral) Chalamet aligned himself with some of the most revered actors in cinema history, naming Marlon Brando and Daniel Day-Lewis as those he looked up to.\n\"I know the classiest thing would be to downplay the effort that went into this role and how much this means to me, but the truth is this was five years of my life,\" Chalamet said. \"I'm really in pursuit of greatness,\" he added. \"I know people don't usually talk like that, but I want to be one of the greats. I'm inspired by the greats. I'm inspired by the greats here tonight\u2026 I want to be up there.\" He also called Bob Dylan \"a true American hero\" in the speech, and, a week earlier at the Berlin Film Festival, referred to him as \"the man, the myth, the legend\".\n\"I love how Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet isn't sugarcoating how badly he wants to win the Oscar during his SAG speech,\" wrote Buzzfeed's Spencer Althouse on X.\nBut the perception that the Oscar demographic is older and thus needs a certain style of wooing is rapidly shifting, Clayton Davis says. \"They also added 4,000 new members in the last decade. And a lot of them are young, they're diverse, they're from different backgrounds,\" he explains. \"The Oscars have changed. The old guard, you're never going to get them on board, although when you respect someone like Bob Dylan and recognise his contribution, that speaks to older Academy voters, and they can in turn respect him [Chalamet] as an artist.\n\"They already embraced the movie; in that it's nominated for eight Oscars. He introduced Bob Dylan to Gen Z, who probably had never heard of this guy before. So, I think you've got to admire at minimum that he is bridging the generational divide.\"\nChalamet may be the youngest ever best actor winner in SAG's three-decade history, but the SAG prize was also Chalamet's first ever major award. He was first Oscar-nominated in 2018 at the age of 22 for Luca Guadagnino's love story Call Me by Your Name, Bafta-nominated in 2019 for Felix Van Groeningen's addiction drama Beautiful Boy, and Golden Globe-nominated last year for Paul King's Wonka.\nBut although his filmography speaks of taste and versatility, there are some reasons why an Oscar win for him is still unlikely this year. \"Voting for the Oscars closed already,\" Davis points out. \"I was most confident that he would win the SAG partly because they tend to be more populist in their choices. What it means for the Oscar race now is harder to discern. Is it a 'too little, too late' mentality? I remember last year when Lily Gladstone won the SAG best actress the day before Oscar voting closed, and after I'd concluded that Emma Stone was going to win the Oscar. We all switched our predictions to Lily, and Emma Stone still ended up winning in the end.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Why horror performances deserve more awards\n\u2022\u00a0The Brazilian film that could upset the Oscars\n\u2022\u00a0'Category fraud' is the latest Oscar scandal\u00a0\nNor are the statistics on Chalamet's side. No one who has won just the SAG best actor award has then gone on to win the Oscar. Male actors also tend to win their Academy Awards later in life \u2013 in an Oscar statistic probably not lost on either of them, Adrien Brody is still the youngest ever male best actor Oscar winner, for The Pianist in 2002 at the age of 29, the same age as Chalamet is now. (By contrast, the youngest ever best actress winner was aged 21 at the time.)\n\"I think that it's a barrier of entry for some people in terms of voting for him,\" Davis says. \"Some people feel like, 'We have time, Timmy's here. Timmy's very established.' If anything, at minimum this generation's Leonardo DiCaprio, right?\" he says. \"There is this sense of, 'We don't have to do it now.'\"\nThis may not be comforting to Chalamet, as DiCaprio was aged 41 when he finally got his best actor Oscar, on his fourth attempt, but Davis is prepared to predict that next year Chalamet will have another chance at the Oscar in a film he's starring in and producing: Marty Supreme, directed by Josh Safdie.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\"Timmy will be here probably next year\u2026 Marty Supreme sounds like it's going to be an amazing movie, even though we know nothing about it. He will probably do back-to-back nominations at minimum. And in a year when he played in the sequel to a sci-fi franchise and played Bob Dylan, that's a pretty killer resume for 2024,\" he says. \"And now in 2025, he's going to be sporting a moustache in a Safdie brother movie. I'm excited to see what he's going to continue to deliver.\"\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nAfghanistan knock England out of Champions Trophy\nFrom 1999 at Edgbaston in their own tournament to defeat by Bangladesh in Adelaide in 2015, I have covered plenty of shambolic England exits in global tournaments.\nEach time it feels like the lowest point \u2013 that things cannot go on \u2013 and Wednesday's defeat by Afghanistan in the Champions Trophy ranks among those dark days of the past.\nEngland have disintegrated as a white-ball outfit since their two World Cup wins in 2019 (ODI) and 2022 (T20).\nIt is time to once again plan for the future because relieving Jos Buttler of the captaincy is simply the sensible thing to do.\nWhenever I have dealt with him, Buttler has always been a very nice guy. He won that T20 World Cup as skipper in 2022 but, even if he says he enjoys the role, the captaincy has never felt like a natural fit.\nHe has spoken about practising his smile in the mirror and after Wednesday's defeat told the media he had to think whether he is \"part of the problem or the solution\", which sounds like the words of someone whose mind is a little mixed up.\nButtler will be 37 by the time the next 50-over World Cup comes along in 2027. \nThere is no reason why he cannot stay in the team as a player until then, especially if stepping down releases him of the burden, puts that smile on his face and allows him to go back to being the destructive batsman we know he can be.\nBut moving on to another leader now, most likely Harry Brook, would give him time to bed in before that tournament in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia. It just feels like the right thing to do.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nTo his credit, Buttler actually began this tournament with the correct message. He said how his batters needed to learn to change through the gears when necessary, and go back down a gear when necessary.\nThe problem is, only Ben Duckett in the defeat by Australia and Joe Root in his 120 against Afghanistan showed any capabilities of being able to do so.\nThe dismissals of Phil Salt and Jamie Smith were horrendous on Wednesday.\nSalt's shot \u2013 a limp swipe across the line to be bowled \u2013 was a real jaw-dropper while Smith left me lost for words.

        "article_text": "Nigeria's former military ruler Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, known as IBB, has released a book about the turbulent times while he was in charge of the country.\nA Journey In Service, which chronicles his life, especially while he was in office from 1985 to 1993, has got Nigerians talking and reflecting on what might have been if things had turned out differently.\nHere are four takeaways from the book:\nThis is the biggest talking-point as it touches on a topic which many believed altered Nigeria's history. Some say the country still hasn't really recovered from the annulment of the 1993 presidential elections.\nIn the book, Babangida, now 83, for the first time expressed deep regret for cancelling that election.\nThe poll was supposed to bring an end to military rule after 10 years and the cancellation of the outcome threw the country into turmoil. \nThe date of the vote \u2013 12 June - is now remembered in Nigeria as Democracy Day.\nGen Babangida was forced to resign.\nMoshood Abiola, widely believed to have won the election, was later imprisoned and his wife assassinated.\nNigeria's current President, Bola Tinubu, said at the book launch that Gen Babangida had shown courage by admitting what took place.\n\"That accident of history is most regrettable. The nation is entitled to expect my expression of regret,\" Babangida writes.\nGen Babangida, popularly known as IBB, acknowledged that Abiola, who died in 1998, won the election.\nHowever, in 1993 as results were being collated, the military government abruptly stopped the process - an action that triggered widespread protests and a political crisis. \nAt the time, he cited the issue of vote-buying, as well as the need to protect the country\u2019s judiciary as reasons for the annulment.\nAbiola\u2019s son Jamiu said the acknowledgment by Gen Babangida that his father had won the election came as a welcome surprise to him and some of his family members.\n\u201dPerhaps General Babangida was looking for peace,\u201d he told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.\nCivilian rule was eventually restored in 1999, 11 months after the death of another military ruler Sani Abacha.\nGeneral Mamman Vatsa and Babangida grew up together, were in the same class in school and rose alongside each other in the military. His execution in 1986 after he was convicted of a coup plot is another major talking-point of Babangida's presidency.\n\"We were very close friends,\" Babangida recalls.\n\"We had grown up together in Minna and had been classmates in Bida. We did several things together as peers. My wife recalled that we used to share a room as bachelors. We would reach out for whatever shirt was available, irrespective of whose it was, and just wear it and head out! We were that close.\"\nHowever, he says now realises that Vatsa had been jealous since when they were teenagers. \n\"With the benefit of hindsight now, I recall that a constant part of our relationship as teenagers and young men was a continuous and recurrent peer jealousy on his part towards me. He was always envious of my achievements, especially when he thought I was progressing better than him, either in school or our military career path.\"\nVatsa and nine others were executed in March 1986. They were said to have planned a coup, which according to Babangida would have plunged the country into darkness.\n\"I had to choose between saving a friend's life and the nation's future,\" he writes.\nAnother contentious issue has been the 1966 coup which overthrew Nigeria's first government following independence from the UK. Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa was killed, along with other high-ranking national and regional leaders.\nThe fact most of the coup plotters were from south-eastern Nigeria meant the coup became known as an \"Igbo coup\" - a label Babangida rejects.\nHe highlighted the role of Major John Obienu, an ethnic Igbo officer, who played a key role in quelling the coup, revealing that many senior Igbo officers were also killed in the mutiny.\nThe book also sheds light on the involvement of members of other ethnic groups, notably Yorubas, many of whom he said had participated in the military takeover.\nThe former leader confirmed that the original intention of the coup plotters was to release politician Obafemi Awolowo from detention and install him as president.\nBabangida writes: \"It was a terrible time for the Nigerian military. As I have said elsewhere, as a young officer who saw all of this from a distance, probably, ethnic sentiments did not drive the original objective of the coup plotters.\n\"For instance, the head of the plotters, Major Kaduna Nzeogwu, was only 'Igbo' in name. Born and raised in Kaduna, his immigrant parents were from Okpanam in today's Delta State, which, in 1966, was in the old mid-western region. Nzeogwu spoke fluent Hausa and was as 'Hausa' as any! He and his original team probably thought, even if naively, that they could turn things around for the better in the country.\nThe association of Igbos with the coup led to attacks on members of that community around the country and ultimately to the civil war in which some Igbo leaders tried to secede from Nigeria in 1967. At least a million people were killed in what became known as the Biafran war. \nMany Nigerians see Babangida's wife Maryam as the country's most iconic and influential First Lady. From 1985 to when they left office in 1993, their love story captivated a lot of people. She died in 2009 and the ex-head of state has never remarried.\n\"She was stunning. Her ebony beauty set off enchanting eyes, and her dazzling smile showed off a lovely set of teeth; when she smiled \u2013 and she often smiled \u2013 her face lit up, and her eyes danced,\" he writes.\n\"We both saw our marriage as our freedom and agreed to sort things out ourselves if we quarrelled. We were very compatible; indeed, I can only recall two occasions on which we quarrelled, and neither of us was afraid to apologise to the other. In all our years of marriage, it was never necessary for anyone to mediate between us over a misunderstanding because of that original meeting of minds.\"\n\"I never imagined that Maryam would pass away before I did, but the gift of life is in Allah's hands, not in humanity's. I am grateful for the life Maryam and I shared and for the fruit of our union. Coping without her has not been easy, but it has been made much less demanding by the memories of our life together and the length of her shadow,\" Babangida says.\nHe describes Maryam as a devoted wife, mother, homemaker, and passionate advocate for rural women. Above all, he saw her as a true partner.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Italian cuisine may be one of the most recognised and loved in the world \u2013 often imagined as a collection of ancient recipes and local traditions preserved by skilful nonnas over the centuries. But now, a food historian is exposing common myths and false stories, arguing that the Italian cuisine as we know it is barely a few decades old.\nFood is no doubt an integral part of the country's culture and identity \u2013 so much so that Italians cherish Neapolitan pizza or pasta alla carbonara as much as the great historical and artistic treasures of the boot-shaped peninsula. Tales abound of centuries-old local feuds over what city has the best filled pasta, while every local cheese or cured meat is likely to boast links to the Renaissance or the Middle Ages.\nAlberto Grandi, food historian and professor of economic history at the University of Parma, has been debunking Italian food myths for years. In 2018, Grandi published Denominazione di Origine Inventata (Invented Designation of Origin: The Lies of Marketing on Typical Italian Products) and later launched a podcast called DOI. But it was a 2023 interview with Financial Times that put Grandi's work into the spotlight and sparked wide debates across Italy.\nGrandi claimed in the interview that pasta alla carbonara was invented in Italy just after World War Two using US Army provisions like bacon and powdered egg yolks, countering the common belief that the authentic recipe includes pork jowl and Roman pecorino cheese. This theory is backed by other authors, like Luca Cesari in The Discovery of Pasta: A History in Ten Dishes, but caused outrage in a country increasingly obsessed with maintaining the lore of Italian authenticity in food. The discussion evolved into a heated Italian-American dispute about the origin of the iconic dish. \u00a0\nGrandi's latest book, La Cucina Italiana Non Esiste (Italian Cuisine Doesn't Exist), written with his podcast co-host Daniele Soffiati and published in April 2024, stirred new controversies with its provocative title.\u00a0\nThe idea that many beloved recipes and products such as cheeses or cured meats have hundreds of years of history, Grandi and Soffiati claim, is pure fantasy. Food is constantly changing and evolving. No product or recipe has always been as we know it now, and most dishes have a shorter history than most people imagine.\nGrandi argues that migration is what made Italian cuisine what it is today. Millions of people left Italy in the 19th and 20th Centuries, emigrating to South America, North America and European countries. They were leaving behind a country that was poverty-stricken, where the diet was limited to a handful of products. Pellagra, a disease caused by lack of vitamin B3, was endemic in several areas of Italy at the end of the 19th Century.\u00a0\nThe Italians who landed on New York's Ellis Island left hunger and misery behind. And it was in the \"new world\", Grandi argues, that Italian immigrants found the wealth and ingredients to create the recipes that eventually popularised Italian food worldwide.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nHowever, many Italians are not familiar with this history. They might imagine that their beloved recipes were born in Italy, passed down, unchanged, from generation to generation and eventually exported abroad by Italian migrants. \"It might seem that the rest of the world didn't know how to eat until all of a sudden Italians arrived,\" says Grandi. He believes it's pure myth \u2013 popularised by social media \u2013 that nonnas taught Americans how to cook rich, genuine Italian food.\nPizza is the most famous example of this. Born as a cheap street food in Naples, in the 19th Century it was almost synonymous with poverty and filth. Pizza is \"a crust of leavened bread dough, oven-toasted, with a sauce of a bit of everything on top\", wrote Pinocchio author Carlo Collodi in 1886. He added that pizza had \"an air of complex filth that perfectly matches that of its vendor\".\nIt was in America, says Grandi, that pizza became \"red\". While fresh tomatoes were among the original toppings, Italian immigrants to the US popularised pizza prepared with tomato sauce, a product that industrialisation made easy to access and store. And it was in the US that pizzerias really started to take off. \u00a0\nScholars call this process \"the pizza effect\": when a product leaves its place of origin, gets profoundly transformed and then returns to its place of origin to be fully embraced in a completely different form.\nGrandi also angered Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese producers when he argued that parmesan has evolved for the better over the last few decades, and the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese that was eaten in Italy 100 years ago and earlier \u2013 a smaller wheel with a black rind \u2013 is now only made in Wisconsin.\nThe shift in the Italian culinary landscape started with the rapid expansion that occurred in Italy post-WWII. The boom brought new possibilities to millions of Italians. Cars, supermarkets and refrigerators meant that people who were limited to a daily local supply could travel to restaurants, buy new products and create new recipes. Tiramisu, says Grandi, is a great example of this: a dessert created in the late 1960s that is based on supermarket ingredients and only possible with a refrigerator. \u00a0\u00a0\nWith the new products and brands also came marketing. \"Television influenced our cuisine and gastronomical identity greatly,\" says Grandi. He argues that most of Italy's gastronomic traditions were invented by food marketers. Carosello, a short television programme that aired in Italy every night from 1957 to 1977, introduced new products and brands through stories, sketches and iconic characters. Carosello provided the consumer education upon which Italian home cuisine was then built, especially by mothers and grandmothers.\nGrandi's book explains that when industry-driven growth started to lose steam in the 1970s, Italy's economy pivoted to small companies, niche products and local excellence. Thousands of protected labels and regional products emerged and Italians doubled down on gastro-nationalism.\n\"Cuisine is no longer part of our identity,\" says Grandi, \"it is our identity.\" He argues that after decades of industry decline and economic stagnation, Italians have no faith in the future \u2013 that's why they \"invent the past\".\nIn less than a century, Grandi says, Italians went from being malnourished migrants to self-appointed custodians of ancestral traditions. The obsession for tradition has sparked searches for \"true\" recipes and \"correct\" ways of consuming food. Italians are ever more adamant to say that bolognese should be called rag\u00f9 alla bolognese and never served with spaghetti. You should also never put chicken (let alone pineapple) on pizza, cook pasta alla carbonara with cream or break spaghetti in two.\n\"I always say that every time anyone in the world adds cream to carbonara, somebody in Rome dies,\" says Grandi. \"Italians used to get upset when they were defined as 'pizza, pasta, mandolin, mafia',\" he adds. \"Now it looks like it's us Italians feeding those stereotypes.\"\nSocial media seems to have contributed to popularising these attitudes. The X account Italians mad at food, launched in 2015, showcases comments of furious Italians who are outraged and offended by how people in other nations choose to eat \"their\" cuisine.

        "article_text": "Bangkok-born actor Dom Hetrakul plays a hotel spa therapist in The White Lotus season three. Here are his top tips for visiting Phuket, Koh Samui and Bangkok.\nSince its tourism boom in the mid-20th Century, Thailand has become synonymous with paradisical landscapes and top-notch hospitality. In recent years, however, the Southeast Asian country has risen beyond its reputation as a spiritual and adventure haven, partially due to acclaimed film productions and influential names drawing attention to its unique culture.\nToday, the country's cultural influence has reached nearly every industry, from fashion to sports to entertainment. For a prime example, look no further than the highly anticipated third instalment of HBO's series The White Lotus, which premiered 16 February 2025. Following successful stopovers in Hawaii and Italy, season three features Thailand as its latest lush backdrop for intrigue and social satire. The islands of Koh Samui and Phuket are the main filming locations (with a smattering of scenes shot in Bangkok), while an ensemble of Thai actors including Blackpink's Lisa Manobal, Patravadi Mejudhon, Tayme Thapthimthong and actor, model and businessman Dom Hetrakul join the star-studded cast.\nBangkok-born Dom Hetrakul has built a portfolio as an actor, model and TV presenter while juggling his job as a motorcycle trading businessman. He has starred in several local and international productions, including Bangkok Dangerous (2008), Twilight Over Burma (2015) and The Family (2023). Hetrakul's most recent screen venture is HBO's The White Lotus season three, where he plays a Thai hotel spa attendant.\n\"The series is a very deep and dark comedy so it's going to be fun when it comes to Thailand, which has a different background compared to Hawaii and Sicily,\" says Hetrakul, who plays Pornchai, the beatific hotel spa therapist at the Thai branch of the fictional White Lotus resort. \"We have strong values and beliefs influenced by our religious background, but we're still dynamic in a way. That might be something very distinctive when you get close to the Thai community [and why] everyone is looking at Thailand as one of the most famous destinations for tourism.\"\nHetrakul, who was born in Bangkok and calls the city home, balances his career in entertainment with a job in the motorcycle trading business. But his packed schedule has never stopped him from travelling and finding inspiration in his home country: \"Apart from acting, sports and motorcycles take me everywhere. To find inspiration you need to get out of your comfort zone, that [means] more places and people to meet.\"\u00a0\nHere are Hetrakul's favourite places in Bangkok, Phuket and Koh Samui. \u00a0\nHome to the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui where much of the season's hotel scenes were filmed, Koh Samui is perhaps the ultimate White Lotus set-jetting destination. Indeed, a good deal of the season's drama and privileged behaviour unfolds on the palm-laden island, located in the Gulf of Thailand.\nMost visitors arrive in Koh Samui via the Samui International Airport, but ferries and other means of transportation are available from Surat Thani Province. \"You can take a cruise about 45 minutes from the mainland,\" Hetrakul says.\nWhile its rugged coastline, majestic mountain ranges and long, sandy beaches make it a travel-worthy getaway, the island's wellness offerings have stimulated tourism in recent years; something keenly noted in season three, with the surprise return of fan-favourite spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) from The White Lotus season one, whose story arc involves learning Thai wellness techniques from Hetrakul's Pornchai so she can improve her practice in Maui.\nKoh Samui's luxurious spas, remote resorts and holistic health centres provide wellness and spiritual therapies and retreats for meditation, Ayurvedic treatments and massages, but Hetrakul suggests immersing yourself in yoga. \"In Koh Samui, they have a lot of different training experiences like Thai boxing and yoga,\" he says. \"But [I'd recommend] yoga by the beach every morning with yogis from around the world... That's a very healthy community.\"\u00a0\nAddress: Ko Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nThai people's love for food runs deep so no trip to Thailand is complete without indulging in the country's culinary delicacies. \"Over here, we eat all day, all night \u2013 daytime, office hours \u2013 we just order food and eat all the time,\" Hetrakul says. \"Restaurants have to open all day.\"\nTip:\nIf you wish to experience one of Thailand's more emblematic celebrations, consider visiting during Songkran (Thai New Year). The festivities run between 13-15 April 2025 and celebrate the end of summer, welcoming the rainy season with water-pouring traditions. \"The Songkran Festival is chaotic in the best sense, to be honest,\" says Hetrakul. \"It's not really the traditional, soft [kind of experience]; it's [high power] stuff.\"\nWhile you'll have to watch the upcoming episodes to see the exact dishes and restaurants featured in The White Lotus season three, Koh Samui is packed with delicious food options from Western-style restaurants (Hetrakul likes\u00a0Summer by Coco Tam, The Shack and Gusto Italiano) to local eateries like Hetrakul's favourite island haunt, Jun Hom. The unassuming beachside spot is recognised for its seafood and homemade traditional dishes like pineapple fried rice, silver sillago fish and yum tua pu(wing bean salad). \"Everything is from the local fisherman's market,\" Hetrakul says, citing the Fisherman's Village Night Market, another go-to spot for foodies in Koh Samui \u2013 and rumoured to be the setting for some of season three's Songkran Festival shenanigans. \"Those aromatic herbs, spicy chillies and coconut milk on all sorts of fish, crabs, and prawns \u2013 you name it \u2013 Jun Hom makes [it].\"\nWebsite: https://www.facebook.com/JunhomKohSamui\nAddress: 7/3 Mu 5, Mae Nam, Ko Samui, 84330\nPhone: +66 77 602 008\nWhether at exclusive high-voltage clubs or vibrant festivals by the ocean, Thailand's much-revered party scene lives up to the hype. Previews of season three offer glimpses at the White Lotus' take on Thai nightlife; neon lights, fireworks and dance performances spice up the intricate plot entanglements in the trailer.\nTip:\nNightlife is at the core of the Thai travelling experience. \"You'll see the nightlife in the White Lotus season three,\" says Hetrakul. \"For some [previous portrayals onscreen] you might have seen The Hangover II or The Beach \u2013 that's how crazy we go. It depends on how you [pick] the places. You have premium clubs at hotels, but also very affordable places.\" If you're in Bangkok, he recommends checking out the options [on] Sukhumvit Road, one of the world's longest roads, which runs from Thailand to Cambodia.\nHetrakul's top Thai party hotspot is Ko Pha Ngan island, about 38km from Koh Samui \u2013 eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted Phangan Mantra Inn located near Ko Pha Ngan's Haad Rin Beach in the trailer's party scenes. \"[Koh Pha Ngan] is famous for the Full Moon Party,\" says Hetrakul, referring to the monthly festival-style beach parties that take over Haad Rin Beach every full Moon night or the day after. Locals and visitors celebrate by gathering around stages lined up across the shore for performances of various musical genres.\nFor those wary of big crowds \u2013 the parties attract thousands of attendants \u2013 Hetrakul has an insider tip. \"Now, people are trying to host more parties, they call them the Half Moon Parties,\" he says. \"Full Moon is more exposed to the public, so you expect the crowds, but Half Moon [celebrations] are less packed.\"\nAddress: Koh Phangan District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nAbout 30km north-west of Koh Samui lies the Mu Ko Ang Thong National Marine Park, an enclave of 42 islands surrounded by turquoise sea. The archipelago's clear-water shores welcome The White Lotus guests, serving as a fitting introduction to Thailand's stunning seascapes.\nThough camping areas and bungalows are available on Ko Wua Talap, the park's largest island,\u00a0 Hetrakul recommends planning a day trip to the archipelago to explore luscious tropical forests, azure beaches and rugged landscapes apt for any type of visitor, from those seeking a calm, stress-free retreat to adventure enthusiasts. \"There are white-sand beaches and mountain ranges on the island itself, so you can enjoy a beach tour or hiking, depending on which of those small islands you prefer,\" says Hetrakul. \"[Ang Thong National Park is also] great for snorkelling, diving, kayaking, canoeing or camping.\" For wildlife lovers, if you're lucky enough, you may even come across cadres of cute-looking spectacled leaf monkeys.\u00a0\nAddress: Koh Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nConnected to the mainland via the 600m-long Sarasin Bridge, Phuket is Thailand's largest island. It's also home to various locations featured in The White Lotus season three, from the opulent Michelin Guide-recommended Ta Khai restaurant, where characters are seen dining (and whining), to the Anantara Mai Khao Phuket resort, whose lavish spa serves as a backdrop for the interactions between Hetrakul's Pornchai and Rothwell's Belinda.\u00a0\n\"Phuket's [highlights] are the nightlife and the beach \u2013 Patong beach, the bars and clubs,\" Hetrakul says. However, those who venture beyond will be rewarded with splendid natural views and zealously protected greenery.\n\"About an hour's drive from Old Phuket Town, in the north of the island, there is a well-preserved mangrove forest called Baan Tha Chatchai,\" the actor says. Here, community-based ecotourism is king; away from crowds, visitors can engage in activities such as kayaking and canoeing along shallow and still waterways. \"Deep in the jungle it's very calm, so you don't have to worry too much. [For example,] in the western part of Thailand, the waves are stronger, [but this is] a different current.\"\nLocal dishes such as mee hokkien (chewy egg noodles) or Phuket lobster top off an excursion to the area. \"They have a lot of restaurants around, some deep in the forest. It's very very traditional \u2013 truly local \u2013 food,\" Hetrakul emphasises. \"They have seafood, fresh vegetables and fruit. But to be warned, the food is mostly spicy.\"\nAddress: Within Phuket Marine National Park Operation Centre 2, 92/7 Moo 5 Mai Khao, Thalang, Phuket 83110\nThailand's cultural appeal doesn't stop at its beloved spicy food and notoriously wild festivals. For decades, sports, especially Muay Thai, have driven the country's soft power strategy; in early February, the Thai government launched a year-long campaign titled Grand Tourism and Sports Year 2025, aimed at leveraging the sports calendar to boost tourism. The national passion for Muay Thai is reflected in The White Lotus season three, as various characters chat about the fights and take in a match at Phuket's Bangla Boxing Stadium Paton.\u00a0\nAs a sports enthusiast \u2013 he practices Muay Thai \u2013 Hetrakul encourages visitors to soak up Thailand's sports tradition and learn about its origins. \"We do lots of [sports but] Muay Thai, previously called Thai boxing, has become mainstream,\" he says. \"If you're a fan of UFC (mixed martial arts) fights, most elite athletes are here for training. If they're talking about the striking, Muay Thai [has] one of the best striking techniques.\"\nWhile you can witness Thailand's most famous combat sport or book a class nearly anywhere in Thailand \u2013 \"there are a lot of Muay Thai camps around [the country],\" Hetrakul says \u2013 the actor recommends stopping by the Rajadamnern Stadium in his hometown of Bangkok. Located just a few blocks from the Wat Benchamabophit temple, Rajadamnern was Thailand's first venue uniquely dedicated to Muay Thai and was responsible for introducing the sports' official ranking system and rule book. The stadium is also recognised for its architecture and circular ring \u2013 the only one of its kind in the world.\u00a0\nThe venue hosts combat every night, but Hetrakul advises visitors to get tickets for Friday and Saturday when the most anticipated clashes are generally scheduled.\nWebsite: https://rajadamnern.com/\nAddress: 8 Ratchadamnoen Nok Rd, Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Bangkok 10100\nInstagram: @rajadamnern_stadium\nProminently featured in season three's storyline, Thai wellness and healing practices need no introduction. Nuad Thai, or Thai massage, for example, was inscribed in 2019 on Unesco's List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This manual therapy, aimed at realigning a person's body and energy, is one of Thailand's most popular and widespread cultural attractions; Hetrakul's Pornchai even performs Nuad Thai on Rothwell's Belinda when showing her his \"signature treatment.\"\nThe Buddhist temple Wat Pho, credited as the birthplace of Nuad Thai, is Hetrakul's recommendation to experience and learn about Thai massage. The complex, which houses Bangkok's largest reclining Buddha, was the city's first public education centre. Inside, the walls document centuries of knowledge on Thai healing techniques with a series of engraved marble slabs dated to the 19th Century.\u00a0\nAs home to the Watpho Thai Traditional Medicine School, today the temple lures visitors interested in undergoing massage therapy. \"It's a place [to receive] traditional Thai massage,\" says Hetrakul. \"[But] they can [also] certify you with the approval of the Ministry of Health. You just need time to apply if you're interested in traditional Thai massage.\"\nWebsite: https://www.watpomassage.com/EN/about\nAddress: 392 / 33-34 Soi Pen Phat 1, Grand Palace, Maharat Road Phra Nakhon district, Bangkok 10200\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

I didn't know how to deal with my emotions. It really affected my mental health and I had suicidal thoughts.\n\"Now I've learned to ignore the comments and if I can be bothered, I delete them.\"\nOfcom has previously issued guidance to tech firms around protections for children online and on dealing with illegal online content.\nSpeaking to Radio 5 Live, Dame Melanie said the organisation would \"absolutely\" name and shame companies who didn't comply with their guidance, so the public would know which companies were \"not taking [user's safety] seriously\".\nThe regulator wants sites and apps to adopt these measures voluntarily in what they call \"a safety by design approach\". For example, they could adopt \"abusability\" testing to identify how a service or feature could be exploited by a malicious user.\nRules in the Online Safety Act, due to come into force this year, will compel social media firms to show that they are removing illegal content - such as child sexual abuse, material inciting violence and posts promoting or facilitating suicide. The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography.\nContent creator Harriet Maynard has also experienced abusive comments, which sometimes escalate into pile-ons - where a large number of people harass a person online.\nHer Instagram posts are aimed at a female audience and relate to issues around parenthood and lifestyle content.\nDespite having mainly female followers, when a video of Harriet's goes viral, she says she receives \"an influx of negative messages, primarily from men\".\n\"I normally don't let it bother me, but when you get a wave of online abuse, it can get you down.\n\"In a 'normal' workplace, if you were being bullied or harassed, then there'd be an HR department to deal with it accordingly. But for us making content online for a living, there's nothing like that.\"\nNicole Jacobs, domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales, welcomes the draft guidance.\n\"I'm pleased that Ofcom are stepping up to start the process of providing guidance to tech companies to tackle this,\" she said. \"It's now on these firms to implement these recommendations and ensure that perpetrators can no longer weaponise online platforms for harm.\n\"By taking meaningful practical action, not only will people be safer online, but it will demonstrate that tech companies are ready to play their part in tackling domestic abuse.\"\nProf Clare McGlynn, an expert in sexual violence, online abuse and the legal regulation of pornography, says she feels the guidance, which has no legal force, will struggle to make meaningful change.\n\"Experience shows that tech platforms do the absolute minimum necessary to comply with the law and little more. In the current climate, this is unlikely to change,\" she said.\n\"We urgently need to do more by strengthening regulation, making many of these recommendations legally binding. A dedicated Online Safety Commission which prioritises online harms would be a positive next step. \"\nSome of the suggestions to tech companies from Ofcom include:\nWhile a report from Ofcom shows women are five times more likely to suffer intimate image abuse and are more likely to report being negatively affected by harms experienced online than men, Dame Melanie said the guidance was not about \"women versus men or demonising men\".\n\"I think many men are really concerned about this as well. And that wider culture that's going on online, I just don't think it's healthy for anybody.\n\"The misogyny that's becoming normalised in some parts of the internet, that's not great for boys. It's not going to help them to form proper, strong, healthy relationships as they grow up. So I really hope men will get involved in this too.\"\nHarriet believes some of the suggestions by Ofcom would be ineffectual, such as popups on screen to make users consider if they wish to post abusive comments.\n\"I don't think these kind of people worry if they're going to offend someone by doing what they're doing. They hide behind their keypads. Complete cowards,\" she says.\nHowever, she would welcome more protections for women experiencing pile-ons if they were built into social media platforms, adding users should be able to protect themselves from \"pure abuse\".\nMiah feels the guidance may make some difference, if companies choose to follow it.\n\"I'd like to see tech companies do more,\" she says, \"[Ofcom has] a huge challenge, but real change is possible if they hold platforms accountable.\n\"Right now, reporting hate often leads nowhere - there needs to be stricter enforcement and actual consequences for harmful behaviour.\"\nIn a statement given to the BBC, Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, said: \"We remove any language that incites or facilitates serious violence, disable accounts, and work with law enforcement when we believe that there is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety.\n\"We continue to work with women's safety groups to understand the different ways harassment towards women can show up, while improving our technology to find and remove abuse more quickly.\"\nThe BBC has also contacted other social media companies, including TikTok and X, for comment.\nIf you have been affected by issues raised in this article, help and support can be found on the BBC action line website.\nRadio 5 Live's Nicky Campbell is being joined by a panel of experts and a studio audience to discuss women and girls' safety online, in public spaces and at home.

Pre-season not going in the perfect way, many players arriving late. The most important thing is that we stayed together and worked hard. \n\"I think now we can see the progress and development of individual players, of the system and the players know how we have to play and what we have to do.\n\"One thing is theory and the other thing is transform it on to the pitch and that's one thing that they are doing really well in the last few weeks and months.\"\nGlasner was quick to point out, however, that just 10 days ago he was sitting in the same spot disappointed after a 2-1 home defeat by Everton. \n\"It is always to work on your football and work on the group and stay together,\" he said about his targets. \"This is what we are doing regardless of what the results are.\"\nEngland head coach Thomas Tuchel was in attendance for the game and will have been delighted by the performance of midfielder Wharton. \nThe 21-year-old, who signed for the Eagles in February last year, was so impressive in his first season that he was included in the England squad that reached the final of Euro 2024, after just three months of Premier League football. \nWharton had a hand in three of the Palace goals on Tuesday and his first-time forward passing shone throughout the match. \n\"We know the tactics that the gaffer has given us and if we stick to the plan, we know we have a great chance in every game we play.\" Wharton said. \nGlasner said Wharton \"adjusted so quickly to the pace of the Premier League again after being out a few months''.\nThe performance could not have come at a better time, with Tuchel set to name his first England squad next month. \nA player who will be delighted with Wharton's return to the team and forward passing is Mateta. \nThe Frenchman has scored eight Premier League goals in 2025 - the joint-most of any player in the competition alongside Liverpool's Mohamed Salah. \nMateta, who scored 16 league goals last season, has 12 this campaign and is arguably the most improved player since Glasner arrived. \nHe is the focal point of the attack and his much-improved hold-up play allows the likes of Eze and Sarr to make runs off of him. \nWith a top-10 finish in their sights and a potential FA Cup run, things are looking positive at Selhurst Park\nLatest Crystal Palace news, analysis and fan views\nGet Crystal Palace news sent straight to your phone",

They are not yes men.\"\nIt is almost exactly three years since Ferguson resigned from his last managerial position with League 1 Alloa Athletic. \nHe had been in charge for nine months and left the club eighth in the third-tier table. Prior to that he had spells in the fourth tier with Clyde and Kelty Hearts.\nSince then, Ferguson said he had been enjoying the \"quiet life\", working with Rangers as a club ambassador, and harboured no immediate plans to return to the dugout until this opportunity arose. \nWhen asked if he felt ready to embrace the challenge of such a huge job, Ferguson's response was robust and emphatic.\n\"I wouldn't be siting here if I didn't,\" he said.\nHe added: \"I went down a different route as an ambassador.\n\"Did I want to get back into coaching and management? If I'm being brutally honest, I wasn't thinking about it. But when that phone call comes, there was no way I was going to turn it down.\n\"I am desperate to get started.

Its policy towards Gaza, it says, was \"paradoxical: Hamas was illegitimate, yet there was no effort to develop an alternative\".\nThe military had chosen a \"conflict management\" approach to dealing with Gaza, it says. And had assumed that Hamas was \"neither interested [in] nor preparing for a large-scale war\" - a perception reinforced by Hamas's own deception tactics.\nEvidence from 2018 onwards suggesting that Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist group by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - was indeed developing an ambitious plan was interpreted as \"unrealistic or unfeasible\", reflecting \"Hamas's long-term aspirations rather than an actionable threat\".\nThe report says that in the months leading up to the war, the Military Intelligence Directorate began to develop a new assessment, suggesting that Hamas' plan was not merely a vision but \"a concrete framework for operational planning\".\nHowever, this emerging assessment was not brought to the attention of senior officials in military intelligence.\nThe report identifies a broad streak of complacency within the military about Hamas's intentions and how to deal with the threat it posed.\n\"There was no deep discussion of the question: What if we are wrong?\" the report says.\nOver time, \"a significant and continuous gap between the intelligence assessments of Hamas and reality\" had developed.\nThe report also highlights what it says was \"a decline in deep familiarity with the enemy's different worldview, including its culture, religion, language and history\".\nIt calls for deep reform of the intelligence directorate's culture, \"fostering intellectual openness, scepticism, listening, learning, debate, and constructive disagreement\".\nIt says the desire to protect highly valuable intelligence sources contributed to the military's failure to raise the alert level immediately before 7 October.\nThe Gaza Division, it says, \"was effectively defeated for several hours\" on 7 October, significantly impairing its ability to understand what was going on and respond effectively.\nIt says the Air Force responded quickly, but that \"there was significant difficulty distinguishing between IDF troops, civilians and terrorists\".\nThe report also says that in some incidents, wounded soldiers were evacuated before civilians.\nAfter presenting the findings to commanders on Monday, the IDF's outgoing chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said he took full responsibility for the failures.\n\"I embrace my responsibility. It is mine. I was the commander of the army on 7 October and I have my responsibility and I have all of your responsibility. I see that as mine too. And I see that in every command of mine that went wrong, there is also a part of me,\" he said in a video.\nLast month, the general announced his resignation over the failures and called for a commission of inquiry to carry out a broader investigation that would help prevent another attack.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has not acknowledged any responsibility for what happened on 7 October, has said such a state inquiry should wait until the end of the war.\nHis critics accuse Mr Netanyahu of being unwilling to admit any personal fault.\nIsrael responded to the 7 October attack by launching an air and ground campaign in Gaza, during which at least 48,365 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

I'm just hoping they'll let me in when I show up.\"\nThe Bolton actor's turn as PC Mukherjee was a high point in the hilarious outing, as the intrepid new PC was central to the plot, helping the iconic title characters track down their penguin nemesis, the master of disguise Feathers McGraw.\nThe film also featured the vocal talents of Patel's fellow Boltonian, comedian Peter Kay, who voiced PC Mukherjee's superior, Ch Insp Mackintosh.\nCreator and Preston-born Nick Park and his Bristol-based Aardman Animations team have already won four Oscars, so Patel said hopes were high that they would add to that achievement.\n\"The team are so insanely talented and their minds are brilliant and the script is so witty and so fun,\" she said. \n\"It made it such an enjoyable job to work on [and they are] also just all lovely people.\n\"They've got Oscars and they're very successful, they're very well known. \n\"But they're all just really lovely, down to earth people who just want to make the film as good as it can be.\"\nThe trip to the Oscars comes three years after Patel landed her first role in coming-of-age musical drama Everybody's Talking About Jamie. \nThat success came just days after she was rejected by a number of drama schools and she said she got the part in an open online audition.\nSince then, she said she \"fell head first\" into the industry, which was \"kind of mental\", and she recently joined the cast of BBC drama Waterloo Road for the latest series.\nShe said becoming a professional actor was a dream come true.\n\"I never thought that I would be able to do it professionally in this capacity,\" she said.\n\"I was like, 'oh, maybe I'll go to drama school and then in like 10 years, I'll get a little bit on the telly and, and that'll be great'. \n\"And I'll maybe do some community theatre because that's really fun. \n\"But yeah, it's mad. I can't believe it.\n\"Everyone who has ever met me as a child would know that I loved singing and dancing and attention.\"\nShe said she was excited about every aspect of her trip and had chosen her all-important red carpet outfit.\n\"I wanted to find something that I felt really good in, that I felt represented who I was and I think I found that,\" she said.\nHowever, she added that she would keep the exact details of the outfit \"under wraps\".\nAbove everything else though, she said there was one thing she was really looking forward to.\n\"I'm really excited to see Raye perform,\" she said.\n\"I love her so much and I've never seen her live and the first time I'm going to see her is at the Oscars, which is mental.\"\nThe 97th Academy Awards will be held in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on Sunday.

On Wednesday night they were finally able to show them.\n\"Of course it gives us a boost. We showed again tonight that we can compete with the best,\" said Wiegman. \n\"We have shown that before and it was really good to show that again, maybe for ourselves. The fans who were in the stadium I think enjoyed the game. \n\"It felt a very good performance and I'm very happy. There are always things to improve but lots of things went well today.\"\nThe Debrief podcast: England beat Spain & light up Wembley\nWhat we have done has not been in vain - Bonmati\nSpain stronger after battles on & off pitch - Codina\nGoalscorer Park was one of a number of England players who will have come off the pitch brimming with confidence.\nLauren James was exceptional out wide, Millie Bright unbeatable in defence and Lucy Bronze tireless in dealing with Spain forward Salma Paralluelo. \nIt was a performance which encapsulated the best of England and was the perfect response to Friday's underwhelming 1-1 draw with Portugal.\n\"After the last game, we wanted to be even more connected. We spoke about just being proper English tonight,\" said Bright.\n\"I mean that fight and that desire to defend for each other, to work hard for each other and to be hard to beat. It's so important to be hard to beat.\"\nWiegman agreed it felt like \"a proper English\" performance and highlighted the \"fight and togetherness\" to compete with Spain. \n\"It was an absolute team performance and we fought for every yard,\" she added. \n\"I think the fight and the togetherness is the most important thing and it always starts with that. Of course it gives a boost when you win.\"\nEngland's players celebrated on the pitch afterwards, Bright dancing with team-mate Chloe Kelly, while Bronze fist-pumped towards the stands. \nThey were applauded heavily at half-time and again when the final whistle went, while Spain's players stood looking dejected in the centre of the pitch.\nIt was only the second match of the Nations League campaign and this result does not affect things heavily yet - but it is a significant boost to England's Euro 2025 preparations. \nFormer England midfielder Izzy Christiansen said it felt like \"a semi-final or possibly a final of a major competition\" between two of Europe's heavyweights.\nSpain had their chances too - Lucia Garcia hit the crossbar in the first half before Aitana Bonmati was denied by goalkeeper Hannah Hampton.\nBut it was a match of high quality with England's star players James and Bronze showing their credentials and Spain's threat continuing until the final whistle.\n\"An absolutely superb game of football we've just witnessed,\" said Christiansen on BBC Radio 5 Live. \n\"The intensity and the magnitude of that first 45 minutes - it felt like a semi-final, possibly a final, of a major European or world competition.\n\"The 22 players on the pitch and the substitutes that came on were going at it 100%. This is the start of a massive rivalry between two top nations.\"\nIt was a performance by England that felt overdue but defender Niamh Charles said it was one they knew they were capable of.\n\"I think we know in ourselves our standards and we always kept looking internally and working on what we could do,\" she added. \n\"There was a lot of noise going on outside but we stuck to what we know and we've really been putting in the work over this camp. \n\"Hopefully you saw a bit of it and that's motivated us to keep going.\"\nA day in the life of England keeper Earps at PSG",

Clearly within that we are trying to improve every single day. \n\"People may have seen the France v Italy game and expect England to win by 50 points because we are at home. We have to be realistic as well. It's a Test match and Italy are a decent side, they are well coached and have some good players who we know a lot about.\n\"Of course it's important how we play, but our job is to win rugby games. We probably didn't give Scotland enough credit for how well they played. Would we like to throw the ball about and score eight or nine tries? Of course we would, but the reality is they are a good side and they took that away from us.\"\nSinfield's current title is skills coach, but the former rugby league international says his role is very varied, as he has also been seen working with England's kickers before they address the ball.\nMarcus Smith began the tournament as England's fly-half and main kicker but his disappointing performance from the tee against France led to namesake Fin Smith converting Elliot Daly's winning try late on.\nMarcus Smith retained the kicking duties in the victory over Scotland before Fin Smith took the responsibility for a long-range penalty from just inside the halfway line.\nAsked whether England have a main kicker, Sinfield said: \"Typically it's been Marcus for this campaign.\n\"That kick where we changed at the weekend was from bang on the halfway line and on a slight angle as well so it's understanding what people's ranges are. The guys actually made that decision on the field.\n\"The balance between them is great. They understand the team has to come first and sometimes that means some decisions are made, not just around kicking but with selection, positions people play in and the minutes they get.\"\nMarcus Smith has played the past two matches at full-back, with Fin Smith steering the attack from fly-half, but Sinfield says the aim of the decision is to utilise the Harlequins playmaker's strength in space.\n\"I think he's played in that [full-back] role a number of times for Quins,\" added Sinfield. \"He perhaps hasn't started there, but certainly gone there in games when Jarrod Evans has gone on.\n\"We know he is a world-class number 10 and part of our role as coaches is trying to get our best players on the field, and sometimes that means they have to shift positions slightly. \n\"One of Marcus' big qualities is how he beats people and what he's like in spaces that are a little bit bigger and when the gaps are a bit bigger, and trying to get him into those positions is a big part of why he was moved to 15. \n\"That's not to say it will continue or to say it will change, it's to say the fact he has some flexibility in his play is really important to us.\"",

        "article_text": "For over 20 years, archaeologists in India's southern state of Tamil Nadu have been unearthing clues to the region's ancient past.\nTheir digs have uncovered early scripts that rewrite literacy timelines, mapped maritime trade routes connecting India to the world and revealed advanced urban settlements - reinforcing the state's role as a cradle of early civilisation and global commerce.\nNow they've also uncovered something even older - evidence of what could be the earliest making and use of iron. Present-day Turkey is one of the earliest known regions where iron was mined, extracted and forged on a significant scale around the 13th Century BC.\nArchaeologists have discovered iron objects at six sites in Tamil Nadu, dating back to 2,953\u20133,345 BCE, or between 5,000 to 5,400 years old. This suggests that the process of extracting, smelting, forging and shaping iron to create tools, weapons and other objects may have developed independently in the Indian subcontinent. \n\"The discovery is of such a great importance that it will take some more time before its implications sink in,\" says Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti, a professor of South Asian archaeology at Cambridge University.  \nThe latest findings from Adichchanallur, Sivagalai, Mayiladumparai, Kilnamandi, Mangadu and Thelunganur sites have made local headlines such as \"Did the Iron Age Begin in Tamil Nadu?\" The age marks a period when societies began using and producing iron widely, making tools, weapons and infrastructure.\nParth R Chauhan, a professor of archaeology at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (ISSER), urges caution before drawing broad conclusions.  He believes that iron technology likely emerged \"independently in multiple regions\".\nAlso, the \"earliest evidence remains uncertain because many regions of the world have not been properly researched or archaeological evidence is known but has not been dated properly\". \nIf the Tamil Nadu discovery is further validated through rigorous academic study, \"it would certainly rank amongst the world's earliest records\", Mr Chauhan says. Oishi Roy, an archaeologist at ISSER, adds that the find \"suggests parallel developments [in iron production] across different parts of the world\".\nEarly iron came in two forms - meteoritic and smelted. Smelted iron, extracted from ore, marked the true beginning of iron technology with mass production. The earliest known iron artefacts - nine tubular beads - were made from meteoritic iron, which comes from fallen meteorites.\nIdentifying iron-bearing rocks is the first challenge. Once located, these ores must be smelted in a furnace at extremely high temperatures to extract the metal. Without this process, raw iron remains locked within the rock. After extraction, skilled ironsmiths shape the metal into tools and implements, marking a crucial step in early ironworking.\nMost sites in Tamil Nadu where iron has been found are ancient habitation areas near present-day villages. Archaeologists K Rajan and R Sivanantham say that excavators have so far explored a fraction of over 3,000 identified Iron Age graves containing sarcophagi (stone coffins) and a wealth of iron artefacts. In the process, they uncovered hoe-spades, spears, knives, arrowheads, chisels, axes and swords made of iron.\nAt burials excavated at one site, over 85 iron objects - knives, arrowhead, rings, chisels, axes and swords - were found inside and outside burial urns. More than 20 key samples were robustly dated in five labs worldwide, confirming their antiquity.\nSome finds are particularly striking. \nHistorian Osmund Bopearachchi of the Paris-based French National Centre for Scientific Research highlights a key discovery - an iron sword from a burial site, made of ultra-high-carbon steel and dating to 13th\u201315th Century BC. \nThis advanced steel, a direct evolution of Iron Age metallurgy, required sophisticated knowledge and precise high-temperature processes.\n\"We know that the first signs of real steel production date back to the 13th Century BC in present-day Turkey. The radiometric dates seem to prove that the Tamil Nadu samples are earlier,\" he said. Ms Roy adds that the early steel in Tamil Nadu indicates the people there \"were iron makers, not just users - a technologically advanced community evolving over time\".  \nAlso, in a site called Kodumanal, excavators found a furnace, pointing to an advanced iron-making community. \nThe furnace area stood out with its white discolouration, likely from extreme heat. Nearby, excavators found iron slag - some of it fused to the furnace wall - hinting at advanced metalworking techniques. Clearly the people at the site were not just using iron, but actively producing and processing it.\nTo be sure, the Tamil Nadu excavations are not the first in India to uncover iron. At least 27 sites across eight states have revealed evidence of early iron use, some dating back 4,200 years. The latest Tamil Nadu digs pushes back the antiquity of Indian iron by another 400 years,\" archaeologist Rajan, who has co-authored a paper on the subject, told me. \n\"The Iron Age is a technological shift, not a single-origin event - it develops in multiple places independently,\" says Ms Roy, noting earlier discoveries in eastern, western and northern India.\n\"What's clear now,\" she adds, \"is that indigenous iron technology developed early in the Indian subcontinent.\"\nExperts say the excavations in Tamil Nadu are significant and could reshape our understanding of the Iron Age and iron smelting in the Indian subcontinent. Also, \"what these digs testify is to the existence of a distinctly sophisticated style of civilisation,\" notes Nirmala Lakshman, author of The Tamils - A Portrait of a Community.\nHowever, archaeologists caution that there is still a lack of excavations needed to collect fresh data from all over India. As one expert put it, \"Indian archaeology is in silent mode outside Tamil Nadu.\"\nKatragadda Paddayya, a leading Indian archaeologist, said this was \"just the starting point\".\n\"We need to delve deeper into the origins of iron technology - these findings mark the beginning, not the conclusion. The key is to use this as a premise, trace the process backward and identify the sites where iron production truly began.\"  ",

Senior health sources have indicated that the organisation had a degree of autonomy at the time, and the top job she then took on in 2021 was different to what was now envisaged by the Labour Government. \u00a0\n\"Wes Streeting is entitled to shape things as he wishes\", said one, \"but the role of NHS England chief executive will change\".\nThe reality is that whoever is appointed, the government faces huge challenges cutting waiting lists for operations and treatments, and reducing long waits in emergency departments.\nNHS England said Amanda Pritchard had decided it was the right time to stand down, now that the NHS has turned a corner on recovery from the pandemic and the foundations are in place to make further changes to support the NHS.\nMs Pritchard said in a statement: \"We always knew the recovery period after a once-in-a-century pandemic was going to be incredibly challenging, and whilst the timeliness and experience of care is still not good enough for too many people, the NHS has achieved a great deal in the face of historic pressure thanks to a relentless focus on innovation and reform.\"\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting thanked her for her integrity and unwavering commitment.\nHe said: \"Amanda can be enormously proud of the leadership she has given in the face of the biggest health emergency for our country in modern history, as well as steering NHS England during turbulent political waters and six secretaries of state in her time as chief executive.\"\nRichard Meddings, chairman of NHS England, described it as \"a huge loss\" for the NHS.\n\"Under her leadership, the NHS has delivered a huge amount for patients - in the face of pandemic recovery, unprecedented strikes and consecutive even busier winter periods, the NHS has continued to improve performance, reform and innovate\", he said.\nMs Pritchard has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks.\nThe public accounts committee said that she, her deputy, Julian Kelly, and two senior civil servants at the Department of Health and Social Care were \"complacent\" and lacked dynamism.\nMPs on the Health and Social Care Committee said they were disappointed and frustrated by the \"lengthy and diffuse answers\" she and other officials gave them under questioning.\nLast week, when challenged on the issue, she told BBC Breakfast \"we're not all brilliant performers at committee hearings, but it's absolutely right that we are scrutinised by Parliament.\"\nNHS England has announced that Sir James Mackey, currently chief executive of Newcastle Hospitals, will be taking over as interim head of NHS England and will work closely with Ms Pritchard for the next month before taking up post formally in April.\nHer successor, Sir James, said he was honoured to be leading the health service through the next phase \"as we radically reshape the role of NHS England and work with the government to build an NHS that is fit for the future through the 10-year health plan\".",

        "article_text": "Only three Premier League goalkeepers - Ipswich's Arijanet Muric, Robert Sanchez of Chelsea and Brighton's Bart Verbruggen - have made more errors leading to goals this season than Andre Onana\nManchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana is in the spotlight again after his error led to Ipswich Town taking an early lead in their Premier League game on Wednesday evening. \nUnited rallied and eventually won the game 3-2 despite being down to 10 men, but the mistake has reignited the debate about the Cameroon international.\nThe 28-year-old endured a tough start to life at Old Trafford but appeared to have turned a corner earlier this season when he had the most clean sheets in England's top flight with six. \nHowever, four minutes in to the game against the Tractor Boys, he illustrated why United fans and pundits have persistent doubts about him.\nHe dashed to the edge of his penalty area as Patrick Dorgu ran towards him and, as the left wing-back nudged the ball towards where he expected Onana to be, it gifted Jaden Philogene with a tap-in.\nThe former Aston Villa winger later scored his second of the night from a deep cross that deceived Onana because of Liam Delap's run across him.\nSpeaking on TNT Sports, former Blackburn and Wales midfielder Robbie Savage said: \"I've got no idea why Onana is running out to that position [for the first goal]. \n\"Dorgu has got it under control, no problem at all. He shouldn't come there.\n\"You should be talking, lay it back to him on his right foot and then he can clear it. I don't know why he's come.\" \nFormer United defender Rio Ferdinand added: \"It was a terrible start. Onana doesn't need to come. The full-back is in complete control and he can just hold his ground and let him play it back to him.\"\nOn BBC Radio 5 Live, former Celtic boss Neil Lennon added: \"I don't know where Andre Onana is going. It is a shambles.\"\nUnited paid \u00a347m to sign Onana from Inter Milan in the summer of 2023 as a  replacement for four-time club player of the year David de Gea.\nBut he has largely failed to shake the view that his occasional fallibility adds to the fragility of a struggling side.\nOnana made several glaring mistakes in the Champions League last term that contributed heavily to United's early exit from the competition at the group stage. \nThere had already been notable errors against Viktoria Plzen, Brighton and Nottingham Forest this season prior to the Ipswich game as he has slipped down in the race for the Golden Glove.\nHis performance in the 1-0 defeat at Tottenham, where he pushed Lucas Bergvall's tame effort straight into the path of goalscorer James Maddison, encouraged further scrutiny.\nHis understudy, Turkey's Altay Bayindir, has played just seven times since joining in September 2023 and is yet to start a Premier League game. \nOnana's form and the reluctance to use Bayindir prompts questions about the decision to let De Gea, Dean Henderson and Czech Republic goalkeeper Matej Kovar to leave for less than half the amount Inter were paid for their goalkeeper.\nDe Gea, 34, who has won 45 caps for Spain and is now at Fiorentina in Serie A, is the obvious barometer. \nHe has a better shot save percentage than Onana - 72 compared to 65 - and has yet to make any big errors directly leading to goals, compared to three for Onana.\nIn mitigation, De Gea has faced fewer shots (90 to 111) and Onana has also had to contend with a switch in formation from 4-3-3 to 3-4-3 under a new manager in Ruben Amorim. \nThe Portuguese boss is also yet to name an unchanged starting XI in any of the 23 matches he has taken charge of and has had a habit of substituting one of his three central defenders after about an hour.\nThat can hardly help build relationships and understanding at the back and nor can Onana be blamed for some of the static defending in front of him.\nIt should also be noted Onana has at times made crucial saves this season.\nWhat's more, Fiorentina are in better form than United, challenging for a Champions League spot in Italy while United are a lowly 14th in the Premier League.\nHowever, a perhaps surprising statistic against Onana centres around passing accuracy, given he was brought in as the calatyst towards a possession-based style of play. \nDe Gea was not noted for his dexterity with his feet but trails Onana by just 1%, although he has made significantly fewer passes. His pass completion statistics in his final season at United (73%) were also higher than Onana's this year.\nFormer United goalkeeper Massimo Taibi, whose famous howler against Southampton in 1999 hastened his own departure from Old Trafford, believes Onana could be on borrowed time.\n\"I think subconsciously the United environment isn't ideal for him and when a marriage is showing cracks, it's pointless to continue,\" he told the Sun in December. \n\"I'd be straight to the point and tell him, 'Andre, you are one of the best keepers in Europe but in the Premier League, you are under-performing. Block out criticism, do some soul-searching, press the reset and go again. And if things don't change by June, move on'.\"\nOnana will perhaps be wondering if his latest error will lead to his exit from Old Trafford after just two seasons in Manchester.\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

        "article_text": "A new revival of Christopher Marlowe's pioneering play about the 14th-Century King of England puts the spotlight back on his relationship with his male \"favourite\" Piers Gaveston.\nThis week, at its base in Stratford-upon Avon, the world-famous Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) is opening a new production of Christopher Marlowe's Edward II. Though this influential 16th-Century play about a beleaguered queer monarch is more than 430 years old, it still feels stingingly relevant.\u00a0Marlowe depicted a king whose authority and ability to rule is fatally undermined by his relationship with another man. Modern-day UK monarchs hold only ceremonial power, but overt queerness in the British royal family remains vanishingly rare.\u00a0Lord Ivar Mountbatten, a second cousin of King Charles III who is currently competing on US reality show The Traitors, is widely described as \"the first openly gay royal\".\nMarlowe's play dramatises the struggles of Edward II, a real-life King of England who reigned from 1307 to 1327. A year after Edward II succeeded his father, Edward I, he married the King of France's daughter, Isabella, in an effort to strengthen Anglo-French relations. Queen Isabella bore Edward II four children, and became a formidable figure in her own right \u2013 she is sometimes called \"the she-wolf of France\". But Marlowe's play really hinges on the king's controversial relationship with his male \"favourite\", Piers Gaveston, and how this sparked a constitutional crisis that he never recovered from.\u00a0\nThe playwright\u00a0never says outright that the two men are lovers, but the queer subtext is hardly subtle. In one scene, after he is reunited with his favourite, Edward beseeches him to \"kiss not my hand [but] embrace me, Gaveston, as I do thee\". In another, Isabella bemoans the fact \"the king regards me not, but [instead] dotes upon the love of Gaveston\". Only a wilfully obtuse reader of Marlowe's text could miss the insinuation that these two men are more than just friends.\u00a0\nEver since it was written, Marlowe's play has helped to cement the real-life Edward's debatable but not entirely misleading reputation as a \"gay king\". To put it simply, we can never know for certain whether Edward II had a romantic and/or sexual relationship with any of his male favourites. But when it was first performed in 1592, it paved the way for the monarch's queerness to be openly discussed by historians. \"The earliest text we have accusing Edward of some kind of sexual transgression was written around the time Gaveston was murdered [in 1312],\" historian Kit Heyam, author of The Reputation of Edward II, 1305-1697, tells the BBC. \"It says that at the beginning of Edward's reign, there was 'much lechery habitually practised'.\"\u00a0\nIn the parlance of the time, \"lechery\" was used to describe any kind of \"sinful\" sexual behaviour, according to the mores of the Catholic Church, which held religious authority in England at the time. \"The text seems to be suggesting that this behaviour will stop now that Gaveston's dead, but it stops short of saying that the sexual transgression was actually between Gaveston and the king,\" Heyam says. In the centuries after Edward II's death, it became less risky for writers to insinuate that Edward II may have been sexually transgressive, but the invention of the printing press in the 15th Century cranked up the innuendo. \"Writers would sensationalise their texts to make them more commercially appealing, so they started saying that Edward II was definitely sexually transgressive, and it was definitely the fault of his male favourites,\" Heyam says. \"But Marlowe was the first person to join the dots, and say that Edward II was actually sleeping with them.\"\nThe actor and RSC co-artistic director Daniel Evans, who portrays Edward II in the new production, believes that Marlowe's play still feels \"radical\" in 2025. His interest in reviving it was piqued by director Daniel Raggett, who posed a \"provocative\", hypothetical question that underlines the piece's enduring relevance: \"What would happen if our current king, Charles III, suddenly said: 'I know I've been married for a while, but I actually want someone called Colin by my side, not Camilla?'\" It might not cause a civil war, as Edward's relationship with Gaveston begets in Marlowe's play, but Evans questions just how accepting today's \"supposedly liberal and permissive society\" would be. \"Deep-rooted homophobia still exists, and the whole notion of the British Royal Family, of lineage and heirs, is very dependent on a heteronormative family structure,\" he notes.\nEvans and Raggett were also intrigued by the play's late-20th-Century renaissance, which is inextricably linked with the burgeoning LGBTQ+ rights movement. Dr Will Tosh, head of research at Shakespeare's Globe, and author of Straight Acting: The Many Queer Lives of William Shakespeare, says that Marlowe's play \"doesn't have a hugely long performance history\" outside of the era in which it was written. He notes that in the 18th and 19th centuries, it essentially went \"into cold storage\" because the idea of a male monarch having a male lover would have been anathema to conservative Georgian and Victorian audiences. The play's subsequent revival in the second half of the 20th Century coincides with a \"more curious and less judgmental attitude to queer intimacy\", Tosh says.\nIn 1969, two years after male homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales, but 11 years before the same advance was made in Scotland, Ian McKellen portrayed Edward II in a Prospect Theatre Company production that toured the UK. Gaveston was played by James Laurenson, a New Zealand actor who died last year, and their on-stage kiss caused some controversy when the production arrived in Edinburgh. \"The late councillor John Kidd took offence to this show of male affection, particularly as it took place on a stage erected within the assembly hall of the Church of Scotland,\" McKellen recalls on his website. Though a couple of local policemen were sent to watch the production, McKellen notes that they found \"no problem\" with its contents and this brief fuss \"guaranteed full houses for the run.\"\nWhen this production was broadcast on the BBC a year later, it made history by including the first same-sex kiss ever shown on British television. In a 2017 interview, McKellen said that the Prospect production also had a profound impact on \"many, many Americans\" who watched it on US network PBS. \"They saw for the first time in their lives two men kissing and couldn't believe it, but took comfort from it,\" he said.\nThe play's place in the queer canon was further cemented by a 1991 film adaptation directed by artist and gay rights activist Derek Jarman. Featuring a deliberately anachronistic mix of modern and medieval props, costumes and backdrops, Jarman's film dials up Marlowe's homoeroticism, and reframes the story within the context of the contemporary LGBTQ+ rights movement. As Gaveston (played by Andrew Tiernan) is tortured for his transgressions, Jarman shows police clashing with protesters from gay-rights group OutRage!.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0\"He was a monster\": How history got Henry VIII wrong\n\u2022\u00a0The redemption of America's most vilified First Lady\n\u2022\u00a0The historic female gang who menaced London\nA year before Jarman's film, Marlowe's play was staged by the RSC with Simon Russell Beale in the title role. Angela K Ahlgren argues in her\u00a02011 essay Performing Queer Edward II in the 1990s\u00a0that Jarman's film and this RSC revival of the play \"reflect notions of queerness circulating in the 1990s because they stage violence, same-sex desire, and references to contemporary gay political issues\". At the time, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was devastating the gay male population globally, and queer activists in the UK were protesting against Section 28, a piece of legislation that prohibited the supposed \"promotion of homosexuality\" by schools and local councils. It had been enacted by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Government in 1988, following a rising tide of anti-gay sentiment in the media.\nStill, Marlowe's play should never be regarded as a work of historical gospel. Tosh says the playwright's \"major dramatic innovation\" is to make the king's relationship with Gaveston the \"central drama\" of his life by \"compressing the timeline\". In reality, Edward II cultivated relationships with other highly influential male favourites after Gaveston was murdered in 1312, just five years into his 19-year-reign. But Marlowe depicts his bond with Gaveston as by far the most emotionally significant. \"After Gaveston's death in the play, Edward invokes his memory to justify whatever he's doing. And later, when Edward is imprisoned and mistreated, he invokes Gaveston's name again as a plea for salvation,\" Tosh says.\u00a0\nOf course, Marlowe's play also invites us to make serious presumptions about the nature of the two men's relationship. Historian Kathryn Warner, author of Edward II: The Unconventional King, says we can never know for certain how Edward II felt about Gaveston and his other male favourites because the king didn't keep a diary or write personal letters. \"All we have is the word of outsiders, which is obviously open to interpretation,\" she says. But in all likelihood, given that he fathered an illegitimate child with an unknown woman, Edward II's sexuality was probably more complicated than his reputation as a \"gay king\" might suggest.\u00a0\"I think in purely physical terms, we could probably call him more bisexual than gay,\" Warner says. \"But emotionally, it strikes me that he probably was gay, because he was very, very close to his male favourites.\"\u00a0\nThis closeness almost certainly caused his downfall. According to Heyam, Edward's fundamental error throughout his reign was to grant his favourites too much power. \"He failed to realise that being king of England in the 14th Century is very much a manager's job,\" they say. \"Edward needed to keep a number of powerful nobles happy, but when he gave Gaveston power over them, he made them very angry.\" After Gaveston was murdered by a group of rival barons in 1312, Edward II made the same mistake again with Hugh Despenser the Younger, whom Warner describes as \"the last and most powerful\" of his male favourites.\u00a0\nIt's worth noting that Despenser does appear in Marlowe's play, but only as a relatively minor character called Spencer who is essentially a stand-in for Gaveston following his death. The real-life Despenser had much more agency. In 1324, amid growing tensions with France, he began to wield his influence against Queen Isabella because of her French heritage. Isabella fought back with support from her own favourite, Richard Mortimer, which ultimately led to Despenser's execution in 1325, and Edward II's forced abdication the following year. \"If he had just kept his public and private lives separate, he would probably have been fine,\" Heyam says.\nIn Marlowe's play, the fallen monarch is killed at Mortimer's behest by a red hot poker through his anus. Warner says the idea that Edward II was murdered in this way is \"almost certainly a myth\" \u2013 one Marlowe didn't invent, but definitely helped to \"popularise\". Over 430 years later, it remains a shocking image with crassly homophobic overtones. But even if Marlowe's poker scene is apocryphal, the play still has a lot to say about the consequences of intolerance. When Edward complains about being forced to \"leave my Gaveston\", the disapproving Earl of Lancaster replies derisively: \"Diablo, what passions call you these?\" His use of the Spanish word for \"devil\" is surely no accident. \"I hope audiences who see this play think deeply about what happens when you try to ban love and sublimate someone's natural way of being,\" Evans says. \"The endless cycle of violence that this can create is something we can all learn from today.\"\u00a0\nEdward II is at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon until April 5, rsc.org.uk\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Moments later he was in handcuffs and under arrest.\nHe had shouted a homophobic slur, committing a hate crime that led to him being charged with a Section 5 Public Order offence. The case ended up in court, where he pleaded guilty, and he was banned from attending football matches in the UK for three years.\nNow Steve - not his real name as he fears for the impact on his professional and personal life - is trying to make amends after coming through a fan education programme run by anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out.\nHere he shares his story with BBC Sport.\nA lifelong football fan, Steve had just watched his side play Chelsea and was leaving the stadium.\n\"I heard Chelsea fans shouting and I shouted back, 'Oi, you Chelsea rent boys', gave them a few gestures and thought nothing of it.  I thought I was just having a bit of back and forth with the away fans,\" he said.\nWhat followed is all a bit of a blur.\n\"I walked away and then all of a sudden I was surrounded by six security guards. And then from that point, a police officer arrested me and put the cuffs on.\"\nSince January 2022, the Crown Prosecution Service has defined the \"Chelsea rent boy\" chant - aimed at the west London club's players and supporters - as a homophobic slur and says that anyone singing it is committing a hate crime and could face prosecution.\n\"I'm in my 20s and I didn't really understand that [term],\" Steve said. \"I knew there was stuff around it, but I didn't really perceive why it was homophobic.\"\nSteve was eventually referred to Kick It Out, which runs a fan education programme where offenders learn about the different types of discrimination and the impact their actions can have on victims.\n\"I accept that [what I did] was awful, and now it's about repaying that, turning that into something positive. I've had a look at myself... I'm willing to make amends,\" he said.\n\"People are going to make mistakes, but you're judged on how you then move forward.\"\nHe said the session had changed him \"massively\".\n\"It's made me aware of how there's a fine line between what's considered banter and just abuse.\"\nThe Kick It Out course is run by Alan Bush, the charity's fan education and engagement manager, who has delivered more than 400 sessions in the past five years. In that time, 40 fans were referred to him by either police or clubs for using the Chelsea slur.\n\"We can't ban our way out of discrimination and we can't just ban football fans from football. All we do is we push it back into society,\" Bush said.\n\"Football has a responsibility to educate its fans... then fans say to other fans  'you can't say that, mate,  you'll end up in court' or 'you can't say that because that's wrong'. There's a chance they report, there's a chance that they challenge. And I just think that has to be a far better than just banning people.\"\nHe added that \"the vast majority have not understood the gravity of how offensive that [chant] can be, how that can cause harassment, alarm and distress to an individual\".\nTo illustrate his point, Bush tells the offenders the story of Lee Johnson, a passionate Tottenham fan who was forced out of football for nearly a decade after hearing the Chelsea chant inside White Hart Lane as a teenager.\n\"It completely shook me to my core,\" Johnson - who is now co-chair of the Proud Lilywhites, the LGBTQ+ supporters' association of Tottenham Hotspur - told BBC Sport. \n\"It felt like all of the lights had gone out and I was just isolated by myself. It just took me straight back to when I was younger at school. 'Rent boy' was one of the things I used to get [called].\"\nJohnson had often been a target for abuse in his home town. Football used to be an escape, somewhere he could \"get lost in the magic of the game\" but hearing homophobic chanting made him question everything.\n\"I was thinking 'Am I safe here?' If people around me knew that I was gay, would they be attacking me or be verbally abusive? Would they stop singing it about Chelsea and would they start singing it about me?\" he said.\n\"People were using a term that has caused a lot of harm to me over the years. It's very traumatic. I think it was still the first half and I just said to my friend, 'I can't be here'. It was a fight or flight response. I left and I didn't come back for nearly 10 years.\"\nSince 2023, the Football Association has also been able to charge clubs if their fans sing the chant.\nSeven charges have been brought against six clubs for homophobic chanting, according to English football's governing body. The clubs, which include Wolves, Leeds and Luton have been fined a total of \u00a3415,000.\nTwo charges raised against Tottenham Hotspur following their Premier League match with Manchester United on 29 September 2024 are yet to be decided.\nThe updated FA guidance, combined with the change in law, appears to be having the desired effect.\nFigures from Kick it Out show reports of mass homophobic chanting are falling, with 17 reported incidents last season, down from 43 in the 2021-22 season.\nSteve knows he has been part of the problem.\nHe has never considered himself homophobic but since he got arrested he has been through a spectrum of emotions.\n\"Fear. Annoyance. Despair. Guilt. But then came acceptance,\" he said.\n\"My journey has sort of been about personal growth. Now I want to make a difference going forward. I want to make football a better place.\"\nHe wants to make sure other do not repeat his mistakes, adding: \"Treat everybody with respect or you'll end up like me with a ban and a criminal record.\n\"Some people who are gay have walked away from football altogether and don't feel it's safe. So, if I can just stop one person from doing that. I'll be happy. Just think before you speak.\"",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nButtler on 'right time for me' to leave England captaincy\nThe end came quicker than anyone expected.\nJust six months ago England coach Brendon McCullum backed Jos Buttler to the hilt despite questions over his captain's future.\nEven after defeat by Afghanistan, most thought the decision would be made after the flight home. Instead, Buttler resigned with a smile, his mate by his side, leaving McCullum searching for a new lieutenant.\nEngland's fall from the white-ball summit has been stark and there are issues aplenty to face...\n'Last rites and alarm bells drown out England's good vibes'\nEngland bowler Wood may need knee surgery\nThe first is the most obvious - finding Buttler's replacement.\nHarry Brook is the overwhelming favourite given he is the current deputy, impressed when standing in for the five-match one-day international series against Australia last September and is regularly praised by coaches and team-mates for his smart 'cricket brain'.\nBut appointing the 26-year-old would bring its own challenges.\nThere is less crossover ahead in England's multi-format schedule, but playing every white-ball match and being a Test regular would require Keely Hodgkinson's stamina.\nMcCullum has already accepted he will have to miss tours, having taken charge of the Test and limited-overs sides. If Brook were named skipper, he would surely have to do the same.\nThe alternative is turning to a white-ball specialist, but Adil Rashid, 37, is too old and Liam Livingstone and Phil Salt too insecure in the XI. Sam Curran has Indian Premier League captaincy experience, but is currently out of the side.\nRecalling a specialist captain like James Vince or Sam Billings is surely a non-starter.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nBoth Buttler and McCullum were keen to stress the resignation is not the end of the 34-year-old's England career.\n\"I'm sure we will look at ways that we can get the best out of him in terms of his role, so he can have maximum impact as well,\" said the former Black Caps skipper.\nYet Buttler the batter is in need of reinvigoration. He has scored only two 50s in ODIs since September 2023, but an example to follow is not hard to find.\n\"Hopefully now I can follow Joe Root's lead and play like he has since he relinquished the captaincy,\" Buttler said of his team-mate, who gave up the Test job and scored centuries in three of his next four Tests.\nButtler cannot continue as a non-captaining, non-bowling number six in the modern game, meaning some imagination is required.\nMcCullum and Buttler created a new role for Jamie Smith in this tournament - a powerplay-attacking number three that has resulted in Smith twice being dismissed cheaply by poor shots.\nPerhaps, a revitalised Buttler is actually the ideal man for that.\nThis one is English cricket's long-standing problem.\nWhen England focus on the Test side, the white-ball team struggles. When they give priority to those in a coloured kit, the red-ball side lurches towards review-inducing crisis.\nThat Buttler has rarely had his best players available is the caveat that should go down alongside a tournament record that reads one title and three sorry exits.\nMcCullum's first act as white-ball leader has been to bring the two sides closer together. Smith, Ben Duckett, Brydon Carse and Gus Atkinson are all Test players given limited-overs opportunities. The results cannot be deemed a success.\nEngland will play only 10 Tests this year, having played 17 in 2024, and McCullum does not sound ready for change.\n\"Most other teams manage that, if you look at India's players and how they play cross-formats, look at Australia's fast bowling line-up, New Zealand are similar,\" he said.\n\"I'm hopeful that with some shrewd planning and a better understanding of what our player pool looks like, we'll be able to make sure we can get it across all formats, because that's ultimately what people that follow this team deserves.\"\nThe damage caused by England's Champions Trophy campaign may not be consigned to three matches in eight days in Pakistan.\nMark Wood's knee injury could yet have serious consequences for their quest to regain the Ashes this winter.\nIf, as feared, he requires surgery, there have to be genuine concerns about how well the fast bowler can recover from going under the knife again aged 35.\nWood was picked for this tournament as part the current set-up's pace obsession.\nThat he, Jofra Archer, Jamie Overton, Atkinson and Saqib Mahmood - all capable of bowling at least 88mph - were picked is part of McCullum's plan to make fast bowling one of the USPs of English cricket. Again, this plan has not worked here.\nMcCullum will have half an eye on the next 50-over World Cup in southern Africa where fast, bouncy pitches should suit the ploy, but a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka comes before then.\nWho is the new-ball metronome to be the TikTok generation's Chris Woakes? Who will take middle-over wickets like Liam Plunkett or offer support to Archer at the death?\nAnd spinner Rashid's replacement looks as far away as ever\u2026\nThat takes us to another issue that continues to disadvantage England. They have to find a generation of 50-over cricketers from a pool who are not playing the format.\nThe Hundred is not going anywhere. England need to find a solution to the problems it has caused rather than just throw their arms into the air.\nThe main issue is not giving youngsters a taste of 50-over cricket - the One-Day Cup will continue to do that while it is played as a development competition alongside The Hundred - but instead ensuring the talents spotted have enough competitive, challenging cricket to aid their progression afterwards.\nThis is where the Lions programme will be crucial.\nJacob Bethell, Jordan Cox, Tom Hartley and Carse all played in the Lions' last ODI in February 2023 and have gone on to varying degrees of success on the international stage.\nAnother solution would be to move the One-Day Cup and give England an advantage over their rivals.\nNo nation's players are currently playing a good amount of domestic one-day cricket. Were England to find a way, their rebuild could gain a jump start.",

        "article_text": "Tom Pidcock is one of Britain's most successful riders in the modern era\nTom Pidcock said goodbye to Ineos Grenadiers at a training camp in December in Denia, Spain, \"on good terms\" following a career-defining three years which ended with the 25-year-old being \"no longer compatible\" with one of cycling's biggest and most successful teams.\nA couple of months later he looked a man unleashed as he blasted away from his pursuers on the second stage of his debut race for his new second-tier Q36.5 team, winning comfortably between steep sandstone rocks during the Alula Tour - a race where he would go on to win the overall green jersey.\nThe only thing missing was any of his true rivals for the big race wins this year. It made Pidcock look imperious in Saudi Arabia, but it's how he will look in Belgium and France as the season progresses that will define his year - and possibly the double Olympic mountain bike champion's road-race career.\nVery little information about how the relationship with one of Ineos' biggest talents broke down has made it outside the team bus. Which leaves many looking for clues within what both team and athlete say - even while they are trying not to say much.\n\"I think it's as simple as the word 'compatibility',\" said Ineos CEO John Allert during a pre-season press call. \"There's no guarantees in life... I think Tom and the team probably realised we'd come to a point of recognising that.\n\"I think the whole Tom topic might be one for a book in 10 years' time.\"\nIt's as telling, especially in Allert's last line, as it is diplomatic.\nThere's little doubt there was a fallout: they dropped him from competing in the final big race of last season - the Il Lombardia 'monument' classic across Italy's wealthy northern region. A one-day event Pidcock was perfect for.\nPidcock himself gave his own clues to BBC Sport during his second training camp before the new season. \"I feel fresher, more energised. I feel like it's my own journey, taking control and being in charge of my own destiny. It's a really nice feeling as well.\"\nThe past few seasons had seen Ineos shift from a winning machine to a more relaxed and autonomous environment, which would seemingly suit a young, nonchalant, multi-discipline athlete such as Pidcock.\nThey were happy to see him throw himself into a lake off a speedboat on Instagram, or fly at breakneck speed down the dirt tracks of the Alps for Olympic glory on a different kind of bike.\nBut road cycling is changing and Ineos are making a transition into a modern 'super-team'. This includes last year's introduction of performance director Scott Drawer and a search for more sponsors on top of the already substantial backing of Ineos owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, which requires a refocus on what was their original objective as Team Sky: to win the Tour de France, again and again.\nPidcock's Q36.5 team should receive an invitation to at least one Grand Tour, but it's in the one-day races above where the Briton could excel\nPidcock himself remains confident he is capable of winning a three-week race - he has won one of the hardest stages of the hardest race of them all, of course, descending his way to folklore at 100km/h before climbing Alpe d'Huez to victory during the 2022 Tour de France.\nPidcock, however, won't be there in 2025 as cycling's biggest race would have been unlikely to accept Q36.5 this year - given their current lower UCI ProTeams status, they will rely on wildcard invites to this year's biggest World Tour races.\n\"I'm happy, I've got a year out from it... a break. When I come back it'll be [with] a refreshed energy,\" he said.\nQ36.5 will make it to at least one three-week Grand Tour this year and it allows Pidcock to focus on the one-day races, where he has excelled in recent seasons.\nHis next objective must be to win one of the five 'monument' one-day races. \"Italian races, Ardennes [classics]... all these races I want to perform in, and now be a bit more focused on them.\"\nIt's a focus which begins this weekend with the spring classics 'opening weekend', the Omloop Nieuwsblad race in Belgium.\nMore clues lie within a team seemingly behind Ineos in terms of resource.\n\"This team has super-impressed me with how much knowledge there is and expertise in certain areas,\" said Pidcock. \"This is the highest standard of people I've actually ever worked with.\"\nPidcock knows he hasn't simply jumped ship and landed hastily with a minnow. There's a lot more to a team who have already won as many races this year as they had in a whole season since 2023.\nOwned by a former mining magnate, South African Ivan Glasenberg, the team - named after the high-end cycling clothing brand - have potentially very deep pockets and a few 'prestige' sponsors in a sport which still allows big spending to pay off quickly.\nThe team was born in 2023 out of the ashes of Team Dimension Data, which under many guises won several big races as a World Tour team across the previous 15 or so years, including Mark Cavendish - wearing the yellow jersey - claiming four Tour de France stage wins in 2016.\nPidcock's 2025 began with a bang with victory overall, and on the two climbing stages, at the Alula Tour in Saudi Arabia\nTeam boss Doug Ryder, a fellow South African, led that team. And while anyone would expect an employer to be excited about their new charge, Ryder's view of Pidcock is effusive.\n\"[Pidcock's] attention to detail is next-level,\" he says. \"He focuses on every millimetre. We did a nice team-building event, and it was Tom's idea, and then he wouldn't let the team pay - just those personal things are just really, really cool.\"\nQuite the team player for a man considered by some to be the opposite at Ineos. And it's likely the biggest clue of all when it comes to Pidcock's Ineos era...\n\"Within our team, he doesn't have to fight for leadership,\" concludes Ryder. \"He will be our out-and-out leader when we go to those races.\n\"He wants to be a world champion. And he wants to ride for general classification in a Grand Tour, and show that he's one of those riders that can stand tall on the podium in the highest endurance events in our sport.\"",

        "article_text": "Gene Hackman's daughters and granddaughter say they are \"devastated\" and will \"miss him sorely\", as they led tributes to the movie star who has died aged 95.\nHackman was found dead along with his wife Betsy Arakawa and their dog at his home in New Mexico, US. No cause of death was given, but police said the situation was \"suspicious enough\" to merit investigation.\nIn a statement, daughters Elizabeth and Leslie, and granddaughter Annie said: \"He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just dad and grandpa.\" \nMorgan Freeman who co-starred with Hackman in the 1992 movie Unforgiven - for which Hackman won an Oscar - described the actor as \"incredibly gifted\" while the movie's director Clint Eastwood said he was \"extremely saddened\" by the news. \nRalph Fiennes - nominated for an Oscar this year for Conclave - paid tribute to the late actor with a black and white portrait of a smiling Hackman, simply titled Gene Hackman 1930-2025. \nViola Davis called Hackman \"one of the greats\" while Tom Hanks posted on Instagram that: \"There has never been a 'Gene Hackman Type.' There has only been Gene Hackman.\"\nThe Prince of Wales also issued a statement saying he was \"so sad to hear the news\". \n\"Hackman was a true genius of film who brought each and every character to life with power, authenticity and star quality,\" added Prince William, who is also president of Bafta.\nHackman's 1978 Superman co-star Valerie Perrine labelled him \"a genius\", while the Guardian's film critic said his death \"marks the end\" of the era of American new wave cinema.\nThe Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, who worked with Hackman on the 1974 mystery thriller The Conversation, called Hackman \"a great artist\".\nIn a statement posted on Instagram, Coppola said: \"Gene Hackman a great actor, inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity.\n\"I mourn his loss, and celebrate his existence and contribution.\"\nHackman, who won two Oscars for his work on The French Connection and Clint Eastwood's Western Unforgiven, played more than 100 roles across his career.\nThey included supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s.\nPerrine, who acted opposite Hackman as his character's on-screen girlfriend Eve Teschmacher, described the late actor as \"a genius\" and one of the \"greatest to grace the silver screen\".\nShe posted on X: \"His performances are legendary. His talent will be missed. Goodbye my sweet Lex Till we meet again.\"\nHackman appeared alongside Hollywood heavyweights including Al Pacino in 1973's Scarecrow, Gene Wilder in 1974's Young Frankenstein and Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton in 1981's Reds.\nHe also starred in the hit movies Runaway Jury and Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums.\nThe British Academy of Film and Television, said it was \"saddened\" to hear of Hackman's death, describing him as a \"much-celebrated\" actor with an \"illustrious\" career.\nSpanish actor Antonio Banderas described it as being \"a very sad day for the cinema's family\".\nHank Azaria, the actor best known for voicing characters in The Simpsons, said \"it was an honour and an education working with Gene Hackman\" on 1996's The Birdcage.\n\"Mike Nichols said of his genius character acting: 'He always brought just enough of a different part of the real gene to each role he played.' Sending all my love to his family and friends.\nStar Trek actor George Takei posted: \"We have lost one of the true giants of the screen.\n\"Gene Hackman could play anyone, and you could feel a whole life behind it,\" he wrote.\n\"He could be everyone and no-one, a towering presence or an everyday Joe. That's how powerful an actor he was.

In 2020, the season halted, delayed and then restarted in front of no supporters because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Liverpool won the Premier League and Leeds won the Championship, returning to the top flight after a 16-year absence.\nDaniel Farke's side are now five points ahead of Sheffield United, who are in the other automatic promotion place, and seven in front of third-placed Burnley. After Saturday's visit by West Brom to Elland Road, 10 out of Leeds' last 11 games will be against teams outside the top 10.\nIn all likelihood, work will be going on behind the scenes to try to make Leeds' next top-flight campaign far different to their last, which ended in relegation after three seasons.\nMaking an impact will not be easy.\nIn the past 15 years, 42% of all promoted teams have dropped back to the Championship in the first season. That rises to 50% in the past decade.\nAmpadu faces surgery in blow for Wales and Leeds\nLeeds stun Sheff Utd with comeback to go five clear\nLatest Leeds United news, analysis and fan views\nFormer Leeds manager Marcelo Bielsa remains a legendary figure among fans from their last promotion into the Premier League.\nFirstly, let's deal with the elephant in the room. Marcelo Bielsa.\nWhen Leeds were last promoted in 2020, they did so under the guidance of a man who has assumed legendary status in West Yorkshire.\nBielsa took a group of average players and turned them into a collective force. \nThey shrugged off the heartbreak of missing out on promotion in 2019 by going up the following season and then finishing ninth in the Premier League. \nThey played exhilarating, attractive football and were a joy to watch.\nBielsa's team eventually faded, shattered by the demands placed on it. Bielsa was sacked in February 2022, with the Leeds hierarchy fearing relegation.\nIt was an astute move as Bielsa's replacement, Jesse Marsch, kept them up. But the stay of execution lasted only a year and Bielsa's reputation among supporters remained high. \nFarke accepted the challenge. The former Norwich boss signed a four-year deal in July 2023. His first season ended with 90 points but defeat by Southampton in the play-off final at Wembley.\nMany fans wanted the German out. It was never going to happen.\n\"I always thought he had a two-year window, so I never felt he was in jeopardy,\" said BBC Radio Leeds commentator Adam Pope. \n\"They got 90 points and the basis from which he started was such a mess. Players were agitating to leave and I don't think he knew who was going to be available from match to match. \n\"It was an extraordinary effort to get as far as they did. But this was the year it has felt like it had to happen.\"\nFarke himself will have a point to prove, as well as big question marks over his own Premier League credentials.\nHis Norwich team bounced between Championship title winners in 2019, Premier League relegation in 2020 and promotion again in 2021, before he was sacked 11 games into his second Premier League campaign in November 2021. Farke's top-flight record is six wins from 49 games.\nDaniel Farke won two Championship promotions in three seasons with Norwich\nOne source with knowledge of the inner workings of Leeds explained the issue the club had on their last three-year stay in the Premier League was that then-owner Andrea Radrizzani just didn't have the funds to kick on.\nRadrizzani's shares were bought by the 49ers Enterprises when they took over Leeds in the summer of 2023, The investment arm of the American football franchise San Francisco 49ers is also attempting to buy a significant stake in Glasgow Rangers.\nThey proved that they have the finance by methodically working through what has been described as the massive 'credit card bill' of instalment payments for transfers from a sizeable churn of players in and out of Elland Road.\nDoubtless they will have a plan for this summer and beyond.\nHowever, there are two issues that are inescapable.\nFirstly, Leeds are hamstrung by the knowledge two seasons in the EFL slices \u00a344m off the maximum \u00a3105m three-year loss limit that applies to the rest of the Premier League.\nAnd beyond that, how much will survival actually cost?\nFor the second year running, the three teams that were promoted from the Championship are looking likely to go straight back down. \nTwo of them, Leicester and Southampton, have far more recent top-flight experience than Leeds. Their struggles prove jumping up from the Championship - even with the benefit of parachute payments - is one thing, but staying there is another matter entirely.\nLeeds clearly need at least one striker. They sold Georginio Rutter to Brighton for \u00a340m in August, which sets a benchmark for a decent Premier League forward. \nWhen you start adding in creative midfielders, full-backs and a goalkeeper - Illan Meslier added another mistake to this season's 'crime sheet' by scoring an own goal to give Sheffield United the lead on Monday - the millions rack up.\nTwo of Farke's mainstays, Joe Rothwell and Manor Solomon, are on loan and will need to be bought or replaced, so the bill for a decent shot at survival is going to be astronomical.\nElland Road has been Leeds United's home since the club was formed in 1919\nOne way of paying for this would be to generate greater revenue from Leeds' vast fanbase.\nPlans are already in place to expand the dated Elland Road stadium from its current 38,000 capacity by redeveloping the West Stand and the Revie Stand to eventually take the capacity to 55,000.\nThe aim is to use the same model as Liverpool, whose work on the Anfield Road stand was done by building over the top of the existing structure.\nBut this work will not be cheap. Leeds need to be in the Premier League before club chiefs press ahead.\nFor Leeds' financial executives, a delicate balance needs to be navigated between ploughing resource into infrastructure and Farke's squad. Ideally, it should be a twin track process and fans understand that.\nAfter Monday's match, I asked Farke if he felt an \"obligation\" to take Leeds back to the Premier League.\nHe said not. But the answer was revealing.\n\"In the last 25 years, we were promoted to the Premier League once and had three seasons in it, one outstanding season for Marcelo and two difficult ones, including a relegation,\" he said.\n\"At the moment, you are not allowed to label us as an established Premier League side. This is what I want to change.\n\"It is good for us to stay humble. At this club, after a win, everyone speaks about Europe, after a loss, people are saying we will probably go down to League Two. That is what these clubs are all about.\n\"It is a great honour to be in this chair at this amazing club. It is a great responsibility but it comes with pressure. \n\"Everyone expects us to win. That is what Leeds is all about.\"\nLatest Leeds United news, analysis and fan views\nListen to the latest Don't Go To Bed Just Yet podcast",

No cause of death was given, but police said the situation was \"suspicious enough\" to merit investigation.\nIn a statement, daughters Elizabeth and Leslie, and granddaughter Annie said: \"He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just dad and grandpa.\" \nMorgan Freeman who co-starred with Hackman in the 1992 movie Unforgiven - for which Hackman won an Oscar - described the actor as \"incredibly gifted\" while the movie's director Clint Eastwood said he was \"extremely saddened\" by the news. \nRalph Fiennes - nominated for an Oscar this year for Conclave - paid tribute to the late actor with a black and white portrait of a smiling Hackman, simply titled Gene Hackman 1930-2025. \nViola Davis called Hackman \"one of the greats\" while Tom Hanks posted on Instagram that: \"There has never been a 'Gene Hackman Type.' There has only been Gene Hackman.\"\nThe Prince of Wales also issued a statement saying he was \"so sad to hear the news\". \n\"Hackman was a true genius of film who brought each and every character to life with power, authenticity and star quality,\" added Prince William, who is also president of Bafta.\nHackman's 1978 Superman co-star Valerie Perrine labelled him \"a genius\", while the Guardian's film critic said his death \"marks the end\" of the era of American new wave cinema.\nThe Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, who worked with Hackman on the 1974 mystery thriller The Conversation, called Hackman \"a great artist\".\nIn a statement posted on Instagram, Coppola said: \"Gene Hackman a great actor, inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity.\n\"I mourn his loss, and celebrate his existence and contribution.\"\nHackman, who won two Oscars for his work on The French Connection and Clint Eastwood's Western Unforgiven, played more than 100 roles across his career.\nThey included supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s.\nPerrine, who acted opposite Hackman as his character's on-screen girlfriend Eve Teschmacher, described the late actor as \"a genius\" and one of the \"greatest to grace the silver screen\".\nShe posted on X: \"His performances are legendary.

        "article_text": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim during the 2-2 draw at Everton on 22 February\nManchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says he and his players must take some responsibility for the club's present financial predicament.\nSpeaking less than 24 hours after United confirmed a second round of redundancies that will lead to up to 200 staff members losing their jobs, Amorim said that, as the \"engine\" of the club, his squad must do better.\nAfter losing more than \u00a3300m in the past five years, United find themselves 15th in the Premier League before their encounter with relegation-threatened Ipswich at Old Trafford on Wednesday.\nIt is their worst league campaign since the dark days of 1989-90, when Sir Alex Ferguson almost got the sack as United flirted with the relegation zone before eventually finishing 13th.\n\"We have to address all the problems in the club but one important piece of this moment is to understand how we get to this situation,\" said Amorim. \n\"It has a lot to do with the lack of success of the football team because we are the engine of any football club.\"\nIn the space of under two seasons, United have fallen from a third-place finish in Erik ten Hag's first season in charge to their current position.\nWhile Amorim and his squad might be insulated from the cost-cutting measures - staff at Old Trafford will no longer get free lunches in a move the club estimates will save \u00a31m - some of the people they work with every day will soon no longer be around.\n\"We know this year was really hard for everybody,\" said Amorim, who replaced Ten Hag in November.\n\"As a club, we did a lot of changes. When you are doing the changes if you have a football team who are playing well and winning games, it is easier for the fans and everyone to feel that. But in this moment we are in a difficult period inside of the club and inside of the pitch. We have to fight against this feeling.\n\"We have do our job and we try our best to help the team to perform better.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'I feel sorry for Rasmus Hojlund' - Troy Deeney\nUnited have scored 30 goals from 26 league games so far this season, with Rasmus Hojlund managing just two from 15 league starts.\nThe 22-year-old Denmark striker, who was signed from Atalanta for \u00a372 in August 2023, has scored seven goals in all competitions, with his last strike coming in the Europa League against Viktoria Plzen on 12 December.\n\"I think it's clear, we as a team, we are not helping Rasmus,\" Amorim added. \"We don't create a lot of chances.\n\"I think Rasmus has a lot of potential. If we improve the way we play the game, he will have more opportunities to score.\n\"He came here very young and, when you are very young, to be the number nine and play all the time sometimes is hard.\n\"We have to look at Rasmus as a player: he has the pace, he has the technique, he scores some goals that are really hard to score.\n\"Sometimes he doesn't choose the better runs, sometimes he's so anxious to touch the ball because he passes long minutes without the ball and he moves away from the goal.\n\"We address that in training. He has the ability, he already showed that here, but I think it's more a team thing than a Rasmus thing.\"\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

The fans and the players will always be in my heart and I've always said my top level in my career I did with them.\"\nBojan may not have been the next Messi but he was forging an impressive career at Stoke, with his form leading to links with moves to Liverpool and Manchester United.\nBut a serious knee injury in January 2015 disrupted his progress and he was never the same again. Spells at Mainz and Alaves followed before he finished his career in Japan, retiring in 2022.\nThe following year he returned to Barcelona, taking on the football co-ordinator role, and while he may only be a couple of years older than some of those in the current first-team, he is enjoying his new life off the pitch.\n\"I don't miss playing football,\" he said. \n\"I feel that was the end of a chapter in my life, I felt proud about what I did and what I learned from the good and the bad experiences. \n\"I see the players now when they are training and playing and I feel already I did this, and now I am on another step and looking forward.\"\nListen to the full interview with Bojan Krkic on the Euro Leagues podcast on BBC Sounds.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Pamela Anderson has had her fair share of ups and down over her career.\nSo that might explain why she's so stoic about missing out on an Oscar nomination for her role in The Last Showgirl.\n\u201cThe win is the work,\u201d the Canadian actress told BBC News.\n\u201cYou couldn't have told me I'd be here a decade ago, so this is very exciting for me, to even be in the conversation.\u201d\nAnderson, 57, did manage to score nominations at the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild Awards for her part in Gia Coppola\u2019s film about a fading Las Vegas dancer.\nBut she is not in the running for the Academy Awards, which take place this Sunday in Los Angeles.\n\u201cI just wish everybody well,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI think anybody, any actor, realises that all of this is about having another chance to be able to perform and share your talent with the world.\u201d\nAnderson rose to prominence on the 1990s TV series Baywatch.\nThe lifeguard drama became the most-watched television show in the world at the time, and it's still the role she's best known for.\nBut in the three decades since she first ran along the California beaches, fans and critics have become acquainted with different parts of Anderson's life story including Playboy covers, a leaked sex tape and many marriages.\nIn 2022, Hulu series Pam & Tommy told the story of how Anderson and now ex-husband Tommy Lee's sex tape was stolen and illegally distributed in the mid-90s.\nAnderson later criticised the series in an interview with Variety, describing it as \"shocking\" and calling for the people behind it to apologise to her.\nNow, she's starring in a new film which is also about second chances.\nIn The Last Showgirl, the lead character Shelly, played by Anderson, must plan for her future after her show abruptly closes.\nPlenty of critics have drawn parallels with Anderson\u2019s own life in the spotlight, and she doesn't dispute this.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s what drew me to the project, that it was so relatable on so many levels,\u201d Anderson said of the film.\nShe added that its central theme, of struggling to make your career work as a woman in later middle age, was something \"many generations of women\" had faced.\nIn the film, Shelly is portrayed as having a strained relationship with her daughter Hannah.\nShelly's career as a showgirl means she often works late, causing her to miss important moments like bedtime with Hannah.\nThat, too, is something that Anderson says she can relate to.\nShe shares two sons, Brandon Thomas, 28, and Dylan Jagger, 27, with her ex-husband, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce drummer Tommy Lee.\nShe said that for all working mums, there's \"no proper way\" to be a parent while also following your dreams and pursuing your career.\n\u201cSo this movie is, I think, in a very vulnerable space.\n\u201cAnd it was an interesting role to play with all her imperfections and selfishness and selflessness. And it was a lot of layers and nuances to the character that I could really relate to.\u201d\nThe Last Showgirl has received a mixed reception from critics, though most have praised Anderson's performance.\nThe New York Times called it \"sensitive and beguiling\" and described Anderson as \"dazzling\". But the Guardian awarded it just one star, calling it \"a big disappointment\" (although a later review bumped that up to three stars).\nMany have also described the role as Anderson's \"comeback\". She doesn't reject the term, but says she prefers to see it as \"a new chapter\".\n\"I've always been fascinated with the craft of acting,\" she said. \"[But] my personal life kind of took me off course, and I raised two beautiful boys.\"\nShe's not the only actress to be back in the spotlight this season.\nDemi Moore is nominated for best actress at the Oscars for her role in The Substance, a body horror which has revitalised her career.\n\"I'm really happy for Demi,\" Anderson said. \"I think she's earned her place. And you have to earn it. You have to fight for it.\"\nWith so many strong female protagonists in this year's films, I'm curious what Anderson now thinks of Baywatch.\nThe show has long been criticised for its portrayal of its female characters, who, many argued, were sexualised and denied meaningful plot lines.\n\"I didn't see it like that at all. I thought it was quite innocent and wholesome and, and fun to watch,\" she said.\n\"I always felt like I was surrounded by such incredible people, lifeguards that were also firemen or firewomen. It was really, really, empowering.\"\nAnderson has always been seen to embody a look that rose to prominence in the 90s - skinny, blonde, and enhanced by plastic surgery.\nBut in recent years, she has been sporting a \"no-makeup\" look, choosing instead to embrace her natural appearance.\n\"My beauty routine is rest. And so that's more important to me these days,\" she told me.\nShe said it's not that she's against makeup, but more that she thinks \"there's a time and a place\" for it.\n\"This chapter, for me, has been about self-acceptance and finding out who I am. What are my original thoughts?

Mr Musk, who was born in South Africa, holds both Canadian and US citizenship.\nResponding to the petition, the billionaire wrote on X: \"Canada is not a real country.\" The post was later deleted.\nThe petition claims the billionaire \"has used his wealth and power to influence our elections\" and \"has now become a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty\". Mr Musk has Canadian citizenship through his mother, who was born in Saskatchewan.\nLaunched on 20 February, the petition, already signed by more than 250,000 Canadians, remains open for signatures until 20 June. \nIt is mostly symbolic and has no legal force. But petitions with at least 500 signatures and a member of parliament's backing typically receive a government response, this one may not, as a spring election could dissolve parliament.\nIt was created by a British Columbia author and endorsed by MP Charlie Angus of the New Democratic Party.

He later emigrated to the US.\nThe billionaire has backed Trump's hardline immigration policies but now faces scrutiny over claims he worked illegally in the US on a student visa. \nIn a recent interview, Steve Bannon, a former advisor to President Trump, called Mr Musk a \"parasitic illegal immigrant\". \nThe Tesla CEO has denied the accusations, and has said he did not work illegally. He became a naturalised US citizen in 2002, according to a recent biography.\nThe BBC has contacted Mr Musk via his businesses for comment.",
