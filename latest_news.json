So he delayed saying farewell to a place that means so much to him.\n\"They're the two most important wins in my career,\" he said of his 1985 and 1993 victories at Augusta, which are his sole major triumphs.\n\"It's emotional. You can tell already my voice is breaking a bit just realising it's going to be my last competitive Masters.\"\nLanger has conceded for many years that he no longer has the game to compete at Augusta; three missed cuts in his past three Masters are testament to that.\n\"The course is just getting too long and I'm getting shorter and shorter,\" he said. \n\"I'm hitting hybrids [into greens] where the other kids are hitting nine-irons, maybe even wedges. So I knew I wasn't going to be in contention anymore.\n\"A few years back I asked the chairman of the club, 'is there a time limit? Do we age out when we're 60?'. He said, 'no, you will know when it's time to quit, it's totally up to you'.\n\"It is time to quit.\"\nLyle, Langer, Woosnam, Olazabal, Ballesteros and Faldo were victorious at Augusta National in an extraordinary era of success for European golf\nLanger was runner-up at The Open twice and third on three occasions in a career that promised more major success.\nThat he was unable to add a major other than his two at Augusta only intensifies his link to this fabled corner of Georgia.\nIn 40 appearances, he has made the cut 27 times and finished inside the top 10 nine times.\n\"It's been an incredible journey, for a young man born in a village of 800 people [in Bavaria, southern Germany], where golf was nothing, to make it here,\" he said.\n\"To get an invitation to play the Masters when it was extremely difficult for European or international players to get one, and then to win the Masters on the third go was just a dream come true.\"\nHe was just the third non-American winner, following in the footsteps of South Africa's three-time champion Gary Player and Seve Ballesteros of Spain, who won twice. \nHis win cemented belief among Europeans that success could be achieved at Augusta.\nBallesteros paved the way with his victories in 1980 and 1983, before Langer won his first two years later. \nThen Scotland's Sandy Lyle, England's Nick Faldo (twice) Wales' Ian Woosnam, Langer again and Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal collected six of seven titles from 1988.\nLanger's debut was in 1982, two years after Ballesteros had broken the glass ceiling. \nThe German's initial experience was hardly noteworthy. He shot 77 and 78 to miss the halfway cut by one stroke after three-putting 11 times in 36 holes on unfamiliar greens that were too slick for a naive 24-year-old.\n\"Coming here the first time, driving down Magnolia Lane, seeing this place for the first time was an eye-opener,\" he said. \n\"I had never seen a golf course manicured like this or a tournament run as efficiently as this has been.\"\nBy the time Langer won his second title in 1993, he was married with three children\nHe vowed to come back better prepared and when he returned two years later he made it through to the weekend - the first of an incredible run of 19 successive Masters that Langer would play all four rounds.\nHis victory 12 months later was secured with a classic back-nine Augusta charge. He birdied four out of six holes from the 12th as he overturned a three-shot deficit to Curtis Strange, who dropped shots on three of his final five holes.\nLanger bogeyed the 18th but still beat Strange, Ray Floyd and his playing partner Ballesteros by two shots.\nHe made a solid defence of his title in 1986 and briefly shared the lead in the final round before Jack Nicklaus produced a back nine for the ages to clinch his record-extending sixth Green Jacket and 18th major title.\nThat week was also memorable for witnessing the first time a world ranking was published, and it was Langer who had the honour of topping the inaugural list.\nHe was becoming something of an Augusta specialist and the love affair strengthened with two more top 10s before he claimed his second victory in 1993.\nLanger was challenged by unheralded American Dan Forsman in the final round. \nForsman was one shot behind the German when he teed off on the notoriously tricky par-three 12th. He dumped two balls in the water, walked off with a quadruple-bogey seven and was barely heard of again.\nIn contrast, Langer's name continued to pepper the leaderboards at Augusta, with top 10s in 1997, 2001 and 2004. \nHe finished joint eighth at the age of 56 in 2014 and held the record for the oldest player to make the cut - at the age of 63 in 2020 - until Fred Couples eclipsed that in 2023.\nThis is Langer's final Masters but not the end of competitive golf for the former Ryder Cup captain, who looks as fit as he did in his pomp.\nHe shows no signs of slowing down on the PGA Tour Champions - the US-based seniors tour - and has racked up at least one victory a year since joining the circuit in 2007 when he turned 50. \nHe has won 12 majors among 47 senior victories - both of which are records.\nThis week he is back among the game's youthful elite though, and will seek to end his Masters career with the same controlled elegance with which he has played throughout his career.\nHe will not contend for the title. That is clear. Instead, the question is whether his Masters career ends after round two on Friday, or if he defies his own expectations and makes the cut.\n\"After four decades it's going to be bittersweet,\" he said.\n\"When I'm inside the ropes, my mind switches to being a competitor, play golf and take care of the task in front of me. \n\"But I might get a bit emotional looking around, seeing my family, my kids, my grandkids, my brother and other friends that are going to be supporting me this week.\n\"I love the Masters more than any tournament in the world. I'm expecting it to be very difficult emotionally.\"",

        "article_text": "Rory McIlroy's Augusta troubles started on the 10th hole of the final round in 2011 with a wayward drive into the trees down the left\nIt is often referred to as the most important distance in golf; the five inches between the ears.\nThe game is as much a test of temperament as technique and champions at the very highest level have to conquer both elements to land the biggest titles.\nIn their pomp the likes of Colin Montgomerie and Lee Westwood had the physical attributes to win any tournament they played. But something would always get in the way when it came to the majors; the big four tournaments that define careers.\nThere was always a stumbling block at the Masters, The Open, the US Open or US PGA Championship. It prevented them, and many others, from producing their best shots when they most needed them.\nIt is not a slight to say this. It's golf. The mental challenge of pulling off key shots when the only inhibiter is the pressure of the moment encapsulates the magic of the game.\nIt will be evident in abundance again this week as Rory McIlroy embarks on his latest attempt to complete the career Grand Slam. He is among the world's best who are all gathering together for the first time in eight months for the Masters at Augusta National.\nMasters - dates, tee times, favourites & how to follow on the BBC\nMcIlroy can cope with Masters pressure - Mickelson\nMcIlroy dealing with elbow issue before Masters\nThese major weeks are the ultimate individual examination and for all his prolific form at tour level, McIlroy has failed to add to his tally of four major wins since 2014.\nWe wonder why Westwood and Monty never won a major, why it took Phil Mickelson until his 13th year on tour to land his first win on this elevated stage but the most burning current question surrounds McIlroy's frustrations - the majors and most pertinently the Masters.\nSo precocious was the Northern Irishman's talent when he first competed as a teenager in 2009 he was asked about completing the Grand Slam by the age of 22.\nTwo years on at Augusta he led by four shots going into the final round, only to shoot 80 in a scarring denouement. Despite four subsequent top-five finishes, he has never since embarked on the final day back nine with a real chance of glory.\n\"The biggest challenge for Rory is the mental one,\" said Paul McGinley. The former Ryder Cup captain's Golf Channel colleague, Brandel Chamblee, added of the Masters. \"It is literally his nemesis, It brings out the worst golf in Rory annually.\"\nMcIlroy dropped six shots in three holes in the final round as his hopes of winning the 2011 Masters evaporated\nThe popular view is that McIlroy suffers from a build up of mental scar tissue, first triggered by that Augusta capitulation in 2011.\nAlthough he quickly started collecting his quartet of majors, post 2014 there have been many instances where further setbacks have added to the malaise. Most recent was last year's US Open where he was beaten by to the title by Bryson DeChambeau despite leading by two with five holes to play.\n\"It is possible for people to build something up in their heads and say this is the one that I struggle with because previously something bad happened,\" chartered psychologist Stephen Smith told BBC Sport.\n\"That memory hasn't been processed properly out of what we call the short term executive memory into your long term memory. \n\"And it's literally interfering with the performance message from the higher order brain. \n\"It's almost like a mini form of PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder).\"\nSmith has worked with athletes across a wide range of sports and says bad memories can influence physical performance.\n\"The wire that carries the performance movement message from your brain to your body gets that wonderful swing going in a connected way,\" he said.\n\"And that's why you make more mistakes on that hole or on that course or in that tournament, because you're just literally not able to send the signal to the muscles. It's getting interfered with by what you would call scar tissue.\"\nNot since that ill-fated tilt in 2011, when he began with a 65, has McIlroy made a dominant start to the Masters. He has only broken 70 on one occasion - a 69 in 2018 when he finished tied fifth behind Patrick Reed after a final round 74.\nIn this period he has won at every level, including the prestigious Players Championship twice. The second of those Sawgrass wins occurred only last month and that combined with a fine win at Pebble Beach in February is fuelling optimism for this week.\nThe now 35-year-old is second favourite behind defending champion Scottie Scheffler, who has yet to win this year. Indeed, of all the biggest names, McIlroy has had the most successful start to the year.\nStars are aligning for him to win the one major to elude him.\nVictory this week would put him alongside the all time greats; Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods - the only golfers to have won all four majors and completed the Grand Slam collection.\nMcIlroy is desperate to wear the famous Green Jacket, but can you want it too much?  \n\"That's a very good point,\" said Smith.\n\"All of this is said without me ever having spoken to Rory, I couldn't comment as to how accurate my views on the situation are.\n\"But looking at it from outside the goldfish bowl that is tournament golf, you look at it and say, OK, right, maybe that's it, it could be that he actually wants it too much.\"\nMcIlroy has been working with sports psychologist Bob Rotella in the build up to his 17th attempt at winning the Masters. \"I think he'll have him very well prepared now,\" McGinley said.\n\"They've had two or three runs at this now, and I think they will be coming up with a plan in terms of taking that pressure and decimating it and putting it aside.\"\nSmith believes the answer lies in reaffirming good memories, such as McIlroy's imperious opening drive in his three-hole play-off win over JJ Spaun at the Players three weeks ago. The champion admitted to being very nervous before that tee shot.\nNicklaus, winner of a record 18 majors, used to insist he never missed a short putt in the sport's biggest championships, which was not true but a valuable technique to reaffirm confidence. Woods would celebrate fine shots with a trademark move with his club.\n\"Tiger with his club twirl,\" said Smith, who is an associate fellow of the British Psychological Society. \"It's a hard copy down of the good stuff into the long-term memory so he can draw on it.\n\"I know that I can do it. I know that I've won.\"\nAnd while the notion of accumulated mental scar tissue is potentially ruinous, Smith believes that McIIroy is at a prime age to deal with any such issue.\n\"His emotional intelligence is growing, immensely,\" he said. \"He is not the man he was was when he was 29 or 30.\"\nAnd in 2025, McIlroy - without yet playing at his very best - looks assured. Using a different ball this year his technique, especially in his approach play, looks better nuanced and more effective.\nSo this might just be the year for the man with 28 PGA Tour wins, but no major victories in his past 38 attempts. He is playing the best golf of any of the leading contenders, but this week carries a mental burden far greater than any of his rivals.\nIt is the bit between the ears.\n\"You've got to own it because if you don't it'll just niggle away at you,\" Smith said. \"So you've got to almost burst that cyst, excise it, clean it out,  deal with it.\"",

        "article_text": "Once home to a thriving Jewish majority, Thessaloniki holds fragments of a lost world. One traveller's journey to find them leads to something even more powerful: living memory.\nAs my family admired the gleaming remodel of Thessaloniki's century-old Modiano Market, local culinary guide Smaragda Marki admitted to me that among the trendy cafes and German delicatessen, she wished it were just a little more Greek. \"I wish it were a little more Jewish,\" I responded, staring up at the colourful Easter decorations.\nThe newly reopened market had topped my list of places to go in Greece's second-largest city, bringing together my two favourite things to look for while travelling: good food and tidbits of Jewish history. However, Modiano left me dissatisfied on both counts. Though the building still bears the name of its Jewish architect and stands on the site of the former Talmud Torah Synagogue, little else hinted that the nut stand used to be a kosher butcher or that Jews had any other part of its past life.\nThessaloniki was once considered an epicentre of Jewish culture, one of the only cities in Europe where Jews were the majority. Known as Salonika at the time, it was part of the Ottoman Empire until 1912. The Ottoman Empire allowed Jews escaping the Spanish Inquisition in the 15th Century to settle there for hundreds of years. But with Ottoman power beginning to wane in the early 20th Century, Greece took over the city in 1912. Five years later, the Great Fire of 1917 devastated huge swaths of the city and left 70,000 people homeless, including much of the Jewish population. The Talmud Torah Synagogue (and 31 others) were destroyed. The one-time centre of Jewish culture and majority Jewish city received its final blow in 1943 when Nazi forces deported 50,000 Jews to Europe's concentration camps.\nEighty years later, I struggled to find traces of the community, and even finding a Jewish guide to show me around proved difficult. It wasn't surprising; Thessaloniki's Jewish community now numbers less than 1,000 people, a small population sample within which to find a niche professional tour guide. Plenty of companies offered tours of Jewish Thessaloniki, most touting bonafides by proximity to, rather than being a part of the small congregation.\nEventually, I booked through a company based in Athens because it was run by a Greek Jew. I still didn't know if my actual guides would be Jewish, though at least I could be sure they were trusted by the community.\nWhen Elia Matalon greeted us the next morning, I let out a sigh of relief. In the lobby of our hotel, he explained that he and his wife Hella Kounio-Matalon run their tours together and they both come from families that go back many generations in Thessaloniki's Jewish community. Later in the eight-hour tour he would tell us about how his mother survived the war by hiding in homes across the border in Albania while Kounio-Matalon spoke of her father surviving Auschwitz. We began walking toward a Holocaust memorial sculpture, through a narrow alleyway where he pointed to a restaurant owned by a gentile chef who became fascinated by the city's Jewish history and now serves traditional Sephardic Jewish foods like nogada (meatballs in walnut sauce).\nMuch of the city's history is Jewish history. In the Ano Ladadika neighbourhood, we stared up at the city's famous broken clock, stopped by an earthquake in 1978. The building originally belonged to a bank started by the Italian Jewish Allatini brothers, 19th-Century entrepreneurs whose flour company grew to be the largest in the Balkans before World War Two.\nWe walked down adjacent Siggrou Street and paused in front of a 1926 mansion. Today, it houses a hookah bar, which meant we could wander into the lovely plant-filled atrium and up the grand staircase. Outside, Matalon pointed out the holes in the doorpost where a mezuzah once hung. A visible symbol of Jewish identity, the traditional decorative case holds a prayer, fulfilling the commandment to \"write them on the doorposts of your house\".\nSo much of visiting Jewish history around the world is like this: evidence of where we once were. Visiting the former site of the Jewish cemetery. Peering at painted-over holes and fading stars of David. Jews left their mark on Thessaloniki, but hardly in a fashion that hints to the glorious centre of Jewish life it once was. I love to imagine what it was like to live in these rich Jewish worlds, what could be if we weren't constantly getting kicked out of places.\nAcross the street from Modiano Market, we entered one of the city's two remaining synagogues. Because Thessaloniki's laws granted properties owned by Jews before WW2 without surviving family members to the Jewish community, the congregation owns the building, which mostly houses offices, and the synagogue on the ground floor. Marble tablets on the wall list the more than 70 synagogues that served the city's once much-larger Jewish population. The money the rent brings in allows the synagogue to pay retirees to show up to complete their minyan (the minimum number of people needed for a prayer service), a win-win situation.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Mediterranean's ancient gay-friendly civilisation\n\u2022 The Tour de France champion who saved hundreds of Jews\n\u2022 The tiny, idyllic island where Greeks escape the heat\nOutside the building, I learned how a bench signals that a piece of Thessaloniki's Jewish culture still lives within. The decorative wooden top looks the same as any other bench, a comforting and welcoming place to sit on busy Vasileos Irakleiou, between a synagogue and Modiano Market. Below, a sturdy cement bollard telegraphs its true purpose: these surround all the remaining Jewish sites in the city, protecting them from potential violence by vehicle.\nWe see them again outside the only remaining pre-WW2 synagogue, the community's other house of prayer. The Monastir Synagogue escaped destruction by invading Axis forces because the Red Cross used it during the war, a story that would be slightly more heartwarming if they hadn't nearly destroyed it themselves by using it as a storehouse and stable. It has since been returned to its stained-glass and marble-walled glory.\nA large tour group from a cruise, wearing headsets to hear their guide, filed in, and I browsed the tiny museum in the foyer until they left, just a few minutes later. Then Matalon and Kounio-Matalon announced that they had a surprise for us. Together, they offered to sing a song in Ladino, the ancient version of Judeo-Spanish spoken by the region's Jews: Adio Kerido (Goodbye, Beloved), a love song repurposed as a farewell to Holocaust deportees.\nBy the time they stepped onto the bimah, the raised platform at the front of the sanctuary, I had already seen the history for which I came: the train car parked permanently at the station in memory of the city's Jews, who were deported in similar ones; the mansions built by the thriving majority population of the 19th Century; and the lovely, solemn Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki. But as their voices joined, reverberating in the incredible acoustics of the large room, singing \"Adio, adio, kerido\", I realised I'd found something even better: a unique Jewish culture still alive.\n\"No kero la vida,\" they sang hauntingly, beautifully, mournfully, \"I don't want to live.\" The song offered such sorrow for the departing love, but it brought me such happiness to hear, to see this moment, the kind of moment for which people travel. A moment that could never be predicted, that could never be expected, and, more than anything, that could never happen anywhere else in the world except precisely here.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Jorgen Strand Larsen bundles in Wolves' late winner to push Ipswich closer to the drop\nIpswich are teetering on the brink. With seven games left and 12 points to make up on fourth-bottom Wolves, the battle to stay up looks over. \nJorgen Strand Larsen's scrappy 84th-minute goal settled a tense encounter between the two relegation rivals after Pablo Sarabia had cancelled out a Town opener from Liam Delap.\nDefeat pushed the Tractor Boys closer to the drop in a game they simply had to win. Their fairytale rise from League One to the top flight in successive seasons looks certain to end with an immediate return to the Championship. \nWolves' comeback success at Portman Road crucially stretched them further clear of the bottom three and even Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna conceded their fight for survival looks bleak.\n\"I think it's certainly more than likely on the balance of probabilities,\" he said when asked about the prospect of relegation. \"Not that I don't think we can't finish the season strongly, but Wolves are a strong side and the chance of them losing all their games is really low. \n\"The likelihood is we'll fall short of our ultimate dream.\"\nWhen Ipswich won 2-1 at Wolves in December through Jack Taylor's last-gasp header - which ended Gary O'Neil's managerial reign at Molineux - they moved three points above Wolves.\nTown were still third bottom at the time, but just a point behind Crystal Palace, while second-bottom Wolves were four adrift of safety.\nFast forward five months and defeat at Portman Road leaves them needing one of the greatest of escapes. \nThe biggest deficit overcome by a side to stay up after 30 matches of a Premier League season was West Ham United in 2006-07. \nAt that stage, Alan Curbishley's men were eight points from safety, having been 10 behind a match earlier. Ipswich have a game less and a bigger gap.\nBradford City, in 1999-2000, and Fulham, in 2007-08, came from six points behind to survive with just five matches left, but it seems fanciful for the Tractor Boys to think of achieving that.\nJust seven of their 20 points have been won in Suffolk this season, a huge Achilles heel for a newly promoted side. Just one victory - 2-0 against Chelsea in December - has been celebrated at Portman Road and they have now lost six successive home league games for only the second time in their history, matching a wretched run in 1963 when they went on to be relegated too.\nLeicester have won nine points at home, while bottom club Southampton's sorry season is epitomised by the five points they have earned at St Mary's and they will be relegated if they fail to win at Tottenham on Sunday. \n\"You can look at different games, Liverpool, Fulham, [Aston] Villa we started really well, then came up short in terms of trying to break teams down, like the Crystal Palace game,\" reflected McKenna. \n\"We have had a few high energy games and the other teams have punished us. Today it was a spirited and committed performance but not enough to win. We are talking about small sample sizes. \n\"It's strange not to have more wins at home than away. I don't think there's one outstanding reason. If there was, we would have found it and sorted it.\"\nIn contrast, Wolves have earned 10 points from their seven home games since Vitor Pereira replaced O'Neil in December. \nUnder the Portuguese, Wolves have won more points than the three promoted sides put together - 23 from 15 games, scoring 19 goals and conceding 19.\nThe bottom three have won 16 points from a combined 43 games in that time (Ipswich eight, Southampton five and Leicester three). \nNo side has dropped more points from winning positions in the top flight this season than Ipswich (25) and they have simply not been competitive enough.\nThey have led against Fulham (twice), Manchester City, Aston Villa,(twice), Brentford, Leicester, Bournemouth, Manchester United and now Wolves and failed to win. \nEven Liam Delap's 12 goals have been unable to help them bridge the gap at this level. He has scored 38.71% of Ipswich's 31 this season - only Alexander Isak (41%), Mohamed Salah (39%) and Erling Haaland (36.8%) have higher figures in this campaign.\n\"There will be plenty of time to talk about it, analyse it and reflect on the positives and negatives,\" added McKenna. \n\"We knew coming into this nine-game block the balance of probabilities was really small, but we committed as a group to show the right values and show full commitment. \n\"We have Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Arsenal here after that, Newcastle at St James' Park and Everton in one of the last games at Goodison. \n\"We have some fantastic fixtures coming up for a club who haven't been into the Premier League for 22 years. \n\"I know today is a big setback and it hurts, but I know the players and supporters and everyone are going to muster up the energy to compete as well as we can in the last few games.\" \nThis video can not be played\nIpswich \u2018sad\u2019 as relegation looms \u2013 McKenna",

        "article_text": "Liverpool's loss at Fulham was their first away league defeat under Arne Slot\nLiverpool's unbeaten run has come to an end but - barring a remarkable collapse - they will end the season as Premier League champions.\nDefeat at Fulham was the Reds' first in 26 league games and just their second of the campaign.\nBut with seven games remaining, Arne Slot's side require a maximum of 11 points more to secure the title.\n\"If you look at the goals we conceded, I think all three, we could have prevented them,\" Slot told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"That is not what we usually see and that is probably why we are where we are, because if you make these mistakes more often in this league, you would not have the amount of points we have.\n\"The second half is much more like the team we are. Conceding three goals in the manner we did is not of the standards of Liverpool. That's clear.\"\nDespite the setback at Craven Cottage,  a record-equalling 20th top-flight crown is surely a formality now?\nThey could even win the title as early as 20 April - if results elsewhere go their way - with no team in Premier League history throwing away a lead of this size at this stage of the season.\nThe Reds' dominance has been clear for all to see this campaign, and they lead second-placed Arsenal by 11 points.\nSlot is certainly expecting his side to bounce back and get the job done.\n\"We played a good game on Wednesday [against Everton] and we will show up against West Ham [on Sunday] as well,\" he told Sky Sports.\nLiverpool's 26-match unbeaten run ended by Fulham\nPremier League Review with Darren Fletcher\nThis video can not be played\n'Mo will show up' - Slot not worried by Salah's form\nWe've all heard the accusations and whispers this season from rival fans, haven't we?\n'This Liverpool team isn't actually that great.' 'The Premier League is a poor league this season.' 'Liverpool's class of 2024-25 wouldn't have won the title in another season.'\nSunday's loss will only add to those shouts. How fair is this, though?\nFirstly, it has to be said Liverpool's usual rivals are not having their best seasons.\nDefending champions Manchester City are on track for their worst campaign under Pep Guardiola, Manchester United are set for their worst season in Premier League history, Arsenal are nine points adrift of their points tally at this stage of last season, while Tottenham and Chelsea have suffered their own struggles as well.\n\"The other teams just haven't stepped up this season and Liverpool have been consistent all the way through,\" former Manchester United captain Gary Neville told Sky Sports prior to the Fulham match.\n\"The rest of them have fallen well below their standards - Arsenal, obviously Manchester City, United, Tottenham.\"\nIt's been a good season for Liverpool to hit full stride then. And Slot's men have certainly done that.\nEven if Arsenal were on the 71 points they had reached at this stage last season, when they were top of the table, Liverpool would still be two points ahead of them.\n\"I don't even think Liverpool have been outstanding this season, they've been efficient,\" ex-Manchester City defender Micah Richards told Sky Sports.\n\"They've been slower in build-up and more ruthless in front of goal.\"\nArsenal's much-lauded invincibles finished their title-winning campaign on 90 points back in 2004. Slot's men need 18 points from seven games to beat that.\nIn 32 Premier League seasons, only 14 sides have reached that mark and one of them - Manchester United in 1993-94 - did so in a 42-game season.\nLiverpool are also the only side to get 90-plus points and not win the title - doing so twice under Jurgen Klopp - meaning only 12 of the previous 31 league-winning sides posted in 90 points or more.\nMeanwhile, the average number of points for the team in second after their 31st game of a season is 65.4 - slightly higher than Arsenal's current 62 points - but there have been second-placed teams on much lower tallies at this stage, including Arsenal's 57 points in 2000-01.\n\"Liverpool want to reinstate the aura that they've had all season and finish strong,\" former Manchester City midfielder Izzy Christiansen told Sky Sports.\n\"However they end up winning it is almost up to them.

        "summary": "Slot's men need 18 points from seven games to beat that.In 32 Premier League seasons, only 14 sides have reached that mark and one of them - Manchester United in 1993-94 - did so in a 42-game season.Liverpool are also the only side to get 90-plus points and not win the title - doing so twice under Jurgen Klopp - meaning only 12 of the previous 31 league-winning sides posted in 90 points or more.Meanwhile, the average number of points for the team in second after their 31st game of a season is 65.4 - slightly higher than Arsenal's current 62 points - but there have been second-placed teams on much lower tallies at this stage, including Arsenal's 57 points in 2000-01. How fair is this, though?Firstly, it has to be said Liverpool's usual rivals are not having their best seasons.Defending champions Manchester City are on track for their worst campaign under Pep Guardiola, Manchester United are set for their worst season in Premier League history, Arsenal are nine points adrift of their points tally at this stage of last season, while Tottenham and Chelsea have suffered their own struggles as well. Liverpool title push hits a bump - but when can they win it?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Liverpool's loss at Fulham was their first away league defeat under Arne SlotSam DruryBBC Sport journalistPublished7 hours ago538 CommentsLiverpool's unbeaten run has come to an end but - barring a remarkable collapse - they will end the season as Premier League champions.Defeat at Fulham was the Reds' first in 26 league games and just their second of the campaign.But with seven games remaining, Arne Slot's side require a maximum of 11 points more to secure the title. And Slot's men have certainly done that.Even if Arsenal were on the 71 points they had reached at this stage last season, when they were top of the table, Liverpool would still be two points ahead of them. \"Despite the setback at Craven Cottage,  a record-equalling 20th top-flight crown is surely a formality now?They could even win the title as early as 20 April - if results elsewhere go their way - with no team in Premier League history throwing away a lead of this size at this stage of the season.The Reds' dominance has been clear for all to see this campaign, and they lead second-placed Arsenal by 11 points.Slot is certainly expecting his side to bounce back and get the job done.",

It was enormously important to speak to as many people as possible and to do the research. Every last detail.\"\nThe family says the loss of Jean still echoes in their hearts. His cousin Vivian Figueiredo, who breaks down in tears during the interview, says Jean's mother will never give up.\n\"It's just the obligation that she feels to fight for justice for him. She's 80, she just left this small town in Brazil, the other side of the world, to come here just to fight for him.\"\n\"The police should really be careful, not just suspect and kill because a life is priceless.\"\nTowards the end of the interview, Vivian looks at her aunt and tells her she's brave.

Hotter weather drove the fossil generation increase in 2024, but we're very unlikely to see a similar jump in 2025.\"\nIn a separate report, the European Copernicus climate service said March 2025 was the second hottest on record, extending a spell of record or near record breaking temperatures.\nEmber is a global energy think tank which has been predicting for several years that emissions of the climate warming gas carbon dioxide were about to start falling. \nBut this hasn't happened yet due to increasing global demand for electricity. \nCheap and relatively easy to install, for the twentieth year in a row solar is the fastest growing electricity source. According to Ember, the amount generated by solar panels has doubled every three years since 2012.\nChina continues to dominate the growth of solar with more than half of the increase taking place there. India's solar capacity doubled between 2023 and 2024.\nThough it is growing fast, solar remains a relatively small part of the global energy mix contributing just under 7% of global supply \u2013 that's the same as powering the entire country of India. \nWind contributes just over 8%, with hydropower contributing 14% making it the largest source of clean energy. Both hydro-electric and nuclear power (9%) are growing much more slowly than wind and solar.\nThe report says that clean energy sources contributed more than 40% of global electricity generation for the first time since the 1940s. Back then demand was much lower, and hydroelectric power stations contributed a significant share.\nThe big picture is that the rise in the global demand for electricity continues to outpace the growth in renewable energy. \nThat means that though the percentage generated by clean power has risen to 40.9% the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted has yet to start falling.\nAccording to the Ember report global demand for electricity rose by 4% in 2024. \nThis was partly due to an increased use of air conditioning in what was a particularly hot year. That meant that fossil fuel generation, mostly coal (34%) and gas (22%), increased by 1.4% and global emissions of the climate warming gas CO2 rose to an all time high of 14.6bn tonnes.\nIn the last five years, fast-growing Asian economies, in particular India and China, have continued expanding their use of fossil fuels to meet rapidly rising demand for electricity.

Here are his top tips for visiting Phuket, Koh Samui and Bangkok.\nSince its tourism boom in the mid-20th Century, Thailand has become synonymous with paradisical landscapes and top-notch hospitality. In recent years, however, the Southeast Asian country has risen beyond its reputation as a spiritual and adventure haven, partially due to acclaimed film productions and influential names drawing attention to its unique culture.\nToday, the country's cultural influence has reached nearly every industry, from fashion to sports to entertainment. For a prime example, look no further than the highly anticipated third instalment of HBO's series The White Lotus, which premiered 16 February 2025. Following successful stopovers in Hawaii and Italy, season three features Thailand as its latest lush backdrop for intrigue and social satire. The islands of Koh Samui and Phuket are the main filming locations (with a smattering of scenes shot in Bangkok), while an ensemble of Thai actors including Blackpink's Lisa Manobal, Patravadi Mejudhon, Tayme Thapthimthong and actor, model and businessman Dom Hetrakul join the star-studded cast.\nThe SpeciaList\n(Credit: Wardrobe Ministry)\nBangkok-born Dom Hetrakul has built a portfolio as an actor, model and TV presenter while juggling his job as a motorcycle trading businessman. He has starred in several local and international productions, including Bangkok Dangerous (2008), Twilight Over Burma (2015) and The Family (2023). Hetrakul's most recent screen venture is HBO's The White Lotus season three, where he plays a Thai hotel spa attendant.\n\"The series is a very deep and dark comedy so it's going to be fun when it comes to Thailand, which has a different background compared to Hawaii and Sicily,\" says Hetrakul, who plays Pornchai, the beatific hotel spa therapist at the Thai branch of the fictional White Lotus resort. \"We have strong values and beliefs influenced by our religious background, but we're still dynamic in a way. That might be something very distinctive when you get close to the Thai community [and why] everyone is looking at Thailand as one of the most famous destinations for tourism.\"\nHetrakul, who was born in Bangkok and calls the city home, balances his career in entertainment with a job in the motorcycle trading business. But his packed schedule has never stopped him from travelling and finding inspiration in his home country: \"Apart from acting, sports and motorcycles take me everywhere. To find inspiration you need to get out of your comfort zone, that [means] more places and people to meet.\"\u00a0\nHere are Hetrakul's favourite places in Bangkok, Phuket and Koh Samui. \u00a0\nHome to the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui where much of the season's hotel scenes were filmed, Koh Samui is perhaps the ultimate White Lotus set-jetting destination. Indeed, a good deal of the season's drama and privileged behaviour unfolds on the palm-laden island, located in the Gulf of Thailand.\nMost visitors arrive in Koh Samui via the Samui International Airport, but ferries and other means of transportation are available from Surat Thani Province. \"You can take a cruise about 45 minutes from the mainland,\" Hetrakul says.\nWhile its rugged coastline, majestic mountain ranges and long, sandy beaches make it a travel-worthy getaway, the island's wellness offerings have stimulated tourism in recent years; something keenly noted in season three, with the surprise return of fan-favourite spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) from The White Lotus season one, whose story arc involves learning Thai wellness techniques from Hetrakul's Pornchai so she can improve her practice in Maui.\nKoh Samui's luxurious spas, remote resorts and holistic health centres provide wellness and spiritual therapies and retreats for meditation, Ayurvedic treatments and massages, but Hetrakul suggests immersing yourself in yoga. \"In Koh Samui, they have a lot of different training experiences like Thai boxing and yoga,\" he says. \"But [I'd recommend] yoga by the beach every morning with yogis from around the world... That's a very healthy community.\"\u00a0\nAddress: Ko Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nThai people's love for food runs deep so no trip to Thailand is complete without indulging in the country's culinary delicacies. \"Over here, we eat all day, all night \u2013 daytime, office hours \u2013 we just order food and eat all the time,\" Hetrakul says. \"Restaurants have to open all day.\"\nTip:\nIf you wish to experience one of Thailand's more emblematic celebrations, consider visiting during Songkran (Thai New Year). The festivities run between 13-15 April 2025 and celebrate the end of summer, welcoming the rainy season with water-pouring traditions. \"The Songkran Festival is chaotic in the best sense, to be honest,\" says Hetrakul. \"It's not really the traditional, soft [kind of experience]; it's [high power] stuff.\"\nWhile you'll have to watch the upcoming episodes to see the exact dishes and restaurants featured in The White Lotus season three, Koh Samui is packed with delicious food options from Western-style restaurants (Hetrakul likes\u00a0Summer by Coco Tam, The Shack and Gusto Italiano) to local eateries like Hetrakul's favourite island haunt, Jun Hom. The unassuming beachside spot is recognised for its seafood and homemade traditional dishes like pineapple fried rice, silver sillago fish and yum tua pu(wing bean salad). \"Everything is from the local fisherman's market,\" Hetrakul says, citing the Fisherman's Village Night Market, another go-to spot for foodies in Koh Samui \u2013 and rumoured to be the setting for some of season three's Songkran Festival shenanigans. \"Those aromatic herbs, spicy chillies and coconut milk on all sorts of fish, crabs, and prawns \u2013 you name it \u2013 Jun Hom makes [it].\"\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/JunhomKohSamui\nAddress: 7/3 Mu 5, Mae Nam, Ko Samui, 84330\nPhone: +66 77 602 008\nWhether at exclusive high-voltage clubs or vibrant festivals by the ocean, Thailand's much-revered party scene lives up to the hype. Previews of season three offer glimpses at the White Lotus' take on Thai nightlife; neon lights, fireworks and dance performances spice up the intricate plot entanglements in the trailer.\nTip:\nNightlife is at the core of the Thai travelling experience. \"You'll see the nightlife in the White Lotus season three,\" says Hetrakul. \"For some [previous portrayals onscreen] you might have seen The Hangover II or The Beach \u2013 that's how crazy we go. It depends on how you [pick] the places. You have premium clubs at hotels, but also very affordable places.\" If you're in Bangkok, he recommends checking out the options [on] Sukhumvit Road, one of the world's longest roads, which runs from Thailand to Cambodia.\nHetrakul's top Thai party hotspot is Ko Pha Ngan island, about 38km from Koh Samui \u2013 eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted Phangan Mantra Inn located near Ko Pha Ngan's Haad Rin Beach in the trailer's party scenes. \"[Koh Pha Ngan] is famous for the Full Moon Party,\" says Hetrakul, referring to the monthly festival-style beach parties that take over Haad Rin Beach every full Moon night or the day after. Locals and visitors celebrate by gathering around stages lined up across the shore for performances of various musical genres.\nFor those wary of big crowds \u2013 the parties attract thousands of attendants \u2013 Hetrakul has an insider tip. \"Now, people are trying to host more parties, they call them the Half Moon Parties,\" he says. \"Full Moon is more exposed to the public, so you expect the crowds, but Half Moon [celebrations] are less packed.\"\nAddress: Koh Phangan District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nAbout 30km north-west of Koh Samui lies the Mu Ko Ang Thong National Marine Park, an enclave of 42 islands surrounded by turquoise sea. The archipelago's clear-water shores welcome The White Lotus guests, serving as a fitting introduction to Thailand's stunning seascapes.\nThough camping areas and bungalows are available on Ko Wua Talap, the park's largest island,\u00a0 Hetrakul recommends planning a day trip to the archipelago to explore luscious tropical forests, azure beaches and rugged landscapes apt for any type of visitor, from those seeking a calm, stress-free retreat to adventure enthusiasts. \"There are white-sand beaches and mountain ranges on the island itself, so you can enjoy a beach tour or hiking, depending on which of those small islands you prefer,\" says Hetrakul. \"[Ang Thong National Park is also] great for snorkelling, diving, kayaking, canoeing or camping.\" For wildlife lovers, if you're lucky enough, you may even come across cadres of cute-looking spectacled leaf monkeys.\u00a0\nAddress: Koh Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nConnected to the mainland via the 600m-long Sarasin Bridge, Phuket is Thailand's largest island. It's also home to various locations featured in The White Lotus season three, from the opulent Michelin Guide-recommended Ta Khai restaurant, where characters are seen dining (and whining), to the Anantara Mai Khao Phuket resort, whose lavish spa serves as a backdrop for the interactions between Hetrakul's Pornchai and Rothwell's Belinda.\u00a0\n\"Phuket's [highlights] are the nightlife and the beach \u2013 Patong beach, the bars and clubs,\" Hetrakul says. However, those who venture beyond will be rewarded with splendid natural views and zealously protected greenery.\n\"About an hour's drive from Old Phuket Town, in the north of the island, there is a well-preserved mangrove forest called Baan Tha Chatchai,\" the actor says. Here, community-based ecotourism is king; away from crowds, visitors can engage in activities such as kayaking and canoeing along shallow and still waterways. \"Deep in the jungle it's very calm, so you don't have to worry too much. [For example,] in the western part of Thailand, the waves are stronger, [but this is] a different current.\"\nLocal dishes such as mee hokkien (chewy egg noodles) or Phuket lobster top off an excursion to the area. \"They have a lot of restaurants around, some deep in the forest. It's very very traditional \u2013 truly local \u2013 food,\" Hetrakul emphasises. \"They have seafood, fresh vegetables and fruit. But to be warned, the food is mostly spicy.\"\nAddress: Within Phuket Marine National Park Operation Centre 2, 92/7 Moo 5 Mai Khao, Thalang, Phuket 83110\nThailand's cultural appeal doesn't stop at its beloved spicy food and notoriously wild festivals. For decades, sports, especially Muay Thai, have driven the country's soft power strategy; in early February, the Thai government launched a year-long campaign titled Grand Tourism and Sports Year 2025, aimed at leveraging the sports calendar to boost tourism. The national passion for Muay Thai is reflected in The White Lotus season three, as various characters chat about the fights and take in a match at Phuket's Bangla Boxing Stadium Paton.\u00a0\nAs a sports enthusiast \u2013 he practices Muay Thai \u2013 Hetrakul encourages visitors to soak up Thailand's sports tradition and learn about its origins. \"We do lots of [sports but] Muay Thai, previously called Thai boxing, has become mainstream,\" he says. \"If you're a fan of UFC (mixed martial arts) fights, most elite athletes are here for training. If they're talking about the striking, Muay Thai [has] one of the best striking techniques.\"\nWhile you can witness Thailand's most famous combat sport or book a class nearly anywhere in Thailand \u2013 \"there are a lot of Muay Thai camps around [the country],\" Hetrakul says \u2013 the actor recommends stopping by the Rajadamnern Stadium in his hometown of Bangkok. Located just a few blocks from the Wat Benchamabophit temple, Rajadamnern was Thailand's first venue uniquely dedicated to Muay Thai and was responsible for introducing the sports' official ranking system and rule book. The stadium is also recognised for its architecture and circular ring \u2013 the only one of its kind in the world.\u00a0\nThe venue hosts combat every night, but Hetrakul advises visitors to get tickets for Friday and Saturday when the most anticipated clashes are generally scheduled.\nWebsite: \nhttps://rajadamnern.com/\nAddress: 8 Ratchadamnoen Nok Rd, Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Bangkok 10100\nInstagram: \n@rajadamnern_stadium\nProminently featured in season three's storyline, Thai wellness and healing practices need no introduction. Nuad Thai, or Thai massage, for example, was inscribed in 2019 on Unesco's List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This manual therapy, aimed at realigning a person's body and energy, is one of Thailand's most popular and widespread cultural attractions; Hetrakul's Pornchai even performs Nuad Thai on Rothwell's Belinda when showing her his \"signature treatment.\"\nThe Buddhist temple Wat Pho, credited as the birthplace of Nuad Thai, is Hetrakul's recommendation to experience and learn about Thai massage. The complex, which houses Bangkok's largest reclining Buddha, was the city's first public education centre. Inside, the walls document centuries of knowledge on Thai healing techniques with a series of engraved marble slabs dated to the 19th Century.\u00a0\nAs home to the Watpho Thai Traditional Medicine School, today the temple lures visitors interested in undergoing massage therapy. \"It's a place [to receive] traditional Thai massage,\" says Hetrakul. \"[But] they can [also] certify you with the approval of the Ministry of Health. You just need time to apply if you're interested in traditional Thai massage.\"\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.watpomassage.com/EN/about\nAddress: 392 / 33-34 Soi Pen Phat 1, Grand Palace, Maharat Road Phra Nakhon district, Bangkok 10200\n*This article, originally published on 26 February 2025, provides a companion to fans tuning into the Season 3 finale on 6 April.\u00a0\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

You have premium clubs at hotels, but also very affordable places.\" If you're in Bangkok, he recommends checking out the options [on] Sukhumvit Road, one of the world's longest roads, which runs from Thailand to Cambodia.\nHetrakul's top Thai party hotspot is Ko Pha Ngan island, about 38km from Koh Samui \u2013 eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted Phangan Mantra Inn located near Ko Pha Ngan's Haad Rin Beach in the trailer's party scenes. \"[Koh Pha Ngan] is famous for the Full Moon Party,\" says Hetrakul, referring to the monthly festival-style beach parties that take over Haad Rin Beach every full Moon night or the day after. Locals and visitors celebrate by gathering around stages lined up across the shore for performances of various musical genres.\nFor those wary of big crowds \u2013 the parties attract thousands of attendants \u2013 Hetrakul has an insider tip. \"Now, people are trying to host more parties, they call them the Half Moon Parties,\" he says. \"Full Moon is more exposed to the public, so you expect the crowds, but Half Moon [celebrations] are less packed.\"\nAddress: Koh Phangan District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nAbout 30km north-west of Koh Samui lies the Mu Ko Ang Thong National Marine Park, an enclave of 42 islands surrounded by turquoise sea. The archipelago's clear-water shores welcome The White Lotus guests, serving as a fitting introduction to Thailand's stunning seascapes.\nThough camping areas and bungalows are available on Ko Wua Talap, the park's largest island,\u00a0 Hetrakul recommends planning a day trip to the archipelago to explore luscious tropical forests, azure beaches and rugged landscapes apt for any type of visitor, from those seeking a calm, stress-free retreat to adventure enthusiasts. \"There are white-sand beaches and mountain ranges on the island itself, so you can enjoy a beach tour or hiking, depending on which of those small islands you prefer,\" says Hetrakul. \"[Ang Thong National Park is also] great for snorkelling, diving, kayaking, canoeing or camping.\" For wildlife lovers, if you're lucky enough, you may even come across cadres of cute-looking spectacled leaf monkeys.\u00a0\nAddress: Koh Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nConnected to the mainland via the 600m-long Sarasin Bridge, Phuket is Thailand's largest island. It's also home to various locations featured in The White Lotus season three, from the opulent Michelin Guide-recommended Ta Khai restaurant, where characters are seen dining (and whining), to the Anantara Mai Khao Phuket resort, whose lavish spa serves as a backdrop for the interactions between Hetrakul's Pornchai and Rothwell's Belinda.\u00a0\n\"Phuket's [highlights] are the nightlife and the beach \u2013 Patong beach, the bars and clubs,\" Hetrakul says. However, those who venture beyond will be rewarded with splendid natural views and zealously protected greenery.\n\"About an hour's drive from Old Phuket Town, in the north of the island, there is a well-preserved mangrove forest called Baan Tha Chatchai,\" the actor says. Here, community-based ecotourism is king; away from crowds, visitors can engage in activities such as kayaking and canoeing along shallow and still waterways. \"Deep in the jungle it's very calm, so you don't have to worry too much. [For example,] in the western part of Thailand, the waves are stronger, [but this is] a different current.\"\nLocal dishes such as mee hokkien (chewy egg noodles) or Phuket lobster top off an excursion to the area. \"They have a lot of restaurants around, some deep in the forest. It's very very traditional \u2013 truly local \u2013 food,\" Hetrakul emphasises. \"They have seafood, fresh vegetables and fruit. But to be warned, the food is mostly spicy.\"\nAddress: Within Phuket Marine National Park Operation Centre 2, 92/7 Moo 5 Mai Khao, Thalang, Phuket 83110\nThailand's cultural appeal doesn't stop at its beloved spicy food and notoriously wild festivals. For decades, sports, especially Muay Thai, have driven the country's soft power strategy; in early February, the Thai government launched a year-long campaign titled Grand Tourism and Sports Year 2025, aimed at leveraging the sports calendar to boost tourism. The national passion for Muay Thai is reflected in The White Lotus season three, as various characters chat about the fights and take in a match at Phuket's Bangla Boxing Stadium Paton.\u00a0\nAs a sports enthusiast \u2013 he practices Muay Thai \u2013 Hetrakul encourages visitors to soak up Thailand's sports tradition and learn about its origins. \"We do lots of [sports but] Muay Thai, previously called Thai boxing, has become mainstream,\" he says. \"If you're a fan of UFC (mixed martial arts) fights, most elite athletes are here for training. If they're talking about the striking, Muay Thai [has] one of the best striking techniques.\"\nWhile you can witness Thailand's most famous combat sport or book a class nearly anywhere in Thailand \u2013 \"there are a lot of Muay Thai camps around [the country],\" Hetrakul says \u2013 the actor recommends stopping by the Rajadamnern Stadium in his hometown of Bangkok. Located just a few blocks from the Wat Benchamabophit temple, Rajadamnern was Thailand's first venue uniquely dedicated to Muay Thai and was responsible for introducing the sports' official ranking system and rule book. The stadium is also recognised for its architecture and circular ring \u2013 the only one of its kind in the world.\u00a0\nThe venue hosts combat every night, but Hetrakul advises visitors to get tickets for Friday and Saturday when the most anticipated clashes are generally scheduled.\nWebsite: \nhttps://rajadamnern.com/\nAddress: 8 Ratchadamnoen Nok Rd, Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Bangkok 10100\nInstagram: \n@rajadamnern_stadium\nProminently featured in season three's storyline, Thai wellness and healing practices need no introduction. Nuad Thai, or Thai massage, for example, was inscribed in 2019 on Unesco's List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This manual therapy, aimed at realigning a person's body and energy, is one of Thailand's most popular and widespread cultural attractions; Hetrakul's Pornchai even performs Nuad Thai on Rothwell's Belinda when showing her his \"signature treatment.\"\nThe Buddhist temple Wat Pho, credited as the birthplace of Nuad Thai, is Hetrakul's recommendation to experience and learn about Thai massage. The complex, which houses Bangkok's largest reclining Buddha, was the city's first public education centre. Inside, the walls document centuries of knowledge on Thai healing techniques with a series of engraved marble slabs dated to the 19th Century.\u00a0\nAs home to the Watpho Thai Traditional Medicine School, today the temple lures visitors interested in undergoing massage therapy. \"It's a place [to receive] traditional Thai massage,\" says Hetrakul. \"[But] they can [also] certify you with the approval of the Ministry of Health. You just need time to apply if you're interested in traditional Thai massage.\"\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.watpomassage.com/EN/about\nAddress: 392 / 33-34 Soi Pen Phat 1, Grand Palace, Maharat Road Phra Nakhon district, Bangkok 10200\n*This article, originally published on 26 February 2025, provides a companion to fans tuning into the Season 3 finale on 6 April.\u00a0\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Which hobbies are best for meeting new people? Molly Gorman tested four of them \u2013 and discovered surprising facts about how and why we bond as a species.\nWalking into a busy climbing gym in London on a Friday night, I feel an overwhelming sense of dread. Desperately gazing past the staff at the reception desk, my eyes lock onto the sea of chalk-covered hands and limbs swinging between multi-coloured holds \u2013 all around five metres (16ft) above crash mats.\u00a0\nI am here as part of an experiment for our ongoing BBC series exploring the science \u2013 and art \u2013 of friendship. Cultivating friendships is key to our wellbeing, and to living a long life. As we mature and become more agreeable, it can actually get easier to form and maintain friendships. But where do you start?\nLondon is a city of nearly nine million people, but like anywhere, it can still be lonely. And without opportunities to mingle, it can be hard to try out and develop different friendship skills and strategies.\nFinding a hobby may seem an obvious way to foster social connection \u2013 in fact, research suggests that bonding through hobbies is a uniquely human trait. However, given the huge range of potential clubs, classes and activities, which one is actually best for making friends? And is there scientific evidence that some activities have more social potential than others?\nTo find out, I tested three new activities, and one existing hobby for comparison, and also explored the evidence-backed benefits they might offer. I chose a range of activities, from sports to art, across different budgets. For full transparency, I decided to mention the cost of each activity \u2013 since choosing a hobby can also be a matter of affordability. Here's what I found:\nIn late 2020, I moved to London from the countryside. Seeking to make friends in my local area as well as shape some kind of exercise routine, I decided to join a recreational netball league, which is perfect for those who may be more interested in the social aspect of a team sport, as opposed to the competitiveness.\nI soon found a wonderful team and we have now played together for four years. Every Monday evening, rain or shine, we take to the court, but we also meet up outside of the sport \u2013 whether that's for a drink after a match or dinner on the weekend.\nIf you are not naturally into ball games, this activity may not feel worth trying out \u2013 but research suggests that team sports can have huge benefits for people of all ages and all abilities. Inclusive sports can for example improve the wellbeing of children with disabilities by providing them with the opportunity to \"form friendships, express creativity, develop a self-identity and foster a meaning and purpose in life\".\nAccording to Arran Davis, an expert on social connection and health at the University of Oxford, in the UK, collaborative activities like team sports can not only make exercise feel easier, but can help us build social relationships. \u00a0\n\"There's a couple of ways that could happen: the first is just doing stuff together. So what psychologists call 'sharing intention',\" he says. This term refers to the phenomenon of connecting over or talking about a common goal or action. As Davis puts it, it's the sense of: \"'I think about what you're thinking about, you think about what I'm thinking about'.\"\nShared intention \"makes us feel a bit closer to one another and that can lead us to view one another as good cooperative partners or people that we feel more similar to\", he says. \"And these are the things that build friendships\u2026 through coordinating or collaborating, we're able to signal to each other that we're friends,\" he explains.\nDavis goes on to explain how endorphins and other natural chemicals released in the body when we do aerobic exercise, for example the feeling of \"runner's high\", can be enhanced when we're working in a team. \"Interestingly, these chemicals are also involved in primate bonding. When primates groom each other, they release endorphins, or when we laugh together, we release endorphins,\" he says. \"So this gives us a positive feeling that we then start to associate with the people around us. It can be a way to build connection through sharing a positive psychological state.\"\nA 2023 study compared social bonding between humans, and between other primates. It concluded that there may be something unique about the way we as humans bond through shared experiences, whether it's taking a walk together, dancing together, making music together, playing team sports or even just having a conversation. While positive social bonds are generally important for all primates, our special ability as humans to connect through shared, interactive experiences may help us learn more about each other, and ultimately coordinate and maintain larger social networks than other primates, according to the study.\nFor adults, team sport participation typically\u00a0declines\u00a0in older age, but research suggests it's never too late.\u00a0One study\u00a0examined the reasons why a group of adults over the age of 55 engage in team sports and found that community and togetherness were an important motivation, as well as the potential health benefits.\nFrom my experience, team sports are fantastic for making friends because not only do you see the same people on a weekly basis, but playing a sport together provides a topic of conversation to discuss and bond over. I have made lifelong friends through netball, and it always brings a burst of joy to my week (even when we lose).\nStill, I was curious about whether adding other activities could help me widen my social circle further \u2013 and reveal insights into our relationship with ourselves, as well as with others. That's how I ended up in the chalk-dusted bouldering gym...\nBouldering is a type of climbing where the route is\u00a0\"short but tricky\"\u00a0and is performed without a harness or ropes. Studies on bouldering and mental health suggest that the sport may have a positive effect on\u00a0symptoms of depression, more so than\u00a0home-based exercise, for example.\u00a0In one study, 133 patients with depression were assigned bouldering psychotherapy for ten weeks \u2013\u00a0the results showed that bouldering alleviated their symptoms. (Of course, depression is a complex condition, and if you are worried about your mental health, you should consult your healthcare provider for advice and support.)\nAs with team sports, the benefits of climbing and bouldering extend across different ages and abilities. Researchers surveying US Veterans and non-Veterans with disabilities found a range of potential therapeutic benefits to adaptive rock and rope climbing, for example, including\u00a0community connection, confidence-building, and muscle strengthening.\nI certainly found that bouldering had a positive effect on my mind. When I was climbing, my sole focus was concentrated on my next move: where my feet needed to go, how to swing my hips to reach the next hold and ensuring I kept a steady grip. Essentially, it felt like problem-solving combined with a physical challenge.\nWhen I was taking a rest and observing groups of climbers in the middle of the mats, both chatting and looking out for fellow climbers on the wall, it also became clear that bouldering is a very social sport \u2013 they were offering support, encouragement and guidance to each other. Climbing gyms host a range of routes at varying difficulty levels, marked by colour, meaning that people with different fitness levels can boulder together.\nI had booked a beginner's bouldering class, where five of us quickly became united in a camaraderie as an instructor guided us through technique, climbing etiquette and safety. After an hour of learning and testing out the routes to see what we could manage with support from our instructor, we were left to our own devices. Our group largely stuck together but it was easy to chat to other climbers.\nThe next day, I woke to achy forearms \u2013 but it was a satisfying pain, as was the satisfying feeling of trying something brand new.\nUnfortunately, the price tag attached to climbing and bouldering is on the higher side \u2013 and some may not be comfortable with the level of risk and potential for injury. That's why I also tested two gentler and cheaper activities: a book club with a creative writing class, and a life-drawing class (which, while physically safe, felt daunting in a different way \u2013 more on this later).\nFriendship series\nAmid the loneliness epidemic blighting many parts of the world following the pandemic, the BBC looks at how friendships can enrich our lives \u2013 and the science-backed ways to boost our social connections:\n\u2022 Why we become better friends as we age \n\u2022 What we can learn from friendship break-ups \n\u2022 How not to be a 'toxic' friend\nWhen you're looking for social connection, does it help to choose an activity that is openly designed to encourage bonding? I tested this out by taking part in a creative writing session in East London. Facilitated by the London Girls Book Club who host a range of events alongside their monthly book club meeting, the session was designed to help people meet other writers, get inspired and have an opportunity to focus on a piece of creative writing.\n\"I've seen so many of the women create best friends through our club,\" says Caitlin Curry, who founded the London Girls Book Club four years ago after she moved to London from north-east England. In her experience, the shared foundation of loving books has enabled women to form strong friendships. \"At the start you might be seeing new faces, or you might see someone every so often, but the more that you come, you start to see similar faces and build those connections,\" she says.\nPsychologists have a name for this kind of bonding by engaging in, and talking about, a shared activity: \"triadic interactions\". In triadic interactions, we pay attention both to each other, and to an object or activity of mutual interest (on the other hand, a dyadic interaction is one where we only focus on each other). Both dyadic and triadic interactions are key to our early development \u2013 and continue to have bonding benefits for adults, research suggests.\nMost of the women attending the session had shown up alone, and everyone was approachable and open. After an introduction and opportunity to meet everyone, we had 30 minutes of quiet time, a break to discuss what we were working on and then a further 30 minutes to write. I did find that our shared interest in reading and writing, along with our shared goals as writers, made it easy to bond, despite being total strangers just an hour before.\nThere are psychological benefits to creative writing, too, research suggests. One study by Plymouth University and Nottingham Trent University in the UK found that writing and discussing poetry as a means to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic helped people to cope with feelings of loneliness and isolation, as well as help to reduce feelings of anxiety and depression. A similar study published in 2021 found that creative writing may encourage personal growth and a sense of inner peace.\nBook clubs can also be an affordable way to socialise, especially if you borrow the book from a library. Reading may even have health benefits, such as cognitive benefits, potentially making it another hobby that provides a social as well as physical boost.\nFor anyone who is nervous about joining a book club, Curry offers the reminder that you always have the book in common if you're feeling shy: \"A lot of the women that come are very open, very friendly and they'll do things like follow up with each other\u2026 I provide friendship tips, we have name labels and we swap [around] so that you get to chat to lots of new people.\"\nHaving a class that was structured meant that people felt braver and more open to chatting with others. It can be hard to muster up the courage to start a conversation, so knowing that everyone would get a chance to speak provided a bit of light relief.\u00a0\n\"I can't think of a better place to be an artist than London,\" says Ann Mackowski, artist and founder of Soho Life Drawing, a drawing group that runs weekly drop-in sessions in the heart of central London. Oh, and there's tea and biscuits.\nBefore I attended one of her relaxed life drawing workshops (also known as figure drawing), I would have told you that I am awful at sketching or drawing. Really awful.\nUnfortunately, I'd say the same thing now. But my skill level didn't matter.\nDrawing, especially when done in a way that makes us focus on the world around us, can improve mood and wellbeing, research suggests. As I quietly focused on sketching, it felt incredibly calming. I left the session feeling relaxed and proud that I was able to even sketch the outline of a body.\nAs with the other activities I tried out, I discovered that life drawing offered a surprising additional benefit beyond the promise of social connection: it can have a positive impact on body image. One study showed how it just took six weeks of classes to notice feelings of body pride and elevation. Another study showed that for women in particular, greater attendance of life drawing classes was associated with higher body appreciation, as well as and a lower drive for thinness and social physique anxiety.\nThe workshop consisted of sketching a naked person in different poses, accompanied by guidance from Mackowski through the first hour. After a break where we chatted amongst us (with aforementioned tea and biscuits), the session resumed with longer poses for the second hour. Mackowski created a friendly, safe and tranquil space for all, regardless of skill level. Some people were gently reintroducing themselves to life-drawing, others trying something brand new, others had been honing their skills for years.\n\"You get people coming in, they make friends, they come back,\" says Mackowski, adding that the connections people form through her classes has been one of the reasons why she's continued running them for many years. \"It becomes like a little family for some people. Then they might go to other classes together and venture out.\"\nIn fact, in a 2021 survey in the UK on the arts and social connectedness, 82% of participants responded that engagement in the arts was linked with feelings of social connection, belonging and collective understanding.\nMackowski adds that having an artistic community can help people both socially and from a technical standpoint: \"People develop their skills a lot quicker if they can see other people's work\u2026 and identify styles. So if you're in a room with 30 people and you can view their work, beginners get a good idea of where to go. And it's known to increase levels of creativity.\" At the end of our session, there was an opportunity to share your finished work with peers or Mackowski for feedback.\nIn terms of my original quest \u2013 to find out which activity would be best for making friends \u2013 all the ones I tried were a success. Each formed a gateway to a community and new friends, while offering other benefits I hadn't even thought about when starting this mission.\nEmbarking on a new hobby is, of course, just a first step \u2013 it may not be an instant solution to the widespread problem of social isolation and loneliness and the search for social connection. Still, my experience alongside the research on how we as a species bond through shared activities, suggests that it's worth trying out a new activity where you might meet people with similar interests to you. In fact, at the start of this year, 19% of Americans made a New Year's resolution related to a hobby or a skill, according to a poll by the American Psychiatric Association.\nIf you're not sure how to break the ice, here's an opening line I used several times when talking to my fellow boulderers, writers and aspiring artists: \"Have you ever done this before?\" Admittedly, it may not be the world's greatest or most eloquent \u2013 but it did the job of getting us chatting. And for me at least, that awkward small talk quickly led to genuinely enjoyable conversations \u2013 and shared moments of connection.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Some just stand there looking calm, some move around wildly and others spend a good chunk of time shadowing the fourth official.\nEvery manager does it differently - so we wanted to find out exactly how differently.\nOver the past three days, we sent a BBC Sport journalist to all 10 Premier League games to closely watch what every manager did as the action unfolded. \nThey spent the matches recording data on where each boss stood, while also surveying how they interacted with those around them. We know that there are many variables that can determine how a manager reacts so measuring across a single weekend is certainly not definitive, but we were curious to see what unfolded.\nThe data enabled us to produce a heatmap for every manager, which you can find below along with observations from each journalist.\nSome heatmaps will show a number that is either just above or just below 100%. That is because we rounded our percentages up or down to improve readability within the graphic.\nWe watched every Premier League manager - here's what we found out\nHow did we collect the data? Read our methodology\nMike Peter at Goodison Park: The touchlines are tight here, but that wasn't going to stop Mikel Arteta - he still squeezed out of his technical area almost 50% more than opposite number David Moyes.\nAnywhere close to the action was Arteta's domain, with his coaches, particularly set-piece lead Nicolas Jover, having to venture out to join him twice as much as Everton's backroom staff had to find Moyes. Jover, just as much an animated presence as his manager, immediately took up position in the very corner of the technical area for any set-piece.\nMoyes ventured around his area more freely, often stepping back in his box to discuss matters with his staff, and even taking a seat on the bench - something Arteta never did.\nNor was the dugout the only place the veteran Scot sat down - he was perched on a drinks cooler in the corner of his area when Everton scored their equalising penalty.\nMatch report\nGeorge Booth at Selhurst Park: Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner was an animated figure throughout - constantly moving in the technical area and never sitting down for long periods.\nHe did generally respect the white line, only leaving his technical area once in the first half, while in the final 10 minutes of the contest he was frequently interacting with the crowd in a bid to help his team over the line.\nFabian Hurzeler spent the majority of the first half outside his technical area, virtually inches away from the pitch, but was seated for most of the second half - despite the three red cards coming during this period.\nWhen his side faced a defensive set-piece, assistant manager Jonas Scheuermann took control of the technical area, with Brighton's players often looking back to follow instructions.\nThe Brighton manager, with the help of his coaching staff, also interacted with fourth official Sam Allison throughout the game.\nMatch report\nMichael Emons at Portman Road: Ipswich's Kieran McKenna paced along the edge of the technical area, encouraging and clapping his side - calm and steady instead of panicking and nervous.\nHe was a near-permanent presence there, but when something happened - goals at either end, corners, good challenges, shots - he would watch the clip with the analysts for 10-20 seconds before returning to his position.\nA raised fist followed Liam Delap's goal, but McKenna - 40 seconds late for the start of the second half - was dejected after Wolves' late winner.\nWolves manager Vitor Pereira - watching from media seats - and assistant Luis Miguel were suspended, so first-team coach Andre Monteiro took charge.\nAfter Ipswich scored, Monteiro was a chalk-on-the-trainers boss, almost on the pitch, a few paces out of the area. On a few occasions the fourth official had to politely tell Monteiro to get back.\nMonteiro was constantly in touch with Pereira, looking in his direction, making hand signals while talking via an earpiece.\nWhen Wolves equalised, Monteiro was about to bring on striker Hwang Hee-chan, but after some hand waving in Pereira's direction, the decision was changed. Wolves' winner left Pereira hugging his coaching staff, with Premier League safety practically secured.\nMatch report\nEmma Smith at London Stadium: West Ham manager Graham Potter was continuously standing on the edge of his technical area, arms folded and observing the game for the most part, while two members of his staff - assistant manager Bruno and first-team coach Narcis Pelach - were up and down from the bench.\nIt was the coaches who interacted with the fourth official rather than the manager, and calling subs over from their warm-up. Pelach was usually alongside Potter when West Ham had an attacking free-kick.\nPotter and Bruno were often in conversation after key moments and before any tactical changes.\nBournemouth boss Andoni Iraola was much more excitable - almost on the pitch as he issued instructions to his players.\nThis was particularly prevalent early on, though in the second half he spent more time on the bench conversing with staff as the flow of the game changed. He would also take a much more direct role in interacting with his players - both on the pitch and with the subs - than Potter.\nMatch report\nAndrew Bassett at Villa Park: Unai Emery and Nuno Espirito Santo spent the majority of the match in front, rather than within, their technical areas.\nEmery energetically directed his team, frequently moving up and down the sideline, while Nuno stood unmoved with arms folded.\nTheir communication styles with their teams were different too. Emery directed his team, often gesticulating to up the tempo. One moment stood out - when he crouched down to excitably stress a point to substitute Boubacar Kamara as he was coming on.\nFor Forest, Nuno's assistant Rui Silva was more likely to interact with players during the match - shouting instructions and briefing oncoming substitutes. It was notable that Villa coach Austin MacPhee would jump up from the bench to coach most set-pieces, including some attacking throw-ins.\nMatch report\nAdam Millington at Gtech Community Stadium: Coaching on a matchday is a team affair for Thomas Frank. He has no qualms with stepping back to analyse the game and allowing the rest of his backroom team to deputise.\nFrank constantly shifted back to the bench with his notepad in hand to speak to colleagues before stepping back to convey information to the players on the pitch.\nHe seemed to prefer the slightly higher vantage point from the bench. It also gave him the ability to intently watch replays of what was happening on the pitch, assess the game in real time and make any needed adjustments.\nEnzo Maresca, however, was the polar opposite. He rarely retreated to the bench, instead spending the game pacing up and down - and often outside of - his dugout.\nMaresca was regularly animated, shouting instructions towards his players and running backwards and forwards. Frank, meanwhile, was quiet and pensive in his technical area.\nMatch report\nEmma Smith at Craven Cottage: Both managers generally stood alone at the edge of their technical areas, and were the ones to issue instructions to their players.\nMarco Silva was not shy of expressing his views to the officials - he flew into a rage at Fulham not being awarded an early penalty, while referee Chris Kavanagh had to come over for a word after Silva felt Rodrigo Muniz was fouled. \nSilva would occasionally sit down and speak to coaches, but he was usually found pacing the length of his technical area shouting instructions to players.\nArne Slot also stood throughout most of the game, although as more of a watching brief; he would turn to coaches to express thoughts after key moments.\nHis longest period sitting down came after Liverpool went 3-1 behind, when he looked furious and exasperated. After all five goals, Slot spoke to various players in his team - such as Curtis Jones, Cody Gakpo and Diogo Jota - to issue instructions.\nMatch report\nMichael Emons at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium: Two very contrasting styles. Tottenham's Ange Postecoglou was calm throughout - he would pick a spot on the edge of his box and stay there for a few minutes. There was hardly any shouting, just the occasional gesture of frustration when a pass was misplaced.\nThe most animated he became, maybe predictably, was when VAR got involved for a decision to wipe out a second Spurs goal that took four minutes to conclude. That was the only time he moved for any length of time, as his frustration grew.\nAt one stage in the delay he appeared to play a rock, paper, scissors game - highlighting the unpredictable, random nature of VAR decisions.\nSouthampton's Ivan Juric could not stop moving, constantly pacing up and down the line. There were only 47 seconds on the clock when he was told by fourth official Sam Barrott to get back in the area.\nJuric treated the technical area as optional, spending more time out of it than in, often crouching down, repeatedly shouting instructions but all to no avail as the Saints were relegated to the Championship. Juric left the club the following day.\nMatch report\nJoe Bradshaw at Old Trafford: United boss Ruben Amorim bounced between standing on the balls of his feet like a coiled spring and relentlessly pacing his technical area, constantly barking out instructions and only pausing to drink from his bottle or usher coach Carlos Fernandes forward for both attacking and defensive set-pieces. \nThose were the only times he disappeared from the touchline, directing his players through almost every other element of the performance.\nWhile less frenetic on his feet, counterpart Pep Guardiola was equally active - arms thrown wide, head bowed in frustration or whirling his hands to demand more from his players.\nWhen United attacked, Guardiola regularly dropped to his haunches. Occasionally he would return to the dugout to swap thoughts with assistant Juan Manuel Lillo, but barely lasted a minute before coming to the side of the pitch again\nThere was one nice moment when Guardiola showed a delicate touch to control a ball out of play, and Amorim touched his hand as a sign of commendation. From one cultured footballer to another, their mutual respect was also obvious in their embrace at the end.\nMatch report\nMichael Emons at King Power Stadium: Eddie Howe was the main figure of course, but Newcastle assistant Jason Tindall also played a part. Whenever Howe was talking to his players at a set piece or to the substitutes waiting to come on, Tindall would move into position so there was almost always one of them at the front of the area.\nHowe was also in constant talks with Tindall at the back of the technical area or writing notes down in his notebook. When the second goal went in, Howe immediately called over Joelinton for a tactical chat, and he did similar with a number of other players when the third went in, despite the big lead.\nRuud van Nistelrooy had his head in his hands after the visitors scored after a couple of minutes and was noticeably getting more and more frustrated at his side's inability to keep the ball as sloppy mistakes became more frequent.\nHe spent most of the opening half hour on the edge of the technical area, but after Newcastle's third goal, he watched the rest of the half from his seat. He did return to the edge of the technical area for most of the second half though, with most of the home fans leaving well before the end.\nMatch report\nAll graphics and imagery for this project were designed by Lee Martin.",

Shares in Paris and Berlin also dropped.\nTrading on America's main stock market indexes had been skittish - shares initially fell by more than 4% before briefly turning positive on a rumour that the US president was considering a pause on introducing import taxes.   \nThe White House declared this \"fake news\" and the S&P 500, the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones resumed their downward journey although the declines were not as steep. \nLast Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs on the US's trading partners.  \nIn the aftermath, stock markets in the US and in the UK experienced their worst one-day falls since the beginning of the Covid pandemic in 2020. More than $5 trillion (\u00a33.9tn) was erased from the S&P 500.\nIn early trading on Monday, the S&P 500's decline briefly extended to more than 20% since a peak in February, putting it into bear market territory.  \nEconomists speculated that many countries would attempt to negotiate deals with the US on the tariffs.\nBut Trump doubled down, telling reporters on Sunday night that \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something\". \nIf world leaders are unable to agree terms with Trump, the tariffs may have a destructive effect on economies globally, analysts have warned.\n\"Fundamentally, investors are worried about a big hit to corporate [profits] and a massive slowdown in economic growth,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. \nOn Monday, Goldman Sachs, the US investment banking giant, raised the likelihood of a recession in the US from 35% to 45%.\nLast week, after China retaliated against the US with its own tariffs, JP Morgan forecast there was a 60% chance the world's largest economy will enter a downturn.  \nIn a letter to shareholders on Monday, JP Morgan's chief executive Jamie Dimon, said that the tariffs \"will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession\".\nHe wrote: \"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth.\" \nIn the UK, that could mean a 0.8% fall in economic growth this year, economists at KPMG forecast. \n\"There is a strong incentive to seek a negotiated settlement that diminishes the need for tariffs,\" said Yael Selfin, KPMG's chief economist.\nChina's decision to impose retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the US escalated worries about a trade war between the two nations, continued to weigh on the price of oil which fell more than 4%.\nTrump hit back at China's tariffs on his social media, criticising Beijing for \"not acknowledging my warning for abusing countries not to retaliate\".\n\"They've made enough, for decades, taking advantage of the Good OL' USA!\" he added.\nMeanwhile, copper, an indicator of economic growth because it is widely used in industry, closed more than 7% lower on Friday.\nThe price of gold, which is usually seen as a \"safe\" investment, also dropped slightly.

Last Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs on the US's trading partners. \"There is a strong incentive to seek a negotiated settlement that diminishes the need for tariffs,\" said Yael Selfin, KPMG's chief economist.ChinaChina's decision to impose retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the US escalated worries about a trade war between the two nations, continued to weigh on the price of oil which fell more than 4%.Trump hit back at China's tariffs on his social media, criticising Beijing for \"not acknowledging my warning for abusing countries not to retaliate\". In a letter to shareholders on Monday, JP Morgan's chief executive Jamie Dimon, said that the tariffs \"will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession\".He wrote: \"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth.\"",

        "article_text": "Sam was lying in bed one morning when her tenant in a house she owned in Margate sent her a photo of a piece of graffiti that had appeared on the wall outside.\nAstonishingly, it looked like a Banksy. It would turn out to be perhaps the graffiti artist's most interesting new artwork of recent years,\u202fValentine's Day Mascara (pictured above), which was revealed in Margate on Valentine's Day, 2023.\nBamboozled, Sam googled: what do you do when you wake up with a Banksy on your wall?\n\"What did Google say about that?\" I asked her.\n\"Nothing! And I was like, I need to contact the council, I need to find an art gallery who can advise me.\"\nSam called Julian Usher at Red Eight Gallery. Julian's team, conscious that new Banksys are under immediate threat from street cleaners, the weather, rival graffiti artists and other art dealers, promised he'd be in Margate within the hour: \"We knew we had to get the piece covered,\" say Julian.\nAnd there was another reason Julian got to Margate double-quick: if Banksy chooses your wall for one of his drawings, you could be seriously in the money.\nFor the second season of my BBC Radio 4 podcast The Banksy Story, which is called When Banksy Comes To Town, I've been following the very different fates of two sets of homeowners who wake up one day to find a Banksy on their wall. The season shows just how important his graffiti becomes for a local community \u2013 and why people disagree so vehemently about what should happen after it's discovered.\nSam became the custodian of\u202fValentine's Day Mascara, which speaks to the theme of domestic violence, incidents of which usually spike each Valentine's Day. It's a complicated bit of work. A peppy 50s housewife with a black eye has bludgeoned her partner. A real pan with flecks of red is at her feet, and his painted legs are upended into the real fridge-freezer that Banksy left by the wall. A broken plastic chair testifies to the fight they have had.\nLater on the day it appeared, refuse collectors arrived to spirit away the fridge-freezer. This precipitated a free-for-all, with the public helping themselves to the remnants. It was mayhem. \nA media scrum, a wrong-footed local council, millions of global onlookers. Exactly, one suspects, what Banksy wanted. \nAnd this time, just for laughs, he left behind oil painter Peter Brown, commissioned to capture the scenes he would miss. I spoke to Pete \"The Street\" Brown for my series. \"The whole reason I was employed was because Banksy was questioning what was the art about,\" Pete explained. \"Is it about the graffiti? Or is it about the reaction afterwards, and what happens to it?\"\nAs luck would have it, Pete was captured on video just as Banksy's team were putting the finishing touches to Valentine's Day Mascara \u2013 a video that The Banksy Story managed to obtain. In it we can see that one of Banksy's team let a local kid play with their drone. \n\"They're in the process of putting a large piece on a wall and yet they're taking the time to teach a kid how to fly a drone,\" says Steph Warren, who used to work with Banksy and who appeared in my first series - about the artist's rise and rise. \"Very sweet!\"\nAlongside Sam, I've been following the story of Gert and Gary. They, like Sam, did not want me to use their last name. A 30ft-high seagull appeared one morning on the wall of their buy-to-let in Lowestoft in Suffolk. The bird needed to be massive for Banksy's ambitious visual gag to work. The artist had shoved large yellow insulation strips into a skip that now looked like a fast-food container that the seagull divebombed to steal chips.\nBanksy had chosen his wall well. Visitors arriving by train were treated to this witty meditation on the scourge of Britain's seaside towns, equal parts warning and celebration. The\u202fLowestoft Seagull\u202fwas part of Banksy's\u202fGreat British Staycation, his post-Covid lockdown campaign to cheer us all up at the prospect of a summer holiday spent in the UK.\nBut Gert was not cheered-up at all. \"It's not a seagull, it's an albatross!\" she quipped when I went to interview her.\n\"How did you know it was a Banksy?\" I asked.\n\"There was scaffolding erected on the side of the house. I tried to find out if it was a particular scaffolding firm, but there was no phone number,\" Gert replied. \"On the Monday morning the letting agency informed me that I could possibly have a Banksy. By then the scaffolding had gone and this seagull appeared.\"\nThis fits with what we know of Banksy's modus operandi. He claims hiding in plain sight is the best way to remain invisible. \"If questioned about your legitimacy,\" he wrote in his book Wall & Piece, \"simply complain about the hourly rate.\"\nIt's a good gag. But how fun is it for the folk on the other end of his spray can?\nI found that with good hustling skills a Banksied homeowner might see their bank balance expanded, but it's not an easy process. \nAs Gert explains, exasperated, \"Lowestoft people commented that it belongs to Lowestoft\u2026 But nobody's turned up to say, 'we'll help you protect it'. It doesn't belong to the person filming it, or the person taking pictures with their children. The problem is mine!\" \nGert had to contend with people putting their children into the skip for photo opportunities, the council trying to charge her for Perspex screens, and the threat of a Preservation Order which might have cost her \u00a340,000 a year.\nAnd the two stories I've been following have ended up having entirely different outcomes. \nBoth artworks have been taken off the houses they were painted on \u2013 a complex, expensive operation that uses specialist equipment \u2013 so they can be sold. But while the Banksy in Margate is now on the verge of selling for well over \u00a31m, with a sizeable chunk set to go to a domestic violence charity, and with the piece remaining in the town for the foreseeable future, the Banksy up the coast in Lowestoft languishes in a climate-controlled warehouse, costing its owners \u00a33,000 per month. \nIt has cost Gert and her partner Gary around \u00a3450,000 so far to preserve the piece and although there are buyers sniffing around, nobody has bought it yet. Speaking about the situation, Gary told me: \"I'm so angry at what's going on.\"\nNot everyone approves of people trying to sell Banksy's street art. \nSteph Warren \u2013 who starred in the first series of The Banksy Story\u202fas the only person ever to work for Banksy without signing his non-disclosure agreement \u2013 suggests that worried homeowners should simply \"get busy with five litres of white emulsion and paint it out\".\nOwner of street-art gallery Stelladore in St Leonards, Warren is a purist, who feels that art made for the street should remain there, no matter its value. \"With Banksy, where he puts the art is fundamental,\" she says. \"Remove the work from the precise place on the streets that he put it, and the work instantly loses its power. Context is everything.\"\nBut Banksy has elevated graffiti into a new art form, now monetised \u2013 street art. Banksy's signed prints can sell for six-figure sums. Graffiti, or street art, has not just come of age, it is now an asset class. Given this, how can any homeowner feel okay about scrubbing away a Banksy without feeling as if they have smashed a Ming vase?\nOne thing I know for sure: if you wake up with a Banksy on your wall, you'll have to make a series of clever decisions to come out of it unscathed. As Sam says, after two years of dealing with the Banksy circus, \"going back to normal life now is going to be terribly boring\".",

        "article_text": "India's longest and most holy river, the Ganges, is home to thousands of dolphins. But their survival is under threat.\nBut these aren't like the ones found in oceans. They don't leap out of the water in spectacular arcs; surface for long intervals or swim in an upright position. Instead, they swim sideways, spend much of their time underwater, have long snouts and are almost completely blind.\nThese are Gangetic dolphins, a species of river dolphin - and India's national aquatic animal - that's found largely in the Ganges-Brahmaputra river system in the northern part of the country.\nA new survey finds India's rivers host around 6,327 river dolphins - 6,324 Gangetic and just three Indus dolphins. A majority of the Indus dolphins are found in Pakistan as the river flows through both the South Asian countries.\nBoth these dolphin species are classified as \"endangered\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). \nResearchers from the Wildlife Institute of India surveyed 58 rivers across 10 states between 2021 and 2023 to produce the first comprehensive count of India's river dolphins. \nThe origins of river dolphins are as fascinating as the creatures themselves. Often called \"living fossils\", they evolved from marine ancestors millions of years ago, say scientists. \nWhen the sea once flooded low-lying areas of South Asia, these dolphins moved inland - and when the waters receded, they stayed. Over time, they adapted to murky, shallow rivers, developing traits that set them apart from their ocean-dwelling cousins.\nExperts say the new survey is crucial for tracking river dolphin populations. Since 1980, at least 500 dolphins have died - many accidentally caught in fishing nets or killed deliberately - highlighting the ongoing threat to the species.\nConservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha says that up until the early 2000s, there was very little awareness about river dolphins.\nIn 2009, the Gangetic river dolphin was declared India's national aquatic animal to boost conservation. Steps like a 2020 action plan and a dedicated research centre in 2024 have since helped revive its numbers.\nHowever, conservationists say there's still a long way to go.\nDolphins continue to be poached for their flesh and blubber, from which oil is extracted to use as fishing bait. Other times, they collide with boats or get caught in fishing lines and die.\nNachiket Kelkar of the Wildlife Conservation Trust told Sanctuary Asia magazine that many fishermen often didn't report accidental deaths of dolphins fearing legal trouble. \nUnder Indian wildlife laws, accidental or targeted dolphin killings are treated as \"hunting\" and carry strict penalties. As a result, many poor fishermen quietly dispose of the carcasses to avoid fines. \nRiver cruise tourism, which has picked up in India in the past decade, has further threatened their habitat. Dozens of cruise trips operate on both the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers.\n\"There's no doubt that disturbances from cruises will gravely impact the dolphins, which are sensitive to noise,\" conservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha told The Guardian newspaper.\nMr Sinha believes that increased vessel traffic could push Gangetic dolphins towards extinction, much like it did to Baiji dolphins in China's Yangtze river.\nRiver dolphins face threats partly due to their own evolution. Nearly blind, they rely on echolocation - high-pitched sound pulses that bounce off objects and return as echoes - to navigate murky waters. While this trait suits their habitat, it also makes them vulnerable to modern threats.\nTheir poor eyesight and slow swimming speed make river dolphins especially prone to collisions with boats and other obstacles. Adding to their vulnerability is their slow reproductive cycle - they mature between six and 10 years of age and females typically give birth to just one calf every two to three years.\nBut Mr Sinha is hopeful about the future of river dolphins in India. \"Government initiatives have played a big role in saving the dolphins. A lot has been done but a lot more remains to be done too,\" he says.",

Accepting the award, director Jordan Fein said: \"There was a question as to whether a new production of Fiddler on the Roof was appropriate for this moment.\n\"It's a musical about love, not in the romantic abstract sense, but active love, brave and rebellious love that demands empathy and compassion, and that seems to be what we desperately need right now.\"\nBest new musical - The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button  \nBest revival - Oedipus (Wyndham's Theatre production)\nBest musical revival - Fiddler On The Roof\nBest new play - Giant\nBest new entertainment or comedy play - Titanique \nBest new opera production - Festen\nBest actor - John Lithgow for Giant\nBest actress - Lesley Manville for Oedipus (Wyndham's Theatre production)\nBest supporting actor - Elliot Levey for Giant\nBest supporting actress - Romola Garai for The Years\nBest actor in a musical - John Dagleish for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button\nBest actress in a musical - Imelda Staunton for Hello, Dolly!\nBest supporting actress in a musical - Maimuna Memon for Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet Of 1812\nBest supporting actor in a musical - Layton Williams for Titanique\nBest director - Eline Arbo for The Years \nBest new production in affiliate theatre - Boys On The Verge Of Tears\nBest new dance production - Assembly Hall\nBest family show - Brainiac Live\nBest theatre choreographer - Christopher Wheeldon for MJ The Musical \nBest lighting design - Paule Constable & Ben Jacobs for Oliver!\nBest sound design - Nick Lidster for Fiddler On The Roof\nBest costume design - Gabriella Slade for Starlight Express\nBest set design - Tom Scutt for Fiddler On The Roof\nOutstanding achievement in dance - Eva Yerbabuena for her performance in Yerbag\u00fcena \nOutstanding musical contribution - Darren Clark and Mark Aspinall for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button\nOutstanding achievement in opera - Allan Clayton for his performance in Festen\nThe ceremony was hosted by Beverley Knight and Billy Porter and included live performances from shows including Why Am I So Single?, MJ The Musical, Fiddler On The Roof, Oliver!, Starlight Express and a 40th anniversary performance from Les Mis\u00e9rables.",

        "article_text": "India's longest and most holy river, the Ganges, is home to thousands of dolphins. But their survival is under threat.\nBut these aren't like the ones found in oceans. They don't leap out of the water in spectacular arcs; surface for long intervals or swim in an upright position. Instead, they swim sideways, spend much of their time underwater, have long snouts and are almost completely blind.\nThese are Gangetic dolphins, a species of river dolphin - and India's national aquatic animal - that's found largely in the Ganges-Brahmaputra river system in the northern part of the country.\nA new survey finds India's rivers host around 6,327 river dolphins - 6,324 Gangetic and just three Indus dolphins. A majority of the Indus dolphins are found in Pakistan as the river flows through both the South Asian countries.\nBoth these dolphin species are classified as \"endangered\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). \nResearchers from the Wildlife Institute of India surveyed 58 rivers across 10 states between 2021 and 2023 to produce the first comprehensive count of India's river dolphins. \nThe origins of river dolphins are as fascinating as the creatures themselves. Often called \"living fossils\", they evolved from marine ancestors millions of years ago, say scientists. \nWhen the sea once flooded low-lying areas of South Asia, these dolphins moved inland - and when the waters receded, they stayed. Over time, they adapted to murky, shallow rivers, developing traits that set them apart from their ocean-dwelling cousins.\nExperts say the new survey is crucial for tracking river dolphin populations. Since 1980, at least 500 dolphins have died - many accidentally caught in fishing nets or killed deliberately - highlighting the ongoing threat to the species.\nConservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha says that up until the early 2000s, there was very little awareness about river dolphins.\nIn 2009, the Gangetic river dolphin was declared India's national aquatic animal to boost conservation. Steps like a 2020 action plan and a dedicated research centre in 2024 have since helped revive its numbers.\nHowever, conservationists say there's still a long way to go.\nDolphins continue to be poached for their flesh and blubber, from which oil is extracted to use as fishing bait. Other times, they collide with boats or get caught in fishing lines and die.\nNachiket Kelkar of the Wildlife Conservation Trust told Sanctuary Asia magazine that many fishermen often didn't report accidental deaths of dolphins fearing legal trouble. \nUnder Indian wildlife laws, accidental or targeted dolphin killings are treated as \"hunting\" and carry strict penalties. As a result, many poor fishermen quietly dispose of the carcasses to avoid fines. \nRiver cruise tourism, which has picked up in India in the past decade, has further threatened their habitat. Dozens of cruise trips operate on both the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers.\n\"There's no doubt that disturbances from cruises will gravely impact the dolphins, which are sensitive to noise,\" conservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha told The Guardian newspaper.\nMr Sinha believes that increased vessel traffic could push Gangetic dolphins towards extinction, much like it did to Baiji dolphins in China's Yangtze river.\nRiver dolphins face threats partly due to their own evolution. Nearly blind, they rely on echolocation - high-pitched sound pulses that bounce off objects and return as echoes - to navigate murky waters. While this trait suits their habitat, it also makes them vulnerable to modern threats.\nTheir poor eyesight and slow swimming speed make river dolphins especially prone to collisions with boats and other obstacles. Adding to their vulnerability is their slow reproductive cycle - they mature between six and 10 years of age and females typically give birth to just one calf every two to three years.\nBut Mr Sinha is hopeful about the future of river dolphins in India. \"Government initiatives have played a big role in saving the dolphins. A lot has been done but a lot more remains to be done too,\" he says.",

        "article_text": "Once home to a thriving Jewish majority, Thessaloniki holds fragments of a lost world. One traveller's journey to find them leads to something even more powerful: living memory.\nAs my family admired the gleaming remodel of Thessaloniki's century-old Modiano Market, local culinary guide Smaragda Marki admitted to me that among the trendy cafes and German delicatessen, she wished it were just a little more Greek. \"I wish it were a little more Jewish,\" I responded, staring up at the colourful Easter decorations.\nThe newly reopened market had topped my list of places to go in Greece's second-largest city, bringing together my two favourite things to look for while travelling: good food and tidbits of Jewish history. However, Modiano left me dissatisfied on both counts. Though the building still bears the name of its Jewish architect and stands on the site of the former Talmud Torah Synagogue, little else hinted that the nut stand used to be a kosher butcher or that Jews had any other part of its past life.\nThessaloniki was once considered an epicentre of Jewish culture, one of the only cities in Europe where Jews were the majority. Known as Salonika at the time, it was part of the Ottoman Empire until 1912. The Ottoman Empire allowed Jews escaping the Spanish Inquisition in the 15th Century to settle there for hundreds of years. But with Ottoman power beginning to wane in the early 20th Century, Greece took over the city in 1912. Five years later, the Great Fire of 1917 devastated huge swaths of the city and left 70,000 people homeless, including much of the Jewish population. The Talmud Torah Synagogue (and 31 others) were destroyed. The one-time centre of Jewish culture and majority Jewish city received its final blow in 1943 when Nazi forces deported 50,000 Jews to Europe's concentration camps.\nEighty years later, I struggled to find traces of the community, and even finding a Jewish guide to show me around proved difficult. It wasn't surprising; Thessaloniki's Jewish community now numbers less than 1,000 people, a small population sample within which to find a niche professional tour guide. Plenty of companies offered tours of Jewish Thessaloniki, most touting bonafides by proximity to, rather than being a part of the small congregation.\nEventually, I booked through a company based in Athens because it was run by a Greek Jew. I still didn't know if my actual guides would be Jewish, though at least I could be sure they were trusted by the community.\nWhen Elia Matalon greeted us the next morning, I let out a sigh of relief. In the lobby of our hotel, he explained that he and his wife Hella Kounio-Matalon run their tours together and they both come from families that go back many generations in Thessaloniki's Jewish community. Later in the eight-hour tour he would tell us about how his mother survived the war by hiding in homes across the border in Albania while Kounio-Matalon spoke of her father surviving Auschwitz. We began walking toward a Holocaust memorial sculpture, through a narrow alleyway where he pointed to a restaurant owned by a gentile chef who became fascinated by the city's Jewish history and now serves traditional Sephardic Jewish foods like nogada (meatballs in walnut sauce).\nMuch of the city's history is Jewish history. In the Ano Ladadika neighbourhood, we stared up at the city's famous broken clock, stopped by an earthquake in 1978. The building originally belonged to a bank started by the Italian Jewish Allatini brothers, 19th-Century entrepreneurs whose flour company grew to be the largest in the Balkans before World War Two.\nWe walked down adjacent Siggrou Street and paused in front of a 1926 mansion. Today, it houses a hookah bar, which meant we could wander into the lovely plant-filled atrium and up the grand staircase. Outside, Matalon pointed out the holes in the doorpost where a mezuzah once hung. A visible symbol of Jewish identity, the traditional decorative case holds a prayer, fulfilling the commandment to \"write them on the doorposts of your house\".\nSo much of visiting Jewish history around the world is like this: evidence of where we once were. Visiting the former site of the Jewish cemetery. Peering at painted-over holes and fading stars of David. Jews left their mark on Thessaloniki, but hardly in a fashion that hints to the glorious centre of Jewish life it once was. I love to imagine what it was like to live in these rich Jewish worlds, what could be if we weren't constantly getting kicked out of places.\nAcross the street from Modiano Market, we entered one of the city's two remaining synagogues. Because Thessaloniki's laws granted properties owned by Jews before WW2 without surviving family members to the Jewish community, the congregation owns the building, which mostly houses offices, and the synagogue on the ground floor. Marble tablets on the wall list the more than 70 synagogues that served the city's once much-larger Jewish population. The money the rent brings in allows the synagogue to pay retirees to show up to complete their minyan (the minimum number of people needed for a prayer service), a win-win situation.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Mediterranean's ancient gay-friendly civilisation\n\u2022 The Tour de France champion who saved hundreds of Jews\n\u2022 The tiny, idyllic island where Greeks escape the heat\nOutside the building, I learned how a bench signals that a piece of Thessaloniki's Jewish culture still lives within. The decorative wooden top looks the same as any other bench, a comforting and welcoming place to sit on busy Vasileos Irakleiou, between a synagogue and Modiano Market. Below, a sturdy cement bollard telegraphs its true purpose: these surround all the remaining Jewish sites in the city, protecting them from potential violence by vehicle.\nWe see them again outside the only remaining pre-WW2 synagogue, the community's other house of prayer. The Monastir Synagogue escaped destruction by invading Axis forces because the Red Cross used it during the war, a story that would be slightly more heartwarming if they hadn't nearly destroyed it themselves by using it as a storehouse and stable. It has since been returned to its stained-glass and marble-walled glory.\nA large tour group from a cruise, wearing headsets to hear their guide, filed in, and I browsed the tiny museum in the foyer until they left, just a few minutes later. Then Matalon and Kounio-Matalon announced that they had a surprise for us. Together, they offered to sing a song in Ladino, the ancient version of Judeo-Spanish spoken by the region's Jews: Adio Kerido (Goodbye, Beloved), a love song repurposed as a farewell to Holocaust deportees.\nBy the time they stepped onto the bimah, the raised platform at the front of the sanctuary, I had already seen the history for which I came: the train car parked permanently at the station in memory of the city's Jews, who were deported in similar ones; the mansions built by the thriving majority population of the 19th Century; and the lovely, solemn Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki. But as their voices joined, reverberating in the incredible acoustics of the large room, singing \"Adio, adio, kerido\", I realised I'd found something even better: a unique Jewish culture still alive.\n\"No kero la vida,\" they sang hauntingly, beautifully, mournfully, \"I don't want to live.\" The song offered such sorrow for the departing love, but it brought me such happiness to hear, to see this moment, the kind of moment for which people travel. A moment that could never be predicted, that could never be expected, and, more than anything, that could never happen anywhere else in the world except precisely here.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

called the Professional Rugby Agreement (PRA) - as part of the \"One Wales\" strategy through until 2029.\nThe premise is based on the four regions -  Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets - being functioning independent businesses with private investment.\nCardiff are currently ninth in the United Rugby Championship table\nThe investment of Helford Capital Limited in Cardiff Rugby was led by British businessmen Phil Kempe and Neal Griffith, who are on the region's board.\nKempe is a Welshman with an association stretching back more than a decade with the club. \nCardiff said at the time that Kempe had a range of successful business interests across multiple industries in the UK, Canada and the Middle East.\nGriffith, who also has Welsh roots, is a former investment banker with numerous global business interests as an investor and director.\nThe duo had significant business relationships in the United Arab Emirates, which they said they planned to leverage for Cardiff's benefit.\nThe takeover followed the death of former chairman and benefactor Peter Thomas in March 2023.\nThe deal secured the minor stake of the Thomas family and other significant shareholders.\nThe takeover was approved by a \"99.99% majority\" at Cardiff's general meeting.\nThe investment group gained approval from the Cardiff board, the WRU and the Cardiff Athletic Club, which retained a minority shareholding in the club.\nThe due diligence test was undertaken by an independent London-based company.\nCardiff Rugby chair Alun Jones said the takeover would \"represent a huge moment in the history of Cardiff Rugby and gives us a bright, secure and exciting future\".\nCardiff is regarded as one of the grand club names in world rugby. \nGreats of the game including Cliff Morgan, Bleddyn Williams, Sir Gareth Edwards, Barry John, Terry Holmes, John Scott, Neil Jenkins, Jonah Lomu, Gethin Jenkins and Sam Warburton have all worn the Cardiff shirt in different guises.\nCardiff Rugby were formed in 1876 following an amalgamation between Cardiff Wanderers and the Glamorgan Football Club and the first game took place on December 2, 1876, against Newport RFC.\nThe Blue & Blacks became universally acknowledged as one of the world's most famous and successful sides.\nPlaying at Cardiff Arms Park, they claimed victories over major touring teams, including Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and achieved numerous national honours.\nWith the advent of regional rugby in 2003, Cardiff was granted its own standalone professional team. \nThey initially played under the Cardiff Blues brand, with a semi-professional Cardiff RFC side beneath them playing in the Welsh Premiership.\nThe region originally encompassed Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan but following the demise of the Celtic Warriors in 2004, Cardiff club took on responsibility for a wider area that included Rhondda Cynon Taf, Merthyr and Powys.\nCardiff dropped the 'Blues' title in 2021 when they were rebranded as Cardiff Rugby. \nIn the regional era, Cardiff have won the European Challenge Cup twice in 2010 and 2018.\nIf the WRU takes over in the short term it could be searching for new long-term investors.\nThe union could consider taking over permanent ownership of the side but that is something it has attempted to avoid in the past, highlighted by the return of  Dragons to private ownership in 2023.\nIt is set to be business as usual with Cardiff having four United Rugby Championship (URC) games left this season, which will be fulfilled with Matt Sherratt's side still having hopes of finishing in the top eight and qualifying for the play-offs. \nTheir next fixture is against Ospreys on Saturday, 19 April at the Principality Stadium. They are then scheduled to host Munster at the Arms Park six days later.\nIt is understood the plan is to honour contracts and the new signings who have been announced by Cardiff should join up with the squad in the summer.\nUnlike football, there are understood to be no automatic points deduction from the URC if a team goes into administration.\nThe state of rugby finances is under the microscope with London Irish, Wasps and Worcester having all gone out of business during the 2022-23 season, leaving the top flight of English rugby with only 10 teams.\nIn Wales in 2003, five professional regions were created from the club game before Celtic Warriors were disbanded in 2004.\nIn 2017, the WRU stepped in to be the majority stakeholder at Dragons following financial difficulties. The Newport-based side were eventually returned to private investment in 2023.\nIn March 2024, Cardiff announced a loss of \u00a32.1m for the year ending June 2023, with the next set of accounts due in May 2025.\nBoth Ospreys and Scarlets have recently announced losses of more than \u00a32m for the year ending June 2024.\nThe current budgets for the four Welsh professional sides is \u00a34.5m. That is planned to rise to \u00a35.1m and then to more than \u00a36m in the coming seasons.",

That's clear.\"\nDespite the setback at Craven Cottage,  a record-equalling 20th top-flight crown is surely a formality now?\nThey could even win the title as early as 20 April - if results elsewhere go their way - with no team in Premier League history throwing away a lead of this size at this stage of the season.\nThe Reds' dominance has been clear for all to see this campaign, and they lead second-placed Arsenal by 11 points.\nSlot is certainly expecting his side to bounce back and get the job done.\n\"We played a good game on Wednesday [against Everton] and we will show up against West Ham [on Sunday] as well,\" he told Sky Sports.\nLiverpool's 26-match unbeaten run ended by Fulham\nPremier League Review with Darren Fletcher\nThis video can not be played\n'Mo will show up' - Slot not worried by Salah's form\nWe've all heard the accusations and whispers this season from rival fans, haven't we?\n'This Liverpool team isn't actually that great.' 'The Premier League is a poor league this season.' 'Liverpool's class of 2024-25 wouldn't have won the title in another season.'\nSunday's loss will only add to those shouts.

        "article_text": "Take a four-hour slow train through the Eastern Ghats to discover how a remote hill station is changing the global coffee game.\nEven in December, early mornings are rarely pleasant on much of India's Andhra Pradesh coast. The air is already muggy by 06:30 as a crowd mills restlessly on platform five at Visakhapatnam (Vizag) railway station. However, these would-be passengers are no ordinary commuters, but travellers gathered for an experience. When the Visakhapatnam Kirandul Passenger Special rolls onto the platform, the crowd's relief is palpable; the two vistadome coaches at the back of the train that they've been anxiously waiting to board are air-conditioned.\u00a0\nIndians have only a nodding acquaintance with the concept of queues, so a mad scramble ensues as the train comes to a halt. Things settle down as it chugs out of the station and gradually picks up speed. The Visakhapatnam Kirandul Passenger Special also serves as a regular commuter service headed to the town of Kirandul in Chhattisgarh state, about 400km to the north-west, and takes about 14 hours to traverse the distance. But those in the vistadome coaches are interested only in the first leg, to Araku Valley. This serene hill station is about 120km away but takes four hours as the train winds its way through a whopping 58 tunnels cut through the Eastern Ghats. The two vistadome coaches \u2013 with their extra-large windows and rotatable seats \u2013 are designed to provide panoramic views of the area's mountain peaks and valleys and its gentle forested slopes that end in rushing rivers and streams, gorges and rocky promontories.\nAs the train whizzes past Vizag's neighbourhoods and suburbs, it provides snapshots of a city waking up: a vegetable vendor hauling their cart, a dog walker pulled by his dog, two bleary-eyed uniformed children clutching onto their father on a scooter to school. As the city segues into wide open fields and farmlands, the images change: smoke curls lazily into the sky from a lone thatched house in the middle of a farm, a diligent farmer urges on his oxen, a tractor hauls vegetables to the nearby market. The rhythmic clickety-clack of the train's wheels is familiar and soporific.\u00a0\u00a0\nLess than 30 minutes after leaving Vizag, the train slows considerably and begins ascending into the foothills of the Eastern Ghats. As if on cue, most seats in the coach swing to face the windows. The train climbs, plains fall away and even the sporadic habitations clinging to the peaks vanish. Hills and mountains in the distance appear blue-grey in the tender morning sun. But even before this panorama can register, complete darkness descends as the train enters the route's first tunnel. I'm startled by the sounds of adults and children screaming, in jest of course, for the few minutes it takes for us to come out the other side.\nWhen we emerge into daylight, the sight is jaw-dropping: a series of hillocks and gentle valleys, thickly forested, stretch out to the horizon where a haze-shrouded mountain range is just a hint of the soaring peaks to come. As I try to take in as much of the scene as possible, darkness descends again, and with it, more screaming.\nOn the other side is another surreal and dramatic sight: tracks bent around a hill, a green wall sloping straight up on one side, and a sheer drop on the other. The train slowly chugs forward, hugging the inner curve. The vistadomes' rear position means that the entire length of the train is visible, curling against the hill as if teetering on the edge. It then uncoils and wraps itself on the other side, trundling on a bridge built over a stream that gently flows several metres below. The bridge has no continuous guardrails, so, for a moment, it feels like the train is suspended in the air. But soon, the feeling is interrupted by darkness and more screaming, and another breathtaking view on the other side.\nTrain Journeys\nTrain Journeys is a BBC Travel series that celebrates the world's most interesting train rides and inspires readers to travel overland.\nThis sequence repeats over and over again and yet it never gets predictable or boring. Each of the route's 58 tunnels sets up anticipation for what might lay on the other side. Thick curtains of mist clinging to mountainsides or low-hanging clouds cloaking the peaks; rolling grasslands and forests spread out like someone had shaken out a giant green blanket and laid it down; deep valleys and gorges surrounded by undulating peaks; and fleeting glimpses of hamlets and habitations perched precariously on the hillsides.\u00a0\nWe stop every few minutes to drop and pick up commuters at musical-sounding stations that could be tongue-twisters to those unfamiliar: Pendurthi, Kottavalasa, Chimidipalli, Borraguhallu, Karakavalasa. At Shimiliguda, the station proudly wears its altitude on its sleeve: 996m above sea level. Throughout the journey, there is also a continuous parade of food vendors, delectable aromas wafting from their baskets as they sell idli-vada-chutney (a common breakfast of steamed rice cake with coconut chutney), samosa, savoury puffed rice and boiled peanuts.\nWhen the train finally rolls into Araku town, the station is crowded and noisy and the magic of the journey dissipates somewhat. But early next morning, Araku's appeal is on full display. A short walk leads to forests and coffee plantations speckled with tall silver oak trees, their trunks wrapped by pepper vines. Everything is covered in thick fog and the air is nippy, a far cry from Vizag's mugginess. The air is sappy and thick with terpenes. I catch faint whiffs of coffee and pepper.\nCoffee came to Araku with the British and was grown in scattered patches of plantations. Like other coffee-growing regions in India, Araku was an ideal location owing to its combination of soil, altitude and weather. After independence from British rule in 1947, the land passed into local government hands, but decades of underdevelopment and sporadic insurgency kept the region off most investment maps. That began to change in the early 2000s.\u00a0\n\"The local community wanted progress,\" says Manoj Kumar, CEO of the Naandi Foundation, a non-profit that works with farmers through community initiatives and sustainable models. \"So we looked around and thought since coffee was already growing in pockets, it could be expanded.\"\nWorking with local farmers, the organisation began establishing micro-plots of Arabica coffee using regenerative agriculture. What began at around 1,000 acres in 2002 currently stands at 100,000 acres farmed by more than 90,000 families, who each own about an acre on average. Besides coffee, farmers have been encouraged to multi-crop and now produce pepper, red kidney beans, ginger, turmeric, millets, rice, vegetables, fruits such as chikoo (sapodilla), mango, custard apple and avocado.\u00a0The result: a unique fair-trade coffee model known as Arakunomics, which won the Rockefeller Foundation's Food System Vision 2050 Prize in 2020.\nBut the foundation didn't stop there. In a first for Indian coffee, they \"terroir-mapped\" the beans \u2013 borrowing a concept from winemaking \u2013\u00a0and classified the end product into six distinct flavour profiles under the brand name ARAKU. Selective harvesting, sustainable practices and meticulous post-harvest processes have helped the beans consistently score 91/100 on specialty coffee rankings.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How the bullet train transformed Japan\n\u2022 Malaysia's iconic 'Jungle Railway'\n\u2022 The Baltic Express: Central Europe's new hop-on hop-off train\n\"We grow about 2,000 metric tons of coffee, 98% of which is sourced by specialty coffee promoters across the world,\" Kumar says.\nTravellers can explore this story at various coffee holdings in the area, but Priya Rajagopal, a coffee enthusiast and former project manager in tech, recommends the Sunkarametta Coffee Plantation, about 13km south-east of Araku, where a wooden bridge runs for a few hundred metres through the plantation, suspended above the coffee plants and flanked by towering silver oaks. \"When I went, it was the flowering season (March to May) and the plants were full of white flowers, \" she says. \"The air is filled with a sweet, jasmine-like smell.\"\nA short distance away, the modest but informative Araku Coffee Museum offers a primer on the journey from seed to cup. The small adjacent caf\u00e9 serves a robust filter brew \u2013 earthy, rich and perfect for a chilly morning in the hills.\u00a0\nA few days after the train trip, back in Bengaluru, I head to the sole ARAKU cafe in India (most of their production is either exported, retailed in stores or available online), which is tucked away in the tree-lined avenues of the city's Indiranagar neighbourhood. I am torn between the various options but opt for their signature medium roast. It is beautifully rich red-brown and utterly mellow on the tongue. More importantly, a subtle peppery end note immediately transports me back to Araku\u2019s mist-covered winding lanes, the lush green forests and plantations \u2013 and the slow, soulful train ride that led me there.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

I'm startled by the sounds of adults and children screaming, in jest of course, for the few minutes it takes for us to come out the other side.Anita Rao KashiThe train passes through a whopping 58 tunnels on its journey to Araku Valley (Credit: Anita Rao Kashi)When we emerge into daylight, the sight is jaw-dropping: a series of hillocks and gentle valleys, thickly forested, stretch out to the horizon where a haze-shrouded mountain range is just a hint of the soaring peaks to come. The result: a unique fair-trade coffee model known as Arakunomics, which won the Rockefeller Foundation's Food System Vision 2050 Prize in 2020.AlamyThe journey culminates in a pathbreaking initiative: ARAKU coffee, a first-ever terroir-mapped coffee (Credit: Alamy)But the foundation didn't stop there.",

        "article_text": "Markets are reeling from US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, but the American leader is standing by his decisions, defending his policies and saying \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something\". \nExperts answered some of the questions you sent us as the world tries to make sense of the turmoil and wonders how long it will continue.\nRead their answers below.\nSimon Jack, the BBC's business editor, said the FTSE 100, which represents the 100 biggest companies publicly listed in the UK, were all \"put in a big bucket back in 1984\" and given a certain weighting in that bucket depending on how big those companies were. \nThe stock market is a reflection of their total value over time. The bigger the company, the more weight it has in the index. For example, an AstraZeneca or an HSBC has more weight than others.\nIt works the same in the US with the S&P500, which is made up of the 500 biggest companies, with an enormous concentration in some names like Apple, Nvidia and Amazon. \nThe stock market tells you how the value of the shares in those companies has changed - with a focus on those biggest names.\nGenerally speaking, it is an indication of what some of our biggest companies are worth, and when they go up or down, it tells you something about the sentiment of whether their profits are likely to rise or fall in the future.\nJack explains that what happens in stock markets is not necessarily the same thing that happens in the economy. They can be linked, but they are not exactly the same. \nSome people invest directly in shares - and this will definitely affect them. These are some big falls, some of the biggest we have seen in a couple days since pandemic panic gripped the markets back in 2020.\nThe other way that people are exposed to these changes is through their pension funds. Pension fund investing is a long term game. Not all of your money will go into shares - some will go into government bonds, and the closer you get to retirement, the more weighting you will have in things like cash and government bonds, so the less this will affect you. \nThere are two types of pensions: a defined benefit pension - where you get a promised percentage of your salary at retirement - and defined contribution - where your pension pots value will rise and fall with financial markets.\nPensions are exposed right now, but pension investing is a long term game. \nThe warning sign flashing here is not the value of your pension pot - it is what is going to happen to the economies in which we all live and work.\nA lot of people are saying the chance of recession in both the US, UK - and even globally - have gone up a notch, which has implications for things like jobs and wages.\nThere is growing scepticism about tariffs among Americans, although views still fall along partisan lines.\nAccording to one poll released last week, slightly more than half of Republicans, 52%, think tariffs help the economy, but 58% of independents say they hurt the economy, as do 89% of Democrats. \nHowever, that survey was held before Trump's global tariffs came into effect and trillions of dollars was wiped off the value of the US stock market. We will find out in the coming days how the economic turmoil has changed public sentiment. \nOne of the key factors in President Trump's 2024 election victory was that more voters trusted him to improve the US economy, and especially to tackle high prices.\nYet most economists warn that tariffs could drive up prices for US consumers as almost all imported goods will face a tax. \nThere could be inflation and we could also see an economic downturn, and potentially a recession.\nSome think that the whole exercise is about an economic proxy war with China and the entire game is about just trying to level that playing field a little bit, Jack said.\nBut Trump is right in one regard, which is that American markets are much more open to foreign goods than a lot of foreign markets are open to US goods. \nThe UK, for example, puts a 10% tariff on US imported cars, 14% on some kinds of beef, and 8% on other things. So there are barriers both ways. \nAnd while Trump says that other countries have been ripping off the US, it is American corporations that have reasonably pursued shareholder value by trying to put their production facilities in the strategically and economically best places.\nIt is the head of American corporations who opened subsidiaries in Ireland, where there is a low tax rate, and put manufacturing in Vietnam or Cambodia. In a way this has been the sort of rational pursuit of maximum profit, a system which has made the US very rich indeed.\nChina is getting very rich indeed as well, and it is certainly moving up the value chain. \nThere is a feeling that the US was very comfortable when China was making cheap sneakers and t-shirts, but when China starts making supercomputers and missiles the US gets a little bit more concerned, and that is one of the reasons you are seeing some of these tensions come to the fore.\nThat is really the unknown question right now, Davison said, but one thing we can expect is more volatility. \nWe got a little bit of a sense of how markets react on Friday when Trump said he had spoken with Vietnamese officials and there was potentially a deal in the works for Vietnam. \nThe country has been hit with a 46% tariff by the US, which is quite a significant level, and Vietnam has indicated that it could reduce to zero all its tariffs on US goods going into that country. Stocks like Nike and Lululemon actually increase on that news, because these are apparel companies that have a very big presence in Vietnam.\nBroadly, I believe we are going to see markets go down, but you could see particular stocks moving in a more positive direction as there are indications that there may be some exemptions allowed. \nWe do not know what Trump will allow - he has sent some big signals at times saying that his policies will never change, but has also suggested that some deals are possible.",

Only authorised persons can go in close proximity to them to perform a specific task,\" Mr Sharma said.\nInitial reports in the media called the video \"heartwarming\" but many on social media raised concerns about the safety of people and animals in such situations. Others suggested a better option would be for the authorities to create ponds and water bodies in the park to ensure the cats did not have to go far for water in the hot summer.\nVillages on the park's border have been tense as cheetahs wander into their fields and kill their livestock. Last month, some villagers pelted the cats with stones to stop such attacks, The New Indian Express newspaper reported. Officials say they have been trying to raise awareness in the villages so that people adapt to living near the animals.\nTwenty cheetahs were relocated from South Africa and Namibia to the Kuno national park in the central state of Madhya Pradesh between 2022 and 2023 in what was the first such intercontinental translocation of the big cats.\nEight of them have since died due to various reasons, including kidney failure and mating injuries, sparking concerns about whether conditions at Kuno are suitable for them. \nIn 2023, South African and Namibian experts involved with the project wrote to India's Supreme Court, saying they believed that some of these deaths could have been prevented by \"better monitoring of animals and more appropriate and timely veterinary care\". \nExperts from the Namibia-based Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), which has been involved with the project since its inception, had also raised concerns about inadequate record-keeping at Kuno. They told the BBC that the park management had \"little or no scientific training\" and the vets were \"too inexperienced to manage a project of this calibre\".\nPark authorities have rejected the allegations and say there are now a total of 26 cheetahs, including 17 in the wild and nine others that are kept in enclosures at the moment.\nThis year, India is expected to receive 20 more cheetahs from South Africa. Officials say the big cats have already been identified by a task force in collaboration with South African authorities.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

With seven games left and 12 points to make up on fourth-bottom Wolves, the battle to stay up looks over. \nJorgen Strand Larsen's scrappy 84th-minute goal settled a tense encounter between the two relegation rivals after Pablo Sarabia had cancelled out a Town opener from Liam Delap.\nDefeat pushed the Tractor Boys closer to the drop in a game they simply had to win. Their fairytale rise from League One to the top flight in successive seasons looks certain to end with an immediate return to the Championship. \nWolves' comeback success at Portman Road crucially stretched them further clear of the bottom three and even Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna conceded their fight for survival looks bleak.\n\"I think it's certainly more than likely on the balance of probabilities,\" he said when asked about the prospect of relegation. \"Not that I don't think we can't finish the season strongly, but Wolves are a strong side and the chance of them losing all their games is really low. \n\"The likelihood is we'll fall short of our ultimate dream.\"\nWhen Ipswich won 2-1 at Wolves in December through Jack Taylor's last-gasp header - which ended Gary O'Neil's managerial reign at Molineux - they moved three points above Wolves.\nTown were still third bottom at the time, but just a point behind Crystal Palace, while second-bottom Wolves were four adrift of safety.\nFast forward five months and defeat at Portman Road leaves them needing one of the greatest of escapes. \nThe biggest deficit overcome by a side to stay up after 30 matches of a Premier League season was West Ham United in 2006-07. \nAt that stage, Alan Curbishley's men were eight points from safety, having been 10 behind a match earlier. Ipswich have a game less and a bigger gap.\nBradford City, in 1999-2000, and Fulham, in 2007-08, came from six points behind to survive with just five matches left, but it seems fanciful for the Tractor Boys to think of achieving that.\nJust seven of their 20 points have been won in Suffolk this season, a huge Achilles heel for a newly promoted side. Just one victory - 2-0 against Chelsea in December - has been celebrated at Portman Road and they have now lost six successive home league games for only the second time in their history, matching a wretched run in 1963 when they went on to be relegated too.\nLeicester have won nine points at home, while bottom club Southampton's sorry season is epitomised by the five points they have earned at St Mary's and they will be relegated if they fail to win at Tottenham on Sunday. \n\"You can look at different games, Liverpool, Fulham, [Aston] Villa we started really well, then came up short in terms of trying to break teams down, like the Crystal Palace game,\" reflected McKenna. \n\"We have had a few high energy games and the other teams have punished us. Today it was a spirited and committed performance but not enough to win. We are talking about small sample sizes. \n\"It's strange not to have more wins at home than away. I don't think there's one outstanding reason. If there was, we would have found it and sorted it.\"\nIn contrast, Wolves have earned 10 points from their seven home games since Vitor Pereira replaced O'Neil in December. \nUnder the Portuguese, Wolves have won more points than the three promoted sides put together - 23 from 15 games, scoring 19 goals and conceding 19.\nThe bottom three have won 16 points from a combined 43 games in that time (Ipswich eight, Southampton five and Leicester three). \nNo side has dropped more points from winning positions in the top flight this season than Ipswich (25) and they have simply not been competitive enough.\nThey have led against Fulham (twice), Manchester City, Aston Villa,(twice), Brentford, Leicester, Bournemouth, Manchester United and now Wolves and failed to win. \nEven Liam Delap's 12 goals have been unable to help them bridge the gap at this level. He has scored 38.71% of Ipswich's 31 this season - only Alexander Isak (41%), Mohamed Salah (39%) and Erling Haaland (36.8%) have higher figures in this campaign.\n\"There will be plenty of time to talk about it, analyse it and reflect on the positives and negatives,\" added McKenna. \n\"We knew coming into this nine-game block the balance of probabilities was really small, but we committed as a group to show the right values and show full commitment. \n\"We have Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Arsenal here after that, Newcastle at St James' Park and Everton in one of the last games at Goodison. \n\"We have some fantastic fixtures coming up for a club who haven't been into the Premier League for 22 years. \n\"I know today is a big setback and it hurts, but I know the players and supporters and everyone are going to muster up the energy to compete as well as we can in the last few games.\" \nThis video can not be played\nIpswich \u2018sad\u2019 as relegation looms \u2013 McKenna",

        "article_text": "Constructed by a mysterious civilisation that left no written records, the massive site is now open to the public for the first time in more than a century.\nAutumn leaves crackled under our shoes as dozens of eager tourists and I followed a guide along a grassy mound. We stopped when we reached the opening of a turf-topped circle, which was formed by another wall of mounded earth. We were at The Octagon, part of the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks, a large network of hand-constructed hills spread throughout central and southern Ohio that were built as many as 2,000 years ago. Indigenous people would come to The Octagon from hundreds of miles away, gathering regularly for shared rituals and worship.\u00a0\n\"There was a sweat lodge or some kind of purification place there,\" said our guide, Brad Lepper, senior archaeologist for the Ohio History Connection's World Heritage Program (OHC), as he pointed to the circle. I looked inside to see a perfectly manicured lawn \u2013 a putting green. A tall flag marked a hole at its centre.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat's because from 1910 through 2024, The Octagon had been used as a golf course. But on 1 January 2025, this ancient, enigmatic site reopened to visitors for the first time in more than a century.\nAll these prehistoric ceremonial earthworks in Ohio were created by what is now called the Hopewell Culture, a network of Native American societies that gathered from as far away as Montana and the Gulf of Mexico between roughly 100 BCE and 500 CE and were connected by a series of trade routes. Their earthworks in Ohio consist of shapes \u2013 like circles, squares and octagons \u2013 that were often connected to each other. Archaeologists are only now beginning to understand the sophistication of these engineering marvels.\nBuilt with astonishing mathematical precision, as well as a complex astronomical alignment, these are the largest geometrical earthworks in the world that were not built as fortifications or defensive structures. And while most people have never heard about the sites or its builders, that may be about to change.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nIn 2023, eight of Hopewell's earthworks were inscribed as a Unesco World Heritage site. These include The Great Circle and The Octagon in Newark, Ohio, as well Ohio's first state park, Fort Ancient (not an actual fort). The other five are part of the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park: Mound City, Hopeton Earthworks, High Bank Works, Hopewell Mound Group and Seip Earthworks.\u00a0\nLepper told me The Octagon and The Great Circle were once a larger, single Hopewell complex spanning 4.5 square miles and connected by a series of roads lined by earthwork walls. Walking through both sites today, there is an immediate shock of scale. The Great Circle, where the museum for Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks is found, is 1,200ft in diameter. Its walls rise up to 14ft high and are outlined on the inside by a deep ditch. The Great Circle was once connected to a square and a burial ellipse, with only part of the square still visible today.\u00a0The Octagon sprawls a massive 50 acres and is attached to the 20-acre Observatory Circle, a large earthwork circle for gathering and rituals connected to the observation of the night sky.\n\"You could put four Roman Colosseums inside just The Octagon,\" Lepper told me. \"Stonehenge would fit within just that small circle now serving as a putting green.\" He added that 2,000 years ago, Indigenous workers built these earthworks without modern tools, digging up soil with pointed sticks and hauling it in wicker baskets on their backs. One estimate, he noted, is that they moved seven million cubic feet of dirt.\u00a0\nThe achievement of the Hopewell Culture, however, is not simply in creating large, precise shapes, which they did without the vantage point of hills for an aerial view. They also embedded a sort of hidden geometry within these structures. Until the mounds were measured and compared, it was thought that the builders didn't have any mathematical and geometrical sophistication, as there are no written records to testify to their level of knowledge. It was eventually discovered, however, that they made precise measurements across their earthworks and connected them in unsuspecting ways.\u00a0\nLepper explained that the circumference of The Great Circle \"is equal to the perimeter of the perfect square that it was connected to\", and that \"the area of that perfect square is equal to the area of the [Observatory Circle] that's connected to The Octagon\".\u00a0\nHe added: \"If you draw a square inside The Octagon by drawing a line from alternate corners of The Octagon, the sides of that square [1,054ft] are equal to the diameter of the circle that it's attached to [1,054ft].\"\nExamples of this interplay between earthworks have been found repeatedly by archaeologists. According to Lepper, that measure of 1054ft, whether halved or doubled, is found in other Indigenous earthworks across the country, and served as a common unit of measure.\u00a0\nWhile the Hopewell Culture's geometrical and mathematical knowledge astonished scholars, another level of sophistication appears when the layers are peeled back further: astronomical alignment.\u00a0\nMore like this\n:\n\u2022 The US's lost, ancient megacity\n\u2022 A mysterious US desert civilisation\n\u2022 A long-lost Maya city that was just discovered\nIn the 1980s, two professors at Earlham College in Indiana, Ray Hively (a physicist and astronomer) and Robert Horn (a philosopher), decided to pay a visit to The Octagon and its attached Observatory Circle. As astronomical monuments like Stonehenge had received great attention, they wondered if these earthworks were also aligned to a solar calendar.\u00a0\u00a0\nHively and Horn found no solar connections, but they then considered an alternative purpose: the lunar cycle.\n\"We thought deliberate lunar alignments unlikely at Newark,\" they wrote, because while the Sun can be tracked over a year, a complete lunar cycle takes 18.6 years. Even so, the lunar cycle proved to correspond to the position of the Observatory Mound at The Observatory Circle. There, one can watch the Moon rise over the exact centre of The Octagon in the distance every 18.6 years.\u00a0\n\"Astronomical alignments are only relevant and useful if they somehow tie the celestial orbs to belief systems and understandings of life,\" said Timothy Darvill, professor of archaeology at Bournemouth University who has researched both Stonehenge and the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks. \"The ceremonies around the observation of the skyscape could well have a secondary function in terms of fostering community.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThat ancient community and culture was part of the reason for its Unesco World Heritage Site inclusion.\u00a0\nA Unesco site needs to show that it has \"outstanding universal value\", said Jennifer Aultman, director of historic sites and museums at Ohio History Connection which helped lead its Unesco consideration. One criterion for this, she said, \"is that these are masterpieces of human creative genius\", which is where these mathematical, geometrical and astronomical features are important. The other, \"is that they bear really exceptional testimony to the cultural tradition that produced them\".\nAultman explained: \"You really can understand something about the lives of the people and what mattered to them by looking at, and learning about, the earthworks.\"\u00a0\nConsider the Moon, for example, which was clearly important for the Hopewell Culture. Darvill told me that, for some cultures, the \"Sun, Moon... are considered to have power over what happens on a day-to-day basis. As such, the heavenly bodies are often deified, which is how their power is justified and rationalised.\" It is therefore likely that the Moon was a deity shared by those who gathered at the mounds.\u00a0\n\"The land we know as Ohio is home to a number of extraordinary earthworks built by Indigenous residents of this region thousands of years ago,\" said Megan Wood, executive director and CEO of the Ohio History Connection. While not all earthworks in Ohio are specifically Hopewell Mounds \u2013 such as the solar-aligned Serpent Mound Historical Site in Peebles, Ohio, for example \u2013 Wood sees them all as \"icons\" of Indigenous \"cultural achievements\".\u00a0\nSince the Hopewell Culture left no written records, only the earthworks and the few objects retrieved from them serve as their last cultural testimony. While archaeological excavations continue on some sites, objects like ritual smoking pipes and a small stone statue of a shaman wearing a bear skin and holding a human skull called \"the Shaman of Newark\" have been found. As these earthworks were gathering places and not villages, artefacts representing the locations from where these Indigenous peoples travelled have also been discovered, like effigy pipes, a copper head plate and an obsidian knife.\nHowever, after the Hopewell Culture gradually began to disappear starting around 500 CE, other Indigenous peoples stepped in to become caretakers of the land. One of those groups was the Shawnee Tribe, which called Ohio home before they were forcibly removed west of the Mississippi River in the 1830s.\u00a0\n\"We may not have been responsible for building or creating them, but I know that my ancestors lived there, and that my ancestors protected them and respected them,\" said Chief Glenna Wallace of the Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma, who believes that other tribes should have a role in the future of protecting the Hopewell Earthworks and communicating their cultural importance.\u00a0\nFor years, The Octagon was under the control of the Moundbuilders Country Club. After more than a decade of negotiations, the OHC and the club finally reached a deal in 2024 to transfer the site's long-term lease to the historical society, paving the way for them to open the earthworks to visitors beginning this January.\nFor advocates of the site's preservation, the Unesco designation and opening of these mysterious mounds to the public offers a new chapter to educate visitors about Ohio's Native American history. It also means more Indigenous stakeholders, like the Shawnee, can tell that story from an Indigenous perspective for future generations.\u00a0\n\"I just want people to know about it,\" said Chief Wallace, \"I want people to be able to see it. I want people to be able to visit it and want people to realise that it is a cultural phenomenon. That it's priceless.\"\u00a0\nThis story was originally published in December 2022 and has been updated to reflect recent developments.\n---\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on\u00a0Facebook, or follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\n\u00a0",

        "article_text": "On 12 March, Kilmar Abrego Garcia was driving home with his young son in Maryland when he was stopped by agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\nAgents took Mr Garcia into custody, then shuttled him to detention facilities in Louisiana and Texas. \nAccording to a federal judge, after three days, \"without any notice, legal process, or hearing\", Mr Garcia found himself back in his native El Salvador at an infamous prison known for housing gang members. \nThe government said he was deported due to an \"administrative error\".\nBut despite that, Mr Garcia remains incarcerated in El Salvador as lawyers debate the unusual intricacies of the case. \nA Maryland court ordered Mr Garcia be returned to the US,  but Trump officials argued that they cannot compel El Salvador to return Mr Garcia. The administration also argued that the judge ordering his return lacked the authority to do so.\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court put a temporary hold on lower court orders while they consider the matter.\nImmigration experts say that as US President Donald Trump takes a hardline approach on illegal immigration, this case has the potential to upend due process  for immigrants.\n\"If the US Supreme Court were to accept [the Trump administration's] position, it would completely eviscerate any rule of law in the immigration process,\" Maureen Sweeney, director of the University of Maryland's Chac\u00f3n Center for Immigrant Justice, told the BBC.  \n\"Because they could pick up anybody, at any time, and send them anywhere with no repercussions whatsoever.\"\nUS District Judge Paula Xinis wrote in a filing Sunday that ICE officials did not follow procedures in the Immigration and Nationality Act when they deported Mr Garcia to El Salvador.\nShe ruled the US must bring him back before midnight on Monday. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, writing that the US \"has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street\".\nYet the Trump administration has argued that it cannot comply, saying Judge Xinis' filing is outside her jurisdiction.\n\"Neither a federal district court nor the United States has authority to tell the Government of El Salvador what to do,\" US Solicitor General D John Sauer wrote in an appeal to the Supreme Court.\nNicole Hallett, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School said that while it is true - US district judges cannot order El Salvador to take action -  they can order the US government to have Mr Garcia returned.\nShe also said the US has previously facilitated the return of mistakenly deported individuals.\nProf Hallett also questioned the government's claim that the US is powerless to compel El Salvador to release Mr Garcia, citing an agreement between the two countries.\nThe US, under the Trump administration, paid El Salvador's government $6m to house prisoners it sends, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. Top officials like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump himself have publicly touted the arrangement.\n\"It's almost as if the Salvadoran government is acting as an agent of the US government,\" Ms Hallett said, arguing that this makes the release more plausible.\nMr Garcia's lawyers argued that because El Salvador was detaining Mr Garcia \"at the direct request and pursuant to financial compensation\" from the US, the court could order the US government to request his return.\nMr Garcia is among 238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadorans deported under the Trump administration to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison. Officials allege they are gang members and therefore are subject to deportation.\nMr Garcia, who is married to a US citizen, does not have any gang ties and has never been charged with a crime, his lawyer says.\nHe was also protected by a \"withholding of removal\" order, which means the US government cannot send him back to El Salvador because he could face harm. The order dates back to 2019, when ICE first took Mr Garcia into custody and alleged he belonged to the MS-13 criminal organisation, an allegation he denied at the time.\nSuch orders are common, immigration lawyers told the BBC, and are an alternative to asylum protections.\n\"It was an unlawful act, for the US to return him to the country where he could not be returned,\" said Amelia Wilson, director of the Immigration Justice Clinic at Pace University.\nA judge ultimately granted Mr Garcia the 2019 order after he \"testified about how he was a victim of gang violence in El Salvador when he was a teenager and he came to the US to escape all of that,\" his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, wrote in a March 2025 affidavit.\nDepartment of Justice attorney Erez Reuveni acknowledged that at the time the \"government did not appeal that decision, so it is final\".\nThe Trump administration now reiterates allegations that Mr Garcia belonged to MS-13, but Judge Xinis said the government made this claim \"without any evidence\" and had not produced a removal order or warrant.\nThe Trump administration continues to press its case to the nation's highest court, setting up a potential showdown over the White House's deportation strategy.\nChief Justice John Roberts issued an administrative stay on Monday night, pausing lower court rulings while the US Supreme Court considers the government's appeal.\nPresident Trump touted the stay as a victory, writing on Truth Social that the ruling allowed the president \"to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself.\"\nImmigration lawyers, meanwhile, are watching Mr Garcia's case closely, considering it a test for how much power the administration can exert over US immigration.\n\"If the Trump administration is trying to remove these individuals by bypassing the immigration courts,\" said Ms Wilson, \"there's a direct and obvious line between what they're doing, and an effort by the administration to completely usurp judicial and due process.\"",

So he delayed saying farewell to a place that means so much to him.\n\"They're the two most important wins in my career,\" he said of his 1985 and 1993 victories at Augusta, which are his sole major triumphs.\n\"It's emotional. You can tell already my voice is breaking a bit just realising it's going to be my last competitive Masters.\"\nLanger has conceded for many years that he no longer has the game to compete at Augusta; three missed cuts in his past three Masters are testament to that.\n\"The course is just getting too long and I'm getting shorter and shorter,\" he said. \n\"I'm hitting hybrids [into greens] where the other kids are hitting nine-irons, maybe even wedges. So I knew I wasn't going to be in contention anymore.\n\"A few years back I asked the chairman of the club, 'is there a time limit? Do we age out when we're 60?'. He said, 'no, you will know when it's time to quit, it's totally up to you'.\n\"It is time to quit.\"\nLyle, Langer, Woosnam, Olazabal, Ballesteros and Faldo were victorious at Augusta National in an extraordinary era of success for European golf\nLanger was runner-up at The Open twice and third on three occasions in a career that promised more major success.\nThat he was unable to add a major other than his two at Augusta only intensifies his link to this fabled corner of Georgia.\nIn 40 appearances, he has made the cut 27 times and finished inside the top 10 nine times.\n\"It's been an incredible journey, for a young man born in a village of 800 people [in Bavaria, southern Germany], where golf was nothing, to make it here,\" he said.\n\"To get an invitation to play the Masters when it was extremely difficult for European or international players to get one, and then to win the Masters on the third go was just a dream come true.\"\nHe was just the third non-American winner, following in the footsteps of South Africa's three-time champion Gary Player and Seve Ballesteros of Spain, who won twice. \nHis win cemented belief among Europeans that success could be achieved at Augusta.\nBallesteros paved the way with his victories in 1980 and 1983, before Langer won his first two years later. \nThen Scotland's Sandy Lyle, England's Nick Faldo (twice) Wales' Ian Woosnam, Langer again and Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal collected six of seven titles from 1988.\nLanger's debut was in 1982, two years after Ballesteros had broken the glass ceiling. \nThe German's initial experience was hardly noteworthy. He shot 77 and 78 to miss the halfway cut by one stroke after three-putting 11 times in 36 holes on unfamiliar greens that were too slick for a naive 24-year-old.\n\"Coming here the first time, driving down Magnolia Lane, seeing this place for the first time was an eye-opener,\" he said. \n\"I had never seen a golf course manicured like this or a tournament run as efficiently as this has been.\"\nBy the time Langer won his second title in 1993, he was married with three children\nHe vowed to come back better prepared and when he returned two years later he made it through to the weekend - the first of an incredible run of 19 successive Masters that Langer would play all four rounds.\nHis victory 12 months later was secured with a classic back-nine Augusta charge. He birdied four out of six holes from the 12th as he overturned a three-shot deficit to Curtis Strange, who dropped shots on three of his final five holes.\nLanger bogeyed the 18th but still beat Strange, Ray Floyd and his playing partner Ballesteros by two shots.\nHe made a solid defence of his title in 1986 and briefly shared the lead in the final round before Jack Nicklaus produced a back nine for the ages to clinch his record-extending sixth Green Jacket and 18th major title.\nThat week was also memorable for witnessing the first time a world ranking was published, and it was Langer who had the honour of topping the inaugural list.\nHe was becoming something of an Augusta specialist and the love affair strengthened with two more top 10s before he claimed his second victory in 1993.\nLanger was challenged by unheralded American Dan Forsman in the final round. \nForsman was one shot behind the German when he teed off on the notoriously tricky par-three 12th. He dumped two balls in the water, walked off with a quadruple-bogey seven and was barely heard of again.\nIn contrast, Langer's name continued to pepper the leaderboards at Augusta, with top 10s in 1997, 2001 and 2004. \nHe finished joint eighth at the age of 56 in 2014 and held the record for the oldest player to make the cut - at the age of 63 in 2020 - until Fred Couples eclipsed that in 2023.\nThis is Langer's final Masters but not the end of competitive golf for the former Ryder Cup captain, who looks as fit as he did in his pomp.\nHe shows no signs of slowing down on the PGA Tour Champions - the US-based seniors tour - and has racked up at least one victory a year since joining the circuit in 2007 when he turned 50. \nHe has won 12 majors among 47 senior victories - both of which are records.\nThis week he is back among the game's youthful elite though, and will seek to end his Masters career with the same controlled elegance with which he has played throughout his career.\nHe will not contend for the title. That is clear. Instead, the question is whether his Masters career ends after round two on Friday, or if he defies his own expectations and makes the cut.\n\"After four decades it's going to be bittersweet,\" he said.\n\"When I'm inside the ropes, my mind switches to being a competitor, play golf and take care of the task in front of me. \n\"But I might get a bit emotional looking around, seeing my family, my kids, my grandkids, my brother and other friends that are going to be supporting me this week.\n\"I love the Masters more than any tournament in the world. I'm expecting it to be very difficult emotionally.\"",

        "article_text": "Authorities in India's Kuno National Park have started disciplinary action against a forest worker who is seen offering water to a cheetah and her cubs in a video that has gone viral online.\nThe man, a driver at the sanctuary, violated instructions which say only authorised personnel can go near the big cats, park officials told PTI news agency.\nCheetahs were declared extinct in India in 1952, the only large mammal to become extinct since the country's independence. \nThey were reintroduced in Kuno in 2022 as part of an ambitious plan to repopulate the species.\nThe incident came to light on Sunday, when a video of the man feeding water to the big cats began circulating online. \nThe footage shows him pouring water into a metal pan after being urged to do so by some people who aren't seen in the video.\nMoments later, a cheetah named Jwala and her four cubs walk up to the pan and start drinking from it. \nOfficials say it's not uncommon for certain staff members to offer water to big cats if they get close to the boundary of the national park to lure them back into the forest.\nThe mum and her cubs were in the fields close to the boundary, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Uttam Kumar Sharma told PTI. \n\"The monitoring team, in general, has been instructed to try to deviate or lure the cheetahs back inside whenever such a situation arises so as not to create human-cheetah conflict,\" he said\nHowever, only trained personnel are allowed to do so and the man's actions went against established protocol, he added.\n\"There are clear instructions to move away from cheetahs. Only authorised persons can go in close proximity to them to perform a specific task,\" Mr Sharma said.\nInitial reports in the media called the video \"heartwarming\" but many on social media raised concerns about the safety of people and animals in such situations. Others suggested a better option would be for the authorities to create ponds and water bodies in the park to ensure the cats did not have to go far for water in the hot summer.\nVillages on the park's border have been tense as cheetahs wander into their fields and kill their livestock. Last month, some villagers pelted the cats with stones to stop such attacks, The New Indian Express newspaper reported. Officials say they have been trying to raise awareness in the villages so that people adapt to living near the animals.\nTwenty cheetahs were relocated from South Africa and Namibia to the Kuno national park in the central state of Madhya Pradesh between 2022 and 2023 in what was the first such intercontinental translocation of the big cats.\nEight of them have since died due to various reasons, including kidney failure and mating injuries, sparking concerns about whether conditions at Kuno are suitable for them. \nIn 2023, South African and Namibian experts involved with the project wrote to India's Supreme Court, saying they believed that some of these deaths could have been prevented by \"better monitoring of animals and more appropriate and timely veterinary care\". \nExperts from the Namibia-based Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), which has been involved with the project since its inception, had also raised concerns about inadequate record-keeping at Kuno. They told the BBC that the park management had \"little or no scientific training\" and the vets were \"too inexperienced to manage a project of this calibre\".\nPark authorities have rejected the allegations and say there are now a total of 26 cheetahs, including 17 in the wild and nine others that are kept in enclosures at the moment.\nThis year, India is expected to receive 20 more cheetahs from South Africa. Officials say the big cats have already been identified by a task force in collaboration with South African authorities.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "For the first time in decades, Lyle and Erik Menendez say they are beginning to feel hope they could get parole. It is a shift in mindset for the brothers, who have spent more than 30 years behind bars for the murders of their parents in their Beverly Hills home.\n\"My brother and I are cautiously hopeful,\" Lyle Menendez, 57, said in a recent jailhouse interview with TMZ, which was aired on Fox.\n\"Hope for the future is really kind of a new thing for us. I think Erik would probably agree with that. It's not something we've spent a lot of time on,\" he added.\nThe Menendez brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in 1996 and sentenced to life without parole for the 1989 shotgun killings of their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez.\nThe case shocked the nation - not only for the brutal nature of the crime, but also for the courtroom drama that followed.\nTheir first trial ended in a hung jury after both brothers detailed years of sexual abuse they claimed to have suffered at the hands of their father, a high-powered music industry executive.\nBut prosecutors in the second trial cast doubt on those claims, arguing the brothers had acted out of greed and wanted to inherit their parents' wealth. The jury agreed, and the brothers were convicted and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\nOver the decades, the brothers have kept up their appeals - and recently learned that they would get a parole hearing after all.\nWith that hearing scheduled for June, and a resentencing hearing in the middle of April, the brothers are reflecting on how they will lead their lives if freed.\n\"What it is that I want to do in terms of my day-to-day life is much of what I'm doing in here. I want to be an advocate for people that are suffering in silence,\" 54-year-old Erik Menendez told TMZ.\n\"Lyle and I aren't talking about leaving prison - should we be able to get out - and not looking back. Our lives will be spent working with the prison and doing the work that we're doing in here, out there,\" he added.\nPart of the bid for parole hinges on a risk assessment that evaluates whether the brothers are still seen as threats to society.\nThe brothers say they have changed in prison.\n\"I'm striving to be a better person every day, and I want to be a person that my family can be proud of,\" said Erik Menendez. \"Who I've evolved into, who I've seen Lyle evolve into. I'm beginning to like myself, be proud of myself, and find it's okay to like myself.\"\nDuring their time in prison, both Erik and Lyle have started rehabilitation programs for disabled and elderly inmates and taught classes on trauma healing and meditation.\n\"Our best moments are the ones that are not spoken about, and we just help somebody, or we help an animal, or we make somebody smile that's feeling down that might have gone and harmed themselves if we weren't there,\" Erik said, speaking of their volunteer work in prison.\nDespite the upcoming parole hearing, the brothers' future - and the other possible paths to freedom - remain uncertain.\nLos Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman recently withdrew a motion for resentencing that had been filed under his predecessor, George Gasc\u00f3n, signalling a harder stance on the case.\nHochman has publicly said he will not support the brothers' release, though the final decision rests with a judge.\nThe move has stirred controversy with the DA's office as two former prosecutors who worked under Gasc\u00f3n and advocated for the brothers' resentencing, have filed a legal case against Hochman - accusing him of harassment, retaliation, and defamation. \nThe pair claim they were demoted because of their stance on the case - and have faced intense public scrutiny as a result. Mr Hochman's office is yet to comment.\nSome members of the Menendez family have also criticized Mr Hochman, suggesting he is letting personal bias influence his actions. Mr Hochman denies this.\n\"Hochman doesn't seem to want to listen or engage with us,\" the brothers' cousin Tamara Goodell told US media. Ms Goodell accused the prosecutor of dismissing and ignoring the family, and \"not acting like a neutral party\".\nBut public opinion remains divided.\nIn the same TMZ special, Alan Abrahamson, a former Los Angeles Times reporter who covered the Menendez trials in the 1990s, said the brothers are \"two of the most skilled and accomplished liars\".\n\"The Menendezes are very capable of shapeshifting, and being who people who want them to be,\" Mr Abrahamson said. \"And I think this is one of the grave dangers of this discussion that people don't seem to pick up on.\"\nThat is a thought shared by a former Beverly Hills detective who was assigned to investigate the murders at the time.\n\"This is the most heinous murder case I've had,\" Tom Linehan told TMZ. He believes the Menendez brothers were money-motivated killers who grew up getting exactly they wanted.\n\"If somebody is challenging what they want to do, they'd take them out if they had to,\" Linehan added.\nAs for the brothers, they have to hope the parole board sees things differently, so they will continue to fight their legal case.\n\"You never know how long you'll be blessed to be on the Earth, so we don't sit around waiting for something,\" Lyle said.",

        "article_text": "Jorgen Strand Larsen bundles in Wolves' late winner to push Ipswich closer to the drop\nIpswich are teetering on the brink. With seven games left and 12 points to make up on fourth-bottom Wolves, the battle to stay up looks over. \nJorgen Strand Larsen's scrappy 84th-minute goal settled a tense encounter between the two relegation rivals after Pablo Sarabia had cancelled out a Town opener from Liam Delap.\nDefeat pushed the Tractor Boys closer to the drop in a game they simply had to win. Their fairytale rise from League One to the top flight in successive seasons looks certain to end with an immediate return to the Championship. \nWolves' comeback success at Portman Road crucially stretched them further clear of the bottom three and even Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna conceded their fight for survival looks bleak.\n\"I think it's certainly more than likely on the balance of probabilities,\" he said when asked about the prospect of relegation. \"Not that I don't think we can't finish the season strongly, but Wolves are a strong side and the chance of them losing all their games is really low. \n\"The likelihood is we'll fall short of our ultimate dream.\"\nWhen Ipswich won 2-1 at Wolves in December through Jack Taylor's last-gasp header - which ended Gary O'Neil's managerial reign at Molineux - they moved three points above Wolves.\nTown were still third bottom at the time, but just a point behind Crystal Palace, while second-bottom Wolves were four adrift of safety.\nFast forward five months and defeat at Portman Road leaves them needing one of the greatest of escapes. \nThe biggest deficit overcome by a side to stay up after 30 matches of a Premier League season was West Ham United in 2006-07. \nAt that stage, Alan Curbishley's men were eight points from safety, having been 10 behind a match earlier. Ipswich have a game less and a bigger gap.\nBradford City, in 1999-2000, and Fulham, in 2007-08, came from six points behind to survive with just five matches left, but it seems fanciful for the Tractor Boys to think of achieving that.\nJust seven of their 20 points have been won in Suffolk this season, a huge Achilles heel for a newly promoted side. Just one victory - 2-0 against Chelsea in December - has been celebrated at Portman Road and they have now lost six successive home league games for only the second time in their history, matching a wretched run in 1963 when they went on to be relegated too.\nLeicester have won nine points at home, while bottom club Southampton's sorry season is epitomised by the five points they have earned at St Mary's and they will be relegated if they fail to win at Tottenham on Sunday. \n\"You can look at different games, Liverpool, Fulham, [Aston] Villa we started really well, then came up short in terms of trying to break teams down, like the Crystal Palace game,\" reflected McKenna. \n\"We have had a few high energy games and the other teams have punished us. Today it was a spirited and committed performance but not enough to win. We are talking about small sample sizes. \n\"It's strange not to have more wins at home than away. I don't think there's one outstanding reason. If there was, we would have found it and sorted it.\"\nIn contrast, Wolves have earned 10 points from their seven home games since Vitor Pereira replaced O'Neil in December. \nUnder the Portuguese, Wolves have won more points than the three promoted sides put together - 23 from 15 games, scoring 19 goals and conceding 19.\nThe bottom three have won 16 points from a combined 43 games in that time (Ipswich eight, Southampton five and Leicester three). \nNo side has dropped more points from winning positions in the top flight this season than Ipswich (25) and they have simply not been competitive enough.\nThey have led against Fulham (twice), Manchester City, Aston Villa,(twice), Brentford, Leicester, Bournemouth, Manchester United and now Wolves and failed to win. \nEven Liam Delap's 12 goals have been unable to help them bridge the gap at this level. He has scored 38.71% of Ipswich's 31 this season - only Alexander Isak (41%), Mohamed Salah (39%) and Erling Haaland (36.8%) have higher figures in this campaign.\n\"There will be plenty of time to talk about it, analyse it and reflect on the positives and negatives,\" added McKenna. \n\"We knew coming into this nine-game block the balance of probabilities was really small, but we committed as a group to show the right values and show full commitment. \n\"We have Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Arsenal here after that, Newcastle at St James' Park and Everton in one of the last games at Goodison. \n\"We have some fantastic fixtures coming up for a club who haven't been into the Premier League for 22 years. \n\"I know today is a big setback and it hurts, but I know the players and supporters and everyone are going to muster up the energy to compete as well as we can in the last few games.\" \nThis video can not be played\nIpswich \u2018sad\u2019 as relegation looms \u2013 McKenna",

        "article_text": "Ruben Vardanyan is one of Armenia's richest men, but his millions are of little use now that he is facing a possible life term in jail in neighbouring Azerbaijan.\nThe two neighbouring Caucasus countries have agreed the text of a historic peace deal to end decades long conflict over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, but Vardanyan and 15 other former ethnic Armenian leaders are not part of the agreement.\nThey are on trial in a military court in Baku, accused of war crimes dating back decades.\nVardanyan, a 56-year-old Russian-Armenian entrepreneur, is facing 42 charges including planning and waging war, mercenary activities and terrorism.\nA picture of him in court appeared to show bruises on his forehead and there have been allegations of torture, denied by Azerbaijan which insists his rights have been respected in custody.\nIt marks a dramatic downfall for a man who made his fortune in Russia and once rubbed shoulders with celebrities such as George and Amal Clooney.\nHe set up Russia's first investment bank back in the early 1990s, and as founder of the country's prestigious business management school \"Skolkovo\" he enjoyed the reputation of a progressive visionary, a Western-friendly voice in Russia's business community in the 2000's.\nBut a 2019 investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project said that employees of his investment bank built a financial system laundering billions of dollars in the mid-2000s.\nVardanyan denied being aware of any criminal activities, and was never legally charged.\nHe spent hundreds of millions of dollars on philanthropic projects in Armenia, and transformed a quiet town in the snow-capped mountains in the north of the country, setting up a school with the aim of attracting students from all over the world.\n\"This school was imagined as an institution that would bring Armenia to the world and the world to Armenia,\" says Adam Armanski, the principal of the United World Colleges (UWC) of Dilijan.\nEverything changed for Ruben Vardanyan in September 2022 when he decided to move to Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous region that was historically populated by ethnic Armenians but part of Soviet Azerbaijan.\nArmenia and Azerbaijan had already fought two full scale wars over the region, which was internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan.\nThe first Karabakh war in the 1990s resulted in the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Azeris.\nThen, in 2020, Azerbaijan - backed by Turkey - regained control of big swathes of the lost territory, while the Karabakh enclave remained in the hands of ethnic Armenian separatists.\nWithin months of Vardanyan's arrival Azerbaijani authorities blocked the only road connecting Nagorno-Karabakh with the Republic of Armenia, subjecting the region's population to severe food shortages.\nVardanyan renounced his Russian citizenship and became the de facto prime-minister of Nagorno-Karabakh, which Armenians call Artsakh. He used his name, contacts and the ability to speak fluent English to raise the awareness of the plight of Karabakh Armenians.\n\"My father did more interviews with international media in three months than all the other Nagorno-Karabakh presidents in 30 years.

Billionaire on trial in Azerbaijan who risks being left behind by peace deal2 hours agoShareSaveRayhan DemytrieBBC South Caucasus correspondentShareSaveAzertac TVImages of Vardanyan in court in Baku appeared to show bruising on his foreheadRuben Vardanyan is one of Armenia's richest men, but his millions are of little use now that he is facing a possible life term in jail in neighbouring Azerbaijan.The two neighbouring Caucasus countries have agreed the text of a historic peace deal to end decades long conflict over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, but Vardanyan and 15 other former ethnic Armenian leaders are not part of the agreement.They are on trial in a military court in Baku, accused of war crimes dating back decades.Vardanyan, a 56-year-old Russian-Armenian entrepreneur, is facing 42 charges including planning and waging war, mercenary activities and terrorism.A picture of him in court appeared to show bruises on his forehead and there have been allegations of torture, denied by Azerbaijan which insists his rights have been respected in custody.It marks a dramatic downfall for a man who made his fortune in Russia and once rubbed shoulders with celebrities such as George and Amal Clooney.He set up Russia's first investment bank back in the early 1990s, and as founder of the country's prestigious business management school \"Skolkovo\" he enjoyed the reputation of a progressive visionary, a Western-friendly voice in Russia's business community in the 2000's.But a 2019 investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project said that employees of his investment bank built a financial system laundering billions of dollars in the mid-2000s.Vardanyan denied being aware of any criminal activities, and was never legally charged.He spent hundreds of millions of dollars on philanthropic projects in Armenia, and transformed a quiet town in the snow-capped mountains in the north of the country, setting up a school with the aim of attracting students from all over the world. \"This school was imagined as an institution that would bring Armenia to the world and the world to Armenia,\" says Adam Armanski, the principal of the United World Colleges (UWC) of Dilijan.State Border Service of AzerbaijanVardanyan (C) was detained by Azerbaijan in September 2023 as he tried to leave for ArmeniaEverything changed for Ruben Vardanyan in September 2022 when he decided to move to Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous region that was historically populated by ethnic Armenians but part of Soviet Azerbaijan.Armenia and Azerbaijan had already fought two full scale wars over the region, which was internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan.The first Karabakh war in the 1990s resulted in the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Azeris.Then, in 2020, Azerbaijan - backed by Turkey - regained control of big swathes of the lost territory, while the Karabakh enclave remained in the hands of ethnic Armenian separatists.Within months of Vardanyan's arrival Azerbaijani authorities blocked the only road connecting Nagorno-Karabakh with the Republic of Armenia, subjecting the region's population to severe food shortages.Vardanyan renounced his Russian citizenship and became the de facto prime-minister of Nagorno-Karabakh, which Armenians call Artsakh. The amount of attention this was receiving from the Western media clearly irritated Azerbaijan,\" his son David Vardanyan told the BBC.There had been speculation that Vardanyan had moved there to avoid international sanctions imposed on Russia's billionaires with links to the Kremlin.The government in Baku considered his decision to take up the position as illegal.His son insists he was driven by the desire to help local Armenians. \"ReutersThe trials of Vardanyan and 15 other ex-Karabakh leaders have been denounced by critics as show trialsHis father's long-term friend Arman Jilavian said even the remotest of chances of helping ethnic Armenians remain in their ancestral land was enough for him.",

        "article_text": "Born in The Gambia to a Gambian father and Senegalese mother, Nicolas Jackson has risen from humble beginnings to become Chelsea's main striker\nNicolas Jackson's return from injury has been well timed for Chelsea, as the Blues look to land the Europa Conference League trophy and book a return to the Champions League for the first time since 2022-23.\nThe Senegalese has bagged nine goals in 26 games this season, turning himself into Enzo Maresca's first-choice striker following an up and down beginning to his Stamford Bridge career.\nNot that early starts have always been a problem.\n\"Sometimes we trained very early in the morning, especially when the sun was very hot,\" Pere Badara Sarr, the Casa Sports coach who discovered Jackson in Senegal, told BBC Sport Africa.\n\"He would say that once the rooster crowed, he'd be up and on his way to training.\"\nBorn in The Gambia, Jackson moved to Senegal aged 12, relocating to Ziguinchor, a village some 273 miles (440km) and a nine-hour car journey from the capital Dakar.\nWhile honing his skills playing with friends behind his house - sometimes barefoot - for more than two hours a day after school, Jackson would keep an ear out for visiting scouts or indications of organised trials.\n\"It was easy to pick him for a number of reasons, but mainly because of his style of play,\" Sarr added, having spotted Jackson at a national competition involving 8,000 young hopefuls.\n\"He had this unique pull on his team-mates that really made him stand out. They called him Neymar.\"\nZiguinchor is situated on the Casamance River in southern Senegal\nThe comparisons to Brazil's all-time top scorer may not have stuck, but Jackson has shown dedication worthy of top professionals.\n\"He lived with his mother, cousins and uncles, which kept him grounded,\" Sarr said.\n\"I can't remember him ever being late for training.\"\nFrom Casa Sports, Jackson's application earned him a move to La Liga club Villarreal aged 18.\n\"He told [his family] he wouldn't come back until he made it,\" Birane Hady Cisse, the sports editor at Senegalese news agency 373/500, told BBC Sport Africa.\n\"He's undoubtedly one of the top players we have now.\"\nDiomansy Kamara, who won a half-century of caps for Senegal, was instrumental in that transfer to Spain, with Cisse claiming the former Fulham and West Brom forward's guidance has been crucial.\n\"He understood how things worked in Europe and picked the best place for Jackson to develop, without focusing too much on where he could make money right away.\"\nJackson failed to find the net in his first 10 games for Villarreal's first team\nYet Jackson's European dream looked on shaky ground, as he alternated between Villarreal's youth and B teams while adapting to his new surroundings.\n\"When he came he was shy and looked raw,\" Javier Sidro, who covers the Yellow Submarine as the head of sports at Radio Castellon Cadena SER, told the BBC.\n\"But he paid attention and was always willing to improve.\"\nSecond-tier outfit Mirandes turned down the chance to sign Jackson permanently after just one goal in 17 outings on loan.\nBut such things can be a blessing in disguise, and Jackson returned to Villarreal knowing it was make or break.\nHe was eventually handed his first-team debut by Unai Emery as a late substitute against Real Betis in October 2021.\n\"In the weeks leading up to that, Emery had been preparing him as he liked his movement and saw the potential for greatness,\" Sidro revealed.\n\"It was interesting to keep an eye on him. He was capable of generating chances and looked really strong, but there was work to be done on his finishing.\"\nJackson was consigned to fleeting appearances from the bench for the rest of the season, with injuries also restricting his progress.\nJackson won his first cap for Senegal at the 2022 Fifa World Cup when he appeared against the Netherlands\nHe began the next campaign strongly, netting on his first La Liga start, but Emery's work to fully integrate him into the side ended when he left for Aston Villa in October 2022.\n\"Quique Setien replaced Emery and he saw something in Jackson too - a player who was clearly talented but hadn't yet reached his potential,\" Sidro said.\nJackson made his senior debut for Senegal at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and Premier League clubs were starting to take notice.\nBournemouth agreed a fee of more than \u00a320m ($25.9m) to sign him in January 2023 but injury meant the deal fell through - with the Cherries snapping up Ghana forward Antoine Semenyo from Bristol City instead.\nOnce again, a failed transfer brought the best out of the Senegalese in the second half of that season.\n\"Jackson exploded, not instantly, but gradually,\" Sidro explained. \"Once he started, he was really unstoppable.\"\nNine goals in the final eight games of the La Liga campaign helped Villarreal finish fifth and qualify for the Europa League.\nChelsea, who at the time were changing their model to target young players, secured his services in June 2023, handing Jackson an eight-year contract.\nJackson's undulating career at Chelsea has seen him look like a world-beater in some games while showing naivety in others.\nHowever, he netted 14 league goals in his debut campaign and former Senegal striker Demba Ba, who spent 18 months with the Blues, thinks there is no doubt that Jackson will be a long-term success in west London.\n\"At Villarreal he was really good at making that final turn, and he'll be great at Chelsea,\" Ba said.\n\"He just needs to keep working hard and remember that he has to score goals.\"\nCould this season's run-in provide Jackson with the stage to prove that he is the real deal?\nShould he lead the Blues to a top-four finish, or score the goals that clinch a first trophy since 2021, then the boy from Ziguinchor may finally silence his doubters.",

Its rules also state a club is \"likely\" to face disciplinary actions if there is \"sufficient evidence of mass discriminatory chanting\".\nIn recent years the FA has cracked down on tragedy chanting and racist and homophobic chanting.\nClubs have been fined, and some fans have been given banning orders and have faced criminal charges.\nIn 2023 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) updated its guidance on football-related offences, confirming that tragedy chanting can be prosecuted, external as a public order offence.\nThe guidance also includes reference to other hate crimes, such as homophobic or racist chanting or gestures, and pitch incursion.\nThe FA does not currently take action on all offensive chants. It did not charge Millwall after some fans chanted \"let him die\" at Crystal Palace forward Jean-Philippe Mateta when he was treated for a head injury on the pitch during a fifth-round FA Cup match last month.\nThe FA condemned those chants but said they did not breach its regulations.\nJamie Vardy's wife Rebekah was the subject of offensive chants in the wake of the high-profile 'Wagatha Christie' trial, while Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes was recently the target of insults relating to his appearance.\nThere is a feeling that if the FA took action every time there was a distasteful song they would be charging a club virtually every game.\nEach case is assessed on its own merit, but the perception is the case has to be extreme for an FA charge to be brought as chances of success are slim.\nIn this instance, it is understood the chants about Foden's mum would be deemed discriminatory according to the FA rulebook if they had been directed at a female player, but as they were aimed at a non-participant in the game the rule does not apply. \nUnited declined to comment publicly on the chants but have privately acknowledged they are unacceptable.\n\"Clubs have the power to act,\" said Varney. \"Whether through bans, fines or education, action can and should be taken.\n\"Without it, the lack of accountability continues to damage trust. \n\"Our recent research found that 85% of women who had experienced or witnessed sexism in a football setting didn't report it because they didn't think it would make a difference, or they would be listened to.\"\nHowever, some believe that offensive chants are \"part of the game\".\n\"It's part of the game unfortunately, it is what it is. I've heard people say things about my kids, my wife, you name it,\" former Watford striker Troy Deeney said on talkSPORT.\n\"I take Pep's point, but it's a derby, people are emotional, it's part of football. We shouldn't accept it, but it's been going on since the beginning of time.\n\"Gianfranco Zola once said to me: 'We're paid to not have feelings'.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

He also took home the under-16 rail jam trophy and the under-12 snowboard cross title.\nThe last person under 12 to win a main title? That was Brookes, back in 2018, when she was 11. Still a teenager, she has gone on to become world champion, an X Games gold medallist and a World Cup overall crystal globe winner.\nThe Brits were being held in Mayrhofen, Austria, after a six-year hiatus for the full event because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nHis father James told BBC Sport: \"Riley amazes us every day with his hard work and dedication and it's great to see all that hard work pay off for him.\n\"Thank you to the Brits for putting on the competition to enable the best talent in the UK to showcase themselves. We can't wait to see how Riley progresses in the sport.\"\nRiley Sharpe (centre) with mum Jennifer and dad James\nSharpe has been snowboarding since the age of two - his ability soon became so evident that the family were advised to allow him to snowboard for a full season, rather than a week's holiday a year.\n\"We were told he had a gift and to give him a chance,\" James said, so they made the decision to support him and moved the family to France for the winter.\n\"He excelled faster than anyone expected. He is obsessed with it,\" James added.\nHe competed on the Swiss tour aged eight and won every competition in the under-11s category against other international snowboarders. This season, Sharpe claimed the under-12 title at the World Rookie Tour finals in Kaprun and is leading the Ziller Valley Rally - also in Austria - with one event to go.\nJohn Weatherley, who coaches him alongside Barry Parker, said: \"You can tell he's special. He's got a lot of style and is like a sponge when he's learning anything new.\"\nTo aid his training, the family are building a rail park at their property in the French ski resort of Avoriaz and split the winter season between France and the United States, where mum Jennifer was born.\n\"We were just casual snowboarders,\" Jennifer said. \"Now we chase the snow across the world!\" \nIn the summer months, the family are back in Nantwich in Cheshire and Sharpe trains at the Chill Factore in Manchester and Tamworth Snowdome.\nBrookes and her family live 10 miles away and Mia's mum Vicky has been advising the Sharpes on the number of competitions he should enter at his age - as well as keeping snowboarding fun.\nSharpe and Brookes, 18, have ridden together a number of times. Jennifer said: \"She's really good with him and understands because she's been on the same journey.\"\nAlthough Sharpe is eager to progress to major competitions as soon as possible, he will have to wait until he is 15 for World Cup events, and 16 for the Winter Olympics, which would mean being eligible for the 2034 Games.\nThere is no minimum age for the X Games, however, which is by invitation.\n\"Nothing scares me,\" Sharpe said. \"I can't wait for next season already. I want to keep pushing and showing what I can do.\"  \nSharpe competing in the rail-jam at the Brits, in Mayrhofen, Austria\nTeenager Brookes wins World Cup snowboard title for GB\nGB's Atkin wins women's world freeski halfpipe gold",

Yes, use it to motivate you.

It's just impossible.\n\"I'm a mum. I'm trying to work at the same time. I've got two young kids.

In fact, if I see a male and they're like 'reset with me', I'm locked in.\n\"I love the fact that it is still predominantly female, but a lot of men are getting into it now as well.\"\nDr Stephanie Alice Baker, an associate professor in sociology at City St George's University of London, said cleaning was a role that women had \"typically\" occupied.\nShe said creating social media content based upon cleaning therefore offered \"a sense of control\".\n\"They can monetise something they'd traditionally have completed as unpaid labour.\"\nDr Baker said that while lifestyle content was increasing in popularity, audience interest was not new.\n\"This type of content existed before social media, it's just that social media makes it a lot more accessible,\" she said.\n\"The mediums and the audiences have changed but the concerns around self-improvement have existed over generations.\"\nDr Ceri Bradshaw, a psychologist at Swansea University, said there was a risk that people could be \"easily tricked\" by snappy, 60-second cleaning videos that in reality take hours of physical work.\n\"I think we're also easily tricked into thinking that we should be more like the people that we watch,\" she added.\nBut Dr Bradshaw said she understood the appeal of watching cleaning content.\n\"With the cleaning, you're effectively sort of fixing something that needs fixing and it's happening very, very quickly.\n\"It's quite soothing to the brain.\"",

They were not uncovered until a week after the incident because international agencies, including the UN, could not organise safe passage to the area or locate the spot.When an aid team found the bodies they also discovered Refat Radwan's mobile phone containing footage of the incident.The Israeli military official denied any of the medics were handcuffed before they died and said they were not executed at close range, as some reports had suggested.Earlier this week, a surviving paramedic told the BBC the ambulances had their lights on and denied his colleagues were linked with any militant group.The IDF promised a \"thorough examination\" of the incident, saying it would \"understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation\".The Red Crescent and many other international organisations are calling for an independent investigation.Israel renewed its aerial bombardment and ground offensive in Gaza on 18 March after the first phase of a ceasefire deal came to an end and negotiations on a second phase stalled.More than 1,200 people have since been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.More than 50,600 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.Video footage appears to contradict Israeli account of Gaza medic killingsRed Cross outraged over killing of medics by Israeli forces in GazaUS says law applies to 'all parties' in Gaza after Israel kills medicsMiddle EastIsrael & the PalestiniansIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestinian territoriesHamas",

The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.\nThe immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.\nBut sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.\nThe new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.\n\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.\n\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"\nThe scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg.

        "article_text": "In 1966, the remote Spanish village of Palomares found that the \"nuclear age had fallen on them from a clear blue sky\". Two years after the terrifying accident, BBC reporter Chris Brasher went to find what happened when the US lost a hydrogen bomb.\nOn 7 April 1966, almost 60 years ago this week, a missing nuclear weapon for which the US military had been desperately searching for 80 days was finally found. The warhead, with an explosive power 100 times that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, was carefully winched from a depth of 2,850ft (869m) out of the Mediterranean Sea and delicately lowered onto the USS Petrel. Once it was on board, officers painstakingly cut into the thermonuclear device's casing to disarm it. It was only then that everyone could breathe a sigh of relief \u2013 the last of the four hydrogen bombs that the US had accidentally dropped on Spain had been recovered.\n\"This was not the first accident involving nuclear weapons,\" said BBC reporter Chris Brasher when he reported from the scene in 1968. \"The Pentagon lists at least nine previous accidents to aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs. But this was the first accident on foreign soil, the first to involve civilians and the first to excite the attention of the world.\"\nThis terrifying situation had come about because of a US operation code-named Chrome Dome. At the beginning of the 1960s, the US had developed a project to deter its Cold War rival, the Soviet Union, from launching a pre-emptive strike. A patrol of nuclear-armed B-52 bombers would continuously criss-cross the skies, primed to attack Moscow at a moment's notice. But to stay airborne on these long looping routes, the planes needed to refuel while in flight.\nOn 17 January 1966, one such bomber was flying at a height of 31,000ft (9.5km) over the Almer\u00eda region of southern Spain, and attempted a routine air-to-air refuelling with a KC-135 tanker plane. \"I believe what happened was the bomber was closing at a too-high rate of closure speed and he didn't stabilise his position,\" US Maj Gen Delmar Wilson, the man in charge of dealing with the catastrophic accident, told Brasher, \"with the result that they got too close and collided.\"\nThe B-52 bomber's impact with the refuelling plane tore it open, igniting the jet fuel the KC-135 was carrying and killing all four of the crew onboard. The ensuing explosion also killed two men in the B-52's tail section. A third managed to eject, but died when his parachute did not open. The other four members of the bomber's crew successfully bailed out of their burning plane before it broke apart and fell to earth, raining down both flaming aircraft fragments and its lethal thermonuclear cargo onto the remote Spanish village of Palomares.\nThe huge fireball was seen a mile away. Thankfully, it did not trigger a nuclear explosion. The bomber's warheads were not armed and had built-in safeguards to prevent an unintended atomic chain reaction. But the thermonuclear devices did have explosives surrounding their plutonium cores as part of the triggering mechanism. In the event of an accident, the bombs had parachutes attached to them designed to cushion the impact on landing and prevent radioactive contamination. And indeed, one undetonated bomb did land safely in a riverbed and was recovered intact the following day. Unfortunately, two of the plummeting nuclear bombs' parachutes failed to open.\nThat morning, Spanish farmer Pedro Alarc\u00f3n was walking to his house with his grandchildren when one of the nuclear bombs landed in his tomato field and blew apart on impact. \"We were blown flat. The children started to cry. I was paralysed with fear. A stone hit me in the stomach, I thought I'd been killed. I lay there feeling like death with the children crying,\" he told the BBC in 1968.\nThe other hydrogen bomb also exploded when it hit the ground near a cemetery. These dual blasts created vast craters and scattered highly toxic, radioactive plutonium dust across several hundred acres. Burning aircraft debris also showered the Spanish village. \"I was crying and running about,\" a villager called Se\u00f1ora Flores told the BBC in 1968. \"My little girl was crying, 'Mama, Mama, look at our house, it is burning.' Because of all the smoke I thought what she said must be true. There were a lot of stones and debris falling around us. I thought it would hit us. It was this terrific explosion. We thought it was the end of the world.\"\nOnce the news that the bomber had come down with nuclear weapons aboard reached US military command, a huge operation was launched. At the time of the disaster, Capt Joe Ramirez was an US Air Force lawyer stationed in Madrid. \"There were a lot of people talking, there was a lot of excitement in the conference room. Everyone kept talking about a 'broken arrow'. I learnt then that 'broken arrow' was the code word for a nuclear accident,\" he told BBC's Witness History in 2011.\nUS military personnel were scrambled to the area by helicopter. When Capt Ramirez arrived in Palomares, he immediately saw the devastation and chaos wrought by the accident. Huge pieces of smoking wreckage were strewn all over the area \u2013 a large part of the burning B-52 bomber had landed in the school's yard. \"It's a small village but there were people scrambling in different directions. I could see smouldering debris, I could see some fires.\"\nIN HISTORY\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\u00a0\nDespite the carnage, miraculously no one in the village was killed. \"Nearly 100 tonnes of flaming debris had fallen on the village but not even a chicken had died,\" said Brasher. A local school teacher and doctor climbed up to the fire-scarred hillside to retrieve the remains of the US airmen who had been killed. \"Later still, they sorted the pieces and the limbs into five coffins, an act that was to cause a certain amount of bureaucratic difficulty when the Americans came to claim only four bodies from that hillside,\" said Brasher.\nThree of the B-52 crew who managed to eject landed in the Mediterranean several miles off the coast and were rescued by local fishing boats within an hour of the accident. The fourth, the B-52 radar-navigator, ejected through the plane's explosion, which left him badly burned, and was unable to separate himself from his ejection seat. Despite this, he managed to open his parachute and was found alive near the village and taken to hospital.\nHowever, this still left the problem of locating the plane's deadly nuclear payload. \"My main concern was to recover those bombs, that was number-one priority,\" Gen Wilson told the BBC in 1968.\n\"The first night, the Guardia Civil [the Spanish national police force] had come to the little bar in Palomares, and that was about the only place that had electricity. And they had reported what they considered to be a bomb, so we immediately despatched some of our people to this riverbed which is not far from the centre of town, and, in fact, it was a bomb, so we placed a guard on that. And then the next morning, at first daylight, we started conducting our search, and I believe it was something in the order of 10am or 11am the following morning, we located two other bombs.\"\nThis accounted for three of the nuclear bombs, but there was still one missing. By the next day, trucks filled with US troops had been sent from nearby bases, with the beach in Palomares becoming a base for some 700 US airmen and scientists urgently trying to contain any radioactive contamination and locate the fourth warhead.\n\"The first thing that you could see as the search really got underway in earnest was Air Force personnel linking up hand-by-hand and 40 or 50 people in a line. They would have designated search areas. There were some people with Geiger counters who started arriving, and so they started marking off the areas which were contaminated,\" said Capt Ramirez in 2011. When US personnel registered an area contaminated with radiation, they would scrape up the first three inches of topsoil and seal it in barrels to be shipped back to the US. Some 1,400 tonnes of irradiated soil ended up being sent to a storage facility in South Carolina.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How a US general nearly started a nuclear war in 1950\n\u2022 The greatest sailing rescue ever made\n\u2022 How Russia launched a giant space mirror in 1993\nBoth the US and Spain, which at the time was under the brutal rule of Francisco Franco's military dictatorship, were keen to downplay the devastating accident. Franco was especially worried that radiation fears would hurt Spain's tourism industry, a major source of revenue for his regime. In an effort to reassure the local population and the wider world that there was no danger, the US Ambassador to Spain, Angier Biddle Duke, would end up taking a swim in the sea off Palomares coast in front of the international press just weeks after the accident.\nBut despite hundreds of US personnel conducting an intensive and meticulous search of the surrounding area for a week, they still couldn't find the fourth bomb. Then Capt Ramirez spoke to a local fisherman who had helped rescue some of the surviving airmen who had splashed down in the sea. The fisherman kept apologising to Capt Ramirez for not being able to save one of the US flyers, whom he thought he had witnessed drifting down into the depths.\u00a0\nCapt Ramirez realised that the fisherman could have actually seen the missing nuclear bomb. \"All the bodies had been accounted for, I knew that,\" he said. The search then quickly shifted to the Mediterranean Sea, with the US Navy mobilising a flotilla of more than 30 ships, including mine-sweepers and submersibles, to scour the seabed. The exploration of miles of ocean floor was both technically complicated and a very slow process, but after weeks of exhaustive searching, a newly developed deep-diving vessel, Alvin, finally located the missing bomb in an underwater trench.\nNearly four months after it was first lost, the warhead was finally made safe and back in US hands. The next day, despite the secrecy with which the US military had surrounding its nuclear arsenal, it took the unusual step of showing the bomb to the world's press. Ambassador Duke reasoned that unless people saw the bomb for themselves, they would never feel certain that it had actually been recovered.\nAlmost six decades later, the incident still casts a long shadow over the Almer\u00eda region. The US clean-up operation managed to miss some areas of contamination, and the US and Spain agreed to fund yearly health-checks for Palomares residents. They also promised to monitor the soil, the water, the air and local crops. But there are still some 100 acres (40 hectares) of contaminated land in Palomares that remain fenced off. And despite Spain and the US signing a mutual agreement in 2015 to clean up the area, neither has yet complied.\u00a0\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Take a four-hour slow train through the Eastern Ghats to discover how a remote hill station is changing the global coffee game.\nEven in December, early mornings are rarely pleasant on much of India's Andhra Pradesh coast. The air is already muggy by 06:30 as a crowd mills restlessly on platform five at Visakhapatnam (Vizag) railway station. However, these would-be passengers are no ordinary commuters, but travellers gathered for an experience. When the Visakhapatnam Kirandul Passenger Special rolls onto the platform, the crowd's relief is palpable; the two vistadome coaches at the back of the train that they've been anxiously waiting to board are air-conditioned.\u00a0\nIndians have only a nodding acquaintance with the concept of queues, so a mad scramble ensues as the train comes to a halt. Things settle down as it chugs out of the station and gradually picks up speed. The Visakhapatnam Kirandul Passenger Special also serves as a regular commuter service headed to the town of Kirandul in Chhattisgarh state, about 400km to the north-west, and takes about 14 hours to traverse the distance. But those in the vistadome coaches are interested only in the first leg, to Araku Valley. This serene hill station is about 120km away but takes four hours as the train winds its way through a whopping 58 tunnels cut through the Eastern Ghats. The two vistadome coaches \u2013 with their extra-large windows and rotatable seats \u2013 are designed to provide panoramic views of the area's mountain peaks and valleys and its gentle forested slopes that end in rushing rivers and streams, gorges and rocky promontories.\nAs the train whizzes past Vizag's neighbourhoods and suburbs, it provides snapshots of a city waking up: a vegetable vendor hauling their cart, a dog walker pulled by his dog, two bleary-eyed uniformed children clutching onto their father on a scooter to school. As the city segues into wide open fields and farmlands, the images change: smoke curls lazily into the sky from a lone thatched house in the middle of a farm, a diligent farmer urges on his oxen, a tractor hauls vegetables to the nearby market. The rhythmic clickety-clack of the train's wheels is familiar and soporific.\u00a0\u00a0\nLess than 30 minutes after leaving Vizag, the train slows considerably and begins ascending into the foothills of the Eastern Ghats. As if on cue, most seats in the coach swing to face the windows. The train climbs, plains fall away and even the sporadic habitations clinging to the peaks vanish. Hills and mountains in the distance appear blue-grey in the tender morning sun. But even before this panorama can register, complete darkness descends as the train enters the route's first tunnel. I'm startled by the sounds of adults and children screaming, in jest of course, for the few minutes it takes for us to come out the other side.\nWhen we emerge into daylight, the sight is jaw-dropping: a series of hillocks and gentle valleys, thickly forested, stretch out to the horizon where a haze-shrouded mountain range is just a hint of the soaring peaks to come. As I try to take in as much of the scene as possible, darkness descends again, and with it, more screaming.\nOn the other side is another surreal and dramatic sight: tracks bent around a hill, a green wall sloping straight up on one side, and a sheer drop on the other. The train slowly chugs forward, hugging the inner curve. The vistadomes' rear position means that the entire length of the train is visible, curling against the hill as if teetering on the edge. It then uncoils and wraps itself on the other side, trundling on a bridge built over a stream that gently flows several metres below. The bridge has no continuous guardrails, so, for a moment, it feels like the train is suspended in the air. But soon, the feeling is interrupted by darkness and more screaming, and another breathtaking view on the other side.\nTrain Journeys\nTrain Journeys is a BBC Travel series that celebrates the world's most interesting train rides and inspires readers to travel overland.\nThis sequence repeats over and over again and yet it never gets predictable or boring. Each of the route's 58 tunnels sets up anticipation for what might lay on the other side. Thick curtains of mist clinging to mountainsides or low-hanging clouds cloaking the peaks; rolling grasslands and forests spread out like someone had shaken out a giant green blanket and laid it down; deep valleys and gorges surrounded by undulating peaks; and fleeting glimpses of hamlets and habitations perched precariously on the hillsides.\u00a0\nWe stop every few minutes to drop and pick up commuters at musical-sounding stations that could be tongue-twisters to those unfamiliar: Pendurthi, Kottavalasa, Chimidipalli, Borraguhallu, Karakavalasa. At Shimiliguda, the station proudly wears its altitude on its sleeve: 996m above sea level. Throughout the journey, there is also a continuous parade of food vendors, delectable aromas wafting from their baskets as they sell idli-vada-chutney (a common breakfast of steamed rice cake with coconut chutney), samosa, savoury puffed rice and boiled peanuts.\nWhen the train finally rolls into Araku town, the station is crowded and noisy and the magic of the journey dissipates somewhat. But early next morning, Araku's appeal is on full display. A short walk leads to forests and coffee plantations speckled with tall silver oak trees, their trunks wrapped by pepper vines. Everything is covered in thick fog and the air is nippy, a far cry from Vizag's mugginess. The air is sappy and thick with terpenes. I catch faint whiffs of coffee and pepper.\nCoffee came to Araku with the British and was grown in scattered patches of plantations. Like other coffee-growing regions in India, Araku was an ideal location owing to its combination of soil, altitude and weather. After independence from British rule in 1947, the land passed into local government hands, but decades of underdevelopment and sporadic insurgency kept the region off most investment maps. That began to change in the early 2000s.\u00a0\n\"The local community wanted progress,\" says Manoj Kumar, CEO of the Naandi Foundation, a non-profit that works with farmers through community initiatives and sustainable models. \"So we looked around and thought since coffee was already growing in pockets, it could be expanded.\"\nWorking with local farmers, the organisation began establishing micro-plots of Arabica coffee using regenerative agriculture. What began at around 1,000 acres in 2002 currently stands at 100,000 acres farmed by more than 90,000 families, who each own about an acre on average. Besides coffee, farmers have been encouraged to multi-crop and now produce pepper, red kidney beans, ginger, turmeric, millets, rice, vegetables, fruits such as chikoo (sapodilla), mango, custard apple and avocado.\u00a0The result: a unique fair-trade coffee model known as Arakunomics, which won the Rockefeller Foundation's Food System Vision 2050 Prize in 2020.\nBut the foundation didn't stop there. In a first for Indian coffee, they \"terroir-mapped\" the beans \u2013 borrowing a concept from winemaking \u2013\u00a0and classified the end product into six distinct flavour profiles under the brand name ARAKU. Selective harvesting, sustainable practices and meticulous post-harvest processes have helped the beans consistently score 91/100 on specialty coffee rankings.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How the bullet train transformed Japan\n\u2022 Malaysia's iconic 'Jungle Railway'\n\u2022 The Baltic Express: Central Europe's new hop-on hop-off train\n\"We grow about 2,000 metric tons of coffee, 98% of which is sourced by specialty coffee promoters across the world,\" Kumar says.\nTravellers can explore this story at various coffee holdings in the area, but Priya Rajagopal, a coffee enthusiast and former project manager in tech, recommends the Sunkarametta Coffee Plantation, about 13km south-east of Araku, where a wooden bridge runs for a few hundred metres through the plantation, suspended above the coffee plants and flanked by towering silver oaks. \"When I went, it was the flowering season (March to May) and the plants were full of white flowers, \" she says. \"The air is filled with a sweet, jasmine-like smell.\"\nA short distance away, the modest but informative Araku Coffee Museum offers a primer on the journey from seed to cup. The small adjacent caf\u00e9 serves a robust filter brew \u2013 earthy, rich and perfect for a chilly morning in the hills.\u00a0\nA few days after the train trip, back in Bengaluru, I head to the sole ARAKU cafe in India (most of their production is either exported, retailed in stores or available online), which is tucked away in the tree-lined avenues of the city's Indiranagar neighbourhood. I am torn between the various options but opt for their signature medium roast. It is beautifully rich red-brown and utterly mellow on the tongue. More importantly, a subtle peppery end note immediately transports me back to Araku\u2019s mist-covered winding lanes, the lush green forests and plantations \u2013 and the slow, soulful train ride that led me there.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "In This City Is Ours, Liverpool actor James Nelson-Joyce plays a leading gang member who is struggling to balance his criminal career and family life, against a backdrop of changing modern masculinity.\nSo it's not hard to see why the new BBC drama has been dubbed by reviewers as the \"Scouse Sopranos\" - with reference to the acclaimed US mafia boss Tony and his equally conflicting set-up.\nNelson-Joyce plays the notorious Michael Kavanagh, who works for drug lord and lifelong friend Ronnie Phelan, played by Sean Bean. And the plot focuses on the power struggle between Michael and Ronnie's son Jamie - played by Nelson-Joyce's real life football friend and fellow Scouser Jack McMullen - as to who will take over the business when the top dog retires to Spain, via the Wirral.\nInconveniently though, Michael falls in love with Diana (Hannah Onslow). The couple are trying for a baby but due to his low sperm count need to try IVF to start a family.\nIt's not an ideal environment for domestic bliss to blossom - or good for Michael's street cred - but it does provide the scene for the 36-year-old actor's \"most amazing\" TV experience to date. \n\"It's about Michael allowing himself to be vulnerable,\" Nelson-Joyce tells BBC News.\n\"Because a lot of men put up this brave wall where it's like, I can't be seen to be that person,\" he adds. \"It's took Diana to be that breath of fresh air in his life.\" \nHe believes it is important to show on screen how \"we are allowed to change\".\n\"Because Michael's identity throughout has been as Ronnie's right-hand man, so he's always been the one you don't mess with.\n\"Whereas for the first time in his life, he's allowing himself to be who he wants to be; this loving partner who's reliable, who's safe and who doesn't lie to his partner.\"\nThe rising star, who has been mentioned as potential future James Bond, previously appeared opposite Sheffield actor Bean in another Merseyside crime drama, Time.\nAnd he has featured alongside another Liverpudlian, Stephen Graham, in Time, Little Boy Blue, and the recent historical drama A Thousand Blows.\nHe says his latest character's respect for his partner in crime, Ronnie, was a mirror of his real life working relationship with Bean, who he describes as \"a gift\" of a co-star and a \"kind human being\".\nGraham is \"so supportive\" of Nelson-Joyce's career too. The former's own headline-grabbing new show, Adolescence, also tackles toxic masculinity and its potentially deadly effects.\nThis City is Ours' Bafta-winning director Saul Dibb (The Sixth Commandment) notes how Nelson-Joyce has played \"hard men\" roles before but has not been able to demonstrate \"all of the other qualities\" he possesses, until now.\nThe Telegraph has awarded the show five stars, calling it a \"superb crime thriller of betrayals and shifting loyalties\". Critic Anita Singh noted that it \"doesn't quite live up to\" the Sopranos \"but it comes close\".\nIn a four-star review, the Independent said Nelson-Joyce's \"conflicted gangster\" and the show's \"moral ambivalence\" elevated it \"above the average boilerplate crime drama\".\nThe Guardian's Lucy Mangan awarded three stars, however, suggesting \"the fantastic performances don't do enough to lift this Scouse Sopranos.\"\nBut the Sunday Times' Carol Midgley offered another four-star review, saying it \"is as much about family dynamics and the human condition as it is about gangsters and violence\".\nThe show's creator and writer Stephen Butchard (The Last Kingdom) tells us he is \"happy\" with comparisons to the \"brilliant\" New Jersey-based crime show \"because that really is about a family\".\n\"We haven't got as many cured meats,\" he jokes, of Mr Soprano's favourite food.\nAnother reference point was Shakespeare, he explains, to \"explore those huge human emotions of your ambition and greed and love and betrayal.\"\n\"Once greed and secrets take hold, the fabric of any society, including a family, begins to fray,\" he adds.\nFormer engineer Butchard was keen to capture the \"vibrancy\" of his native Liverpool, which he describes as a \"really handsome\" and \"friendly\" modern world city.\nBeautiful vistas of the city's skyline and glamorous waterfront are juxtaposed with life on its streets (along with shots of the gang's dealings in sunny Marbella and Malaga).\n\"I didn't want to show a Liverpool that has been seen previously on the television,\" he says.\n\"Because this story could be told in any city around the world, but then it's only when you come to the characters that you can give them that Liverpool inflection, bite and hopefully humour, and reflect the mood of the city.\"\nHe says he was was impressed with the \"wonderful\" Scouse accents perfected by the non-local members of the extended fictional crime family, including Onslow, Julie Graham and Laura Aikman, as well as Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson.\nAs for genuine Scouser Nelson-Joyce, just when he thought he was out, the producers may have pulled him back in for a second series.\n\"We want to do a season two\" says the star.\n\"It would be mad if there wasn't\" offers Dibb.\nBoth underline the overwhemingly positive responses they've received, particularly from viewers with purple bins.\n\"Because they're the people who know if we've got all the details right,\" says the London director, adding that Liverpudlians would \"not hold back\" in saying so if not.\nHe recounts how a train conductor told actor Michael Noble - who plays Michael's confidant/enforcer, Banksey - that they had \"done they city proud\".\nThe reaction has been \"really lovely\" and \"a bit crazy\" adds Nelson-Joyce.\n\"It feels like the whole city loves it,\" he says. \"I think people really bought the relationship between me and Hannah and really wanted us to work.\"\nHis celebrity pal, ex-Liverpool footballer Jamie Carragher told him personally last week that he thought the show was \"[expletive] brilliant\".\nTony Soprano could not have put it better himself.\nThis City Is Ours airs on BBC One on Sundays at 21:00 BST.

This City is Ours: James Nelson-Joyce on the 'Scouse Sopranos'14 hours agoShareSavePaul GlynnEntertainment reporterShareSaveBBCJames Nelson-Joyce stars as the notorious fictional gangster Michael KavanaghIn This City Is Ours, Liverpool actor James Nelson-Joyce plays a leading gang member who is struggling to balance his criminal career and family life, against a backdrop of changing modern masculinity.So it's not hard to see why the new BBC drama has been dubbed by reviewers as the \"Scouse Sopranos\" - with reference to the acclaimed US mafia boss Tony and his equally conflicting set-up.Nelson-Joyce plays the notorious Michael Kavanagh, who works for drug lord and lifelong friend Ronnie Phelan, played by Sean Bean. \"But the Sunday Times' Carol Midgley offered another four-star review, saying it \"is as much about family dynamics and the human condition as it is about gangsters and violence\".The star said the \"amazing\" cast and crew \"were like one big family\" on setThe show's creator and writer Stephen Butchard (The Last Kingdom) tells us he is \"happy\" with comparisons to the \"brilliant\" New Jersey-based crime show \"because that really is about a family\". \"Because they're the people who know if we've got all the details right,\" says the London director, adding that Liverpudlians would \"not hold back\" in saying so if not.He recounts how a train conductor told actor Michael Noble - who plays Michael's confidant/enforcer, Banksey - that they had \"done they city proud\".The reaction has been \"really lovely\" and \"a bit crazy\" adds Nelson-Joyce. \"I didn't want to show a Liverpool that has been seen previously on the television,\" he says.",

Accepting the award, director Jordan Fein said: \"There was a question as to whether a new production of Fiddler on the Roof was appropriate for this moment.\n\"It's a musical about love, not in the romantic abstract sense, but active love, brave and rebellious love that demands empathy and compassion, and that seems to be what we desperately need right now.\"\nBest new musical - The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button  \nBest revival - Oedipus (Wyndham's Theatre production)\nBest musical revival - Fiddler On The Roof\nBest new play - Giant\nBest new entertainment or comedy play - Titanique \nBest new opera production - Festen\nBest actor - John Lithgow for Giant\nBest actress - Lesley Manville for Oedipus (Wyndham's Theatre production)\nBest supporting actor - Elliot Levey for Giant\nBest supporting actress - Romola Garai for The Years\nBest actor in a musical - John Dagleish for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button\nBest actress in a musical - Imelda Staunton for Hello, Dolly!\nBest supporting actress in a musical - Maimuna Memon for Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet Of 1812\nBest supporting actor in a musical - Layton Williams for Titanique\nBest director - Eline Arbo for The Years \nBest new production in affiliate theatre - Boys On The Verge Of Tears\nBest new dance production - Assembly Hall\nBest family show - Brainiac Live\nBest theatre choreographer - Christopher Wheeldon for MJ The Musical \nBest lighting design - Paule Constable & Ben Jacobs for Oliver!\nBest sound design - Nick Lidster for Fiddler On The Roof\nBest costume design - Gabriella Slade for Starlight Express\nBest set design - Tom Scutt for Fiddler On The Roof\nOutstanding achievement in dance - Eva Yerbabuena for her performance in Yerbag\u00fcena \nOutstanding musical contribution - Darren Clark and Mark Aspinall for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button\nOutstanding achievement in opera - Allan Clayton for his performance in Festen\nThe ceremony was hosted by Beverley Knight and Billy Porter and included live performances from shows including Why Am I So Single?, MJ The Musical, Fiddler On The Roof, Oliver!, Starlight Express and a 40th anniversary performance from Les Mis\u00e9rables.",

Conceding three goals in the manner we did is not of the standards of Liverpool. That's clear.\"\nDespite the setback at Craven Cottage,  a record-equalling 20th top-flight crown is surely a formality now?\nThey could even win the title as early as 20 April - if results elsewhere go their way - with no team in Premier League history throwing away a lead of this size at this stage of the season.\nThe Reds' dominance has been clear for all to see this campaign, and they lead second-placed Arsenal by 11 points.\nSlot is certainly expecting his side to bounce back and get the job done.\n\"We played a good game on Wednesday [against Everton] and we will show up against West Ham [on Sunday] as well,\" he told Sky Sports.\nThis video can not be played\n'Mo will show up' - Slot not worried by Salah's form\nWe've all heard the accusations and whispers this season from rival fans, haven't we?\n'This Liverpool team isn't actually that great.' 'The Premier League is a poor league this season.' 'Liverpool's class of 2024-25 wouldn't have won the title in another season.'\nSunday's loss will only add to those shouts. How fair is this, though?\nFirstly, it has to be said Liverpool's usual rivals are not having their best seasons.\nDefending champions Manchester City are on track for their worst campaign under Pep Guardiola, Manchester United are set for their worst season in Premier League history, Arsenal are nine points adrift of their points tally at this stage of last season, while Tottenham and Chelsea have suffered their own struggles as well.\n\"The other teams just haven't stepped up this season and Liverpool have been consistent all the way through,\" former Manchester United captain Gary Neville told Sky Sports prior to the Fulham match.\n\"The rest of them have fallen well below their standards - Arsenal, obviously Manchester City, United, Tottenham.\"\nIt's been a good season for Liverpool to hit full stride then. And Slot's men have certainly done that.\nEven if Arsenal were on the 71 points they had reached at this stage last season, when they were top of the table, Liverpool would still be two points ahead of them.\n\"I don't even think Liverpool have been outstanding this season, they've been efficient,\" ex-Manchester City defender Micah Richards told Sky Sports.\n\"They've been slower in build-up and more ruthless in front of goal.\"\nArsenal's much-lauded invincibles finished their title-winning campaign on 90 points back in 2004. Slot's men need 18 points from seven games to beat that.\nIn 32 Premier League seasons, only 14 sides have reached that mark and one of them - Manchester United in 1993-94 - did so in a 42-game season.\nLiverpool are also the only side to get 90-plus points and not win the title - doing so twice under Jurgen Klopp - meaning only 12 of the previous 31 league-winning sides posted in 90 points or more.\nMeanwhile, the average number of points for the team in second after their 31st game of a season is 65.4 - slightly higher than Arsenal's current 62 points - but there have been second-placed teams on much lower tallies at this stage, including Arsenal's 57 points in 2000-01.\n\"Liverpool want to reinstate the aura that they've had all season and finish strong,\" former Manchester City midfielder Izzy Christiansen told Sky Sports.\n\"However they end up winning it is almost up to them. They've been fantastic.\"\nYou can only beat what is front of you and Liverpool have done just that in formidable style - up until Sunday, anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool's 26-match unbeaten run ended by Fulham\nHow to win the Champions League: Liverpool 2019\n13 April: West Ham (H)\n20 April: Leicester (A)\n27 April: Tottenham (H)\n4 May: Chelsea (A)\n11 May: Arsenal (H)\n18 May: Brighton (A)\n25 May: Crystal Palace (H)\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "For the first time in decades, Lyle and Erik Menendez say they are beginning to feel hope they could get parole. It is a shift in mindset for the brothers, who have spent more than 30 years behind bars for the murders of their parents in their Beverly Hills home.\n\"My brother and I are cautiously hopeful,\" Lyle Menendez, 57, said in a recent jailhouse interview with TMZ, which was aired on Fox.\n\"Hope for the future is really kind of a new thing for us. I think Erik would probably agree with that. It's not something we've spent a lot of time on,\" he added.\nThe Menendez brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in 1996 and sentenced to life without parole for the 1989 shotgun killings of their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez.\nThe case shocked the nation - not only for the brutal nature of the crime, but also for the courtroom drama that followed.\nTheir first trial ended in a hung jury after both brothers detailed years of sexual abuse they claimed to have suffered at the hands of their father, a high-powered music industry executive.\nBut prosecutors in the second trial cast doubt on those claims, arguing the brothers had acted out of greed and wanted to inherit their parents' wealth. The jury agreed, and the brothers were convicted and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\nOver the decades, the brothers have kept up their appeals - and recently learned that they would get a parole hearing after all.\nWith that hearing scheduled for June, and a resentencing hearing in the middle of April, the brothers are reflecting on how they will lead their lives if freed.\n\"What it is that I want to do in terms of my day-to-day life is much of what I'm doing in here. I want to be an advocate for people that are suffering in silence,\" 54-year-old Erik Menendez told TMZ.\n\"Lyle and I aren't talking about leaving prison - should we be able to get out - and not looking back. Our lives will be spent working with the prison and doing the work that we're doing in here, out there,\" he added.\nPart of the bid for parole hinges on a risk assessment that evaluates whether the brothers are still seen as threats to society.\nThe brothers say they have changed in prison.\n\"I'm striving to be a better person every day, and I want to be a person that my family can be proud of,\" said Erik Menendez. \"Who I've evolved into, who I've seen Lyle evolve into. I'm beginning to like myself, be proud of myself, and find it's okay to like myself.\"\nDuring their time in prison, both Erik and Lyle have started rehabilitation programs for disabled and elderly inmates and taught classes on trauma healing and meditation.\n\"Our best moments are the ones that are not spoken about, and we just help somebody, or we help an animal, or we make somebody smile that's feeling down that might have gone and harmed themselves if we weren't there,\" Erik said, speaking of their volunteer work in prison.\nDespite the upcoming parole hearing, the brothers' future - and the other possible paths to freedom - remain uncertain.\nLos Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman recently withdrew a motion for resentencing that had been filed under his predecessor, George Gasc\u00f3n, signalling a harder stance on the case.\nHochman has publicly said he will not support the brothers' release, though the final decision rests with a judge.\nThe move has stirred controversy with the DA's office as two former prosecutors who worked under Gasc\u00f3n and advocated for the brothers' resentencing, have filed a legal case against Hochman - accusing him of harassment, retaliation, and defamation. \nThe pair claim they were demoted because of their stance on the case - and have faced intense public scrutiny as a result. Mr Hochman's office is yet to comment.\nSome members of the Menendez family have also criticized Mr Hochman, suggesting he is letting personal bias influence his actions. Mr Hochman denies this.\n\"Hochman doesn't seem to want to listen or engage with us,\" the brothers' cousin Tamara Goodell told US media. Ms Goodell accused the prosecutor of dismissing and ignoring the family, and \"not acting like a neutral party\".\nBut public opinion remains divided.\nIn the same TMZ special, Alan Abrahamson, a former Los Angeles Times reporter who covered the Menendez trials in the 1990s, said the brothers are \"two of the most skilled and accomplished liars\".\n\"The Menendezes are very capable of shapeshifting, and being who people who want them to be,\" Mr Abrahamson said. \"And I think this is one of the grave dangers of this discussion that people don't seem to pick up on.\"\nThat is a thought shared by a former Beverly Hills detective who was assigned to investigate the murders at the time.\n\"This is the most heinous murder case I've had,\" Tom Linehan told TMZ. He believes the Menendez brothers were money-motivated killers who grew up getting exactly they wanted.\n\"If somebody is challenging what they want to do, they'd take them out if they had to,\" Linehan added.\nAs for the brothers, they have to hope the parole board sees things differently, so they will continue to fight their legal case.\n\"You never know how long you'll be blessed to be on the Earth, so we don't sit around waiting for something,\" Lyle said.",

Jim Frame, president of the UK Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons and professor at Anglia Ruskin University, said that it does not cover all of the cosmetic surgery operations that happen in the UK because some is carried out by ENT and maxillofacial surgeons, or by non-BAAPS members, especially fillers and Botox.\nThe data also does not include surgeries carried out overseas, where the lower cost of treatment in countries like Turkey attracts Brits. \nCosmetic procedures and surgery carry risks and the NHS warns that they \"can lead to serious complications if they're not done correctly\". \nIt advises people to research thoroughly beforehand, including checking the credibility of the clinic and getting information about the most common complications of the procedure.\n\"There are a lot of susceptible people that are committing to surgeries that a fairly large proportion will regret,\" Prof Frame said.",

        "article_text": "In This City Is Ours, Liverpool actor James Nelson-Joyce plays a leading gang member who is struggling to balance his criminal career and family life, against a backdrop of changing modern masculinity.\nSo it's not hard to see why the new BBC drama has been dubbed by reviewers as the \"Scouse Sopranos\" - with reference to the acclaimed US mafia boss Tony and his equally conflicting set-up.\nNelson-Joyce plays the notorious Michael Kavanagh, who works for drug lord and lifelong friend Ronnie Phelan, played by Sean Bean. And the plot focuses on the power struggle between Michael and Ronnie's son Jamie - played by Nelson-Joyce's real life football friend and fellow Scouser Jack McMullen - as to who will take over the business when the top dog retires to Spain, via the Wirral.\nInconveniently though, Michael falls in love with Diana (Hannah Onslow). The couple are trying for a baby but due to his low sperm count need to try IVF to start a family.\nIt's not an ideal environment for domestic bliss to blossom - or good for Michael's street cred - but it does provide the scene for the 36-year-old actor's \"most amazing\" TV experience to date. \n\"It's about Michael allowing himself to be vulnerable,\" Nelson-Joyce tells BBC News.\n\"Because a lot of men put up this brave wall where it's like, I can't be seen to be that person,\" he adds. \"It's took Diana to be that breath of fresh air in his life.\" \nHe believes it is important to show on screen how \"we are allowed to change\".\n\"Because Michael's identity throughout has been as Ronnie's right-hand man, so he's always been the one you don't mess with.\n\"Whereas for the first time in his life, he's allowing himself to be who he wants to be; this loving partner who's reliable, who's safe and who doesn't lie to his partner.\"\nThe rising star, who has been mentioned as potential future James Bond, previously appeared opposite Sheffield actor Bean in another Merseyside crime drama, Time.\nAnd he has featured alongside another Liverpudlian, Stephen Graham, in Time, Little Boy Blue, and the recent historical drama A Thousand Blows.\nHe says his latest character's respect for his partner in crime, Ronnie, was a mirror of his real life working relationship with Bean, who he describes as \"a gift\" of a co-star and a \"kind human being\".\nGraham is \"so supportive\" of Nelson-Joyce's career too. The former's own headline-grabbing new show, Adolescence, also tackles toxic masculinity and its potentially deadly effects.\nThis City is Ours' Bafta-winning director Saul Dibb (The Sixth Commandment) notes how Nelson-Joyce has played \"hard men\" roles before but has not been able to demonstrate \"all of the other qualities\" he possesses, until now.\nThe Telegraph has awarded the show five stars, calling it a \"superb crime thriller of betrayals and shifting loyalties\". Critic Anita Singh noted that it \"doesn't quite live up to\" the Sopranos \"but it comes close\".\nIn a four-star review, the Independent said Nelson-Joyce's \"conflicted gangster\" and the show's \"moral ambivalence\" elevated it \"above the average boilerplate crime drama\".\nThe Guardian's Lucy Mangan awarded three stars, however, suggesting \"the fantastic performances don't do enough to lift this Scouse Sopranos.\"\nBut the Sunday Times' Carol Midgley offered another four-star review, saying it \"is as much about family dynamics and the human condition as it is about gangsters and violence\".\nThe show's creator and writer Stephen Butchard (The Last Kingdom) tells us he is \"happy\" with comparisons to the \"brilliant\" New Jersey-based crime show \"because that really is about a family\".\n\"We haven't got as many cured meats,\" he jokes, of Mr Soprano's favourite food.\nAnother reference point was Shakespeare, he explains, to \"explore those huge human emotions of your ambition and greed and love and betrayal.\"\n\"Once greed and secrets take hold, the fabric of any society, including a family, begins to fray,\" he adds.\nFormer engineer Butchard was keen to capture the \"vibrancy\" of his native Liverpool, which he describes as a \"really handsome\" and \"friendly\" modern world city.\nBeautiful vistas of the city's skyline and glamorous waterfront are juxtaposed with life on its streets (along with shots of the gang's dealings in sunny Marbella and Malaga).\n\"I didn't want to show a Liverpool that has been seen previously on the television,\" he says.\n\"Because this story could be told in any city around the world, but then it's only when you come to the characters that you can give them that Liverpool inflection, bite and hopefully humour, and reflect the mood of the city.\"\nHe says he was was impressed with the \"wonderful\" Scouse accents perfected by the non-local members of the extended fictional crime family, including Onslow, Julie Graham and Laura Aikman, as well as Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson.\nAs for genuine Scouser Nelson-Joyce, just when he thought he was out, the producers may have pulled him back in for a second series.\n\"We want to do a season two\" says the star.\n\"It would be mad if there wasn't\" offers Dibb.\nBoth underline the overwhemingly positive responses they've received, particularly from viewers with purple bins.\n\"Because they're the people who know if we've got all the details right,\" says the London director, adding that Liverpudlians would \"not hold back\" in saying so if not.\nHe recounts how a train conductor told actor Michael Noble - who plays Michael's confidant/enforcer, Banksey - that they had \"done they city proud\".\nThe reaction has been \"really lovely\" and \"a bit crazy\" adds Nelson-Joyce.\n\"It feels like the whole city loves it,\" he says. \"I think people really bought the relationship between me and Hannah and really wanted us to work.\"\nHis celebrity pal, ex-Liverpool footballer Jamie Carragher told him personally last week that he thought the show was \"[expletive] brilliant\".\nTony Soprano could not have put it better himself.\nThis City Is Ours airs on BBC One on Sundays at 21:00 BST.

        "article_text": "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer watched in his flat. Chancellor Rachel Reeves saw it in her study. The Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, accompanied by staff and pizza, took in President Donald Trump's big tariffs reveal on Wednesday from his office in Old Admiralty Arch, from where the British Navy was directed to protect and control trade on the high seas in days gone by.\nMinisters can only dream of having that kind of power now, as the UK watches on in growing horror at the bust-up between the US and China.\n\"Sometimes people don't realise they are living through a moment of history,\" a cabinet minister notes, as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping square up to each other, and stock markets plunge. Trump has slapped a 10% tariff on all nations \u2013 including the UK \u2013 for imports into the US, and much higher rates on some countries, including China, which has responded with fresh tariffs of its own.\nSo what's happening in Whitehall right now to try to limit the harm to the UK, perhaps by making a deal with the US, and make the most of any opportunities?\nThe PM is spending another dramatic weekend working the phones from the peace of his country pad, Chequers. So far, the other calls that could really matter, from US negotiators, have not yet resumed.\nTrump dangled a possible trade deal that might exempt the UK from some of the costs from tariffs during the pair's chummy White House press conference in February. There have been significant negotiations since then by a team of around 20, led out of No 10 by Michael Ellam, the Treasury and banking veteran, and the PM's business adviser Varun Chandra alongside the business secretary.\nThose talks included ideas about the UK watering down rules on electric vehicles, possible changes to a tax on tech companies (\"space to talk about it\", one minister says) and changes to online safety rules (\"not happening\", says a government source).\nBut as the US government prepared for its announcements on Wednesday, talks about a deal ground to a halt. Now, after the announcement, the \"ball is in their court\", said one government source involved, waiting to hear if, in the chaos of Trump's new tariff world, the White House can find time and energy to push a deal with the UK.\n\"We're expecting to hear from them any moment,\" one of those involved hopes. The risk, in the visible turmoil, is that any economic agreement could become a case of: don't call us, we'll call you. We'll be asking Darren Jones, the Treasury Minister, about it when he join us in the studio tomorrow.\nIf a deal is done, however, do not expect an all-singing all-dancing arrangement. Instead, \"it would be a basic agreement on principles \u2013 rather than a super detailed trade agreement\", says a government source, contrasting these \"quick and dirty\" moves to long-running negotiations with India (\"we're on our 15th chapter with them!\"). \nUncertainty around the talks, and the limited nature of what a deal could achieve in any case, means No 10 is \"not sitting here waiting for it \u2013 it's not the basket where all our eggs are\".\nFor weeks the government told us they were preparing for all kinds of scenarios. A secret cabinet committee was considering how the UK might react if Trump's tariffs materialised.\nBut now they are here, the actual response is\u2026 not to respond, and to spend four weeks asking businesses if they would like the government to respond later on. That is not just Whitehall dither: at this stage, there seems to be almost zero appetite among ministers to join in with the rounds of tariffs between the US, China, and perhaps the EU in coming days.\nOne Whitehall figure working with business says \"there has not been a single voice in business, big or small, saying this is the wrong strategy\".\nMinisters' approach to get businesses on board, like when Sir Keir invited dozens of big wigs to No 10 the morning after Trump's tariff announcement, is in part because of the anger when the government increased National Insurance contributions. \"The really calm reaction,\" one source says, \"is because we got people into the headspace where tariffs were going to happen \u2013 one of the businesses said they were being borderline stalked, we've been trying to persuade business to trust the process.\"\nThe government is in no rush, and has no enthusiasm to introduce its own new tariffs, and for now at least, demands on them to do so are muted. According to a minister: \"Most people have considerable numbers of jobs in their constituencies on the line \u2013 even in cabinet there might have been some question marks but there weren't this week.\"\nAnd they joke that the Lib Dems, who are calling for tariffs in retaliation, \"keep demanding a trade war but I don't think they'll lead the nation\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who also does not want extra tariffs, will be on tomorrow's show too.\nBut just as the government is going slow on hitting back, they are cracking heads to crack on with their existing plans faster.\nThis isn't all about Trump. I understand the chancellor is looking at whether any of the money announced in the government's vital Spending Review can be brought forward from June. If government departments are able to finalise their deals, can that be sorted and made public as soon as possible?\nThere are discussions too about whether it's possible to speed up the long waited-for Industrial Strategy \u2013 a plan to get investment into the UK pencilled in for June, but could it be brought forward? A decision hasn't been made but the prime minister is again, his team indicate, trying to use the jeopardy around the world as an impetus to push the government machine harder. \"We have to run quickly towards this,\" a government source says \u2013 and the chancellor is looking at it this weekend.\nSign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.\nYou might feel, haven't I heard this before? You'd be right. Since the start of the year, the prime minister and the chancellor have both repeatedly said the government has to go faster, work harder. So why after years in opposition weren't Starmer's team ready to go with all of these changes when they got into office? For a government that promised to be radical, its plans have not always been forthcoming.\nYou may not fancy the kind of radicalism we're seeing out of the White House, but radical it certainly is. To compete, the UK may need to be that too.\nIt is ludicrous to imagine the PM is \"very happy\" that the UK has been hit with tariffs as Trump suggested \u2013 \"artistic licence\", a government source remarked. No British action can completely insulate our economy from disruption abroad. But the government's own actions do matter, and this could be a defining moment.\nWhile there's been no lack of trying to soften the blows for the UK, the government's hopes have been dashed already. First, ministers believed the UK could escape tariffs, then they said they were prepared in case, then disappointed when they arrived. \nAs Sir Keir spends another weekend on the phone, and his officials wait for their phone to ring, the government doesn't know what it will be able to say next.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "summary": "There have been significant negotiations since then by a team of around 20, led out of No 10 by Michael Ellam, the Treasury and banking veteran, and the PM's business adviser Varun Chandra alongside the business secretary.Those talks included ideas about the UK watering down rules on electric vehicles, possible changes to a tax on tech companies (\"space to talk about it\", one minister says) and changes to online safety rules (\"not happening\", says a government source).PA MediaSir Keir Starmer told business leaders in Downing Street that Trump's tariffs will have a serious impact on the UK and global economyBut as the US government prepared for its announcements on Wednesday, talks about a deal ground to a halt. Now, after the announcement, the \"ball is in their court\", said one government source involved, waiting to hear if, in the chaos of Trump's new tariff world, the White House can find time and energy to push a deal with the UK. Trump has slapped a 10% tariff on all nations \u2013 including the UK \u2013 for imports into the US, and much higher rates on some countries, including China, which has responded with fresh tariffs of its own.So what's happening in Whitehall right now to try to limit the harm to the UK, perhaps by making a deal with the US, and make the most of any opportunities?Tariffs have shaken the markets - how worried should we be?China and US are at each other's throats on tariffs, and neither is backing downThe PM is spending another dramatic weekend working the phones from the peace of his country pad, Chequers. Uncertainty around the talks, and the limited nature of what a deal could achieve in any case, means No 10 is \"not sitting here waiting for it \u2013 it's not the basket where all our eggs are\".PA MediaBusiness Secretary Jonathan Reynolds says he is speaking to UK firms about the impact of the new 10% tariffs on British exports to the USFor weeks the government told us they were preparing for all kinds of scenarios. So far, the other calls that could really matter, from US negotiators, have not yet resumed.Trump dangled a possible trade deal that might exempt the UK from some of the costs from tariffs during the pair's chummy White House press conference in February.",

We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and there are going to be fair deals,\" he said.\nTrump said China had introduced its countermeasure \"despite my warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs... will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs\". \nBeijing shot back, saying that \"pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage\".\n\"The US hegemonic move in the name of 'reciprocity' serves its selfish interests at the expense of other countries' legitimate interests and puts 'America first' over international rules,\" Chinese embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu said in a statement. \n\"This is a typical move of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying.\" \nSpeaking from the White House, the US president said there could be both permanent tariffs and negotiations.\n\"We have $36tn (\u00a328tn) debt for a reason,\" he said, adding that the US would be talking to China among other countries to make a \"fair deal and a good deal\".\n\"It's now America first,\" Trump said.\nThe tariffs would come as a major blow to China's manufacturers, for whom the US is a key market for exports.\nChina's top exports to the US include electrical products and other machinery, computers, furniture, toys, vehicles and equipment.\nThe US's top exports to China are oilseeds and grains, as well aircraft, machinery and pharmaceuticals.\nUncertainty around the tariffs led to a turbulent day on global stock markets.\nMarkets worldwide have plunged since Trump announced the global tariffs. \nThe value of US stock markets dropped sharply again on opening on Monday, although they later pared those losses, while Europe's biggest markets, including London's FTSE 100, closed more than 4% down.\nAsian share indexes had nosedived on Monday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index falling by more than 13%, its biggest one-day fall since 1997. However, most major markets made gains on Tuesday with some notable exceptions.\nThe key index in mainland China was broadly flat on Tuesday morning but there were more losses in Taiwan and Singapore. After being closed for national holidays, Thailand and Indonesia also saw stocks fall by more than 4% and 9% respectively. \nTrump's post on Monday also indicated that negotiations on countries' tariff rates would \"begin taking place immediately\".\nTrump met Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, on Monday in the White House. Netanyahu said that his country would eliminate the trade imbalance with the US, which he said was the \"right thing to do\".\n\"We intend to do it very quickly... and we're going to also eliminate trade barriers.\"\nIsrael faces a 17% tariff from April 9 under Trump's \"Liberation Day\" policy.\nThe US president also posted earlier that Japan was sending a negotiation team to discuss tariffs.\nAnd Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, offered Trump a \"zero-for-zero tariff\" deal - although she previously said that she had not ruled out retaliation. \n\"We are also prepared to respond through countermeasures and defend our interests,\" she said.\nTrump said later that the EU had been formed \"to really do damage to the United States and trade\".

        "article_text": "Ruud van Nistelrooy has won three games since being appointed Leicester head coach in November 2024\nIt has been 720 minutes since Leicester last scored at home in the Premier League.\nWith Monday's 3-0 defeat by Newcastle, the Foxes became the first side in the top four tiers of English football to lose eight successive home league games without scoring.\nRuud van Nistelrooy's relegation-bound side have not found the back of the net at the King Power Stadium since 8 December - a 2-2 draw with Brighton.\n\"Nothing surprises me with this group and this manager and this football club at the minute,\" ex-Foxes winger Matt Piper told BBC Radio Leicester. \n\"The anger for me is done, they are sucking the life out of me. This is as bad as it's ever been and we are a club that has dropped down to League One football.\" \nLeicester have registered 82 shots on goal this term but have only accumulated an expected goals (xG) tally of 6.58.\nAgainst Newcastle, Leicester's possession was at a healthy 58% but that creative spark was missing once again with an xG of only 0.47.\nThis from a side that have seen the tremendous highs of lifting the Premier League title, travelled Europe in the Champions League and hoisted the FA Cup high at Wembley Stadium.\n\"This season they are not good enough, there is no fight, there is no determination, there is no want to wear the shirt, there is no confidence,\" he said.\n\"Then there is a manager that goes missing in the dugout. There are major things wrong at this football club and it's been like this for some time. It's just not good enough. There are so many things wrong and I really fear for this football club in the coming years.\"\nThis video can not be played\nLeicester not good enough - Van Nistelrooy on 'difficult night'\nLeicester's current run of eight games without a goal at home equals that of Manchester City in May 2007. And with table-toppers Liverpool next to visit, a new record could very well be set.\nVan Nistelrooy is only the second manager in Premier League history to lose eight successive home games in the competition, after Daniel Farke in September 2021 with Norwich City.\n\"What is worrying is the run of form, lack of goals, the lack of results we can produce,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\"Trying different things, different structures, different players in different positions and the results are not there. That is the worrying thing. This is a difficult night, especially in the run of form we're in. \n\"It's important to analyse this, sleep on it and recover from it. That's it for now. There's no questions, it's dealing with this setback, another one, and that's for now what I can say.\"\nFoxes defender James Justin said players are struggling for confidence as the weeks pass by.\n\"It's hard to describe, to be honest, with how it's been and it makes us feel awful right at the moment,\" he said.\n\"It's hard to find confidence. It's a horrible moment for the club with how we're playing on the pitch and trying to regain any confidence.\"\nDespite being on a winless run of nine games, Leicester still have their Premier League status intact, but Justin did not provide much hope when pressed on the topic.\n\"There is still a chance for us and we have to fight and claw for it, but we aren't showing it on the pitch,\" he said.\nPadraig: Dismal. Setting new records that nobody wants every week. Fans feel disconnected from a mismanaged club that once had the opportunity to be a regular mid-table Premier League team. We threw it away. Incredibly sad.\nKev: It's a Groundhog [Day] Season for us. Breaking [unwanted] records, can't score, can't even shoot, same players every week, same rhetoric before and after the game, we've become numb to it all now.\nJenny: Will we ever score a goal again? I'm a season ticket holder and haven't seen them score in 2025. Ruud is out of his depth, I can see us finishing bottom.\nJames: Just goes from bad to worse - the whole club needs a clear out. Despair as to next season - the fans have lost faith in this bunch of players with the manager, they are clueless.",

        "article_text": "Sam was lying in bed one morning when her tenant in a house she owned in Margate sent her a photo of a piece of graffiti that had appeared on the wall outside.\nAstonishingly, it looked like a Banksy. It would turn out to be perhaps the graffiti artist's most interesting new artwork of recent years,\u202fValentine's Day Mascara (pictured above), which was revealed in Margate on Valentine's Day, 2023.\nBamboozled, Sam googled: what do you do when you wake up with a Banksy on your wall?\n\"What did Google say about that?\" I asked her.\n\"Nothing! And I was like, I need to contact the council, I need to find an art gallery who can advise me.\"\nSam called Julian Usher at Red Eight Gallery. Julian's team, conscious that new Banksys are under immediate threat from street cleaners, the weather, rival graffiti artists and other art dealers, promised he'd be in Margate within the hour: \"We knew we had to get the piece covered,\" say Julian.\nAnd there was another reason Julian got to Margate double-quick: if Banksy chooses your wall for one of his drawings, you could be seriously in the money.\nFor the second season of my BBC Radio 4 podcast The Banksy Story, which is called When Banksy Comes To Town, I've been following the very different fates of two sets of homeowners who wake up one day to find a Banksy on their wall. The season shows just how important his graffiti becomes for a local community \u2013 and why people disagree so vehemently about what should happen after it's discovered.\nSam became the custodian of\u202fValentine's Day Mascara, which speaks to the theme of domestic violence, incidents of which usually spike each Valentine's Day. It's a complicated bit of work. A peppy 50s housewife with a black eye has bludgeoned her partner. A real pan with flecks of red is at her feet, and his painted legs are upended into the real fridge-freezer that Banksy left by the wall. A broken plastic chair testifies to the fight they have had.\nLater on the day it appeared, refuse collectors arrived to spirit away the fridge-freezer. This precipitated a free-for-all, with the public helping themselves to the remnants. It was mayhem. \nA media scrum, a wrong-footed local council, millions of global onlookers. Exactly, one suspects, what Banksy wanted. \nAnd this time, just for laughs, he left behind oil painter Peter Brown, commissioned to capture the scenes he would miss. I spoke to Pete \"The Street\" Brown for my series. \"The whole reason I was employed was because Banksy was questioning what was the art about,\" Pete explained. \"Is it about the graffiti? Or is it about the reaction afterwards, and what happens to it?\"\nAs luck would have it, Pete was captured on video just as Banksy's team were putting the finishing touches to Valentine's Day Mascara \u2013 a video that The Banksy Story managed to obtain. In it we can see that one of Banksy's team let a local kid play with their drone. \n\"They're in the process of putting a large piece on a wall and yet they're taking the time to teach a kid how to fly a drone,\" says Steph Warren, who used to work with Banksy and who appeared in my first series - about the artist's rise and rise. \"Very sweet!\"\nAlongside Sam, I've been following the story of Gert and Gary. They, like Sam, did not want me to use their last name. A 30ft-high seagull appeared one morning on the wall of their buy-to-let in Lowestoft in Suffolk. The bird needed to be massive for Banksy's ambitious visual gag to work. The artist had shoved large yellow insulation strips into a skip that now looked like a fast-food container that the seagull divebombed to steal chips.\nBanksy had chosen his wall well. Visitors arriving by train were treated to this witty meditation on the scourge of Britain's seaside towns, equal parts warning and celebration. The\u202fLowestoft Seagull\u202fwas part of Banksy's\u202fGreat British Staycation, his post-Covid lockdown campaign to cheer us all up at the prospect of a summer holiday spent in the UK.\nBut Gert was not cheered-up at all. \"It's not a seagull, it's an albatross!\" she quipped when I went to interview her.\n\"How did you know it was a Banksy?\" I asked.\n\"There was scaffolding erected on the side of the house. I tried to find out if it was a particular scaffolding firm, but there was no phone number,\" Gert replied. \"On the Monday morning the letting agency informed me that I could possibly have a Banksy. By then the scaffolding had gone and this seagull appeared.\"\nThis fits with what we know of Banksy's modus operandi. He claims hiding in plain sight is the best way to remain invisible. \"If questioned about your legitimacy,\" he wrote in his book Wall & Piece, \"simply complain about the hourly rate.\"\nIt's a good gag. But how fun is it for the folk on the other end of his spray can?\nI found that with good hustling skills a Banksied homeowner might see their bank balance expanded, but it's not an easy process. \nAs Gert explains, exasperated, \"Lowestoft people commented that it belongs to Lowestoft\u2026 But nobody's turned up to say, 'we'll help you protect it'. It doesn't belong to the person filming it, or the person taking pictures with their children. The problem is mine!\" \nGert had to contend with people putting their children into the skip for photo opportunities, the council trying to charge her for Perspex screens, and the threat of a Preservation Order which might have cost her \u00a340,000 a year.\nAnd the two stories I've been following have ended up having entirely different outcomes. \nBoth artworks have been taken off the houses they were painted on \u2013 a complex, expensive operation that uses specialist equipment \u2013 so they can be sold. But while the Banksy in Margate is now on the verge of selling for well over \u00a31m, with a sizeable chunk set to go to a domestic violence charity, and with the piece remaining in the town for the foreseeable future, the Banksy up the coast in Lowestoft languishes in a climate-controlled warehouse, costing its owners \u00a33,000 per month. \nIt has cost Gert and her partner Gary around \u00a3450,000 so far to preserve the piece and although there are buyers sniffing around, nobody has bought it yet. Speaking about the situation, Gary told me: \"I'm so angry at what's going on.\"\nNot everyone approves of people trying to sell Banksy's street art. \nSteph Warren \u2013 who starred in the first series of The Banksy Story\u202fas the only person ever to work for Banksy without signing his non-disclosure agreement \u2013 suggests that worried homeowners should simply \"get busy with five litres of white emulsion and paint it out\".\nOwner of street-art gallery Stelladore in St Leonards, Warren is a purist, who feels that art made for the street should remain there, no matter its value. \"With Banksy, where he puts the art is fundamental,\" she says. \"Remove the work from the precise place on the streets that he put it, and the work instantly loses its power. Context is everything.\"\nBut Banksy has elevated graffiti into a new art form, now monetised \u2013 street art. Banksy's signed prints can sell for six-figure sums. Graffiti, or street art, has not just come of age, it is now an asset class. Given this, how can any homeowner feel okay about scrubbing away a Banksy without feeling as if they have smashed a Ming vase?\nOne thing I know for sure: if you wake up with a Banksy on your wall, you'll have to make a series of clever decisions to come out of it unscathed. As Sam says, after two years of dealing with the Banksy circus, \"going back to normal life now is going to be terribly boring\".",

BBC News has asked the White House and the Atlantic for comment.\nWaltz told Fox News last month that another, unnamed contact of his was supposed to be in the chat in Goldberg's place and that \"100% I don't know this guy\".\nWhen pressed by host Laura Ingraham on how Goldberg's number was added, Waltz responded: \"Well, if you have somebody else's contact, then somehow it... gets sucked in. It gets sucked in.\"\nGoldberg has previously refuted that explanation, and has said the two have met several times.\n\"This isn't The Matrix. Phone numbers don't just get sucked into other phones.\" Goldberg said during an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press. \"My phone number was in his phone because my phone number is in his phone.\"\nBy Goldberg's account, he accepted an out-of-the-blue message request from Waltz that he believed to be a hoax. \nHe watched as, over a period of days, accounts under the names of Vice-President JD Vance, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, CIA director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard exchanged messages about an upcoming US military strike on Houthi rebel targets in Yemen, which ultimately took place on 14 March.\nGoldberg left the chat after the strikes were carried out, but reported his experience in the Atlantic magazine, later publishing the messages in full. The White House acknowledged that the messages were legitimate. \nSources now tell CBS that the first mistakes happened months earlier. \nGoldberg had emailed the then-Trump presidential campaign seeking comment for a story in October 2024. The sources said Hughes was tasked with handling the request, which he messaged to Waltz along with Goldberg's contact information. \nFrom there, Waltz's phone prompted him with the option to save the phone number, which he approved. But the sources said the device saved Goldberg's number under Hughes's name. \nWhen Waltz went to assemble the Signal group chat in March 2025, Waltz believed he was adding Hughes, the sources said. But it was actually Goldberg's number added to the conversation. \nIn the aftermath of the Signal revelations, Waltz took responsibility. \"I built the group,\" Waltz told Fox News, adding it was \"embarrassing\".\nHe said he asked Elon Musk, tech billionaire and Trump ally, for help looking into the error. Separately, lawmakers in Congress demanded an investigation and grilled the chat participants in hearings. Hegseth is also facing a probe from the inspector general of the US Department of Defense over his use of Signal. \nTrump ultimately said he would \"look into\" the issue.\nIt's not clear whether the new reports are the results of those investigations.

        "article_text": "In This City Is Ours, Liverpool actor James Nelson-Joyce plays a leading gang member who is struggling to balance his criminal career and family life, against a backdrop of changing modern masculinity.\nSo it's not hard to see why the new BBC drama has been dubbed by reviewers as the \"Scouse Sopranos\" - with reference to the acclaimed US mafia boss Tony and his equally conflicting set-up.\nNelson-Joyce plays the notorious Michael Kavanagh, who works for drug lord and lifelong friend Ronnie Phelan, played by Sean Bean. And the plot focuses on the power struggle between Michael and Ronnie's son Jamie - played by Nelson-Joyce's real life football friend and fellow Scouser Jack McMullen - as to who will take over the business when the top dog retires to Spain, via the Wirral.\nInconveniently though, Michael falls in love with Diana (Hannah Onslow). The couple are trying for a baby but due to his low sperm count need to try IVF to start a family.\nIt's not an ideal environment for domestic bliss to blossom - or good for Michael's street cred - but it does provide the scene for the 36-year-old actor's \"most amazing\" TV experience to date. \n\"It's about Michael allowing himself to be vulnerable,\" Nelson-Joyce tells BBC News.\n\"Because a lot of men put up this brave wall where it's like, I can't be seen to be that person,\" he adds. \"It's took Diana to be that breath of fresh air in his life.\" \nHe believes it is important to show on screen how \"we are allowed to change\".\n\"Because Michael's identity throughout has been as Ronnie's right-hand man, so he's always been the one you don't mess with.\n\"Whereas for the first time in his life, he's allowing himself to be who he wants to be; this loving partner who's reliable, who's safe and who doesn't lie to his partner.\"\nThe rising star, who has been mentioned as potential future James Bond, previously appeared opposite Sheffield actor Bean in another Merseyside crime drama, Time.\nAnd he has featured alongside another Liverpudlian, Stephen Graham, in Time, Little Boy Blue, and the recent historical drama A Thousand Blows.\nHe says his latest character's respect for his partner in crime, Ronnie, was a mirror of his real life working relationship with Bean, who he describes as \"a gift\" of a co-star and a \"kind human being\".\nGraham is \"so supportive\" of Nelson-Joyce's career too. The former's own headline-grabbing new show, Adolescence, also tackles toxic masculinity and its potentially deadly effects.\nThis City is Ours' Bafta-winning director Saul Dibb (The Sixth Commandment) notes how Nelson-Joyce has played \"hard men\" roles before but has not been able to demonstrate \"all of the other qualities\" he possesses, until now.\nThe Telegraph has awarded the show five stars, calling it a \"superb crime thriller of betrayals and shifting loyalties\". Critic Anita Singh noted that it \"doesn't quite live up to\" the Sopranos \"but it comes close\".\nIn a four-star review, the Independent said Nelson-Joyce's \"conflicted gangster\" and the show's \"moral ambivalence\" elevated it \"above the average boilerplate crime drama\".\nThe Guardian's Lucy Mangan awarded three stars, however, suggesting \"the fantastic performances don't do enough to lift this Scouse Sopranos.\"\nBut the Sunday Times' Carol Midgley offered another four-star review, saying it \"is as much about family dynamics and the human condition as it is about gangsters and violence\".\nThe show's creator and writer Stephen Butchard (The Last Kingdom) tells us he is \"happy\" with comparisons to the \"brilliant\" New Jersey-based crime show \"because that really is about a family\".\n\"We haven't got as many cured meats,\" he jokes, of Mr Soprano's favourite food.\nAnother reference point was Shakespeare, he explains, to \"explore those huge human emotions of your ambition and greed and love and betrayal.\"\n\"Once greed and secrets take hold, the fabric of any society, including a family, begins to fray,\" he adds.\nFormer engineer Butchard was keen to capture the \"vibrancy\" of his native Liverpool, which he describes as a \"really handsome\" and \"friendly\" modern world city.\nBeautiful vistas of the city's skyline and glamorous waterfront are juxtaposed with life on its streets (along with shots of the gang's dealings in sunny Marbella and Malaga).\n\"I didn't want to show a Liverpool that has been seen previously on the television,\" he says.\n\"Because this story could be told in any city around the world, but then it's only when you come to the characters that you can give them that Liverpool inflection, bite and hopefully humour, and reflect the mood of the city.\"\nHe says he was was impressed with the \"wonderful\" Scouse accents perfected by the non-local members of the extended fictional crime family, including Onslow, Julie Graham and Laura Aikman, as well as Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson.\nAs for genuine Scouser Nelson-Joyce, just when he thought he was out, the producers may have pulled him back in for a second series.\n\"We want to do a season two\" says the star.\n\"It would be mad if there wasn't\" offers Dibb.\nBoth underline the overwhemingly positive responses they've received, particularly from viewers with purple bins.\n\"Because they're the people who know if we've got all the details right,\" says the London director, adding that Liverpudlians would \"not hold back\" in saying so if not.\nHe recounts how a train conductor told actor Michael Noble - who plays Michael's confidant/enforcer, Banksey - that they had \"done they city proud\".\nThe reaction has been \"really lovely\" and \"a bit crazy\" adds Nelson-Joyce.\n\"It feels like the whole city loves it,\" he says. \"I think people really bought the relationship between me and Hannah and really wanted us to work.\"\nHis celebrity pal, ex-Liverpool footballer Jamie Carragher told him personally last week that he thought the show was \"[expletive] brilliant\".\nTony Soprano could not have put it better himself.\nThis City Is Ours airs on BBC One on Sundays at 21:00 BST.

        "article_text": "Residential damage in Augusta caused by Hurricane Helene has reached $282m (\u00a3220m)\nThe manicured grass around the entrance to Augusta National is pristine. It always is.\nIn the suburbs which circle the home of the Masters, though, it is a different picture.\nFractured trees sprawl across gardens. Rubbles of wood and brick stack high. Homes remain shattered. So do lives.\nWhen Rory McIlroy and the world's best golfers arrived in Augusta this week, along with an estimated 200,000 fans, the devastation caused by one of the United States' deadliest natural disasters was laid bare before them.\nIn September, Hurricane Helene hit the south-eastern States - leaving death and destruction in its wake.\nAugusta, nicknamed 'The Garden City' because of its natural greenery, felt its mighty force. The residents are still dealing with the effects.\n\"There were multiple hours of 80mph winds which laid all of the forest down,\" lifelong Augusta resident Tonya Bonitatibus told BBC Sport.\n\"A lot of trees fell on top of houses and crushed cars \u2013 I lost my truck. But I was a lucky one.\"\nWhen Helene reached the American coast, it brought extreme winds, numerous tornadoes and flooding across several states. \nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, Helene is responsible for at least 249 fatalities in the United States, including at least 175 direct deaths.\nIt was the deadliest hurricane in the US since Katrina in 2005.\nFlorida, on the south-eastern frontier, bore the brunt of the force. But Helene quickly headed further north, engulfing South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia.\nAugusta, which is the third most populous city in Georgia, was attacked by gusts of wind which reached 100mph through the night of 26 September - with stark consequences.\n\"Helene's winds were responsible for killing 11 people - all from trees falling onto homes in the greater Augusta area,\" a spokesperson for the National Hurricane Center told BBC Sport.\n\"At least 362 homes and buildings were destroyed, while 3,000 others suffered major damage, and 3,500 others experienced minor to moderate damage.\"\nAugusta officials say almost 17,000 fallen trees have been removed from the city\nResidents living close to Augusta National had to leave their homes. Thousands were left without electricity and water.\nJoseph Crosby, his wife Kasey and their three children still cannot live in their storm damaged home, about five miles from the iconic course.\nHe recalls watching a mature Ash tree, which he estimates had grown over 60 feet tall, being \"blown around like a rag doll\".\n\"I think your brain compartmentalises what you're going through,\" Joseph recalls of the night itself.\n\"All you think of at that moment is just survival and keeping your kids safe. \n\"I just remember thinking if the tree came down on our house or something were to happen, would my kids be OK?\"\nThe Crosby family home is among 1,695 properties damaged in the city of Augusta. City officials estimate the cost of residential losses has reached $282m (\u00a3220m).\n\"Folks here are resilient but this won't soon be forgotten. It reminds one how frail and furious nature can be,\" local journalist Joe Kovac told BBC Sport.\n\nAugusta National Golf Club was not as badly affected as the suburbs nearby.\nBut it did not escape. \n\"After the storm when you rode around Augusta National, on Washington Road, the pile of trees was above your car for mile after mile,\" said Bonitatibus.\nTrees came down in their hundreds on the famed course, damaging one of golf's most famous greens on the par-three 16th.\nWalking the course now is a lighter, less claustrophobic experience.  \nYou can see through wooded areas that previously screened individual holes and made them their own isolated stations.\nThe separation of the ninth and first fairways is less cluttered. \nComing down the 11th hole it is possible to see into the neighbouring Augusta Country Club course.\nThe wooded area to the right of the newly-laid 16th green will have fewer shadows when the world's best golfers begin their challenge for the famous Green Jacket on Thursday.  \nSpeaking in January, Augusta National Golf Club chairman Fred Ridley said: \"As far as the golf course goes, it's in spectacular condition.\n\"We had minor damage to the course, the playing surfaces themselves, but we were able to get that back in shape.\n\"I don't think you're going to see any difference in the condition for the Masters this year.\"\nKovac, who recently wrote a vivid account of the city's recovery process,, external agreed.\n\"I was struck by how emerald-green it is, at least the periphery. It is as if the grass never flinched,\" said the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter.\n\"The kerbside lawn around the course perimeter looks manicured to the hilt. Only regular patrons will really notice trees are missing.\n\"But further into the miles of neighbourhoods ringing the National one cannot help but see the wreckage and its remains.\"\nDriving around Augusta, it does not take much to notice the roadsides still populated by fallen trees - oaks, ash and giant pines. \nLong established homes bear scars of severe roof damage, much of it protected only by the flimsy tarpaulins.\nLife has been dominated recently by the need to join lengthy queues for construction and repair workers. \n\"It's been a journey, just rebuilding. It's been really neat to see the community come together in a town like this,\" said Kasey Crosby.\n\"We've heard lots of stories of neighbours helping each other.\n\"Cutting neighbours out of their driveways so they can get their cars out and get to work, or to get to the grocery store. \n\"People are pulling together, helping one another with chainsaws and just showing up.\"\nAugusta is described by its government as a 'centre of medicine, manufacturing, and military'. \nHowever, its job market has long been unstable and the city is ranked among the neediest in the US.\nIn December 2023, local newspaper, the Augusta Chronicle, reported it was ranked the nation's fifth worst city for economic well-being.\nChild poverty, food insecurity and unemployment rates were highlighted as particular problems.\nBlue tarpaulin covering the roofs of Augusta houses is a common sight \nAugusta National, which stumped up $20m (\u00a315.8m) in Masters prize money last year, is well aware of its privilege.\nIn the aftermath of Helene, the club provided $5m of financial support to the relief fund.\nBonitatibus, a riverkeeper who looks after the Savannah waterway, says the aid had a \"huge\" impact and reinforced Augusta National's philanthropic role in the community.\nThe money helped provide food, water, laundry, showers and counselling services.\nBonitatibus estimates the city is about \"60%\" through its recovery, although fears the environmental impact will last for \"many, many years\".\n\"We have things we need to shift as a community so when the next storm comes we're more prepared,\" she said.\n\"In terms of planting trees again, that's a couple of generations. We lost a 100-year-old on our property.\"\nMasters week, which has been held in Augusta since 1934, has long been one of the biggest economic drivers in the city.\nLast year, Forbes reported it contributes an estimated $120m (\u00a394m) annually., external\nA hefty percentage of the 200,000 population rent out their homes - and land - for players, patrons and the media to lay their heads.\nGiven the devastation, this Masters week holds extra significance and will provide a much-needed financial injection for the thousands affected.\nMany have been hanging on, forlorn and frustrated, in the hope of a positive answer from insurance companies deluged by desperate claims.\n\"The Masters is definitely the time when we put our best foot forward \u2013 and we're doing that again,\" said Bonitatibus.\n\"We're happy it is here \u2013 thank goodness, we need the proper cash. This is a huge opportunity for us to get back right.\"",

        "article_text": "Dan Biggar played his final game for Wales in the 2023 Rugby World Cup quarter-final defeat against Argentina\nFormer British and Irish Lions and Wales fly-half Dan Biggar will retire as a player at the end of the season. \nBiggar will finish his 18-year career with French club Toulon, who he joined in November 2022.\nThe 35-year-old won 112 caps for Wales in a 15-year Test career and scored more than 600 points. His final appearance was at the 2023 Rugby World Cup. \nHe won three Six Nations titles and a Grand Slam with Wales and was captain during the Wayne Pivac era.\nBiggar went on two British and Irish Lions tours, making three Test appearances in South Africa in 2021.\n\"There comes a point where you just know, not because of anything in particular, but someone once said to me 'when you know, you'll know',\" Biggar said as he announced his decision on social media.\n\"Rugby has given me everything. I threw myself into this game at 17 and it's given me a life that I could never have imagined.\n\"I've lived out my childhood dreams for the best part of two decades and I'm so, so grateful for that.\"\nBiggar started his youth career at Gorseinon RFC and Gowerton Comprehensive in Swansea before playing a season for Swansea RFC in the Welsh Premiership.\nHe made his senior Ospreys debut in 2008 and during an 11-year spell made 221 appearances and scored 2,203 points, making him the region's record points scorer.\nBiggar was also instrumental in securing two Pro12 titles in 2010 and 2012 and paid tribute to a former Ospreys coach in his retirement address.\n\"A special mention has to go to Sean Holley, who took a chance on a young, cocky 17-year-old when public opinion told him to do otherwise. Who knows if things would have turned out if you hadn't, so thank you Sean,\" he said.\nNorthampton came calling in 2018 and Biggar made 69 appearances for Saints, helping them to lift the Premiership Rugby Cup and reach the league knock-out stages in his first season.\nBefore his contract at Franklin's Gardens expired, Biggar took an opportunity to sign for French giants Toulon, where he will see out the remainder of the 2024-2025 season.\nToulon's Dan Biggar and Charles Ollivon celebrate winning the European Challenge Cup in 2023 \nReflecting on his career, Biggar said there had been moments in rugby he would never forget, including winning his first cap for Wales in 2008, becoming a Test centurion in 2022 and a Lion the previous year.\nBut he says those are not been his greatest achievements.\n\"The thing I'm most proud about is being able to give my family opportunities in life, that's what means the most to me and what I'm most proud of,\" Biggar said.\n\"To my amazing wife Alex and my two beautiful boys I can't thank you enough for everything you've done for me. You were always there to pick me up when things were low and have been by my side through everything when I've needed it. I'm very lucky.\"\nBiggar also remembered his late mother, who he described as his \"biggest fan\".\n\"The one person who isn't here to say thank you to is my mum, who sadly passed away four years ago,\" he said.\n\"Everything I've done over the last 18 years is because of her.\"\nDan Biggar welcomes his son to the Principality Stadium in 2022\nBiggar admitted wearing the prestigious 10 shirt for Wales \"hasn't always been plain sailing and easy\", but it helped to make him a stronger person and player. \nHe also reflected on a difficult past year at Toulon.\n\"I also know that the last 12 months haven't quite gone as I'd hoped with Toulon, it's been tough and setbacks teach you a lot more about yourself and over the last 12 months I've learned a huge amount,\" he said.\n\"There's no real perfect moment to walk away, but this does feel like the right one. \n\"I'm choosing to retire, which a lot of sportspeople don't get to do when they're healthy and I feel very grateful and excited about what's coming next.\n\"Rugby will always be a part of me, but now it's time to give a little bit of time back to my family in this beautiful part of the world and see what challenges come next.\"\nBiggar finished by thanking the game of rugby itself, the people, the memories and  lessons.\n\"I can honestly say I gave it everything I had and now it's time for something new,\" he said.\n\"Thank you, diolch, merci.\"",

There needs to be greater understanding that mouth is part of the body.\n\"We had players at screenings complaining of dental pain, bleeding gums, saying they were unable to train at some points because of dental infections. Once there has been trauma there can be ongoing problems, including with their ability and willingness to compete.\"\nFactors identified included poor hygiene habits such as a lack of brushing and flossing, high levels of sugary sports and fizzy drink consumption, and stress - possibly due to a high-performance environment - which can cause teeth grinding and lead to decay.\nThe study also suggested some cases of tooth wear were related to gastric acids, with dental screenings revealing patterns similar to those from acid reflux and even in eating disorders like bulimia.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone\nThe study is the first to investigate oral health among footballers aged 16 to 18, and the first to include female players.\nDr Konviser said he was \"surprised\" by the comparatively high levels of decay and disorders, given these are athletes in elite sporting set-ups whose health is being constantly assessed.\n\"There are many possible causes of wear, and we are not there to diagnose anything but to flag problems to medical teams,\" he said. \"It was surprising to see the prevalence, especially among younger age groups.\"\nOnly 76% of players confirmed that they brush their teeth twice a day, compared to 81% of 15-year-olds in England.\nIt found 76.8% of the players in the study had gingivitis - inflammation of the gums - compared to just 40% of 15-year-olds in England, with 22.5% showing signs of irreversible gum disease.\nVisible decay that required treatment was present in 31.2% of players, compared to 24% of 15-year-olds across England, while moderate to severe levels of tooth wear was seen in 15.5% of participants.\nThe study found players were relying on a pre-season check-up rather than visiting the dentist regularly, with one in five having not attended the dentist in more than two years.\nIt said findings correspond to high levels of oral disease in male senior players identified in a previous UCL-led study in 2016, which found football players' oral health was 10% worse than average for men of the same age.\nDr Konviser said clubs had been \"very receptive\" of the study - which was initially conceived in 2019 but delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, then took several years to come to fruition - and called on those clubs and the FA to take a \"top-down approach\" to making \"sports dentistry routine among players\".\nAmong solutions suggested are players rinsing their mouths with water after consuming energy drinks, and being encouraged to go to regular dental check-ups.",

        "article_text": "Asia-Pacific stocks from Shanghai to Tokyo and Sydney to Hong Kong plunged on Monday by levels not seen in decades, as global markets continue to reel from US President Donald Trump's tariffs.  \nThe Shanghai Composite was down more than 8% at one point, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped more than 13% and Japan's Nikkei 225 closed down by 7.8% - moves that one analyst described to the BBC as a \"bloodbath\".\nEuropean markets too fell in early trading, with banks and defence firms seeing the biggest drops. This follows global slumps last week after Trump announced new tariffs between 10% and 46% on most countries. \nThis is a blow for Asia's manufacturing hubs that count the US as a key market for exports ranging from clothes to cars. \nThese include wealthy allies like Japan and South Korea, which face 26% tariffs, as well as developing countries like Vietnam that are bracing for a 46% levy - Trump called the fast-growing economy one of the \"worst offenders\". \nAlso on that unenviable list are Cambodia (49%), Thailand (36%) and China, which will face 54% tariffs in total. \nOthers like Singapore, New Zealand and Australia have already had a so-called baseline 10% tariff go into effect. \n\"Asia is bearing the brunt of the US tariff hike. While there could be some room for negotiation, a new regime of higher tariffs is here to stay,\" Qian Wang, Asia Pacific chief economist at investment firm Vanguard.\nAsian economies are also particularly sensitive to fears that a global trade war could trigger a slowdown or even a recession in the US, the world's biggest economy. That, in turn, would further hurt Asian exports. \nSlumps in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan were exacerbated as investors caught up with the big falls seen in other markets on Friday as they were closed for public holidays.\nThe Shanghai Composite closed 7.3% lower and Taiwan Weighted Index lost 9.7% - its biggest drop on record.\nThe ASX 200 in Australia lost 4.2% and the Kospi in South Korea ended 5.6% lower.\nThe Hang Seng closed at 13.22%, its biggest drop since 2008. \n\"Tariffs are feeding into expectations around inflation and a recession,\" said Julia Lee, head of client coverage at FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group.\nGoldman Sachs now forecasts there is a 45% chance the US will fall into recession in the next 12 months - up from a previous estimate of 35% - as the investment banking giant lowered its economic growth forecast for the country.\nOther Wall Street firms have also revised their recession forecasts in the wake of Trump's tariff announcement. JPMorgan now sees a 60% chance of a US and global economic downturn.\n\"This is negative to the global and Asia economy, especially those small open economies, both in the short term and long-term.\"\nCountries from Vietnam to Bangladesh have become highly reliant on the US as an export market.\nSeveral major US brands produce goods in Vietnam, including Nike and Gap.\nBangladesh exports $8.4bn (\u00a36.5bn) of garments a year to the US, according to the trade body, Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. \nSo Trump's announcement last week of a 37% tariff on Bangladesh is bad news for the South Asian nation.\n\"Asia is likely to feel a disproportionate brunt of this turmoil because Asia sends more exports to the US than to other markets,\" said Frank Lavin,  former undersecretary for international trade at the US Department of Commerce.\nAsia's biggest economy, China, has also hit back with its own tariffs, deepening the global stock market turmoil on Friday.\nAll three major US stock indexes in fell by more than 5%, with the S&P 500 dropping almost 6%, capping the worst week for the US stock market since 2020.\nIn the UK, the FTSE 100 plunged almost 5% - its steepest fall in five years, while exchanges in Germany and France faced similar declines.\nMs Lee also highlighted that the global stock market rout looks set to continue: \"US futures trading lower point to another hard session on Wall Street tonight.\"\nGlobal stock markets have lost trillions in value since Trump announced sweeping new 10% import taxes on goods from every country, with products from dozens of countries, including key trading partners such as China, the European Union and Vietnam, facing far higher rates.\nAdditional reporting by Annabelle Liang",

He made a comeback in 2005's Sin City, and was nominated for an Oscar for best actor for 2008's The Wrestler.\nSince becoming a child star on TV show Dance Moms in 2014, JoJo Siwa has forged a career as a multifaceted cultural force, releasing music, acting in Nickelodeon TV shows and films, and setting a trend for inescapable oversized hair bows. Delighting in her rainbow-coloured and sometimes provocative persona, she claimed last year to have invented \"gay pop\".\nTrisha Goddard became a household name thanks to her self-titled daytime talk show, which ran on ITV and Channel 5 between 1998 and 2010, before she took it to the US and then joined TalkTV. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008, and revealed last year that it had returned and was now stage four.\nDaley Thompson is a legend of British athletics. He won Olympic golds in the decathlon in 1980 and 1984, and went undefeated in all competitions between 1979 and 1987.\nJack P Shepherd has been a fixture on Coronation Street for 25 years, playing Gail's son David Platt since he was 12. However, his contract ends this year and there are reports he could be leaving Weatherfield.\nPatsy Palmer has soap opera immortality as Bianca Jackson in EastEnders, a role she first played in 1993. She made her latest comeback in 2024, playing a key part in the 40th anniversary live episode this February.\nMichael Fabricant was a long-serving Conservative MP, sitting in the House of Commons between 1992 and 2024, when he lost his seat. Nicknamed Mickey Fab and known for his lustrous blonde hair, he has been on Celebrity First Dates, and has described himself as the \"life partner\" of former West Midlands Mayor Sir Andy Street.\nChesney Hawkes played the lead role in 1991 film Buddy's Song, but his music career overtook his acting when The One and Only - from the film's soundtrack - spent five weeks at number one and became one of the decade's most enduring pop hits.\nAngellica Bell is a former children's TV presenter, hosting on CBBC from 2000-06 including on shows like Xchange and Short Change, before branching out as co-host of The Martin Lewis Money Show and Shop Smart, Save Money, and winning Celebrity MasterChef.\nChris Hughes is one of the breakout stars of Love Island after finishing third in the 2017 series with Olivia Attwood. He also teamed up with co-star Kem Cetinay to release a single and a game show, and now presents horse racing coverage on ITV.\nComedian and actress Donna Preston plays Despair in Netflix's The Sandman and The Dead Boy Detectives.

        "article_text": "The last time there was no Manchester club in the Premier League's top two was 2016-17, and it has only happened four times since City were promoted in 2002\n\"Not so much red or blue - grey would be better.\"\nThe overwhelming feeling around the 196th Manchester derby was neatly summed up by a comment posted on the BBC Sport website.\nIt might be a stretch to claim, as one respondent did, it was 'the worst derby match in the world'. But the sentiment encapsulated the mood.\n\"It's a Manchester derby,\" seethed former United captain Gary Neville on Sky Sports after the dull goalless draw at Old Trafford. \"It should have more blood, thunder, risk, and courage involved in playing the game.\n\"The congratulations and love-in I'm watching says both teams are happy with 0-0. It looks like it's Sunday afternoon and they're going to go for a roast dinner together now.\"\nUnited head coach Ruben Amorim has not been in England long but the former Sporting boss has worked a few things out.\n\"I understand everything,\" he said. \"Gary Neville is critical about everything. I understand that part.\"\nAmorim's assessment was a simple one. How could anyone expect a reprise of the great games of the past, from either the red or blue sides of the great Mancunian divide, given where the two teams are at the moment?\nCity remain outside the top four, which would guarantee qualification for the Champions League next season. \nMore pertinently, while they remain fifth - which will almost certainly secure a spot in Europe's elite competition - they will drop down if Newcastle win either of their two matches in hand, starting with Monday's home match against nearly doomed Leicester.\n\"I understand we are, in the moment, doing the worst season in history,\" said Amorim. \"Manchester City won everything in the past but this season are struggling.\n\"We are not in the best moments to give the best spectacle to every fan. When we are not fighting for the big things, of course it's different.\n\"You have to look at the context of the game. I understand the critical aspect of players that played in this game in a different way, because they were fighting for the titles every time.\"\nUnsurprisingly, another outspoken former United captain wasn't having any of that.\n\"They get interviewed as if a draw isn't too bad,\" Roy Keane said. \"A draw doesn't get you anywhere fast. It isn't good enough.\n\"Forget the top teams. I'm on about competing with Brentford and Crystal Palace and Wolves and all these teams. Are you telling me Man Utd should be behind them, even with this group of players?\"\nFor context, United - on course for their worst-ever Premier League season - are six points ahead of Wolves. Brentford, one place above them in 12th, are four points ahead.\nThere were also post-match chants against the Glazer family from home fans who stayed behind, determined to crank up pressure on the American majority owners, who they blame for United's parlous state.\nBut Amorim and City boss Pep Guardiola have to set aside the noise to deliver significant improvement.\n\"You see the numbers of players who have been at the top for four, five, six years,\" said Guardiola. \"This year, we drop. It's not one, it's all of them - that's why we are struggling to win games.\"\nMan Utd midfielder Bruno Fernandes had a different take on the lack of intensity.\n\"It can't be like it was in the past, a lot of things have changed, with VAR, everything,\" he said. \"With VAR, you can't do that. We can't be as rough as we want in the duels. Everything has changed.\"\n\"That was one of the dullest Manchester derbies I've seen,\" Chris Sutton told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"It tells you where the clubs are at. Both have a lot of work to do in the summer.\"\nMan City miss chance to move into top four with dull derby draw\nFans 'should be ashamed' of Foden chants - Guardiola\nNo wins for top five - how race for Europe stands\nUnited's problems are huge.\nIt is difficult to imagine Amorim choosing many of the players available to him in an ideal squad.\nBut the fundamental point is a lack of goal threat. United have failed to score in 11 of their 31 Premier League games this season. Aside from matches against the three teams destined to go down, they have scored two goals or more on six occasions, including when they lost at home to Nottingham Forest on 7 December.\n\"We had the same lack of goal [threat],\" said Amorim, when asked about comparisons to last Tuesday's defeat by Forest at the City Ground.\nUnited need to be significantly better at recruitment in the summer than they have been on the pitch this term.\nWing-backs, central defenders and central midfield are all areas of weakness, let alone up front, where Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee continue to toil for little reward. It is now a combined four goals in 48 appearances for the pair since the Europa League win over Viktoria Plzen on 12 December, when Hojlund scored twice.\nOn Sunday, Amorim talked about how he thinks things are going on the good days. That implied there have been other days when he has wondered if United are heading in the right direction.\n\"In the moment it's still really hard every day, but of course you can imagine that the next season is going to be so much different,\" he said. \"That's why I'm always saying I'm in a rush. Everybody here is suffering a lot with all these changes. We have to show something in the next year, right away.\n\"In the good days you think like that, that it was important to come [here] in the middle of the season, to work with the players, to improve the players as soon as possible, to start the next season with the better idea of what we want.\"\nFor City, the journey to the preferred destination is far easier to navigate and there is more belief in Guardiola to keep everyone on the right path.\nYet, for them too there are hazards, not least in the unknowns. \nBy his own admission, he kept faith in too many of his long-serving players last summer. That will not happen again. \nWe already know Kevin de Bruyne is leaving but there are questions over plenty of others in his squad, not all of them fringe, injured or unwanted players. \nThe futures of Jack Grealish, Bernardo Silva and Ederson, all involved against United, have to be determined. \nJuventus full-back Andrea Cambiaso and Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Florian Wirtz are mentioned most frequently as likely additions to Guardiola's squad - but there will probably be more than two new faces.\nClearly, who they can sign will be impacted by the outcome of the hearing into the 115 charges of alleged Premier League financial rule breaches. Guardiola cannot control that situation. \nCity's status and the pull of the manager will ensure they remain an attractive proposition even if they fail to qualify for next season's Champions League. \nHowever, it would be a blow to his pride if, for the first time in his senior managerial career, he fails to take a team into the elite club competition. Not that he is thinking so far ahead. \n\"Eight games, Crystal Palace [next], go for it,\" he said. \"I'd prefer to have 10 or 12 more points but it is what it is. I'm not concerned about next season right now, I'm just concerned about recovery.\n\"Crystal Palace, Everton, Aston Villa and the FA Cup semi-final [against Nottingham Forest].\"\nLooking ahead for red and blue is appropriate in Manchester just now. It's the easiest way of banishing the memory of what happened (or didn't) at Old Trafford.\nPremier League Review with Darren Fletcher\nPremier League index\nPremier League table\nPremier League fixtures\nFollow your Premier League club and get news, analysis and fan views sent direct to you",

        "article_text": "We know Kevin de Bruyne is leaving Manchester City in the summer, but who else might be going - and who should stay?\nTheir rebuild has already started, with \u00a3180m spent on four players in January, but a major overhaul of Pep Guardiola's side looks likely at the end of what has been a troubled campaign, with the future of several stars in doubt.\n\"It feels like there are going to be big changes right through the squad,\" former City goalkeeper Shay Given told BBC Sport.\n\"City fans must have watched Sunday's Manchester derby and been thinking they have no idea what the future will look like - right now, no-one does.\n\"They spent a lot in January, and Omar Marmoush has been the stand-out signing from the players they brought in, but the others have struggled a bit.\n\"Nico Gonzalez and Abdukodir Khusanov are still adjusting to the pace of the Premier League, which shows why this rebuild won't be easy.\n\"In the past, any City signings under Guardiola have come into a team that was a winning machine, full of confidence and usually top of the league.\n\"It is a lot easier to join a side that is brimming with confidence and ripping teams apart every week, but Marmoush, Nico, Khusanov and Vitor Reis have joined a different City, with players who look nervous and the team struggling with and without the ball.\"\nAll four of City's midfielders who started Sunday's derby are over 30\nCity's lack of physicality in midfield has been a key factor in their decline and it is the area of the team that could see the biggest overhaul.\nA fit-again Rodri will surely return as the fulcrum of their side when he recovers from his long-term injury, but who will be alongside him is much less certain.\n\"De Bruyne says he is going, there are doubts over Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan's future and Jack Grealish has not really had a look in,\" Given explained.\n\"Bernardo and Gundogan have been such great players and won everything there is to win, but time catches up with everyone - like De Bruyne, they are both in their 30s now.\n\"It doesn't matter what they have done for City in the past, Guardiola will know he has to freshen things up.\"\nBayer Leverkusen's Germany international Florian Wirtz is high on City's list of targets, but Given feels they could have found the answer a lot closer to home.\n\"There are lots of players who City have let go recently, who they could really do with now,\" he said.\n\"Cole Palmer is an obvious one but I covered an Aston Villa game the other day and Morgan Rogers would bring all of the things that City need - pace, power and creativity.\n\"Imagine if he had only been loaned out in 2023, not sold, and there was the possibility of bringing him back in the summer? You would be thinking problem solved, the likes of Gundogan and De Bruyne can go.\n\"It's not going to be that simple, of course. City sold Rogers to Middlesbrough for about \u00a31.5m but think how much he would cost them now?\"\nGrealish scored City's first goal in Wednesday's 2-0 win over Leicester but was left out of the starting XI at Old Trafford. He replaced Ilkay Gundogan with 16 minutes to go\nIf there is an overhaul at the Etihad, then it will be with new faces, rather than tactics.\nGuardiola is never going to move away from a possession-based playing style and Given feels the old guard can no longer implement an important part of his gameplan.\n\"A lot of teams City play in the Premier League seem to have more energy, or legs, in the team,\" Given said. \"That's been an issue, because the way they press without the ball is so important to their playing style.\n\"A big part of their success down the years under Pep was when they won the ball back quickly, high up the pitch, within a few seconds of losing it.\n\"They would peg teams back and not let them out but now teams are getting through them. \n\"That needs to be rectified. It's something that will come with fresh legs from the people coming in, but that won't solve all the problems City have, because any new signings have to be the highest quality too.\n\"With De Bruyne leaving, I would love to see Guardiola build the team around Jack Grealish playing in a central role and dominating games, but it looks like the writing is on the wall for him to go as well.\n\"For whatever reason, it appears they are not getting on so it does not look good for Jack. He comes in, plays a game or two and then is back out again, no matter how well he does.\"\n\"I'm not just a fan of his, I am his ex-team-mate and friend. It's frustrating to see him being treated this way, because I know he has got so much more to offer the team. He just doesn't get the opportunities, and that is the manager's decision.\"\nStones was injured early in City's Champions League defeat by Real Madrid on 19 February and has not played since\nCity's defensive flaws have not been helped by a series of injuries to their senior centre-halves.\nRuben Dias, Manuel Akanji and Nathan Ake have all missed chunks of the season - Akanji and Ake are currently sidelined after surgery - while John Stones has been restricted to just six league starts.\nKhusanov and Reis, who have only recently turned 21 and 19 respectively, arrived as defensive reinforcements in January but Given would be wary of making sweeping  changes at the back.\n\"None of the four established centre-halves are near their mid-30s yet,\" Given said. \"Stones is the oldest, and he turns 31 in May, so I still feel they have all got plenty to offer. I'd be reluctant to let any of them go. With Stones, for example, they just have to get him fit.\n\"If the club considers them all to be injury prone, then that is a problem. But equally you can't just get rid of all that experience, because you need it in that position. A situation next season where Khusanov and Reis are at centre-half would be a bit worrying.\"\nThere is further uncertainty over the futures of Kyle Walker, on loan at AC Milan, and goalkeeper Ederson, who considered a move to Saudi Arabia last year before committing to another campaign at the Etihad.\n\"The club could get big money for Ederson to fund signings, but then they would have to replace him too,\" Given added.\n\"There are definitely other positions they should be looking at. Ederson is a brilliant goalkeeper, who is so vital to the way they play out from the back. I don't think there is another keeper in the world who is better with the ball at his feet.\n\"He is only 31, so he has plenty of years left at the very top level - I was 33 when I joined City, so I would certainly not be rushing him out of the door - they should try to keep hold of him if they can.\"\nEderson joined City from Benfica for \u00a335m in 2017. He won the Premier League Golden Glove award for most clean sheets in a season for three years running between 2020 and 2022\nWhatever City's next step is, they will have a new voice shaping their transfer strategy. Txiki Begiristain is leaving in the summer with Hugo Viana replacing him as director of football.\n\"I played with Hugo at Newcastle and I am looking forward to meeting him again,\" Given said. \"I am excited to see how he gets on at City but Txiki has left big boots to fill. For a long time City's transfers were brilliant, they hardly put a foot wrong.\n\"Fixing the squad is part of Hugo's job now but there is a lot of transition going on at the club and there is no guarantee any of it will be smooth.\n\"We are about to find out what Pep's masterplan is too and it will be fascinating to see how he does next season - he has only known amazing success with Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City and this is the first time in his managerial career that things have not gone his way.\n\"Can he rebuild City, and come back and win the Premier League again? That is the big question right now, isn't it?\"",

        "article_text": "When Rachel Chinouriri played London's O2 Arena last month, she cried.\nThe new wave indie songwriter was there as the support act for Sabrina Carpenter, just a week after her first Brit Awards, where she was nominated for artist of the year.\nSeven years after her debut single, those milestones felt like a validation. \nNo wonder she shed a tear.\n\"A lot of it was stress relief,\" says the 26-year-old, \"but I also felt strangely at home. \n\"I was just like, 'Wow, is this my life'.\"\nChinouriri was booked for the tour after Carpenter fell in love with her song All I Ever Asked and started playing it as her walk-on music in the US.\nWe speak on the 14th date, as she prepares to play Assago, Italy. By this point, she's having a blast \u2013 bounding across the catwalk every night, and dropping to her knees between songs to talk to the audience at eye level.\nBut she admits the first couple of shows were \"slightly rough\".\n\"I filmed Graham Norton for the first time on Friday, then it was the Brit Awards on Saturday. The tour started in Dublin on Monday, and I had to film a music video on my day off.\"\n\"I was having a lot of first time experiences and trying to figure out what I was comfortable with on the road,\" she says.\n\"I'd say from show five, I was starting to enjoy myself.\"\nIf there were nerves, they didn't show.\nThe singer's infectious energy and knotty pop-rock songs have been picking up new fans in every city. One reviewer called her set \"the perfect sweet treat before the main feast\". At the end of March, she surpassed 4 million monthly listeners on Spotify for the first time. Adele sent her a bouquet of roses.\nRachel Chinouriri is officially having a moment - but it hasn't come quickly.\nA former Brit School student, she released her first single, So My Darling, in 2018, and spent the next few years honing her sound. \nThe 2019 EP Mama's Boy was a mellow blend of soulful pop, while 2021's Four\u00b0 In Winter was full of atmospheric electronic soundscapes.\nUnderneath it all, though, Chinouriri was an indie kid. Raised in Croydon by strict Zimbabwean parents, she'd only been allowed to listen to Christian music at home. When they went out, the singer and her siblings would blast out hits by Coldplay, MIA, Lily Allen and Daughter.\nOnce she incorporated those sounds to her music, Chinouriri's career took off. All I Ever Asked \u2013 a chirpy rock anthem that disguises a desperately sad story about being undervalued \u2013 won her support slots with Lewis Capaldi and Louis Tomlinson.\nFlorence Pugh declared herself a fan, and ended up starring in the video for Never Need Me, a killer kiss-off to a boyfriend who left her dangling.\nFor a musician who'd suffered crippling anxiety as a teenager (\"I was pulling my hair out, and having panic attacks\") the success was entirely unexpected.\n\"British culture is quite self-deprecating,\" she says, \"so when I was younger, I just didn't believe I could do these things.\n\"Even the fact I can say I'm a two-time Brit nominee is still quite surreal. Then I'm like, Why is it surreal? \n\"I do deserve it because I've been making music since I was 16, and I haven't stopped'.\"\n\nChinouriri's debut album, the noughties-flavoured What A Devastating Turn Of Events, was finally released last May.\nInitially charting at number 17, it has continued to sell steadily, thanks to the continued popularity of All I Ever Asked on TiKTok, as well as Chinouriri's scene-stealing festival performances.\nReflecting on her rise, she says there is a \"privilege to having a slow-paced career\".\n\"I've seen what happens when you skyrocket or go viral. If I'd a massive hit song when I was 21, I wouldn't have been ready in any way, shape or form \u2013 mentally or professionally. I'd be panicking.\n\"So now that things are skyrocketing, I just need to remember that what I'm good at is writing how I feel and turning those feelings into music.\n\"And even though there's more opinions about what I'm doing now, I need to trust my gut.\"\n\nWhat A Devastating Turn Of Events was a huge emotional purge. Among the topics she discussed: Racism, school bullying, self-harm, alcoholism, alienation and toxic relationships.\nA recurring theme was men who take more from a relationship than they put back in.\n\"I'm quite a caregiver by nature, and that attracts boys who need a lot of help, or are very insecure,\" the singer reflects.\n\"I tend to be the person's 'mother', which isn't fun, because I have to be the strong one and there's no room for my emotions.\"\nBut the days of heartbreak are over. Last year, the singer unexpectedly found herself in a new kind of relationship, one where her needs are as important as her partner's.\nIt's written all over her new EP, Little House. \"Kissing me under the indigo / I begged for the morning sun not to rise / Oh, what a beautiful starry night,\" she sings, totally besotted, on the ballad Indigo.\nThe lead single, Can We Talk About Isaac, even uses her new partner's real name. His photo is on the artwork.\n\"It's quite a brave move,\" she laughs, \"but I'm a hopeless romantic, and I don't want to lose being able to document my life in song.\n\"It's a risk that whoever wants to date me was going to have to take!\"\nThe title track documents their chance meeting at a pub: \"With two pints in his hands, he came over and said, 'Nice to meet you'.\"\n\"He's very sweet, he's got a very simple friendship group, he likes going to the pub \u2013 but he does so much for me. It's the first experience I've ever had of being taken care of.\n\"He's changed my life, no matter what happens between us. We're both just really in love with each other and having a having a blast.\"\nAt the moment, though, the couple have been forced apart. The Sabrina Carpenter tour lasts five weeks, after which Chinouriri sets off for her first headline tour of North America.\nIt comes six months after the singer had to pull out of a US support slot with alt-pop star Remi Wolf. \nShe says the dates would have left her penniless, even with financial support from her record label.\n\"As much as I would have loved that tour, I wouldn't have been able to pay my rent, which was very, very scary,\" she says.\n\"My fans were like, 'Let's help out. Let's do a GoFundMe for 10 grand', but it was far beyond 10 grand. \n\"It was like, who's going to pay for visas, where's your band going to sleep, what are people going to eat? \n\"It was a big wake up call. It made me reassess; do I need to be styled all the time? Do I need to travel this way all the time?\n\"So now, I'm able to go back now in full force and upgrade my venues and sell out almost the entire tour, which is mental.\"\n\nThe cancellation taught her to slow down instead of grabbing every opportunity she's offered. \nIt's a sign that Chinouriri is finally shedding the self-doubt that clouded her early career.\nThe success of the Sabrina Carpenter tour is a prime example.\n\"There's always a risk as an opener, that people might be completely uninterested, but this has been the complete opposite,\" she says.\n\"Having the entire arena sing songs with you is such a blessed feeling to have.\"\nIt won't be long before she's selling out those arenas on her own.",

That is when there is expectation to win. That is when the fans are on you. There are 20 minutes to go, it's 0-0 or you are getting beaten. The pressure is heaped on you. Have you got it in you to stand up and be counted?\nThat is what makes or breaks a Rangers player. And, in this squad, there are not enough players with the mentality to get through those periods. That for me is where this squad is at - and that is the aspect that has let them down.\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app\nThis video can not be played\nSaturday's loss to Hibernian set an unwanted Rangers record of five straight home defeats\nThat is separate to the technical attributes of these players, though. They are good footballers. They have shown that in European games. They have shown that against Celtic. \nIt was only last month they knocked Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce out of the Europa League and went to Celtic Park and won for the first time in years.\nBut those games bring a different pressure. They bring a different expectation. Going into big European games, especially in the knockout rounds, rarely is there expectancy on Rangers to win.\nMeanwhile, domestically, they simply need to win, win, win. Their tempo needs to be high. They need to commit more bodies forward. \nHow many times have you watched a Rangers game where their two centre-halves are in the attacking half against one striker? That is because, in basic terms, they have to commit more in an attacking sense.\nBut you are at risk if you lose the ball. Just look at Hibernian's second goal on Saturday. It comes from a point where Rangers' defensive-minded players are in Hibs' half.\nIn Europe, you will rarely see that situation with a Rangers team, because they have more focus on the defensive side of their game.\nThe easier thing to do in football is be a defensive team. That is what I think this Rangers team are more comfortable doing. They feel more at ease playing in a defensively organised team that can then counter-attack. \nWhy is it easier? Well, in those moments, you are not coaching a set pattern to break a team down. When that is your gameplan, inevitably when you get possession, the opposition are not set up to be broken down. \nThese Rangers players are intelligent footballers. They get the gameplan of stopping the opposition and being clinical on the counter. They have shown that under Barry Ferguson away to Fenerbahce and Celtic playing in a 3-4-3 set-up.\nIn those games, when Rangers have won the ball, they have been in positions to score goals because even when they are sitting deep in a defensive formation, they always have three attackers forward.\nDefensively, they have more players deeper in the pitch and enough bodies to defend. And, in the attacking sense, having one striker and two number 10s means it is not just Cyriel Dessers or Vaclav Cerny running forward themselves.\nRangers' average player positions in last month's 3-1 win at Fenerbahce (left) and Saturday's defeat at home to Hibs (right) show a stark contrast between where their defensive line typically sits in European and domestic games\nThat approach did not work so well in the home leg against Fenerbahce, or the first half of their league game at Dundee, when they were perhaps expected to take the game to the opposition.\nBut for Thursday's encounter with Athletic Bilbao, I feel the first leg being at home should suit Rangers.\nMost European games that are two-legged affairs, particular in the latter stages of competitions, the first leg is always more cagey. It will probably be accepted a bit more by the Ibrox crowd if Rangers are a bit more solid. \nRangers would bite your hand off to go into that second leg in Bilbao at 0-0. But, make no mistake about it, this will be their toughest European game to date this season. \nThey are going to face a seriously technical team who are fourth in Spain's top flight. They have a top, top coach like Ernesto Valverde - a two-time La Liga winner as Barcelona boss - and they play with good tempo in their approach. \nThat is their model and how they play, so expect their set-up behind the ball to be really good if counter-attack opportunities arise for Rangers.\nThere is no getting away from how big a task this is for Ferguson and his unpredictable players, but that is not to say they cannot hurt them - they can.\nFormer Rangers striker Steven Naismith was speaking to BBC Sport Scotland's Nick McPheat",

        "article_text": "It's likely that you have not heard of Taiwan's Hong Fu Industrial Group, but look down on a busy street and you may well see its products.\nHong Fu is the world's second-biggest maker of trainers (sneakers) supplying shoes to Nike, Converse, Adidas, Puma and many others. It makes around 200 million pairs of sports shoes a year.\nSo when it made a big investment in India's market, the footwear industry took note. \nHong Fu is currently building a giant plant in Panapakkam, in the state of Tamil Nadu in south eastern India. When fully operation, sometime in the next three to five years, it will make 25 million pairs of shoes a year, employing as many as 25,000 workers.\nThe project has Indian partners, including Aqeel Panaruna, the chairman of Florence Shoe Company: \"The international market is saturated and they [Hong Fu] were looking for a new market,\" he explains. \n\"There is a drastic increase in non-leather footwear in India. It has huge potential,\" Mr Panaruna added.\nThe Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports.\nTo spur the industry, last August the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced new quality rules for all shoes sold in India. \nUnder those standards, for example, materials will have to pass tests of strength and flexibility.\n\"These BIS standards are really about cleaning up the market. We've had too many low-quality products flooding in, and consumers deserve better,\" says Sandeep Sharma a journalist and footwear industry expert. \nBut many in India can't afford shoes from well-known brands. \nServing them is a huge and intricate network of small shoe makers, known as the unorganised sector. \nTheir affordable products are estimated to account for two-thirds of the total footwear market. \nAshok (he withheld his full name) counts himself as part of that sector, with shoe making units all across the district of Agra in northern India. He estimates that 200,0000 pairs of shoes are made everyday by operations like his across Agra. \n\"Many consumers, especially in rural and lower-income urban areas, opt for cheaper local footwear instead of branded options,\" he says.\n\"Many organised brands struggle to expand their retail footprint in semi-urban and rural areas because we cater to them.\"\nSo how will the new government standards affect makers like Ashok?\n\"It's complicated,\" says Mr Sharma. \n\"I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can't just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide.\n\"What I'm seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They're pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It's not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold.\"\nMaking the situation more complicated is that the unorganised sector is well-known for making counterfeit shoes of big brands. \nWhile popular among Indian shoppers looking for a stylish bargain, other countries have long-complained about the losses caused.\nMeanwhile, a host of new Indian trainer-makers are springing up, to serve India's growing middle class.\nSabhib Agrawal is trying to get those buyers interested in barefoot footwear - shoes which, their makers say, are healthy for the foot as they encourage natural, or barefoot, movement.\nMr Agrawal says his company, Zen Barefoot, is unusual as much of the Indian footwear industry is not very innovative. \n\"There are very few people who are ready to take time and invest in new technologies here. Indian manufacturing is a very profit- first market, ROI [return on investment] driven.\n\"And in a lot of cases, even the government is not ready to enable these industries through grants or tax relief, which makes it quite difficult.\"\nComet is one Indian firm looking to innovate.\nIt claims to be the first homegrown trainer brand that owns the whole production process, from design to manufacturing.\n\"This level of control allows us to experiment with materials, introduce innovative silhouettes, and continuously refine comfort and fit based on real feedback,\" says founder Utkarsh Gupta.\nHe says the Comet shoes are adapted to India's climate and roads.\n\"Most homegrown brands rely on off-the-shelf soles from the market, but when we started Comet, we realized that these were lacking in quality, durability, and grip,\" he says.\nChange is coming to the footwear sector he says. \"The shift to high value is now happening.\"\n\"Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,\" he adds. \nBack in Agra, Ashok hopes that the unorganised sector is not neglected amid the growth of India's footwear industry.\n\"The government should give us accreditation and certificates so our factories don't close down. Once we too are included in the organised sector no one can beat India in the shoe manufacturing industry.\"\nBut Mr Sharma says change is inevitable.\n\"The market is definitely going to shift. We'll see the bigger players getting bigger - they have the money to adapt quickly.\n\"But I don't think the small guys will disappear completely. The smart ones will find their niche.\"",

        "article_text": "India's longest and most holy river, the Ganges, is home to thousands of dolphins. But their survival is under threat.\nBut these aren't like the ones found in oceans. They don't leap out of the water in spectacular arcs; surface for long intervals or swim in an upright position. Instead, they swim sideways, spend much of their time underwater, have long snouts and are almost completely blind.\nThese are Gangetic dolphins, a species of river dolphin - and India's national aquatic animal - that's found largely in the Ganges-Brahmaputra river system in the northern part of the country.\nA new survey finds India's rivers host around 6,327 river dolphins - 6,324 Gangetic and just three Indus dolphins. A majority of the Indus dolphins are found in Pakistan as the river flows through both the South Asian countries.\nBoth these dolphin species are classified as \"endangered\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). \nResearchers from the Wildlife Institute of India surveyed 58 rivers across 10 states between 2021 and 2023 to produce the first comprehensive count of India's river dolphins. \nThe origins of river dolphins are as fascinating as the creatures themselves. Often called \"living fossils\", they evolved from marine ancestors millions of years ago, say scientists. \nWhen the sea once flooded low-lying areas of South Asia, these dolphins moved inland - and when the waters receded, they stayed. Over time, they adapted to murky, shallow rivers, developing traits that set them apart from their ocean-dwelling cousins.\nExperts say the new survey is crucial for tracking river dolphin populations. Since 1980, at least 500 dolphins have died - many accidentally caught in fishing nets or killed deliberately - highlighting the ongoing threat to the species.\nConservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha says that up until the early 2000s, there was very little awareness about river dolphins.\nIn 2009, the Gangetic river dolphin was declared India's national aquatic animal to boost conservation. Steps like a 2020 action plan and a dedicated research centre in 2024 have since helped revive its numbers.\nHowever, conservationists say there's still a long way to go.\nDolphins continue to be poached for their flesh and blubber, from which oil is extracted to use as fishing bait. Other times, they collide with boats or get caught in fishing lines and die.\nNachiket Kelkar of the Wildlife Conservation Trust told Sanctuary Asia magazine that many fishermen often didn't report accidental deaths of dolphins fearing legal trouble. \nUnder Indian wildlife laws, accidental or targeted dolphin killings are treated as \"hunting\" and carry strict penalties. As a result, many poor fishermen quietly dispose of the carcasses to avoid fines. \nRiver cruise tourism, which has picked up in India in the past decade, has further threatened their habitat. Dozens of cruise trips operate on both the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers.\n\"There's no doubt that disturbances from cruises will gravely impact the dolphins, which are sensitive to noise,\" conservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha told The Guardian newspaper.\nMr Sinha believes that increased vessel traffic could push Gangetic dolphins towards extinction, much like it did to Baiji dolphins in China's Yangtze river.\nRiver dolphins face threats partly due to their own evolution. Nearly blind, they rely on echolocation - high-pitched sound pulses that bounce off objects and return as echoes - to navigate murky waters. While this trait suits their habitat, it also makes them vulnerable to modern threats.\nTheir poor eyesight and slow swimming speed make river dolphins especially prone to collisions with boats and other obstacles. Adding to their vulnerability is their slow reproductive cycle - they mature between six and 10 years of age and females typically give birth to just one calf every two to three years.\nBut Mr Sinha is hopeful about the future of river dolphins in India. \"Government initiatives have played a big role in saving the dolphins. A lot has been done but a lot more remains to be done too,\" he says.",

        "article_text": "Five years on from Megxit, as the Duchess of Sussex builds her new lifestyle empire, her viewing figures are high but, in the UK at least, popularity levels are low. So, ahead of the release of her new podcast tomorrow, experts ask whether anything she does can win wider appeal?\nListen to Daniela read this article \n\"The problem is that people are much more interested in the royal gossip than they are in learning how to make a jam.\" The Countess of Sandwich gets to the crux of what she sees as the Duchess of Sussex's rebrand dilemma.\nAs an American woman who married into the British aristocracy back in 2004, the countess knows firsthand the challenge of slipping between two cultures.\nWhen I first spoke to her about this - long before \"Megxit\" - she was positive that Meghan would win over the nation. \"Having this American optimism and this go-get attitude, that is what you guys kind of like about us, right?\" she told me.\nSeven years on, the countess remains optimistic about Meghan's progress. \"As an American, I look at her and I think she's a hustler. She's taking these opportunities, using them as stepping stones to get to where she wants to go.\" \nOnly not everyone appears to agree. In the UK, Meghan's popularity rating was just 19% at the start of 2025 according to a YouGov poll, down from 26% a year earlier. (In the US, the view is slightly more favourable, sitting at 43% in January 2025.)\nHer recent Netflix lifestyle series, With Love, Meghan, which featured her upcycling supermarket bouquets and scenting flannels with lavender water, wasn't received entirely warmly either. \nDespite it being the tenth most watched Netflix programme globally in its first week, audiences gave it a rating of just 33% on the film and television review website, Rotten Tomatoes (based on more than 2,500 votes).\nThis was followed by the launch of her new brand As Ever, selling, among other things, \u00a311 ($14) edible flower petals and jars of \u00a321.50 ($28) wildflower honey. These sold out within a day, yet this too was met by criticism in some quarters \u2014 with prices being lambasted and some questioning whether Meghan had a clear vision for the brand.\nNow, she is set to host a new podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder, which launches tomorrow. In an Instagram post, she wrote with some excitement: \"I've been having candid conversations with amazing women who have turned dreams into realities.\" But the question now is how will this be received.\nAnd, as her era of brand builder, lifestyle influencer, and businesswoman steams on, what will it really take for her to broaden her popularity and win over those who are circumspect - or downright negative? \nOr could it be that no matter how successful her bottom line or however pioneering her next project, a wider issue is holding back the possibility of broader appeal - and if that really is the case, how to shrug that off?\nIt has been five years since the Duke and Duchess of Sussex walked out of Westminster Abbey, after the annual Commonwealth Service, and into a life away from royal duty.\nAs the couple's grand finale in the UK, it made the optics around the service incredibly tense. Even the question of how the royal party should enter the Abbey became a sticking point.\nThe printed order of service did not include Prince Harry and Meghan in the official royal arrival. The plan had been for them to take their seats earlier, and for Elizabeth II to lead a small procession of senior royals into the Abbey slightly later. However this decision upset the couple, according to those planning the service.\nIt was eventually decided, in order to diffuse the situation, that the Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales (back then, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge) would not walk behind the Queen either. Instead, like Prince Harry and Meghan, they would take their seats earlier.\nSomeone who attended the service that day described it to me as \"deeply uncomfortable\".\nThe friction set the mood for the years ahead. And though Meghan has only made two visits to the UK since 9 March 2020, and her life is now firmly rooted in her home state of California, the impact continues, according to some experts.\nAccording to Evan Nierman, a US-based public relations guru: \"Whatever she does to distance herself, it comes back to Buckingham Palace and her relationship with the Royal Family.\"\nMark Borkowski, founder of the UK-based Borkowski communications agency, also believes that whatever Meghan does next, it will always be filtered through \"the royal lens\". \"Even when Meghan is launching jam or Harry is speaking about mental health, the coverage returns to the same question: are they thriving or failing in their post-royal life?\" \nThere have been questions around choices the couple have made since leaving the UK, too, particularly around the polarising interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, and through the publication of Prince Harry's memoir Spare in 2023.\nOne source who has worked with them described this as \"brave and idiotic\".\nWith that chapter behind them, it was natural that they would focus on new income streams that don't involve talking about the Royal Family. But as Mr Nierman, founder of Red Banyan Public Relations in the US, puts it: \"She's trying to stand out on her own, but she has this level of notoriety and fame that is inextricably linked to the Royal Family.\" \nMuch of the response to Meghan, positive or negative, \"is driven by her marriage to Prince Harry and her ties to the Royal Family\", argues James Crawford, managing director of PR Agency One. \"That connection shapes how everything she does is received.\"\nEarly indications are that though her public popularity may not be sky-high, this is not necessarily translating into lack of business success.\nSome critics, though, tell another story. Tina Brown, the former Vanity Fair editor, put her own review somewhat harshly, concluding that Meghan has an \"unerring instinct for getting it wrong\". \nOn the Netflix series, which was released on 4 March, she added: \"Meghan has come out with a show about fake perfection just when the zeitgeist has turned raucously against it.\"\nOther criticism has also focused on a perceived lack of relatability, in a show that was designed to revolve around the duchess casually sharing hosting tips with friends.\n\"High on gloss, low on human connection,\" said British Vogue. \"Toe-curlingly unlovable TV,\" said The Guardian, while The Telegraph, somewhat cruelly, called the series an \"exercise in narcissism\".\nRoyal author Sally Beddell Smith, meanwhile, feels that the approach itself was a misstep. \"What mystifies me is why not relaunch The Tig,\" she says, referring to the lifestyle website that Meghan once ran. \n\"It had brand loyalty and was easily identifiable. She did it well. It was snappy, it had a reason to exist. It could have really given her a leg up. Why not reignite it?\"\nAnd yet negative responses will not have surprised Prince Harry and Meghan, according to people who work with the couple. They were, I'm told, braced for criticism.\nAnd there were positive responses too, particularly outside the UK. \"Some international press praised the show's warm, feel-good tone and visual polish, seeing it as a natural return to Meghan's pre-royal lifestyle roots,\" points out Mr Crawford. \n\"Likewise, her brand has been well received in some quarters for its positioning and premium aesthetic.\"\nWith Love, Meghan was far from a disaster in the ratings, with 2.6 million views in its first week. Though this was well behind the launch of a sci-fi drama, Halo: Season One, which had 4.2 million views in the same period, experts point out that such comparisons are perhaps unfair. \n\"I would never have predicted it to be right at the top of charts,\" argues Adam Miller, TV editor of Metro. \"A lifestyle show is never going to be at the top against a drama or a thriller... For Netflix, I reckon it's about as expected.\"\nWhat's more, With Love, Meghan was never going to change opinions of those who are already, for whatever reason, predisposed against her - just as her new podcast series is unlikely to. \nExisting Meghan fans will likely enjoy the programme. For those who don't like Meghan, the series is likely to irritate. And according to some experts, a Marmite effect is no bad thing. \n\"In today's polarised media landscape, divisiveness isn't always a disadvantage,\" argues PR guru Mr Crawford.\nThe wider question is how to respond to it. And Meghan's recent approach has become more direct. After podcaster Amanda Hirsch posted a picture of the Netflix series trailer with the caption: \"You guys I'm scared for Meghan,\" the duchess allegedly responded with a handwritten note. \n\"Dear Amanda, I heard you are feeling scared,\" the note reads. \"Don't be. This is the fun part \u2014 let's enjoy it.\"\nLikewise, she responded with humour to rumours of a potential feud with actress and Goop founder Gwyneth Paltrow.\nIn an Instagram video, Ms Paltrow remarked: \"I genuinely do not understand this at all, whatsoever.\" She then turned her head to ask someone off screen: \"Do you understand this?\" The actress revealed Meghan sitting beside her, who shrugged her shoulders nonchalantly, while eating a piece of pie.\nIt was a marketing triumph - a sign that, while she's taking notice, she knows what is really needed. That is, a fresh approach - and that's what Meghan the businesswoman is all about.\nAway from business, life for the couple in California is largely a private one. Their multi-million dollar home in Montecito, around two hours drive up the coast from Los Angeles, is secluded and well-guarded and they have kept their circle of loyal friends tight - among them, tennis star Serena Williams, as well as actress Abigail Spencer.\nMeghan has talked about bonding with parents of her children's friends too, describing nights out, Pilates classes and sharing children's parties.\nWhen the couple go out for dinner, however, they are mostly left to themselves. Chef Vikram Vij has a restaurant in Vancouver where he says the couple have dined on several occasions. \"Everybody knew they were there but they weren't disturbed,\" says Mr Vij.\n\"They were both aware and so respectful of every person that came in contact with them,\" he adds. \"They took the time to say hello to us as a kitchen [and] paid the whole bill for themselves and their security, which I thought was very respectful.\"\nYet for every positive story comes a negative one \u2013 with contradictory claims of less positive experiences from those who have worked with and known the couple.\n\"The atmosphere around Harry and Meghan is so febrile,\" says Vanity Fair contributing editor, Anna Peele, who spent months working on a piece about the couple.\nMore recently, a row around the running of Sentebale, the charity that Prince Harry co-founded in honour of his late mother, has escalated into a bitter dispute, which will now be investigated by the Charity Commission. \nInsiders and those who have worked at Sentebale have been robust in their defence of Prince Harry and Meghan, and critical of accusations.\nBut though this is largely a story about Prince Harry and his charity work, there is a Meghan element to it too, suggesting she is still not able to disentangle herself and her brand from interest in the Royal Family.\nThe question of where Meghan and Prince Harry go from here is up for debate. \"They keep trying new things,\" argues Ms Peele. \"Harry and Meghan have the best of intentions but intentions doesn't always mean impact.\"\nMr Niemar, meanwhile, believes that the best way to address this is to shake off the past and keep doing what they are already doing.\n\"They got what they were after - global fame exposed what they felt they needed to do,\" he says. \"But you can only ride that train for so long\u2026 She's doing the right thing trying to carve out something new.\"\nHowever their next steps require careful consideration. For royal author Sally Bedell Smith, it's no longer just about where Meghan pivots next, but how Prince Harry fits into that. \"Do they scale back and live in a more modest way? Does Harry throw himself into the cause of helping veterans and do things in a quiet way and at a lower key?\"\nWith a pause she adds: \"He's now a spare to his wife.\"\nAnd yet many royal watchers are optimistic that, despite some negative reviews of late, their path ahead will be a success. \"It's never too late to turn things around,\" says Katie Nicholl, journalist and author of The New Royals. \n\"But there's a sense that these two need to listen to their advisers, focus on the next five years and really have a concrete plan... Hollywood is a hard town to crack and they've proved that royal titles alone aren't enough to guarantee success.\"\nWhat that success could look like is a bigger question still. Some have mooted a return to acting for Meghan, who previously starred in the legal drama, Suits, though no one I spoke to recently felt this was realistic. (Although a cameo on the reboot of Suits, which will be set in Los Angeles, would cause a stir.)\n\"She's not the same person she was on Suits. She's not the American girl at the Palace,\" argues Ms Peele. \"She has evolved.\" So far, this involves being a business mogul, lifestyle entrepreneur and content creator.\nBut Katie Nicholl believes that much of their potential now lies away from lifestyle programming and media deals. \n\"While they need to be commercially successful, I think much of their success depends on their philanthropy, on really developing their Archewell Foundation and using their global spotlight for good.\n\"That's where they really have impact and stand out.\"\nTop picture credit: Getty Images.

        "article_text": "Rory McIlroy's Augusta troubles started on the 10th hole of the final round in 2011 with a wayward drive into the trees down the left\nIt is often referred to as the most important distance in golf; the five inches between the ears.\nThe game is as much a test of temperament as technique and champions at the very highest level have to conquer both elements to land the biggest titles.\nIn their pomp the likes of Colin Montgomerie and Lee Westwood had the physical attributes to win any tournament they played. But something would always get in the way when it came to the majors; the big four tournaments that define careers.\nThere was always a stumbling block at the Masters, The Open, the US Open or US PGA Championship. It prevented them, and many others, from producing their best shots when they most needed them.\nIt is not a slight to say this. It's golf. The mental challenge of pulling off key shots when the only inhibiter is the pressure of the moment encapsulates the magic of the game.\nIt will be evident in abundance again this week as Rory McIlroy embarks on his latest attempt to complete the career Grand Slam. He is among the world's best who are all gathering together for the first time in eight months for the Masters at Augusta National.\nMasters - dates, tee times, favourites & how to follow on the BBC\nMcIlroy can cope with Masters pressure - Mickelson\nMcIlroy dealing with elbow issue before Masters\nThese major weeks are the ultimate individual examination and for all his prolific form at tour level, McIlroy has failed to add to his tally of four major wins since 2014.\nWe wonder why Westwood and Monty never won a major, why it took Phil Mickelson until his 13th year on tour to land his first win on this elevated stage but the most burning current question surrounds McIlroy's frustrations - the majors and most pertinently the Masters.\nSo precocious was the Northern Irishman's talent when he first competed as a teenager in 2009 he was asked about completing the Grand Slam by the age of 22.\nTwo years on at Augusta he led by four shots going into the final round, only to shoot 80 in a scarring denouement. Despite four subsequent top-five finishes, he has never since embarked on the final day back nine with a real chance of glory.\n\"The biggest challenge for Rory is the mental one,\" said Paul McGinley. The former Ryder Cup captain's Golf Channel colleague, Brandel Chamblee, added of the Masters. \"It is literally his nemesis, It brings out the worst golf in Rory annually.\"\nMcIlroy dropped six shots in three holes in the final round as his hopes of winning the 2011 Masters evaporated\nThe popular view is that McIlroy suffers from a build up of mental scar tissue, first triggered by that Augusta capitulation in 2011.\nAlthough he quickly started collecting his quartet of majors, post 2014 there have been many instances where further setbacks have added to the malaise. Most recent was last year's US Open where he was beaten by to the title by Bryson DeChambeau despite leading by two with five holes to play.\n\"It is possible for people to build something up in their heads and say this is the one that I struggle with because previously something bad happened,\" chartered psychologist Stephen Smith told BBC Sport.\n\"That memory hasn't been processed properly out of what we call the short term executive memory into your long term memory. \n\"And it's literally interfering with the performance message from the higher order brain. \n\"It's almost like a mini form of PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder).\"\nSmith has worked with athletes across a wide range of sports and says bad memories can influence physical performance.\n\"The wire that carries the performance movement message from your brain to your body gets that wonderful swing going in a connected way,\" he said.\n\"And that's why you make more mistakes on that hole or on that course or in that tournament, because you're just literally not able to send the signal to the muscles. It's getting interfered with by what you would call scar tissue.\"\nNot since that ill-fated tilt in 2011, when he began with a 65, has McIlroy made a dominant start to the Masters. He has only broken 70 on one occasion - a 69 in 2018 when he finished tied fifth behind Patrick Reed after a final round 74.\nIn this period he has won at every level, including the prestigious Players Championship twice. The second of those Sawgrass wins occurred only last month and that combined with a fine win at Pebble Beach in February is fuelling optimism for this week.\nThe now 35-year-old is second favourite behind defending champion Scottie Scheffler, who has yet to win this year. Indeed, of all the biggest names, McIlroy has had the most successful start to the year.\nStars are aligning for him to win the one major to elude him.\nVictory this week would put him alongside the all time greats; Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods - the only golfers to have won all four majors and completed the Grand Slam collection.\nMcIlroy is desperate to wear the famous Green Jacket, but can you want it too much?  \n\"That's a very good point,\" said Smith.\n\"All of this is said without me ever having spoken to Rory, I couldn't comment as to how accurate my views on the situation are.\n\"But looking at it from outside the goldfish bowl that is tournament golf, you look at it and say, OK, right, maybe that's it, it could be that he actually wants it too much.\"\nMcIlroy has been working with sports psychologist Bob Rotella in the build up to his 17th attempt at winning the Masters. \"I think he'll have him very well prepared now,\" McGinley said.\n\"They've had two or three runs at this now, and I think they will be coming up with a plan in terms of taking that pressure and decimating it and putting it aside.\"\nSmith believes the answer lies in reaffirming good memories, such as McIlroy's imperious opening drive in his three-hole play-off win over JJ Spaun at the Players three weeks ago. The champion admitted to being very nervous before that tee shot.\nNicklaus, winner of a record 18 majors, used to insist he never missed a short putt in the sport's biggest championships, which was not true but a valuable technique to reaffirm confidence. Woods would celebrate fine shots with a trademark move with his club.\n\"Tiger with his club twirl,\" said Smith, who is an associate fellow of the British Psychological Society. \"It's a hard copy down of the good stuff into the long-term memory so he can draw on it.\n\"I know that I can do it. I know that I've won.\"\nAnd while the notion of accumulated mental scar tissue is potentially ruinous, Smith believes that McIIroy is at a prime age to deal with any such issue.\n\"His emotional intelligence is growing, immensely,\" he said. \"He is not the man he was was when he was 29 or 30.\"\nAnd in 2025, McIlroy - without yet playing at his very best - looks assured. Using a different ball this year his technique, especially in his approach play, looks better nuanced and more effective.\nSo this might just be the year for the man with 28 PGA Tour wins, but no major victories in his past 38 attempts. He is playing the best golf of any of the leading contenders, but this week carries a mental burden far greater than any of his rivals.\nIt is the bit between the ears.\n\"You've got to own it because if you don't it'll just niggle away at you,\" Smith said. \"So you've got to almost burst that cyst, excise it, clean it out,  deal with it.\"",

        "article_text": "Once home to a thriving Jewish majority, Thessaloniki holds fragments of a lost world. One traveller's journey to find them leads to something even more powerful: living memory.\nAs my family admired the gleaming remodel of Thessaloniki's century-old Modiano Market, local culinary guide Smaragda Marki admitted to me that among the trendy cafes and German delicatessen, she wished it were just a little more Greek. \"I wish it were a little more Jewish,\" I responded, staring up at the colourful Easter decorations.\nThe newly reopened market had topped my list of places to go in Greece's second-largest city, bringing together my two favourite things to look for while travelling: good food and tidbits of Jewish history. However, Modiano left me dissatisfied on both counts. Though the building still bears the name of its Jewish architect and stands on the site of the former Talmud Torah Synagogue, little else hinted that the nut stand used to be a kosher butcher or that Jews had any other part of its past life.\nThessaloniki was once considered an epicentre of Jewish culture, one of the only cities in Europe where Jews were the majority. Known as Salonika at the time, it was part of the Ottoman Empire until 1912. The Ottoman Empire allowed Jews escaping the Spanish Inquisition in the 15th Century to settle there for hundreds of years. But with Ottoman power beginning to wane in the early 20th Century, Greece took over the city in 1912. Five years later, the Great Fire of 1917 devastated huge swaths of the city and left 70,000 people homeless, including much of the Jewish population. The Talmud Torah Synagogue (and 31 others) were destroyed. The one-time centre of Jewish culture and majority Jewish city received its final blow in 1943 when Nazi forces deported 50,000 Jews to Europe's concentration camps.\nEighty years later, I struggled to find traces of the community, and even finding a Jewish guide to show me around proved difficult. It wasn't surprising; Thessaloniki's Jewish community now numbers less than 1,000 people, a small population sample within which to find a niche professional tour guide. Plenty of companies offered tours of Jewish Thessaloniki, most touting bonafides by proximity to, rather than being a part of the small congregation.\nEventually, I booked through a company based in Athens because it was run by a Greek Jew. I still didn't know if my actual guides would be Jewish, though at least I could be sure they were trusted by the community.\nWhen Elia Matalon greeted us the next morning, I let out a sigh of relief. In the lobby of our hotel, he explained that he and his wife Hella Kounio-Matalon run their tours together and they both come from families that go back many generations in Thessaloniki's Jewish community. Later in the eight-hour tour he would tell us about how his mother survived the war by hiding in homes across the border in Albania while Kounio-Matalon spoke of her father surviving Auschwitz. We began walking toward a Holocaust memorial sculpture, through a narrow alleyway where he pointed to a restaurant owned by a gentile chef who became fascinated by the city's Jewish history and now serves traditional Sephardic Jewish foods like nogada (meatballs in walnut sauce).\nMuch of the city's history is Jewish history. In the Ano Ladadika neighbourhood, we stared up at the city's famous broken clock, stopped by an earthquake in 1978. The building originally belonged to a bank started by the Italian Jewish Allatini brothers, 19th-Century entrepreneurs whose flour company grew to be the largest in the Balkans before World War Two.\nWe walked down adjacent Siggrou Street and paused in front of a 1926 mansion. Today, it houses a hookah bar, which meant we could wander into the lovely plant-filled atrium and up the grand staircase. Outside, Matalon pointed out the holes in the doorpost where a mezuzah once hung. A visible symbol of Jewish identity, the traditional decorative case holds a prayer, fulfilling the commandment to \"write them on the doorposts of your house\".\nSo much of visiting Jewish history around the world is like this: evidence of where we once were. Visiting the former site of the Jewish cemetery. Peering at painted-over holes and fading stars of David. Jews left their mark on Thessaloniki, but hardly in a fashion that hints to the glorious centre of Jewish life it once was. I love to imagine what it was like to live in these rich Jewish worlds, what could be if we weren't constantly getting kicked out of places.\nAcross the street from Modiano Market, we entered one of the city's two remaining synagogues. Because Thessaloniki's laws granted properties owned by Jews before WW2 without surviving family members to the Jewish community, the congregation owns the building, which mostly houses offices, and the synagogue on the ground floor. Marble tablets on the wall list the more than 70 synagogues that served the city's once much-larger Jewish population. The money the rent brings in allows the synagogue to pay retirees to show up to complete their minyan (the minimum number of people needed for a prayer service), a win-win situation.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Mediterranean's ancient gay-friendly civilisation\n\u2022 The Tour de France champion who saved hundreds of Jews\n\u2022 The tiny, idyllic island where Greeks escape the heat\nOutside the building, I learned how a bench signals that a piece of Thessaloniki's Jewish culture still lives within. The decorative wooden top looks the same as any other bench, a comforting and welcoming place to sit on busy Vasileos Irakleiou, between a synagogue and Modiano Market. Below, a sturdy cement bollard telegraphs its true purpose: these surround all the remaining Jewish sites in the city, protecting them from potential violence by vehicle.\nWe see them again outside the only remaining pre-WW2 synagogue, the community's other house of prayer. The Monastir Synagogue escaped destruction by invading Axis forces because the Red Cross used it during the war, a story that would be slightly more heartwarming if they hadn't nearly destroyed it themselves by using it as a storehouse and stable. It has since been returned to its stained-glass and marble-walled glory.\nA large tour group from a cruise, wearing headsets to hear their guide, filed in, and I browsed the tiny museum in the foyer until they left, just a few minutes later. Then Matalon and Kounio-Matalon announced that they had a surprise for us. Together, they offered to sing a song in Ladino, the ancient version of Judeo-Spanish spoken by the region's Jews: Adio Kerido (Goodbye, Beloved), a love song repurposed as a farewell to Holocaust deportees.\nBy the time they stepped onto the bimah, the raised platform at the front of the sanctuary, I had already seen the history for which I came: the train car parked permanently at the station in memory of the city's Jews, who were deported in similar ones; the mansions built by the thriving majority population of the 19th Century; and the lovely, solemn Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki. But as their voices joined, reverberating in the incredible acoustics of the large room, singing \"Adio, adio, kerido\", I realised I'd found something even better: a unique Jewish culture still alive.\n\"No kero la vida,\" they sang hauntingly, beautifully, mournfully, \"I don't want to live.\" The song offered such sorrow for the departing love, but it brought me such happiness to hear, to see this moment, the kind of moment for which people travel.

        "summary": "The one-time centre of Jewish culture and majority Jewish city received its final blow in 1943 when Nazi forces deported 50,000 Jews to Europe's concentration camps.Naomi TomkyThessaloniki's Holocaust Memorial commemorates the city's 50,000 Greek Jews who were deported to Europe's concentration camps (Credit: Naomi Tomky)Eighty years later, I struggled to find traces of the community, and even finding a Jewish guide to show me around proved difficult. Though the building still bears the name of its Jewish architect and stands on the site of the former Talmud Torah Synagogue, little else hinted that the nut stand used to be a kosher butcher or that Jews had any other part of its past life.Thessaloniki was once considered an epicentre of Jewish culture, one of the only cities in Europe where Jews were the majority. Below, a sturdy cement bollard telegraphs its true purpose: these surround all the remaining Jewish sites in the city, protecting them from potential violence by vehicle.Naomi TomkyFrom a heyday of 70 synagogues, only two are left to serve the city's remaining Jewish population (Credit: Naomi Tomky)We see them again outside the only remaining pre-WW2 synagogue, the community's other house of prayer. I love to imagine what it was like to live in these rich Jewish worlds, what could be if we weren't constantly getting kicked out of places.Across the street from Modiano Market, we entered one of the city's two remaining synagogues. Together, they offered to sing a song in Ladino, the ancient version of Judeo-Spanish spoken by the region's Jews: Adio Kerido (Goodbye, Beloved), a love song repurposed as a farewell to Holocaust deportees.By the time they stepped onto the bimah, the raised platform at the front of the sanctuary, I had already seen the history for which I came: the train car parked permanently at the station in memory of the city's Jews, who were deported in similar ones; the mansions built by the thriving majority population of the 19th Century; and the lovely, solemn Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki.",

His final appearance was at the 2023 Rugby World Cup. \nHe won three Six Nations titles and a Grand Slam with Wales and was captain during the Wayne Pivac era.\nBiggar went on two British and Irish Lions tours, making three Test appearances in South Africa in 2021.\n\"There comes a point where you just know, not because of anything in particular, but someone once said to me 'when you know, you'll know',\" Biggar said as he announced his decision on social media.\n\"Rugby has given me everything. I threw myself into this game at 17 and it's given me a life that I could never have imagined.\n\"I've lived out my childhood dreams for the best part of two decades and I'm so, so grateful for that.\"\nBiggar started his youth career at Gorseinon RFC and Gowerton Comprehensive in Swansea before playing a season for Swansea RFC in the Welsh Premiership.\nHe made his senior Ospreys debut in 2008 and during an 11-year spell made 221 appearances and scored 2,203 points, making him the region's record points scorer.\nBiggar was also instrumental in securing two Pro12 titles in 2010 and 2012 and paid tribute to a former Ospreys coach in his retirement address.\n\"A special mention has to go to Sean Holley, who took a chance on a young, cocky 17-year-old when public opinion told him to do otherwise. Who knows if things would have turned out if you hadn't, so thank you Sean,\" he said.\nNorthampton came calling in 2018 and Biggar made 69 appearances for Saints, helping them to lift the Premiership Rugby Cup and reach the league knock-out stages in his first season.\nBefore his contract at Franklin's Gardens expired, Biggar took an opportunity to sign for French giants Toulon, where he will see out the remainder of the 2024-2025 season.\nToulon's Dan Biggar and Charles Ollivon celebrate winning the European Challenge Cup in 2023 \nReflecting on his career, Biggar said there had been moments in rugby he would never forget, including winning his first cap for Wales in 2008, becoming a Test centurion in 2022 and a Lion the previous year.\nBut he says those are not been his greatest achievements.\n\"The thing I'm most proud about is being able to give my family opportunities in life, that's what means the most to me and what I'm most proud of,\" Biggar said.\n\"To my amazing wife Alex and my two beautiful boys I can't thank you enough for everything you've done for me.

You dream of winning it yourself but to dream of putting your son up - when he was born I said he couldn't be the jockey the size of him, but he's turned out to be a fantastic jockey.\"\nPatrick is a student of the game, and the big race itself - devouring books on the history of this unique contest.\n\"I know the names of people who won the National nearly 200 years ago so to join that list is mind-blowing,\" he said, after winning the 177th running.\nThe Jockey Club said both long-time leader Broadway Boy, a heavy faller on the second circuit, and Celebre D'Allen - who was pulled up - were walked on to horse ambulances after being assessed on course by vets and taken to the racecourse stables for further assessment.\nWillie Mullins was the first Irish trainer since the legendary Vincent O'Brien 70 years earlier to win the British championship in 2024.\nHe is now poised to catch long-time leader Dan Skelton this time in the title race which concludes at the end of April.\nHaving started the day \u00a31m behind Skelton in prize money, he ate into that lead by \u00a3860,000 with the National result, and father and son even took the concluding race with Green Splendour.\nSo what does Patrick put the stable's success down to?\n\"It's my father's ambition. He's nearly 69 but he keeps wanting to get bigger and get better. I don't see him retiring, I just see him dying one day,\" he said.\nOn top of the emotion of seeing his son triumph, Willie was thinking of old school friend Sadie, the late wife of owner Stewart Andrew, who died from cancer just days after watching Nick Rockett's first win in 2022.\nAndrew said: \"Sadie's favourite colour was mustard and I always take that with me and I gave him a rub with it so it's worked, hasn't it?\n\"Somewhere up there she will be having a glass of champagne and kicking her heels up, which is what she would want me to do.\"\nGrand National 2025 result - where your horse finished\n'Like a Disney movie' - relieve Grand National day\n'He amazes me' - Mullins seals historic 100th Cheltenham Festival win",

        "article_text": "Which hobbies are best for meeting new people? Molly Gorman tested four of them \u2013 and discovered surprising facts about how and why we bond as a species.\nWalking into a busy climbing gym in London on a Friday night, I feel an overwhelming sense of dread. Desperately gazing past the staff at the reception desk, my eyes lock onto the sea of chalk-covered hands and limbs swinging between multi-coloured holds \u2013 all around five metres (16ft) above crash mats.\u00a0\nI am here as part of an experiment for our ongoing BBC series exploring the science \u2013 and art \u2013 of friendship. Cultivating friendships is key to our wellbeing, and to living a long life. As we mature and become more agreeable, it can actually get easier to form and maintain friendships. But where do you start?\nLondon is a city of nearly nine million people, but like anywhere, it can still be lonely. And without opportunities to mingle, it can be hard to try out and develop different friendship skills and strategies.\nFinding a hobby may seem an obvious way to foster social connection \u2013 in fact, research suggests that bonding through hobbies is a uniquely human trait. However, given the huge range of potential clubs, classes and activities, which one is actually best for making friends? And is there scientific evidence that some activities have more social potential than others?\nTo find out, I tested three new activities, and one existing hobby for comparison, and also explored the evidence-backed benefits they might offer. I chose a range of activities, from sports to art, across different budgets. For full transparency, I decided to mention the cost of each activity \u2013 since choosing a hobby can also be a matter of affordability. Here's what I found:\nIn late 2020, I moved to London from the countryside. Seeking to make friends in my local area as well as shape some kind of exercise routine, I decided to join a recreational netball league, which is perfect for those who may be more interested in the social aspect of a team sport, as opposed to the competitiveness.\nI soon found a wonderful team and we have now played together for four years. Every Monday evening, rain or shine, we take to the court, but we also meet up outside of the sport \u2013 whether that's for a drink after a match or dinner on the weekend.\nIf you are not naturally into ball games, this activity may not feel worth trying out \u2013 but research suggests that team sports can have huge benefits for people of all ages and all abilities. Inclusive sports can for example improve the wellbeing of children with disabilities by providing them with the opportunity to \"form friendships, express creativity, develop a self-identity and foster a meaning and purpose in life\".\nAccording to Arran Davis, an expert on social connection and health at the University of Oxford, in the UK, collaborative activities like team sports can not only make exercise feel easier, but can help us build social relationships. \u00a0\n\"There's a couple of ways that could happen: the first is just doing stuff together. So what psychologists call 'sharing intention',\" he says. This term refers to the phenomenon of connecting over or talking about a common goal or action. As Davis puts it, it's the sense of: \"'I think about what you're thinking about, you think about what I'm thinking about'.\"\nShared intention \"makes us feel a bit closer to one another and that can lead us to view one another as good cooperative partners or people that we feel more similar to\", he says. \"And these are the things that build friendships\u2026 through coordinating or collaborating, we're able to signal to each other that we're friends,\" he explains.\nDavis goes on to explain how endorphins and other natural chemicals released in the body when we do aerobic exercise, for example the feeling of \"runner's high\", can be enhanced when we're working in a team. \"Interestingly, these chemicals are also involved in primate bonding. When primates groom each other, they release endorphins, or when we laugh together, we release endorphins,\" he says. \"So this gives us a positive feeling that we then start to associate with the people around us. It can be a way to build connection through sharing a positive psychological state.\"\nA 2023 study compared social bonding between humans, and between other primates. It concluded that there may be something unique about the way we as humans bond through shared experiences, whether it's taking a walk together, dancing together, making music together, playing team sports or even just having a conversation. While positive social bonds are generally important for all primates, our special ability as humans to connect through shared, interactive experiences may help us learn more about each other, and ultimately coordinate and maintain larger social networks than other primates, according to the study.\nFor adults, team sport participation typically\u00a0declines\u00a0in older age, but research suggests it's never too late.\u00a0One study\u00a0examined the reasons why a group of adults over the age of 55 engage in team sports and found that community and togetherness were an important motivation, as well as the potential health benefits.\nFrom my experience, team sports are fantastic for making friends because not only do you see the same people on a weekly basis, but playing a sport together provides a topic of conversation to discuss and bond over. I have made lifelong friends through netball, and it always brings a burst of joy to my week (even when we lose).\nStill, I was curious about whether adding other activities could help me widen my social circle further \u2013 and reveal insights into our relationship with ourselves, as well as with others. That's how I ended up in the chalk-dusted bouldering gym...\nBouldering is a type of climbing where the route is\u00a0\"short but tricky\"\u00a0and is performed without a harness or ropes. Studies on bouldering and mental health suggest that the sport may have a positive effect on\u00a0symptoms of depression, more so than\u00a0home-based exercise, for example.\u00a0In one study, 133 patients with depression were assigned bouldering psychotherapy for ten weeks \u2013\u00a0the results showed that bouldering alleviated their symptoms. (Of course, depression is a complex condition, and if you are worried about your mental health, you should consult your healthcare provider for advice and support.)\nAs with team sports, the benefits of climbing and bouldering extend across different ages and abilities. Researchers surveying US Veterans and non-Veterans with disabilities found a range of potential therapeutic benefits to adaptive rock and rope climbing, for example, including\u00a0community connection, confidence-building, and muscle strengthening.\nI certainly found that bouldering had a positive effect on my mind. When I was climbing, my sole focus was concentrated on my next move: where my feet needed to go, how to swing my hips to reach the next hold and ensuring I kept a steady grip. Essentially, it felt like problem-solving combined with a physical challenge.\nWhen I was taking a rest and observing groups of climbers in the middle of the mats, both chatting and looking out for fellow climbers on the wall, it also became clear that bouldering is a very social sport \u2013 they were offering support, encouragement and guidance to each other. Climbing gyms host a range of routes at varying difficulty levels, marked by colour, meaning that people with different fitness levels can boulder together.\nI had booked a beginner's bouldering class, where five of us quickly became united in a camaraderie as an instructor guided us through technique, climbing etiquette and safety. After an hour of learning and testing out the routes to see what we could manage with support from our instructor, we were left to our own devices. Our group largely stuck together but it was easy to chat to other climbers.\nThe next day, I woke to achy forearms \u2013 but it was a satisfying pain, as was the satisfying feeling of trying something brand new.\nUnfortunately, the price tag attached to climbing and bouldering is on the higher side \u2013 and some may not be comfortable with the level of risk and potential for injury. That's why I also tested two gentler and cheaper activities: a book club with a creative writing class, and a life-drawing class (which, while physically safe, felt daunting in a different way \u2013 more on this later).\nFriendship series\nAmid the loneliness epidemic blighting many parts of the world following the pandemic, the BBC looks at how friendships can enrich our lives \u2013 and the science-backed ways to boost our social connections:\n\u2022 Why we become better friends as we age \n\u2022 What we can learn from friendship break-ups \n\u2022 How not to be a 'toxic' friend\nWhen you're looking for social connection, does it help to choose an activity that is openly designed to encourage bonding? I tested this out by taking part in a creative writing session in East London. Facilitated by the London Girls Book Club who host a range of events alongside their monthly book club meeting, the session was designed to help people meet other writers, get inspired and have an opportunity to focus on a piece of creative writing.\n\"I've seen so many of the women create best friends through our club,\" says Caitlin Curry, who founded the London Girls Book Club four years ago after she moved to London from north-east England. In her experience, the shared foundation of loving books has enabled women to form strong friendships. \"At the start you might be seeing new faces, or you might see someone every so often, but the more that you come, you start to see similar faces and build those connections,\" she says.\nPsychologists have a name for this kind of bonding by engaging in, and talking about, a shared activity: \"triadic interactions\". In triadic interactions, we pay attention both to each other, and to an object or activity of mutual interest (on the other hand, a dyadic interaction is one where we only focus on each other). Both dyadic and triadic interactions are key to our early development \u2013 and continue to have bonding benefits for adults, research suggests.\nMost of the women attending the session had shown up alone, and everyone was approachable and open. After an introduction and opportunity to meet everyone, we had 30 minutes of quiet time, a break to discuss what we were working on and then a further 30 minutes to write. I did find that our shared interest in reading and writing, along with our shared goals as writers, made it easy to bond, despite being total strangers just an hour before.\nThere are psychological benefits to creative writing, too, research suggests. One study by Plymouth University and Nottingham Trent University in the UK found that writing and discussing poetry as a means to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic helped people to cope with feelings of loneliness and isolation, as well as help to reduce feelings of anxiety and depression. A similar study published in 2021 found that creative writing may encourage personal growth and a sense of inner peace.\nBook clubs can also be an affordable way to socialise, especially if you borrow the book from a library. Reading may even have health benefits, such as cognitive benefits, potentially making it another hobby that provides a social as well as physical boost.\nFor anyone who is nervous about joining a book club, Curry offers the reminder that you always have the book in common if you're feeling shy: \"A lot of the women that come are very open, very friendly and they'll do things like follow up with each other\u2026 I provide friendship tips, we have name labels and we swap [around] so that you get to chat to lots of new people.\"\nHaving a class that was structured meant that people felt braver and more open to chatting with others. It can be hard to muster up the courage to start a conversation, so knowing that everyone would get a chance to speak provided a bit of light relief.\u00a0\n\"I can't think of a better place to be an artist than London,\" says Ann Mackowski, artist and founder of Soho Life Drawing, a drawing group that runs weekly drop-in sessions in the heart of central London. Oh, and there's tea and biscuits.\nBefore I attended one of her relaxed life drawing workshops (also known as figure drawing), I would have told you that I am awful at sketching or drawing. Really awful.\nUnfortunately, I'd say the same thing now. But my skill level didn't matter.\nDrawing, especially when done in a way that makes us focus on the world around us, can improve mood and wellbeing, research suggests. As I quietly focused on sketching, it felt incredibly calming. I left the session feeling relaxed and proud that I was able to even sketch the outline of a body.\nAs with the other activities I tried out, I discovered that life drawing offered a surprising additional benefit beyond the promise of social connection: it can have a positive impact on body image. One study showed how it just took six weeks of classes to notice feelings of body pride and elevation. Another study showed that for women in particular, greater attendance of life drawing classes was associated with higher body appreciation, as well as and a lower drive for thinness and social physique anxiety.\nThe workshop consisted of sketching a naked person in different poses, accompanied by guidance from Mackowski through the first hour. After a break where we chatted amongst us (with aforementioned tea and biscuits), the session resumed with longer poses for the second hour. Mackowski created a friendly, safe and tranquil space for all, regardless of skill level. Some people were gently reintroducing themselves to life-drawing, others trying something brand new, others had been honing their skills for years.\n\"You get people coming in, they make friends, they come back,\" says Mackowski, adding that the connections people form through her classes has been one of the reasons why she's continued running them for many years. \"It becomes like a little family for some people. Then they might go to other classes together and venture out.\"\nIn fact, in a 2021 survey in the UK on the arts and social connectedness, 82% of participants responded that engagement in the arts was linked with feelings of social connection, belonging and collective understanding.\nMackowski adds that having an artistic community can help people both socially and from a technical standpoint: \"People develop their skills a lot quicker if they can see other people's work\u2026 and identify styles. So if you're in a room with 30 people and you can view their work, beginners get a good idea of where to go. And it's known to increase levels of creativity.\" At the end of our session, there was an opportunity to share your finished work with peers or Mackowski for feedback.\nIn terms of my original quest \u2013 to find out which activity would be best for making friends \u2013 all the ones I tried were a success. Each formed a gateway to a community and new friends, while offering other benefits I hadn't even thought about when starting this mission.\nEmbarking on a new hobby is, of course, just a first step \u2013 it may not be an instant solution to the widespread problem of social isolation and loneliness and the search for social connection. Still, my experience alongside the research on how we as a species bond through shared activities, suggests that it's worth trying out a new activity where you might meet people with similar interests to you. In fact, at the start of this year, 19% of Americans made a New Year's resolution related to a hobby or a skill, according to a poll by the American Psychiatric Association.\nIf you're not sure how to break the ice, here's an opening line I used several times when talking to my fellow boulderers, writers and aspiring artists: \"Have you ever done this before?\" Admittedly, it may not be the world's greatest or most eloquent \u2013 but it did the job of getting us chatting. And for me at least, that awkward small talk quickly led to genuinely enjoyable conversations \u2013 and shared moments of connection.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Both in gameshows, dramas and documentaries and all, of course, all of the radio shows that came out of there as well,\" he said.\nThe former studios were located on Pebble Mill Road in Edgbaston and were opened by Princess Anne on 10 June 1971. It closed in 2004.\nMany shows, including Call My Bluff, Telly Addicts, All Creatures Great & Small and Good Morning With Anne & Nick, were recorded there.\n\"It was a brilliant place to be, and it was very sad that that contracted into a much smaller operation,\" Owen said.\n\"Pebble Mill At One, I think, was the first ever proper daytime programme, and that was really special.\n\"When I first came to Birmingham\u2026 it used to be great to watch Pebble Mill at lunchtime. The fantastic music, helicopters seemed to be landing all around, and there seemed to be explosions and things going on. And big, big names on that show.\"\nPresenters over the years included Bob Langley, Tom Coyne, Marian Foster, Gloria Hunniford, Fern Britton and Alan Titchmarsh.\nOwen met a lot of famous faces while working on Good Morning With Anne & Nick.\n\"We had Margaret Thatcher on and Tony Blair. We had Tom Jones, Elton John \u2013 the list was fantastic. \n\"I did some wonderful filming with Cher. Spent an afternoon on a bed at The Savoy with Cher. Me dressed in leather trying to be raunchy.\n\"So the memories of that are absolutely brilliant.\"\nWhen Owen first started working on BBC Midlands Today in 1997, the regional news programme was based at the Pebble Mill studios.\nIt first aired on 28 September 1964, broadcast from a tiny studio on Broad Street.\nIn 1971, it moved to the newly opened Pebble Mill Studios, and the first episode was presented by Tom Coyne.\nDr Vanessa Jackson, who specialises in TV production at Birmingham City University, started her career at Pebble Mill.\nIt had three studios, but one of its' most famous locations was the bar \u2013 located in the BBC Club.\n\"That was a very important place because many a programme idea was brought to life at the BBC Club. Many a job offer was made. And they used to do a wicked cheese toastie,\" she said.\n\"It's the place where most BBC staff \u2013 after working on a programme like Pebble Mill At One \u2013 would come over the little bridge over the Bourn Brook and make their way into the club, which used to serve a lot of alcohol and very good food.\"\nEarly in his career, Walsall-born Bob Warman, who presented ITV's Central News for 40 years, worked at BBC Radio Birmingham (now BBC Radio WM), which was broadcast from the Pebble Mill studios.\n\"The BBC Club was a pretty desperate place\u2026 When I came for an interview at the BBC with the then station manager \u2013 who was a chap called Jack Johnson, a wonderful Glaswegian man\u2026 He gave me a brief interview in his office and then said, 'Well, it's lunchtime, we better go to the bar.'\n\"We went into this bar which was absolutely nose-to-nose \u2013 it was rammed with people \u2013 all drinking furiously at lunchtime. And I thought, 'Well, I better do the honours here\u2026' so I said to Jack 'Can I get you a drink?' and he said 'Aye, I'd like a Bells please'.\n\"And I thought 'Gosh, Bells whiskey, at lunchtime', and I said, 'Anything with it?'

        "article_text": "For the first time in decades, Lyle and Erik Menendez say they are beginning to feel hope they could get parole. It is a shift in mindset for the brothers, who have spent more than 30 years behind bars for the murders of their parents in their Beverly Hills home.\n\"My brother and I are cautiously hopeful,\" Lyle Menendez, 57, said in a recent jailhouse interview with TMZ, which was aired on Fox.\n\"Hope for the future is really kind of a new thing for us. I think Erik would probably agree with that. It's not something we've spent a lot of time on,\" he added.\nThe Menendez brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in 1996 and sentenced to life without parole for the 1989 shotgun killings of their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez.\nThe case shocked the nation - not only for the brutal nature of the crime, but also for the courtroom drama that followed.\nTheir first trial ended in a hung jury after both brothers detailed years of sexual abuse they claimed to have suffered at the hands of their father, a high-powered music industry executive.\nBut prosecutors in the second trial cast doubt on those claims, arguing the brothers had acted out of greed and wanted to inherit their parents' wealth. The jury agreed, and the brothers were convicted and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\nOver the decades, the brothers have kept up their appeals - and recently learned that they would get a parole hearing after all.\nWith that hearing scheduled for June, and a resentencing hearing in the middle of April, the brothers are reflecting on how they will lead their lives if freed.\n\"What it is that I want to do in terms of my day-to-day life is much of what I'm doing in here. I want to be an advocate for people that are suffering in silence,\" 54-year-old Erik Menendez told TMZ.\n\"Lyle and I aren't talking about leaving prison - should we be able to get out - and not looking back. Our lives will be spent working with the prison and doing the work that we're doing in here, out there,\" he added.\nPart of the bid for parole hinges on a risk assessment that evaluates whether the brothers are still seen as threats to society.\nThe brothers say they have changed in prison.\n\"I'm striving to be a better person every day, and I want to be a person that my family can be proud of,\" said Erik Menendez. \"Who I've evolved into, who I've seen Lyle evolve into. I'm beginning to like myself, be proud of myself, and find it's okay to like myself.\"\nDuring their time in prison, both Erik and Lyle have started rehabilitation programs for disabled and elderly inmates and taught classes on trauma healing and meditation.\n\"Our best moments are the ones that are not spoken about, and we just help somebody, or we help an animal, or we make somebody smile that's feeling down that might have gone and harmed themselves if we weren't there,\" Erik said, speaking of their volunteer work in prison.\nDespite the upcoming parole hearing, the brothers' future - and the other possible paths to freedom - remain uncertain.\nLos Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman recently withdrew a motion for resentencing that had been filed under his predecessor, George Gasc\u00f3n, signalling a harder stance on the case.\nHochman has publicly said he will not support the brothers' release, though the final decision rests with a judge.\nThe move has stirred controversy with the DA's office as two former prosecutors who worked under Gasc\u00f3n and advocated for the brothers' resentencing, have filed a legal case against Hochman - accusing him of harassment, retaliation, and defamation. \nThe pair claim they were demoted because of their stance on the case - and have faced intense public scrutiny as a result. Mr Hochman's office is yet to comment.\nSome members of the Menendez family have also criticized Mr Hochman, suggesting he is letting personal bias influence his actions. Mr Hochman denies this.\n\"Hochman doesn't seem to want to listen or engage with us,\" the brothers' cousin Tamara Goodell told US media. Ms Goodell accused the prosecutor of dismissing and ignoring the family, and \"not acting like a neutral party\".\nBut public opinion remains divided.\nIn the same TMZ special, Alan Abrahamson, a former Los Angeles Times reporter who covered the Menendez trials in the 1990s, said the brothers are \"two of the most skilled and accomplished liars\".\n\"The Menendezes are very capable of shapeshifting, and being who people who want them to be,\" Mr Abrahamson said. \"And I think this is one of the grave dangers of this discussion that people don't seem to pick up on.\"\nThat is a thought shared by a former Beverly Hills detective who was assigned to investigate the murders at the time.\n\"This is the most heinous murder case I've had,\" Tom Linehan told TMZ. He believes the Menendez brothers were money-motivated killers who grew up getting exactly they wanted.\n\"If somebody is challenging what they want to do, they'd take them out if they had to,\" Linehan added.\nAs for the brothers, they have to hope the parole board sees things differently, so they will continue to fight their legal case.\n\"You never know how long you'll be blessed to be on the Earth, so we don't sit around waiting for something,\" Lyle said.",

        "article_text": "It's only been a couple of years since the last series of Charlie Brooker's dystopian Netflix show Black Mirror landed. But we're now living in an unpredictable world and a lot can happen in a short space of time.\nRenowned for its often savvy and disturbing takes on humanity and our relationship with technology, Black Mirror is back for a seventh series at a time when the pace of change in both politics and tech has left many of us - including lawmakers - struggling to keep up.\nIn 2011, when the first episode aired, Siri was the new kid on the block and the iPhone 4S had just been launched. Now we have Meta AI embedded in WhatsApp and we're on series 10 of the Apple watch. \nSince then, Black Mirror has taken us from creepy memory devices, phone implants and robotic bees to actors-turned-werewolves. And everything in between.\nBrooker is in buoyant mood as, he tells the BBC there appears to be little danger of him running out of ideas anytime soon, when asked if Black Mirror could go on forever.\n\"Hopefully [it will run and run]. Selfishly, it's a fun job,\" he says. \"Technology is developing in the real world very quickly. \n\"That means there are more sources of inspiration, and... the viewer is experiencing more [technological] things in their everyday life.\n\"We can do stories that I wouldn't have thought of 10 years ago, and also, you don't need to explain some of the concepts to people because they've got it in their phone.\"\nThe Crown and Deadpool & Wolverine actor Emma Corrin, who stars in one of this season's episodes, adds: \"It's much closer to home. People have access to stuff like AI which is terrifying so then it's more confronting and serves as a better warning.\"\nBrooker jokes: \"So you're saying it should go on forever?\" \n\"Yes, it should go on forever,\" Corrin concurs.\nBrooker adds: \"I'll find out when it stops if I drop dead or people stop watching.\"\nCorrin appears in an episode titled Hotel Reverie, alongside Issa Rae. The pair both play A-listers appearing in a remake of a vintage Hollywood classic. With a twist, of course.\nCorrin plays screen siren Dorothy Chambers, and reflects: \"I really enjoyed playing in a 1940s movie star.\n\"I just like the voice and the mannerisms and the way they hold themselves, and the style of acting is so ridiculous, larger than life and tongue in cheek, and yet packed with emotion at the same time.\"\nWithout giving too much away, AI - the subject of much debate in the creative industries - rears its head in the storyline.\nCorrin says they don't \"feel great\" about its potential impact on their profession.\n\"Obviously, I think it's scary, but it's also a massive conversation, right? There are aspects of it that are terrifying to me as an artist. I love the creative process. I love that this art is born out of being in a room with people and things coming from the depths of someone's human experience or imagination. And I really don't think we'll lose that, or I hope not. \n\"And I think there are also aspects of AI I probably don't understand, and that could be used as tools for good. It's about everyone being able to understand them and to use them correctly, and them being in the right hands.\"\nBrooker agrees: \"Quite rightly, when Andy Serkis played Gollum [in the Lord of the Rings trilogy], everyone's amazed by that, but what you're amazed by is the human, you're seeing a human performance shining through.\n\"I can totally see the value of AI as a tool for creative people. The point at which it worries me is if you remove the people bit from that equation, or you're just hoovering up their work and regurgitating it, and they're not being paid.\"\nBrooker also returns to another favourite tech theme, which he's used as a jumping off point for several Black Mirror episodes over the previous six series. The world of gaming.\nRemember the interactive standalone Black Mirror film Bandersnatch, where Asim Chaudhry and Will Poulter played a games company boss and a genius developer? The pair are now reprising their roles from the 2018 movie in a new series seven episode called Plaything.\nScottish actor Lewis Gribben, who is soon to star in the highly anticipated TV series Blade Runner 2099, plays 1990s games journalist and loner Cameron, who becomes obsessed with one particular game featuring little pixel creatures. (Brooker himself was a games journalist back in the day). \nFormer Doctor Who Peter Capaldi also turns in a brilliantly disturbing performance as an older Cameron.\nAlthough a big Black Mirror fan, Gribben hadn't seen Bandersnatch but says that coming to Plaything fresh actually aided his performance.\n\"I think it made it easier for me... but I was just intimidated. I was like 'Oh my god, it's Will Poulter who I've watched since I was seven years old acting in Son of Rambow. And Asim Chowdhury from People Just Do Nothing!\"\nGribben tells the BBC he's a bit of a gamer himself but has more of a handle on it than his Black Mirror character. \n\"I'm playing the new Assassin's Creed Shadows at the minute,\" he says. \"When you have a day off... I can spend a solid 10 hours [on it]. But I like to think most people game in moderation or just have bingeing game sessions. It's more like a relaxation thing.\"\nJosh Finan, who has starred in Baby Reindeer, The Responder and recently played Gerry Adams in Say Nothing, plays an acquaintance of Cameron who becomes unwittingly embroiled in his companion's distorted sense of reality. \nThe pair will both star in the highly anticipated Amazon mini-series, Blade Runner 2099. Expected to drop later this year, the action takes place 50 years after 2017's Blade Runner 2049, a movie that also analyses the relationship between humans and AI.\nFinan isn't too worried about being replaced by robots though.\n\"I'm very optimistic. I don't think actors are going anywhere. Maybe I'm being naive [but] I don't think there's any danger of being replaced. What we do is too special.\"\nBlack Mirror series seven can be seen on Netflix from Thursday 10 April.",

        "article_text": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\nMark Flekken (Brentford): Chelsea had 21 shots yet he kept a clean sheet. It wasn't a great game of football but he's one of only four goalkeepers who kept a clean sheet this weekend.\nDaniel Munoz (Crystal Palace): Scored for Palace and has become a monster at the back. Ever reliable and you want him in your Fantasy Premier League team all the time.\nCalvin Bassey (Fulham): By far the best player for Fulham, he was excellent.\nNoussair Mazraoui (Manchester United): Becoming Manchester United's most consistent defender, goes under the radar but makes a lot of last-ditch tackles - the one he made on Phil Foden kept them in the game.\nYouri Tielemans (Aston Villa): He's become undroppable for Villa, excellent. He had a year last year where you thought maybe they needed to move on and get someone better, but this year he's gone from strength to strength and has become a key component. Him and Boubacar Kamara, who was rested at the weekend, have built a massive presence of quality, tough tackling and reliability that Villa have built a foundation on.\nJoao Gomes (Wolves): He was the best player on the pitch by a country mile. Wolves might be worried about losing Matheus Cunha but in my opinion Gomes is the one they need to watch, and will be the harder one to replace. Excellent footballer, took over the game in the second half when they were 1-0 down. Just said 'don't worry guys give me the ball, watch what I can do'.\nMorgan Rogers (Aston Villa): Time and time again for Villa, keeps going, keeps doing wonderful things. I think he will grow into a regular for England, I rate him that highly. If you put him on the left he still delivers but I think his natural position is the number 10 role. Having Marco Asensio there he can learn, he can understand and it will also put that fire in his belly that he wants to be the main man - even though there's wonderful players around him.\nJacob Murphy (Newcastle): Two great goals, has he been the most underrated player this season? I would say I don't know of anyone who has gone more under the radar, but has been a seven-and-a-half or an eight out of 10 every game. He's been excellent.\nRyan Sessegnon (Fulham): A massive win against Liverpool and I think he's waited for a long time to showcase the best version of himself. A lot of injuries, a lot of tough times at Fulham but he's having a run of form that is excellent.\nEvanilson (Bournemouth): I thought he was excellent again, two goals at the weekend. When people are struggling for a number nine I've managed to put two in my team.\nJorgen Strand Larsen (Wolves): A contender for most improved this season. He has developed into a top player, double figures for a team who are struggling. His confidence, touch and assist for the first goal were fantastic. Then a poacher's goal, a really good finish, for the second.\nUnai Emery (Aston Villa): A huge win for Aston Villa, building on what has been a fantastic season and now going into a massive Champions League tie against Paris St-Germain. Most people would have expected them to rest players and change players against a very good Forest team. They did change players, however they were excellent and still got the job done.\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

        "article_text": "This month the government in England will launch a consultation for its men's health strategy. The move is long overdue, experts say, with men much more likely to die prematurely than women. But why are they in such poor health \u2013 and what can be done about it?\nAndrew Harrison was running a men's health clinic from a youth centre in Bradford when he heard a knock. He turned to the door, but no-one was there. Then he heard his name being called. He looked around to see a young man at the window asking for condoms.\n\"I was on the first floor,\" he says, recounting the story from a few years ago. \"The lad had shimmied up a drainpipe on the outside of the building because he didn't want to go through the reception and ask.\"\nThe anecdote, in many ways, encapsulates the challenges over men's health \u2013 a combination of risk-taking behaviour and a lack of confidence and skills to engage with health services.\n\nIn the UK men are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs and have high cholesterol and blood pressure.\nThese are major contributors to the fact men have a lower life expectancy than women - by four years - and are nearly 60% more likely to die prematurely before the age of 75 with heart disease, lung cancer, liver disease and in accidents.\nProf Alan White, who founded the Men's Health Forum charity and set up a dedicated men's health centre at Leeds Beckett University, says the issue needs to be taken more seriously.\nHe cites the pandemic as an example, pointing out that 19,000 more men than women died from Covid. \"Where was the outrage? Where was the attention?\"\nHe says it is too easy to blame men's poor health on their lifestyles, arguing \"it's much more complex than that.\"\nHe says there are biological reasons \u2013 the male immune system is less able to fight off infection. But, as the story of the young man seeking condoms above demonstrates, they can also lack the skills to access health services.\nProf White says: \"Men are less health-literate, that is to say they don't develop the skills to talk about their health and recognise and act on the signs. Men's health is very static from their teenage years right through into their 40s generally \u2013 many go years without see a health professional.\n\"It is different for women. Getting contraception, having cervical screening and then childbirth means many women have regular contact with health services in a way men do not.\"\nMachismo is also a factor, says Mark Brooks, the policy adviser for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Men's and Boy's Issues, which has played a key role in influencing the government to draw up a men's health strategy.\n\"In society we have different expectations in regards to men. They are expected to man up and get on with things, to be strong and resilient.\"\nBut he says when it comes to men's health it is important to pay particular attention to the impact of deprivation. Life expectancy in the poorest 10% of areas is 10 years less than in the wealthiest \u2013 a larger gap than is seen for women \u2013 and in the most deprived areas a man is 3.5 times more likely to die before the age of 75.\n\"You cannot ignore the stark differences when it comes to left-behind communities and those working in blue-collar jobs like construction and manufacturing,\" he says. \"The way health services are designed isn't working for men.\"\nNHS health checks, which are offered every five years to those aged 40 to 74, are considered a crucial intervention when it comes to many of the diseases which are claiming the lives of men early. But fewer than four in 10 men take up the offer.\n\"Someone working in construction or on an industrial estate will find it very difficult to take time off whether that's for a health check or to go and see their GP.\"\nMr Brooks says he would like to see employees given a right to two hours' paid time off to go for health checks as well as seeing them delivered in places where blue-collar workers are employed, such as industrial estates.\nBut he says this is also an issue about employment - with some men in these roles scared to face up to health problems that develop in their 40s and 50s - ignoring early warning signs or hiding illnesses from bosses altogether because of what it may mean for their work.\nHe adds that job worries and financial concerns, along with relationship problems,  are a big driver in the high suicide rates seen among men. Three-quarters of people who take their own lives are men.\nDespite this, just a third of people sent for talking therapies are men, which may suggest that services are not doing enough to consider men's needs.\n\"How services are set up to recognise signs of depression and anxiety is not how men express them \u2013 they are more likely to display signs of anger, abuse alcohol or become withdrawn and push people away,\" says Prof White.\nEthnic differences are also important to recognise, he says. For example, black men in England are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, while men from Indian or Bangladeshi backgrounds are at particularly high risk of diabetes.\nBut none of this means men are not interested in their own health, says Prof Paul Galdas, a men's health expert at York University. \"Men will open up and want to be engaged, but to do that you have to base it around actions and activities.\"\nHe has helped develop a six-week mental fitness programme in partnership with the Movember men's health movement that has been trialled on NHS front-line workers following Covid. Now it is being used by Leeds United football club for its youth players.\nMen are provided with support to understand how behaviour affects moods, they are encouraged to track their habits and set goals for healthy activities.\n\"It can be about going for a walk, seeing friends, playing golf and developing problem-solving skills to protect mental health. Good mental health leads to good physical health.\"\nSimilar activity-based initiatives can be found in a number of local areas where charities, councils and local men's groups have worked together to set up schemes.\nThe Men's Sheds movement is perhaps the most well-known where men are encouraged to come together and bond and support each other while doing practical projects.\nProf White says now is the time to build on these foundations \u2013 something a national men's health strategy is vital for. He says it will help \"shine a spotlight\" on the issue in a similar way to the women's health strategy did back in 2022 \u2013 that led to the creation of a network of women's health hubs and women's health champions at the heart of government.\nBut he also wants it to act as a \"wake-up call\" for men themselves. He says there are some simple steps every man should consider. \n\"Look at your waist size \u2013 if you are carrying weight, if your tummy is too big try to do something. Get moving, get out and about and talk to people.\n\"Take every opportunity to get a health check or screened. And, if you notice changes to body or the way you are managing problems, seek help.\"",

I basically use awards for doorstops.\n\"I have exactly six doors, for example, on the second floor of my Los Angeles home and I've also won six Emmys. So I will have to look for another door!\"\nPorter is the king of Broadway who is currently starring as the Emcee in the critically acclaimed Cabaret in the West End. \nHe tells us he loves UK audiences and says even though they are \"a little more reserved\" than US crowds, they have really \"loosened up\". \nPorter, who hosted the Olivier Awards with West End star Beverly Knight, does have a few words of advice for British cooks though. \nThe actor says \"while the food better than it used to be\", it still needs more \"salt and pepper, before you cook it, not after\".\nWe have offered to have him round for dinner at the BBC canteen, let's see if he accepts. \nGarai beat off stiff competition - including from herself - to take home the Olivier for best supporting actress for her role in The Years. \nShe was also nominated in the same category for Giant. \nIt is Garai's first Olivier win and she already has an idea where the prized trophy will be displayed. \n\"My little boy did ask that if I won, could he keep it in his room and I was like, 'I guess you can!' So it will be with all his action figures.\n\"I feel that I'm accepting this on behalf of my kids, my husband. Everybody wanted me to do something I felt so passionately about.\"\nTitanique is one of those shows where seeing really is believing. \nIt is a jukebox musical of Celine Dion hits, where Celine herself hijacks a museum tour about the Titanic in order to narrate her version of what happened the night the vessel sank. \nGot it? \nThe show won two Oliviers - best supporting actor in a musical for Layton Williams for his portrayal of the infamous iceberg, and best entertainment or comedy play. \nTitanique is a tribute to Celine's powerhouse vocals, so has the Canadian diva seen it yet? \nThe answer is not yet, but creators Tye Blue, Marla Mindelle and Constantine Rousouli say her set designer, backing singer and even Celine's sister have watched it. \nRousouli says he \"would explode into a million pieces of dust\" if Celine was in the audience. \nBut Mindelle, who originated the role of Celine in Titanique, says she \"would faint... then (the real) Celine Dion would walk on stage and somehow take over the part and it would be exactly the same. \n\"The show would go on without a hitch.\" \nMeera Syal's performance in A Tupperware of Ashes was greeted with rave reviews, so it is no surprise she was nominated for best actress at this year's awards. \nSyal played a mother diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease.  \nThe actress says she found out she had been nominated for the prestigious acting prize after leaving a Zumba class. \n\"I saw about 10 missed calls from my agent and quite a few from my daughter and thought, what is going on?\n\"So, sweaty and in my leggings, I rang up and got the news, and it was such a lovely surprise for a Tuesday morning!\"",

        "article_text": "Right from the start, season three of Mike White's Thailand-set one percenter drama was beset by criticism and debate \u2013 where will the series go from here?\nWithin seconds of the highly anticipated final episode of The White Lotus\u2019s season three ending on Sunday evening, the reactions and reviews for the 83-min closer were in. The viewers might as well have been talking about two different shows. \"This was the best season finale so far in The White Lotus universe,\" one person on X commented, while another agreed: \"That episode was a work of art.\" However, others felt \"the ending was a huge flop \u2013 built up several plot lines all series to abruptly end them in 20 minutes with no reflection,\" with another saying the finale \"stinks\u2026 way too long, very boring\". \nThese divisive opinions are reflective of the season as a whole, and were also felt by the critics. Was the third outing of creator Mike White's one-percenter holiday murder-mystery \u2013 set previously in luxury resorts in Hawaii, Sicily and, most recently, Koh Samui, Thailand \u2013 worthy of what Brian Tallerico of Roger Ebert called his \"favourite season yet\"? Or did the series, as the Boston Globe's Steven Nguyen Scaife put it, have \"less to say than ever\u2026 it's comfort food masquerading as social critique\"?\nIt was always going to be a tricky feat for White to pull off mass adoration for a third time. The White Lotus, which debuted in 2021, previously won 15 Emmys and two Golden Globes. It marked a comeback role for Jennifer Coolidge, often credited as White's muse, and who portrayed the naive heiress Tanya McQuoid for the first two seasons. The role earned her two Emmys and a Golden Globe, as well as becoming a fan-favourite. But White had pulled the rug out from viewers at the end of season two, killing off Coolidge's much-loved character, leaving fans unsteady and unsure of where a third series would take them \u2013 and if it would still have the same impact.\u00a0\nThe trouble with the new series can perhaps be traced back to the opening seconds of season three back in February, when disappointed fans noted that not only was the new theme tune not \"a bop\", but it failed to contain the traditional \"wooo-loo-looos\" sounds of the previous two series. It may have been a minor issue, but was integral to the whole experience, some viewers believed.\u00a0\nJust last week, The White Lotus composer, Crist\u00f3bal Tapia de Veer, revealed to The The New York Times that he had quit the show due to \"hysterical\" conversations with the show's producers, adding: \"I texted the producer and I told him that it would be great to, at some point, give them the longer version with the ooh-loo-loo-loos, because people will explode if they realise that it was going there anyway. He thought it was a good idea. But then Mike cut that \u2013 he wasn't happy about that. At that point, we already had our last fight forever, I think.\"\nAlongside this off-set drama, a common complaint about this season was that White's traditional slow-burn of storytelling was too\u2026 slow. The London Evening Standard called it \"agonisingly slow\". Meanwhile, given the star-power of the cast, several characters such as Blackpink's Lalisa Manobal's staff member Mook or The Zone of Interest's Christian Friedel as the resort manager \u2013 and aspiring singer \u2013 Fabian, felt severely underused and underdeveloped.\nFans waiting for a payoff in the finale were disappointed by nothing turning up. \"Manobal, and Christian Friedel, were never really given the chance to shine \u2013 and the show felt poorer for it,\" said the Evening Standard. Other long, drawn-out storylines, such as Jason Isaacs' dodgy financial-dealing dad, Tim Ratliff, attempting to kill his family, were never revealed to his family, sadly depriving viewers of the moment when the snobbish Victoria Ratliff (Parker Posey) discovers they were poor.\nWhite himself seemed to foreshadow some of this criticism. \"It isn't exactly a crowd-pleaser,\" he told The New Yorker. \"I don't know what it is, but we'll see.\" And at the beginning of the final episode, the Buddhist monk, Luang Por Teera, is shown saying to his students: \"There is no resolution to life's questions. It is easier to be patient once we finally accept there is no resolution.\"\nHad the show become a victim of its own success? As the series' feverish Reddit page grew in numbers, so did the fandom's theories, speculations and predictions. This was presumably not something the show was set up for in its debut season, but was something that White appeared to play into across the second and third series: planting hints and suggestions of what might come to pass later in the show, but also red herrings to throw people off the scent again.\u00a0\nWhile some fans may arguably have spoiled the experience for themselves by correctly predicting plot twists in this series \u2013 the slightly trope-y revelation of someone's parentage; who was going to die \u2013 others may have felt frustrated, and that White overplayed his hand with too many false moments that culminated in ultimately inconsequential storylines or characters.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The White Lotus s3 review: 'Feels flabby and elongated'\n\u2022 The White Lotus and hidden codes of male nudity on screen\n\u2022 The show that skewers the super-rich\nHowever, some aspects of this series were roundly agreed to be spectacular. The shock return of the series villain, Greg (Jon Gries), which managed to remain a secret until the first episode aired, was a genuine jump scare rare in contemporary television; and a surprise cameo \u2013 and an even more shocking monologue \u2013 by Sam Rockwell as Frank, a friend of Rick's (Walton Goggins) who is in recovery, will mark the series as unforgettable.\nWhite's writing and sharp talent for capturing humanity it all its gore and glory also shone through again. In the final episode, a heartfelt speech by Laurie (Carrie Coon) to her frenemies; noting how the passing of time made her appreciative of their relationship in her life; to Belinda's (Natasha Rothwell) character arc \u2013 and White's observation that for the right amount of money, we're all likely to sell out our morals.\nIt was these strengths \u2013 and arguably the more \"shock\" storylines like the incest brothers threesome; or all the full-frontal penis shots \u2013 that meant that even if the show was divisive, it was still pulling the viewers in. According to an HBO spokesperson in the New York Times: \"The second season of The White Lotus, which debuted in October 2022, shot up to more than 15 million viewers, and this season is on track to have at least 18 million\", making it one of HBO's most popular shows of all time.\u00a0\nAnd, as some critics have also pointed out, even if this third season of The White Lotus wasn't at its best, \"bad\" The White Lotus is appointment TV, and still heads and shoulders above a lot of other television out there. \"It is better in its third gear than many dramas are in full throttle,\" commented Carol Midgley from The Times.\u00a0\nThere will now likely be debate over whether White should have agreed to continue with a fourth series of The White Lotus \u2013 which was confirmed by HBO before season three began \u2013 and speculation as to its new location and new cast. White has shown that he still has the power to draw in the audiences; but will the destination be worth another journey? \u00a0\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "We watched every Premier League manager - here's what we found out\nIf you went to watch a football match at the weekend, it's likely you were glued to the action on the pitch rather than what was happening off it.\nAnd the first thing you probably told your friends and family about after the game was the great goal, the extraordinary save or the eye-catching skill you witnessed.\nIt turns out, however, there's a whole other sideshow happening just a few feet from the touchline.\n\"It's psychology in action,\" said Dr Gillian Cook - senior lecturer in sport and performance psychology at Liverpool John Moores University. \"Stress is incredibly high.\"\nThat sideshow, of course, is in the dugout and technical area. And the person feeling the stress is the one responsible for what's happening in front of them - the manager.\n\"They know the influence of what they do on the performance of players,\" added Dr Cook, who has studied the behaviour of managers.\n\"Can they control their stress? Are they able to manipulate their own emotions to help their players perform or do they succumb to those emotions? Do they boil over? Do they get red cards which then will likely have a detrimental impact on the team?\"\nIn an attempt to answer some of those questions, we sent a BBC Sport journalist to all 10 Premier League games during the most recent round of fixtures to closely watch every manager while the action unfolded.\nThey recorded data on where the managers stood and how they interacted with those around them, including their coaching staff, the players on the pitch and the match officials.\nHere's what we saw.\nWhere did each Premier League manager stand this weekend? See all the heatmaps\nHow did we collect the data? Read our methodology\nThe Laws of the Game state managers must remain within the confines of their technical area \"except in special circumstances\" - but that doesn't seem to stop them regularly crossing the boundary.\nOn average, Premier League managers this weekend spent nearly a quarter of games standing outside of their area, getting that bit closer to the pitch, even though the distance gained could usually be measured in centimetres.\nPart of that could be down to visuals.\n\"The players see you more and hear you more and they can actually have feedback,\" said Dr Cook. \"They also know that you're there, so you can have that monitoring effect on them.\n\"You will see the managers point to their heads all the time to have that influence on the players to stay focused.\"\nAnother possible reason could be for a manager to be alone with their thoughts.\nWhen sitting in the dugout, a manager will have their coaching staff around them, plus substitutes and other staff members who could all be voicing their opinions.\nFormer Leicester City boss Nigel Pearson said cancelling out the noise would be a reason why he would go to the edge of his technical area.\n\"Yes, there have been times I've done that,\" Pearson told BBC Sport. \"There have also been times I've asked someone else to go out so they can clear their heads.\"\nDr Cook added: \"It is a stressful environment in a dugout with lots of different people, lots of different voices, and lots of opinions.\n\"If you go out of the technical area, it could actually be a way to help alleviate your stress. You're getting away from some of that noise and potential sensory overload.\n\"We know from research that crowded spaces can overwhelm the senses and can lead to feelings of overwhelmingness - you're not able to think and plan and strategise what you're going to do next.\n\"So it could also be just a way of trying to regulate your own emotions.\"\nWhen all is falling apart on the pitch, a manager can play their part in trying to motivate their players and calm hot heads.\nHow this is done can vary, from being an animated presence to spur the team on or providing an aura of calm in the hope it transfers on to the pitch.\nOn Saturday, Brighton were 2-1 down against Crystal Palace and chasing an equaliser. It all got a bit chaotic towards the end of the game as three red cards were shown \u2013 two to Palace and one to Brighton.\nYet for the majority of the second half, and despite having spent more than half of the opening 45 minutes outside of his technical area altogether, Seagulls boss Fabian Hurzeler sat in the dugout, when he might have been expected to be driving on his team from the edge of the technical area.\n\"There's a concept in psychology called emotional labour,\" said Dr Cook. \"It originally comes from the airline industry of service with a smile - it doesn't matter what you feel, you've got to act in a certain way because that's what you think is expected of you.\n\"If you're a football manager there is data suggesting that if you look calm, composed and in control, that will transmit and convey to the players. So the more calm you look, the more calm your players will be, and they'll then have the headspace to go out and execute whatever your gameplan is.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola and Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim both prowled the edge of their technical areas during Sunday's derby between the sides, which ended in a disappointing 0-0 draw\nThe weekend's action also showed there are managers who prefer to be the sole presence in the technical area, while others are happy to let their assistants take charge at times.\nBrentford boss Thomas Frank, for example, frequently welcomed input from his staff, while Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca in the opposite dugout rarely retreated to his bench to seek a second opinion.\nFor Pearson, his coaching staff played just as an important role as he did.\nHe even used their different strengths to be able to ensure messages were getting through to players on the pitch as efficiently as possible.\n\"You have to understand the players you have,\" said Pearson, who was most recently manager of Bristol City. \"That is where I use assistants to help me.\n\"If you think about a coaching staff in its entirety there will be people who have certain connections with individual players that will have a meaningful effect. Rather than just being there shouting just to be seen, it is more about communicating with individuals on the pitch.\n\"You can have players who are quite sensitive and you have to be mindful of how those players will accept Information. At Bristol City, for instance, with people like Curtis Fleming and Jason Euell, they are both totally different types of personalities. Use the right people to make the connections.\"\nHowever, Pearson said there were times it was necessary to be the main presence in the technical area.\n\"There are times as a manager you have to be visible and I think that is more important when things are not going well,\" he said. \"It is more important you absorb some of the negativity to allow the players to play.\"\nWhen it came to interactions between the managers and match officials, it was no huge surprise that was most prevalent in the game containing three red cards.\nCrystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner was most perturbed as his side had both Eddie Nketiah and Marc Guehi sent off in the space of 12 minutes.\nElsewhere, Fulham boss Marco Silva was so irritated about a challenge on Rodrigo Muniz which went unpunished that referee Chris Kavanagh had to come over for a word with him.\nBut does getting that annoyed with officials help the players?\n\"On the one hand you have the positive of the manager shouting to try to influence the decision that's being made next time,\" said Dr Cook.\n\"But that is balanced out by the negatives because if you're a player and you see that your manager is getting distressed or very much doesn't agree with the decision that's being made, that takes your focus away.\"\nUnsurprisingly, Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou became most animated during a video assistant referee (VAR) check - and we all know how much he loves that.\nFaced by a four-minute delay as he awaited a decision, he appeared to play a game of rock, paper, scissors to highlight the unpredictable nature of a VAR call.\n\"VAR is interesting because in the past they put a heart-rate monitor on Brentford manager Thomas Frank and his heart rate went up from 60 beats per minute to 108  beats per minute when a VAR decision was being made,\" said Dr Cook.\n\"So what we saw Ange doing with rock, paper, scissors, I would suggest, could be because he was trying to distract himself - that's another way that we can regulate the emotions.\"\nA variety of styles can be seen on the touchline in the Premier League\nTracksuit or suit - it's a debate as old as time.\nSo what did our data tell us? Predictably, very little. Five managers wore tracksuit bottoms, four of them failed to win. That's as good as it gets.\nWhile a manager's attire may have nothing to do with what happens on the pitch, though, it does tell us a bit about them.\n\"We've all heard the expression power dressing,\" said Dr Cook. \"If you're in a suit, particularly according to research with doctors, they're rated as having higher authority, higher power and higher credibility.\n\"Obviously, that's with doctors, not football managers. But research with sports psychologists has found that if they wear tracksuits then their sports-specific knowledge is deemed to be higher.\n\"So, as a manager, what do you value? Do you want people to see you as the authority figure looking different from everyone else? Or do you want to fit in in a tracksuit that will be the same as your background staff and be seen to have higher sport-specific knowledge?\n\"Which of those you value will then determine how you want to dress.\"\nWe've pored through the data, we've studied the heatmaps, we've done the sums. Lots of sums.\nOne thing is clear - every manager does it their own way and sometimes that way is successful and sometimes it isn't.\nBut when we asked both Dr Cook and Pearson - coming at this from different angles - what it actually all boils down to, they both used the same word: authenticity.\n\"A key construct in management is trust,\" said Dr Cook. \"Do you trust your manager? If you trust what they suggest you should do, you're then more likely to work harder. The harder you work, the better you're likely to perform.\n\"And are they acting the same way in training when they're away from the performance arena? Or are they suddenly acting differently in a stadium? Because if there's a difference there, then it comes away as it's not as authentic.\n\"That can then reduce trust because one of the key factors that comes into trust is predictability and authenticity.\"\nAs Pearson, who has stood in the dugout as a manager for more than 600 games, concluded: \"It's about being authentic and making sure that people have the information.\"",

That was the famous Wall Street Crash that ushered in the great depression of the 1930s.\nBy comparison, the US stock market has lost around 17% of its value from its peak in February and is now down 2% from where it was this time last year.\nThe UK FTSE index has fallen sharply though not by as much.\nThis is partly because it closes earlier than New York, and so it often plays catch up with whatever happens in the US the next morning. \nFollow live updates\nNevertheless, these are the biggest and quickest declines we have seen in world markets since they were gripped by the panic of Covid-19 in early 2020.\nA decline of 20% from a peak is considered a \"bear market\" - a description of a market that appears to be more likely to go down than go up. We are very close to that description right now.\nWhile many people own stocks and shares directly, most people's exposure to stock markets come through their pension plans. There are two types \u2013 defined benefit schemes which guarantee a fixed pension income, and defined contribution where your pension pot rises and falls with financial markets.\nThat may sound like defined contribution plans are very vulnerable to this sell off \u2013 but not all of your contributions go into shares. Much of the money goes into safer investments such as government bonds. These tend to increase in value when stock markets fall as they are seen as a \"safe haven\" along with other assets such as gold. \nThat is exactly what has happened here. \nGovernment bonds have risen in value and that can offset some or all of the fall in shares depending on how your pension savings are allocated.\nThe closer to retirement you are, the higher percentage of your pension pot is likely to be invested in bonds - so the less affected you will be.\nThere have been many falls like this in the decades since the Wall Street Crash but in the long term, shares have turned out to be a good investment \u2013 and pension savings is a long term game.\nIt does matter. A company's share value is a measure of how profitable those companies are expected to be in the future. A plummeting market is an indication that most people think that most companies are likely to see their profits fall.\nThe markets believe that US President Donald Trump's tariff bombshell is expected to raise prices, lower demand and reduce profits, making companies less valuable and more inclined to cut investment and jobs.\nSo the real warning sign here is not about the value of your pension but about the health of the economy in which we live and work.\nFalls like this sometimes, often even, herald an economic downturn. That is more of a worry than the value of your pension, which has seen and will see volatility like this over the years.\nBut that's not to say this is not a very big moment for the world economy.",

        "article_text": "A day before Donald Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs are scheduled to kick in, the US president appears locked in a high-stakes game of chicken, with the world's economy hanging in the balance.\nSome nations labelled \"worst offenders\" are scrambling to make nice with the White House to end this game before it reaches a potentially devastating climax.\nChina, in contrast, is playing a different game, one of retaliation and resistance.\nMeanwhile, Trump has pressed ahead, even as some allies \u2013 in Congress and on Wall Street \u2013 wonder if he's going too far. On Sunday, when asked what level of market fall he would tolerate before changing course, he snapped that it was a \"stupid question\".\nSo is it all a negotiating tactic as many investors and politicians hope \u2013 or is he playing a longer game aimed at permanently restructuring the global economy and America's place in it? In this new world, whether a country is an ally or an adversary depends on whether that nation is giving the US a good deal.\nOn Monday afternoon, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the first world leader to visit the president since his trade announcement, tried his hand at playing Trump's new game. He pledged that his nation \u2013 which has been slotted for tariffs of 17% \u2013 would drop its trade barriers and move to eliminate its trade surplus with the US.\n\"We think it is the right thing to do,\" he said. \"I think Israel can serve as a model to many countries that ought to do the same.\"\nOther nations appear to be pursuing a similar strategy in the hopes of a positive result.\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba called Trump on Monday morning, prompting Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to state that the US was beginning negotiations with the nation to \"implement the president's vision for the new Golden Age of Global Trade\".\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Europe was \"ready to negotiate\" with the US, offering a mutual reduction of tariffs on industrial goods to zero \u2013 a proposal that Trump praised during remarks at the Oval Office, while saying it was still \"not enough\".\nThere were no such gestures from China. On Monday morning, America's top economic competitor announced that it was responding to Trump's 34% tariff increase with an additional 34% of its own.\nThat prompted Trump to threaten another 50% to US tariffs on China if it does not back down by Tuesday.\n\"China has chosen to isolate itself by retaliating and doubling down on previous negative behaviour,\" Bessent posted on X. \"Over 50 countries have responded both openly and positively to Donald Trump's historic action to create a fairer, more prosperous system of global trade.\"\nChina's reaction to Trump's latest move was equally blunt.\n\"We have stressed more than once that pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage with us,\" Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu told BBC partner CBS News. \"China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.\"\nSuch a series of reactions and reprisals from China and the US appeared to be exactly what investors feared last week, as American stock indexes dropped by double-digit percentages.\nBy Monday a growing chorus of business leaders were speaking out against Trump's tariff plan, including Wall Street financiers who had been strong public supporters of his administration \u2013 trying, it appeared, to get the president to back down by force of will alone.\nMeanwhile, US markets were poised to jump at any reason for hope. When a social media post on Monday morning indicated that the president was contemplating a 90-day delay on new tariffs \u2013 perhaps drawn from a misinterpretation of comments made by Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett on Fox News - US stock indexes soared. The S&P 500 index added $2.4tn in market value for about 10 minutes, only for it to all vanish once the White House quickly denied the president was contemplating such a move.\nTrump further closed the door on Monday afternoon, saying he was not \"looking at\" any kind of delay. It was still full speed ahead on tariffs.\n\"We're going to have one shot at this,\" he said.\nPerhaps the most concerning message for investors and foreign leaders hoping for a last-minute reprieve \u2013 and an exit ramp to stability - came from one of Trump's top trade advisers, Peter Navarro.\n\"This is not a negotiation,\" he wrote in a Financial Times opinion piece published on Monday afternoon. \"President Trump is always willing to listen. But to those world leaders who, after decades of cheating, are suddenly offering to lower tariffs - know this: that's just the beginning.\"\nSo if this is about the start of broader systemic change \u2013 what is the desired end goal worth potentially tanking the global economy?\nOne theory is that Trump has a plan with several of his top advisers \u2013 the \"Mar-a-Lago accord\", it is called \u2013 with the ultimate goal of compelling America's trading partners to weaken the US dollar on the international currency exchange. Such a move would make American exports more affordable to foreign markets and diminish the value of China's large reserves of US currency.\nIt's a plan pushed by Trump economic adviser Stephen Miran, although he has denied that it is current administration policy.\nThat's just one of the possible explanations for the current stock market mayhem that Trump has purposefully instigated \u2013 one that many other prominent economists warn is risky. It is far from the only one.\nEver since Trump shocked the world with his sweeping tariff plan, White House officials have fanned out across media to preach patience and offer a selection of sometimes contradictory explanations as to the strategy behind Trump's global trade war. He is doing it to raise revenue and protect American industry - or as a negotiating tool. The tariffs are permanent \u2013 or they are temporary. They will prompt individual deals with other nations - or compel some grand multilateral agreement.\nAs Trump presses on to Wednesday's tariff cliff with no signs of backing away, he seems willing to keep the world guessing.",

        "article_text": "India's longest and most holy river, the Ganges, is home to thousands of dolphins. But their survival is under threat.\nBut these aren't like the ones found in oceans. They don't leap out of the water in spectacular arcs; surface for long intervals or swim in an upright position. Instead, they swim sideways, spend much of their time underwater, have long snouts and are almost completely blind.\nThese are Gangetic dolphins, a species of river dolphin - and India's national aquatic animal - that's found largely in the Ganges-Brahmaputra river system in the northern part of the country.\nA new survey finds India's rivers host around 6,327 river dolphins - 6,324 Gangetic and just three Indus dolphins. A majority of the Indus dolphins are found in Pakistan as the river flows through both the South Asian countries.\nBoth these dolphin species are classified as \"endangered\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). \nResearchers from the Wildlife Institute of India surveyed 58 rivers across 10 states between 2021 and 2023 to produce the first comprehensive count of India's river dolphins. \nThe origins of river dolphins are as fascinating as the creatures themselves. Often called \"living fossils\", they evolved from marine ancestors millions of years ago, say scientists. \nWhen the sea once flooded low-lying areas of South Asia, these dolphins moved inland - and when the waters receded, they stayed. Over time, they adapted to murky, shallow rivers, developing traits that set them apart from their ocean-dwelling cousins.\nExperts say the new survey is crucial for tracking river dolphin populations. Since 1980, at least 500 dolphins have died - many accidentally caught in fishing nets or killed deliberately - highlighting the ongoing threat to the species.\nConservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha says that up until the early 2000s, there was very little awareness about river dolphins.\nIn 2009, the Gangetic river dolphin was declared India's national aquatic animal to boost conservation. Steps like a 2020 action plan and a dedicated research centre in 2024 have since helped revive its numbers.\nHowever, conservationists say there's still a long way to go.\nDolphins continue to be poached for their flesh and blubber, from which oil is extracted to use as fishing bait. Other times, they collide with boats or get caught in fishing lines and die.\nNachiket Kelkar of the Wildlife Conservation Trust told Sanctuary Asia magazine that many fishermen often didn't report accidental deaths of dolphins fearing legal trouble. \nUnder Indian wildlife laws, accidental or targeted dolphin killings are treated as \"hunting\" and carry strict penalties. As a result, many poor fishermen quietly dispose of the carcasses to avoid fines. \nRiver cruise tourism, which has picked up in India in the past decade, has further threatened their habitat. Dozens of cruise trips operate on both the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers.\n\"There's no doubt that disturbances from cruises will gravely impact the dolphins, which are sensitive to noise,\" conservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha told The Guardian newspaper.\nMr Sinha believes that increased vessel traffic could push Gangetic dolphins towards extinction, much like it did to Baiji dolphins in China's Yangtze river.\nRiver dolphins face threats partly due to their own evolution. Nearly blind, they rely on echolocation - high-pitched sound pulses that bounce off objects and return as echoes - to navigate murky waters. While this trait suits their habitat, it also makes them vulnerable to modern threats.\nTheir poor eyesight and slow swimming speed make river dolphins especially prone to collisions with boats and other obstacles. Adding to their vulnerability is their slow reproductive cycle - they mature between six and 10 years of age and females typically give birth to just one calf every two to three years.\nBut Mr Sinha is hopeful about the future of river dolphins in India. \"Government initiatives have played a big role in saving the dolphins. A lot has been done but a lot more remains to be done too,\" he says.",

We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and there are going to be fair deals,\" he said.\nTrump said China had introduced its countermeasure \"despite my warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs... will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs\". \nBeijing shot back, saying that \"pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage\".\n\"The US hegemonic move in the name of 'reciprocity' serves its selfish interests at the expense of other countries' legitimate interests and puts 'America first' over international rules,\" Chinese embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu said in a statement. \n\"This is a typical move of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying.\" \nSpeaking from the White House, the US president said there could be both permanent tariffs and negotiations.\n\"We have $36tn (\u00a328tn) debt for a reason,\" he said, adding that the US would be talking to China among other countries to make a \"fair deal and a good deal\".\n\"It's now America first,\" Trump said.\nThe tariffs would come as a major blow to China's manufacturers, for whom the US is a key market for exports.\nChina's top exports to the US include electrical products and other machinery, computers, furniture, toys, vehicles and equipment.\nThe US's top exports to China are oilseeds and grains, as well aircraft, machinery and pharmaceuticals.\nUncertainty around the tariffs led to a turbulent day on global stock markets.\nMarkets worldwide have plunged since Trump announced the global tariffs. \nThe value of US stock markets dropped sharply again on opening on Monday, although they later pared those losses, while Europe's biggest markets, including London's FTSE 100, closed more than 4% down.\nAsian share indexes had nosedived on Monday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index falling by more than 13%, its biggest one-day fall since 1997. However, most major markets made gains on Tuesday with some notable exceptions.\nThe key index in mainland China was broadly flat on Tuesday morning but there were more losses in Taiwan and Singapore. After being closed for national holidays, Thailand and Indonesia also saw stocks fall by more than 4% and 9% respectively. \nTrump's post on Monday also indicated that negotiations on countries' tariff rates would \"begin taking place immediately\".\nTrump met Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, on Monday in the White House. Netanyahu said that his country would eliminate the trade imbalance with the US, which he said was the \"right thing to do\".\n\"We intend to do it very quickly... and we're going to also eliminate trade barriers.\"\nIsrael faces a 17% tariff from April 9 under Trump's \"Liberation Day\" policy.\nThe US president also posted earlier that Japan was sending a negotiation team to discuss tariffs.\nAnd Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, offered Trump a \"zero-for-zero tariff\" deal - although she previously said that she had not ruled out retaliation. \n\"We are also prepared to respond through countermeasures and defend our interests,\" she said.\nTrump said later that the EU had been formed \"to really do damage to the United States and trade\".

        "article_text": "Rory McIlroy's Augusta troubles started on the 10th hole of the final round in 2011 with a wayward drive into the trees down the left\nIt is often referred to as the most important distance in golf; the five inches between the ears.\nThe game is as much a test of temperament as technique and champions at the very highest level have to conquer both elements to land the biggest titles.\nIn their pomp the likes of Colin Montgomerie and Lee Westwood had the physical attributes to win any tournament they played. But something would always get in the way when it came to the majors; the big four tournaments that define careers.\nThere was always a stumbling block at the Masters, The Open, the US Open or US PGA Championship. It prevented them, and many others, from producing their best shots when they most needed them.\nIt is not a slight to say this. It's golf. The mental challenge of pulling off key shots when the only inhibiter is the pressure of the moment encapsulates the magic of the game.\nIt will be evident in abundance again this week as Rory McIlroy embarks on his latest attempt to complete the career Grand Slam. He is among the world's best who are all gathering together for the first time in eight months for the Masters at Augusta National.\nMasters - dates, tee times, favourites & how to follow on the BBC\nMcIlroy can handle any Masters pressure - Lowry\nMasters tee-times for rounds one and two at Augusta\nThese major weeks are the ultimate individual examination and for all his prolific form at tour level, McIlroy has failed to add to his tally of four major wins since 2014.\nWe wonder why Westwood and 'Monty' never won a major, why it took Phil Mickelson until his 13th year on tour to land his first win on this elevated stage but the most burning current question surrounds McIlroy's frustrations - the majors and most pertinently the Masters.\nSo precocious was the Northern Irishman's talent when he first competed as a teenager in 2009 he was asked about completing the Grand Slam by the age of 22.\nTwo years on at Augusta he led by four shots going into the final round, only to shoot 80 in a scarring denouement. Despite four subsequent top-five finishes, he has never since embarked on the final day back nine with a real chance of glory.\n\"The biggest challenge for Rory is the mental one,\" said Paul McGinley. The former Ryder Cup captain's Golf Channel colleague, Brandel Chamblee, added of the Masters. \"It is literally his nemesis, It brings out the worst golf in Rory annually.\"\nMcIlroy dropped six shots in three holes in the final round as his hopes of winning the 2011 Masters evaporated\nThe popular view is that McIlroy suffers from a build-up of mental scar tissue, first triggered by that Augusta capitulation in 2011.\nAlthough he quickly started collecting his quartet of majors, post 2014 there have been many instances where further setbacks have added to the malaise. Most recent was last year's US Open where he was beaten by to the title by Bryson DeChambeau despite leading by two with five holes to play.\n\"It is possible for people to build something up in their heads and say this is the one that I struggle with because previously something bad happened,\" chartered psychologist Stephen Smith told BBC Sport.\n\"That memory hasn't been processed properly out of what we call the short term executive memory into your long term memory. \n\"And it's literally interfering with the performance message from the higher order brain. \n\"It's almost like a mini form of PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder).\"\nSmith has worked with athletes across a wide range of sports and says bad memories can influence physical performance.\n\"The wire that carries the performance movement message from your brain to your body gets that wonderful swing going in a connected way,\" he said.\n\"And that's why you make more mistakes on that hole or on that course or in that tournament, because you're just literally not able to send the signal to the muscles. It's getting interfered with by what you would call scar tissue.\"\nNot since that ill-fated tilt in 2011, when he began with a 65, has McIlroy made a dominant start to the Masters. He has only broken 70 on one occasion - a 69 in 2018 when he finished tied fifth behind Patrick Reed after a final round 74.\nIn this period he has won at every level, including the prestigious Players Championship twice. The second of those Sawgrass wins occurred only last month and that combined with a fine win at Pebble Beach in February is fuelling optimism for this week.\nThe now 35-year-old is second favourite behind defending champion Scottie Scheffler, who has yet to win this year. Indeed, of all the biggest names, McIlroy has had the most successful start to the year.\nStars are aligning for him to win the one major to elude him.\nVictory this week would put him alongside the all time greats; Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods - the only golfers to have won all four majors and completed the Grand Slam collection.\n'Sniffles aren't going to stop me,' says Scheffler\nEx-champion Langer braced for 'emotional' Masters farewell\nListen: Masters week begins\nMcIlroy is desperate to wear the famous Green Jacket, but can you want it too much?  \n\"That's a very good point,\" said Smith.\n\"All of this is said without me ever having spoken to Rory, I couldn't comment as to how accurate my views on the situation are.\n\"But looking at it from outside the goldfish bowl that is tournament golf, you look at it and say, OK, right, maybe that's it, it could be that he actually wants it too much.\"\nMcIlroy has been working with sports psychologist Bob Rotella in the build up to his 17th attempt at winning the Masters. \"I think he'll have him very well prepared now,\" McGinley said.\n\"They've had two or three runs at this now, and I think they will be coming up with a plan in terms of taking that pressure and decimating it and putting it aside.\"\nSmith believes the answer lies in reaffirming good memories, such as McIlroy's imperious opening drive in his three-hole play-off win over JJ Spaun at the Players three weeks ago. The champion admitted to being very nervous before that tee shot.\nNicklaus, winner of a record 18 majors, used to insist he never missed a short putt in the sport's biggest championships, which was not true but a valuable technique to reaffirm confidence. Woods would celebrate fine shots with a trademark move with his club.\n\"Tiger with his club twirl,\" said Smith, who is an associate fellow of the British Psychological Society. \"It's a hard copy down of the good stuff into the long-term memory so he can draw on it.\n\"I know that I can do it. I know that I've won.\"\nAnd while the notion of accumulated mental scar tissue is potentially ruinous, Smith believes that McIIroy is at a prime age to deal with any such issue.\n\"His emotional intelligence is growing, immensely,\" he said. \"He is not the man he was was when he was 29 or 30.\"\nAnd in 2025, McIlroy - without yet playing at his very best - looks assured. Using a different ball this year his technique, especially in his approach play, looks better nuanced and more effective.\nSo this might just be the year for the man with 28 PGA Tour wins, but no major victories in his past 38 attempts. He is playing the best golf of any of the leading contenders, but this week carries a mental burden far greater than any of his rivals.\nIt is the bit between the ears.\n\"You've got to own it because if you don't it'll just niggle away at you,\" Smith said. \"So you've got to almost burst that cyst, excise it, clean it out,  deal with it.\"",

That's the first time that's happened and that's only a few weeks ago,\" he said.\n\"A bad feeling came over me,\" he added, describing Lady Stewart's mind as being in \"a new world\".\nSir Jackie, who lives in Buckinghamshire, described how his wife of more than 60 years had been diagnosed with dementia after she lost control of her small car and it landed on its roof.\nNo-one had been hurt, he said, but the incident had led to an \"awareness that something wasn't right\".\nA decade later, Sir Jackie said the progression of the disease was such that Lady Stewart could no longer walk.\n\"I know that Helen doesn't mean it when she suddenly goes round and hits me, or the [specialist dementia] nurses,\" he said.\n\"She can hit somebody quite often, she uses language that she's never ever said in her life and it comes like that [clicks his fingers] and I say 'darling, darling, don't say that'.\n\"She says 'Why?' And she'll give me a row for doing that. That's usually after 17:00.\"\n'\"Sundowning\" is a common feature of dementia, where the brain tires and a person becomes more agitated later in the day.\nSir Jackie created an accessible home in Switzerland for Lady Stewart without steps or obstacles - and they employ nurses and specialist neurosurgeons.\nHe said he was aware of the privilege his F1 career had afforded him, and that for many families the only option was residential care.\n\"I visit homes for people with dementia and I leave in tears because people are completely lost,\" he said.\nOne in three people will develop dementia in their lifetime, which Sir Jackie describes as a \"disaster\". \nHe said friends and a former secretary had also been diagnosed and understanding the brain was \"bigger than going to the moon\". \nResearch progress had been \"very slow\", with the medical profession \"failing so far\" and diseases like cancer being prioritised, he said.\nHis charity is now funding the development of a new blood test trial to detect signs of frontotemporal dementia 10 to 20 years before it is diagnosed.\nDr Maura Malpetti, senior research fellow at the University of Cambridge, said the ON-FIRE study was looking at the type of frontotemporal dementia that was not genetic - where diagnoses could not necessarily be predicted.\nDr Malpetti said people with frontotemporal dementia were often misdiagnosed.\n\"It is confused with psychiatric conditions because of the behavioural changes or the language problems,\" she said.\nHer team is looking at how the presence of certain proteins in the blood could indicate the likelihood of future inflammation in the brain.\nChanges in the blood could be present decades before the onset of physical symptoms and they were usually only picked up by scans, which took longer to carry out and required specialist equipment.\nA major problem facing trials for new dementia drugs is that they often involve patients who have already received a diagnosis.\nIt means they are already showing symptoms - but by this time, it may be too late for the drugs to make a difference. \nIdentifying individuals decades before they show symptoms allows researchers to trial drugs to see if they reduce the risk of dementia.\nThree hundred patients were being recruited at 20 centres across England and Dr Malpetti said the trial would eventually be rolled out to 1,000 participants.\nThe study is one of a number of dementia blood tests being developed in the UK, including one at the University of Oxford.\nDr Malpetti said they hoped to see \"tremendous\" developments in the next five years because of the number of inflammation studies.\n\"I think there's been a revelation in the field of blood tests because this allows us to use more accessible and scalable tests,\" she said.\nDr Malpetti said they would freeze the samples so that if a new inflammation marker was discovered, they could go back and test that in the blood.\nShe added an earlier diagnosis would empower families, allowing them to contribute to research to find a cure.\n\"The earlier we understand the changes in the brain, maybe we can stop or slow down the symptoms while the person is still well,\" she said.\nSir Jackie said Formula One brought funding and business acumen to health research.\nThe most recent fundraiser was the One Lap Challenge ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix.\n\"When you have a problem in Formula One [clicks his fingers] it's fixed... they're also changing it [technology] all the time, because they have enthusiasm, and they see the results,\" he said.\nDr Malpetti said she hoped charities like Race against Dementia could transform research, helping it to progress faster.\nSir Jackie said he hoped a cure could be found in his lifetime.\n\"I want this to happen just as much as I wanted to be world champion,\" he said. \"It's terribly important.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

        "article_text": "Alejandro Garnacho (second left) posed with Amad Diallo, Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund after Manchester United's FA Cup final win last season\nAlejandro Garnacho has a bit of history with Manchester City.\nLast season, he scored the opening goal as Manchester United stunned their local rivals in the FA Cup final - later posing with the trophy along with his youthful team-mates Amad Diallo, Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund.\nJust over two months later he was back on target at Wembley when he scored in the Community Shield against this weekend's Manchester derby opponents - the first of eight goals in his first 20 games of the season.\nBut then things took a downturn.\nGarnacho did not face City on 15 December after being dropped along with fellow forward Marcus Rashford.\nHead coach Ruben Amorim spoke about it being a selection issue following an evaluation of \"training performance, game performance, engagement with team-mates\".\n\"I pay attention to everything,\" he said. \"The way you eat, the way you put your clothes to go to a game.\"\nUnlike Rashford, who returned to the squad just once and did not play again before joining Aston Villa on loan in February, Garnacho was recalled immediately. \nSources said the issue came down to an interpretation of his reaction to receiving instruction as he waited to come on in a Europa League game\nAmorim believed Garnacho wasn't listening. Garnacho felt he was, while watching the game unfold.\nNew in the job, Amorim felt he had to lay down a marker. Garnacho's speedy return - and continued presence - confirms the matter has been dealt with and forgotten.\nBut his performance levels have dipped. In 21 appearances since the City game, Garnacho has scored one goal and created four.\nAnd after another frustrating performance against Nottingham Forest on Tuesday - during which he had six unsuccessful shots and was shown a yellow card for kicking the ball away in anger - his future became the focus of fan discussion.\nCan you name people to play for Man Utd & City?\nGarnacho has scored four goals in 29 Premier League appearances this season - making him United's third-top scorer. He has nine goals and eight assists in all competitions\nHe has created 26 chances - putting him outside top 50 in the Premier League.\nGarnacho has attempted 65 dribbles but only completed 20 - 75th among Premier League players.\nHis 68 shots in the league is the 11th highest total, but with a very low conversion rate of 5.9%.\nGarnacho is in the top 10 for carries ending in shots (24) and 20th for carries ending in a chance created (15).\nHe has completed 30.8% successful dribbles - the lowest of any Premier League player to have attempted 50 or more.\nGarnacho's possession won, interceptions, sprints and tackles have dropped under Amorim compared to under Erik ten Hag this season; but his possession won in the final third and distance covered per match stats have improved.\nSpeaking to sources around United, a few key points emerge.\nGarnacho's confidence is at a low ebb. Someone with high-level coaching experience, who understands the demands players face at a club of that stature, suggests he is 'nervous'. It is a trait first spotted when he was breaking into the first team.\nThe Argentine is viewed as a player who is at his best when his mind is free. The belief is he is now over-thinking, meaning he snatches at chances.\nUnited legend Paul Scholes - now a pundit - has previously described Garnacho as \"scruffy\" technically and said his decision-making is \"really poor\" at times.\nIt is acknowledged from sources inside the club that Garnacho is feeling the strain, and he was pictured slapping his head in frustration after one wasted shot on Tuesday.\nThis is the first extended dip of Garnacho's career. While to many he 'arrived' with his brilliant bicycle kick at Everton in November 2023, he actually made his debut in April 2022.\nTuesday's game was Garnacho's 132nd for United - 46 of which have been this season. If he stays injury free and remains at the club, he could become one of the youngest United players to reach 200 appearances.\nAll have come during tumultuous times at Old Trafford, and it is worth remembering, too, that he is just 20.\nAs a 'homegrown' player, Garnacho remains one of United's most valuable assets. \nThe Football Transfers website values him at \u00a355m - ninth in the list of under-21 players globally.\nIt is a year ago since United headed towards the summer transfer window in a delicate position with the Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and let it be known they would consider offers for any of their players, aside from Garnacho, Mainoo and Hojlund, who were 'untouchable'. \nThat status was quietly removed before the January 2025 window.\nGarnacho was the subject of sustained interest from Napoli and Chelsea. Garnacho and his camp were aware of it. They also knew that while they weren't pushing him out of the door, United's hierarchy were not exactly putting the lock and bolt on.\nQuite how close a deal came to being struck is not clear, but could certainly be unsettling for the player.\nGarnacho went from being a central component of Ten Hag's squad to becoming part of the answer to United's PSR problems, with any fee being banked as 'pure profit'.\nHe could hardly be blamed for wondering if his future lay elsewhere.\nGarnacho's 'heatmap' under Erik ten Hag in the Premier League this season\nGarnacho's 'heatmap' under Ruben Amorim in the Premier League this season\n1 of 2\nIt is clear Garnacho's best position - and his preferred role - is as a wide attacking player. \nBut it is a role that does not exist in Amorim's formation, where wing-backs provide the width and inside forwards the penetration. \nHe is trying to adapt - and Amorim's selections and recent quotes suggest he wants him to - but the process is not straightforward.\nOn Friday, he said: \"I think he is doing the right things. Like any player in our team, has to choose better, especially in the last third.\n\"Garnacho is improving the way he defends, the way he runs. He needs more goals and assists, that is clear. He wants to improve and is improving but is not in a great moment.\"\nLast month, the Portuguese said it was \"clear\" Garnacho had talent but he needed to \"learn to play a little bit in a different position\".\n\"He's finding the best way to play in this system. He's improving during training, and I think he changed the way he sees himself. I am trying to find the best position for him.\"\nThe decline in his effectiveness has been spotted elsewhere. After being a regular in the Argentina squad as part of the Copa America win last summer, he was left out for the most recent World Cup qualifiers.\nGarnacho's 26 chances created in the Premier League this season - including his only assist\nGarnacho is not hiding on the pitch, but does shun the limelight off it.\nHe has a young partner and child at home, with his wider family in Spain.\nSources told BBC Sport Garnacho is dedicated and showing maturity - reporting to training an hour before Amorim's start time of 10am for individual gym work.\nThough he does not tend to do many external interviews, he has worked hard on his English since he arrived in September 2020 and spent his first weeks in isolation because of Covid-19. \nHe does plenty of 'meet and greets' with fans and will sometimes stop on the way home from training to offer boots or other memorabilia to young fans.\nGarnacho is starting to gravitate towards the older players in the group. Within the squad, he is no longer recognised as a new kid on the block.\nGoing into Sunday's game there are questions around his future, but only time will tell if that lies at Old Trafford or elsewhere.\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

Only authorised persons can go in close proximity to them to perform a specific task,\" Mr Sharma said.\nInitial reports in the media called the video \"heartwarming\" but many on social media raised concerns about the safety of people and animals in such situations. Others suggested a better option would be for the authorities to create ponds and water bodies in the park to ensure the cats did not have to go far for water in the hot summer.\nVillages on the park's border have been tense as cheetahs wander into their fields and kill their livestock. Last month, some villagers pelted the cats with stones to stop such attacks, The New Indian Express newspaper reported. Officials say they have been trying to raise awareness in the villages so that people adapt to living near the animals.\nTwenty cheetahs were relocated from South Africa and Namibia to the Kuno national park in the central state of Madhya Pradesh between 2022 and 2023 in what was the first such intercontinental translocation of the big cats.\nEight of them have since died due to various reasons, including kidney failure and mating injuries, sparking concerns about whether conditions at Kuno are suitable for them. \nIn 2023, South African and Namibian experts involved with the project wrote to India's Supreme Court, saying they believed that some of these deaths could have been prevented by \"better monitoring of animals and more appropriate and timely veterinary care\". \nExperts from the Namibia-based Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), which has been involved with the project since its inception, had also raised concerns about inadequate record-keeping at Kuno. They told the BBC that the park management had \"little or no scientific training\" and the vets were \"too inexperienced to manage a project of this calibre\".\nPark authorities have rejected the allegations and say there are now a total of 26 cheetahs, including 17 in the wild and nine others that are kept in enclosures at the moment.\nThis year, India is expected to receive 20 more cheetahs from South Africa. Officials say the big cats have already been identified by a task force in collaboration with South African authorities.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

Officials say the big cats have already been identified by a task force in collaboration with South African authorities.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.Read more:Is India's cheetah reintroduction effort in crisis?Cheetahs born in India 70 years after extinctionInside India's plan to bring back extinct cheetahsSeventh cheetah dies in India since reintroductionWildlifeIndia Officials say they have been trying to raise awareness in the villages so that people adapt to living near the animals.Twenty cheetahs were relocated from South Africa and Namibia to the Kuno national park in the central state of Madhya Pradesh between 2022 and 2023 in what was the first such intercontinental translocation of the big cats.Eight of them have since died due to various reasons, including kidney failure and mating injuries, sparking concerns about whether conditions at Kuno are suitable for them. Others suggested a better option would be for the authorities to create ponds and water bodies in the park to ensure the cats did not have to go far for water in the hot summer.Villages on the park's border have been tense as cheetahs wander into their fields and kill their livestock. Officials say it's not uncommon for certain staff members to offer water to big cats if they get close to the boundary of the national park to lure them back into the forest.The mum and her cubs were in the fields close to the boundary, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Uttam Kumar Sharma told PTI.",

        "article_text": "In his first few weeks back in the Oval Office, US President Donald Trump made several extraordinary decisions on foreign policy.\nHe threatened to annex Greenland, announced plans to \"take over\" Gaza, and started to remove the US from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN Paris climate agreement. He has also shuttered the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the government's main overseas aid agency.\nMany of these moves are not very popular with ordinary Americans, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Centre. It surveyed 3,605 US adults in late March - just before Trump imposed sweeping trade tariffs on countries around the world.\nHere are four takeaways from the Pew research.\nTrump has increased his rhetoric on \"getting\" Greenland, and Vice-President JD Vance recently took a controversial trip to the Arctic island.\nBut Pew found that most survey respondents (54%) did not think the US should take over the Danish territory. When asked if they think Trump would actually pursue the plan, 23% thought it was extremely likely, but a greater number (34%) said they believed he would not carry through with it.\nTrump also proposed an American takeover of the Gaza Strip, resettling two million Palestinians in neighbouring countries with no right of return. This would violate international law and has been described as \"tantamount to ethnic cleansing\" by the UN.\nOf those surveyed, 62% of Americans opposed such a move, compared to 15% who favoured it. Opinions were divided as to whether Trump was likely to actually pursue it. Again, the greater number (38%) thought it very or extremely unlikely.\nTrump signed executive orders to remove the US from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Paris Agreement on climate change, and said USAID largely would be shut down.\nMore Americans disapprove than approve of such moves, the survey suggests - although the results are not a landslide.\nAt the start of his second presidency, Trump said he would \"work together, very closely\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine - a very different approach to that of his predecessor, Joe Biden.\nThe Pew research found 43% of respondents thought Trump favoured Russia too much - a higher number than the 31% who said he was striking the right balance between both sides. \nSince the survey was conducted, however, Trump's mood appears to have changed. He has said he is \"very angry\" with Putin over Ukraine negotiations.\nMeanwhile, Trump's relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has grown increasingly close this year.\nAnswering a question about whether Trump was favouring Israelis or Palestinians, 31% of those surveyed thought he favoured Israelis too much. Close behind at 29% were those who thought Trump was striking the right balance. \nLarger than either of these, however, was the group of respondents who were not sure (37%). Just 3% felt he was favouring  Palestinians too much.\nWhile Pew Research Centre is non-partisan, those surveyed were not.\nThe results showed that most of the respondents (64%) who described themselves as Republican - or Republican-leaning - supported the move by the Republican president to end USAID, for example. \nThat compared to just 9% of opposing Democrats - or Democratic-leaning - respondents who felt the same way, indicating a high level of polarisation.\nGenerally, it is older adults who support Trump's foreign policy actions, more than younger adults, the research suggested.\nPew also asked about tariffs on China, although this research was carried out before the situation escalated sharply into the trade war that is now under way.\nGenerally, more Americans said the tariffs would be bad for them personally, but those who were Republican, or leant more towards that party, believed the tariffs would benefit the US.",

        "article_text": "Markets are reeling from US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, but the American leader is standing by his decisions, defending his policies and saying \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something\". \nExperts answered some of the questions you sent us as the world tries to make sense of the turmoil and wonders how long it will continue.\nRead their answers below.\nSimon Jack, the BBC's business editor, said the FTSE 100, which represents the 100 biggest companies publicly listed in the UK, were all \"put in a big bucket back in 1984\" and given a certain weighting in that bucket depending on how big those companies were. \nThe stock market is a reflection of their total value over time. The bigger the company, the more weight it has in the index. For example, an AstraZeneca or an HSBC has more weight than others.\nIt works the same in the US with the S&P500, which is made up of the 500 biggest companies, with an enormous concentration in some names like Apple, Nvidia and Amazon. \nThe stock market tells you how the value of the shares in those companies has changed - with a focus on those biggest names.\nGenerally speaking, it is an indication of what some of our biggest companies are worth, and when they go up or down, it tells you something about the sentiment of whether their profits are likely to rise or fall in the future.\nJack explains that what happens in stock markets is not necessarily the same thing that happens in the economy. They can be linked, but they are not exactly the same. \nSome people invest directly in shares - and this will definitely affect them. These are some big falls, some of the biggest we have seen in a couple days since pandemic panic gripped the markets back in 2020.\nThe other way that people are exposed to these changes is through their pension funds. Pension fund investing is a long term game. Not all of your money will go into shares - some will go into government bonds, and the closer you get to retirement, the more weighting you will have in things like cash and government bonds, so the less this will affect you. \nThere are two types of pensions: a defined benefit pension - where you get a promised percentage of your salary at retirement - and defined contribution - where your pension pots value will rise and fall with financial markets.\nPensions are exposed right now, but pension investing is a long term game. \nThe warning sign flashing here is not the value of your pension pot - it is what is going to happen to the economies in which we all live and work.\nA lot of people are saying the chance of recession in both the US, UK - and even globally - have gone up a notch, which has implications for things like jobs and wages.\nThere is growing scepticism about tariffs among Americans, although views still fall along partisan lines.\nAccording to one poll released last week, slightly more than half of Republicans, 52%, think tariffs help the economy, but 58% of independents say they hurt the economy, as do 89% of Democrats. \nHowever, that survey was held before Trump's global tariffs came into effect and trillions of dollars was wiped off the value of the US stock market. We will find out in the coming days how the economic turmoil has changed public sentiment. \nOne of the key factors in President Trump's 2024 election victory was that more voters trusted him to improve the US economy, and especially to tackle high prices.\nYet most economists warn that tariffs could drive up prices for US consumers as almost all imported goods will face a tax. \nThere could be inflation and we could also see an economic downturn, and potentially a recession.\nSome think that the whole exercise is about an economic proxy war with China and the entire game is about just trying to level that playing field a little bit, Jack said.\nBut Trump is right in one regard, which is that American markets are much more open to foreign goods than a lot of foreign markets are open to US goods. \nThe UK, for example, puts a 10% tariff on US imported cars, 14% on some kinds of beef, and 8% on other things. So there are barriers both ways. \nAnd while Trump says that other countries have been ripping off the US, it is American corporations that have reasonably pursued shareholder value by trying to put their production facilities in the strategically and economically best places.\nIt is the head of American corporations who opened subsidiaries in Ireland, where there is a low tax rate, and put manufacturing in Vietnam or Cambodia. In a way this has been the sort of rational pursuit of maximum profit, a system which has made the US very rich indeed.\nChina is getting very rich indeed as well, and it is certainly moving up the value chain. \nThere is a feeling that the US was very comfortable when China was making cheap sneakers and t-shirts, but when China starts making supercomputers and missiles the US gets a little bit more concerned, and that is one of the reasons you are seeing some of these tensions come to the fore.\nThat is really the unknown question right now, Davison said, but one thing we can expect is more volatility. \nWe got a little bit of a sense of how markets react on Friday when Trump said he had spoken with Vietnamese officials and there was potentially a deal in the works for Vietnam. \nThe country has been hit with a 46% tariff by the US, which is quite a significant level, and Vietnam has indicated that it could reduce to zero all its tariffs on US goods going into that country. Stocks like Nike and Lululemon actually increase on that news, because these are apparel companies that have a very big presence in Vietnam.\nBroadly, I believe we are going to see markets go down, but you could see particular stocks moving in a more positive direction as there are indications that there may be some exemptions allowed. \nWe do not know what Trump will allow - he has sent some big signals at times saying that his policies will never change, but has also suggested that some deals are possible.",

Many nations will face much higher tariffs of up to 50%, starting on 9 April.\nTrump has said his intervention was aimed at encouraging US consumers to buy more American goods and boost the domestic economy.\nBut the announcement - and retaliatory tariffs from countries such as China - led to stocks plunging more than 5% amid fears of a global recession.\nJaguar Land Rover announced on Saturday it would \"pause\" all shipments to the US as it works to \"address the new trading terms\".\nSir Keir wrote: \"This week we will turbocharge plans that will improve our domestic competitiveness, so we're less exposed to these kinds of global shocks.\n\"We stand ready to use industrial policy to help shelter British business from the storm.\"\nThe prime minister admitted some may feel \"uncomfortable\" with the government intervening in the economy, but said the UK could not \"cling to old sentiments when the world is turning this fast\". \nHe has not ruled out further tax rises in the autumn, but pointed out the government had resisted doing so in its Spring Statement. \nAn industrial strategy promised in Labour's election manifesto is due to be unveiled this summer.

        "article_text": "\"Je m'appelle Luis Enrique.\" \nThat's how the Paris St-Germain manager introduced himself to the cameras in Paris back in July 2023.\nBut beyond that, he keeps his French private - except for his favourite phrase: on va gagner (\"we're going to win\"). \nThat pretty much sums the Spaniard up: Honest, direct and not one for show. \nLuis Enrique doesn't perform. He is intense, an obsessive and he lets the work speak for itself.\nAnd what work it has been, transforming PSG from a star-studded squad to a collective, cohesive and resilient unit.\nSaturday's win against Angers secured back-to-back Ligue 1 titles for Luis Enrique's PSG, as they remain unbeaten in the league all season.\nThey still have a chance of repeating last season's domestic treble and, with a Champions League quarter-final coming up against Aston Villa, a first European title is a serious possibility.\nWinning titles is nothing new to the French champions but Luis Enrique has helped turn them from a team long associated with egos and big-money into a vibrant, youthful and thrilling team to watch.\nSo how have PSG and Luis Enrique finally started to win over the neutrals?\nTragedy, withdrawal & ruthlessness: The Luis Enrique story\nLuis Enrique is World Cup winner on Twitch with live Q&As\nPSG beat Angers to clinch Ligue 1 title with six games left\nLife has hit Luis Enrique hard.\nIn 2019, he lost his nine-year-old daughter Xana to a rare form of bone cancer. \nHe has spoken about her with remarkable calm. \"Her body is gone,\" he said, \"but she hasn't died. She's still with us.\"\nIn a deeply moving documentary, he talked about visiting his mother.\n\"My mother couldn't keep photos of Xana. Until I came home and asked, 'Why are there no photos of Xana, Mom?' 'I can't, I can't\u2026,' she used to say. 'Mom, you have to put up photos of Xana, Xana is alive,' I replied.\"\n\"Physically, she may not be here, but spiritually she is. Because every day we talk about her, we laugh, and we remember because I think Xana still sees us.\"\nIn her memory, he and his wife have launched a foundation to help families of terminally ill children - especially those who can't afford to stop working during their child's final months. \nIt's an act of love and fierce purpose. Like everything he does.\nHe is a man grounded in more ways than one.\nFor over two years, he's walked barefoot most mornings on the grass of the pitches of the PSG training ground. \nHe's convinced that 'earthing' helps him avoid spring allergies and reconnect with something deeper. \nHe's strict with his body, too. He stretches every 30 minutes at the training ground, trains daily - even at home sometimes, weaving between sofas and walls - and has turned both house and office into functional gyms, with straps and bars hanging from ceilings and walls.\nHe enjoys surfing, swimming, endurance running and long cycle rides up the steep climbs of Spain's Picos de Europa. \nIn 2007, he completed the Frankfurt Ironman challenge - a 2.4-mile swim, a 118-mile cycle and a full marathon. The following year, he ran the legendary Marathon de Sables, a 155-mile race over six days in the Sahara desert.\n\"I only know how to compete,\" he said to himself when he retired from playing in 2004. Managing was the only option for the former Barcelona and Spain forward.\nAs a coach, Luis Enrique has copied the philosophy of his former team-mate Pep Guardiola from the beginning. \nHe hasn't brought anything truly new to the table, but, using the tonnes of energy he has, he has become one of the top representatives of a broader cultural shift.\nHis relentless edge is now driving everything at Paris St-Germain, although initially he didn't even want the job.\nHe thought the club only cared about names. Players such as Neymar, Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe. Uncoachable, he assumed. \nBut when he heard the philosophy had changed - that they now wanted to build a team - he reconsidered. \nAnd, soon after he arrived, Neymar and Marco Verratti were gone. Messi, who might have stayed had he known Luis Enrique was coming, had already committed to Inter Miami.\nHe understands and appreciates the importance of individual stars, but only up to a point. \nIn a recent documentary about his first season at PSG, he was seen warning Mbappe, his star player at the time, about his obligation to fulfil his defensive duties - just after the player had scored a hat-trick.\n\"He's the best player in the world,\" the Asturian insisted several times. \"But if the team with the best player in the world always won, PSG would have eight Champions League titles and they haven't had any.\"\nHe is a manager who respects structure, but is never afraid to speak his mind. \n\"I'm not afraid of the worst in football... if they sack me, no problem,\" he said. \"The next day, I'll go for a cycling trip.\" \nIt's that perspective that helped him ride out a rocky start last season - including a 4\u20131 loss to Newcastle in the Champions League and heavy criticism from the supporters.\nBut he stayed calm and kept faith in his footballing beliefs. Structure, repetition, and positional discipline. \nHis dream? One day, managers will have mics in the stands and be able to talk players through their positions during a match.\nHe had to rewire a squad addicted to chaos when he arrived in Paris.\nSo he spent little time in an office, instead sitting with his assistants, working directly with his players and embedding his ideas.\nSome players push back against his intensity. Mbappe, for example, didn't love being boxed in as a number nine or publicly challenged after a hat-trick.\nBut others thrive, because he doesn't do favourites.\nHe could not care less if the media don't like him. \nThe three-part documentary about his life is titled You Lot Haven't Got A Clue - a message to the media and a window into how little their opinions affect him. \nHe admitted, if it were up to him, he would take a 50% pay cut if that meant he would not have to speak to the media again. \n\"I don't read the opinions of the journalists,\" he once said, \"not because of a lack of respect, but because, logically, they haven't dedicated even 10% of the time, nor do they have the information, that my staff and I have on any given issue.\"\nAnd there lies another contradiction - a coach unwilling to give one-on-one interviews, yet prepared to expose himself for all to see in a documentary.\nNot for the first time, either.\nNothing was off-limits when, during the World Cup in Qatar, much of Spain was glued to their computer screens as Luis Enrique, then in charge of the national team, spent hours on Twitch answering questions on all aspects of his life as far ranging as why he ate six eggs a day, hated cheese and slept naked.\nHis reasons for his regular streams were the same as why he agreed to the documentary: to offer his most honest version and let people judge. \n\nDiscipline, injuries & family - how Dembele turned career around\nForward Ousmane Dembele has been one of PSG's success stories.\nLast summer, Luis Enrique gave him a mission to score more goals. The message was clear: be more selfish and shoot more. \nDembele listened. He's now thriving in a central role, playing as a false nine, more involved in the build-up, getting more touches, more shots, more goals. \nHe's not the erratic winger from his Barcelona days. He's focused. And the goals have flowed, having now scored 32 goals in all competitions this season.\nFor Luis Enrique, failure isn't trying and falling short. It's failing to give everything.\nHe has carried the belief that football isn't life or death since his playing days. He'll never shed a tear over a defeat. \nWhen it became clear that Mbappe was leaving last summer, he said something that may come to define his PSG reign.\n\"The team will play better,\" he said. No longer forced to design a side around one star, he felt liberated. \"Next year,\" he thought, \"I'm going to control everything that happens on the pitch.\"\nAnd this is very much his PSG, a team that many believe could achieve their dream of finally winning the Champions League.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "The last time there was no Manchester club in the Premier League's top two was 2016-17, and it has only happened four times since City were promoted in 2002\n\"Not so much red or blue - grey would be better.\"\nThe overwhelming feeling around the 196th Manchester derby was neatly summed up by a comment posted on the BBC Sport website.\nIt might be a stretch to claim, as one respondent did, it was 'the worst derby match in the world'. But the sentiment encapsulated the mood.\n\"It's a Manchester derby,\" seethed former United captain Gary Neville on Sky Sports after the dull goalless draw at Old Trafford. \"It should have more blood, thunder, risk, and courage involved in playing the game.\n\"The congratulations and love-in I'm watching says both teams are happy with 0-0. It looks like it's Sunday afternoon and they're going to go for a roast dinner together now.\"\nUnited head coach Ruben Amorim has not been in England long but the former Sporting boss has worked a few things out.\n\"I understand everything,\" he said. \"Gary Neville is critical about everything. I understand that part.\"\nAmorim's assessment was a simple one. How could anyone expect a reprise of the great games of the past, from either the red or blue sides of the great Mancunian divide, given where the two teams are at the moment?\nCity remain outside the top four, which would guarantee qualification for the Champions League next season. \nMore pertinently, while they remain fifth - which will almost certainly secure a spot in Europe's elite competition - they will drop down if Newcastle win either of their two matches in hand, starting with Monday's home match against nearly doomed Leicester.\n\"I understand we are, in the moment, doing the worst season in history,\" said Amorim. \"Manchester City won everything in the past but this season are struggling.\n\"We are not in the best moments to give the best spectacle to every fan. When we are not fighting for the big things, of course it's different.\n\"You have to look at the context of the game. I understand the critical aspect of players that played in this game in a different way, because they were fighting for the titles every time.\"\nUnsurprisingly, another outspoken former United captain wasn't having any of that.\n\"They get interviewed as if a draw isn't too bad,\" Roy Keane said. \"A draw doesn't get you anywhere fast. It isn't good enough.\n\"Forget the top teams. I'm on about competing with Brentford and Crystal Palace and Wolves and all these teams. Are you telling me Man Utd should be behind them, even with this group of players?\"\nFor context, United - on course for their worst-ever Premier League season - are six points ahead of Wolves. Brentford, one place above them in 12th, are four points ahead.\nThere were also post-match chants against the Glazer family from home fans who stayed behind, determined to crank up pressure on the American majority owners, who they blame for United's parlous state.\nBut Amorim and City boss Pep Guardiola have to set aside the noise to deliver significant improvement.\n\"You see the numbers of players who have been at the top for four, five, six years,\" said Guardiola. \"This year, we drop. It's not one, it's all of them - that's why we are struggling to win games.\"\nMan Utd midfielder Bruno Fernandes had a different take on the lack of intensity.\n\"It can't be like it was in the past, a lot of things have changed, with VAR, everything,\" he said. \"With VAR, you can't do that. We can't be as rough as we want in the duels. Everything has changed.\"\n\"That was one of the dullest Manchester derbies I've seen,\" Chris Sutton told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"It tells you where the clubs are at. Both have a lot of work to do in the summer.\"\nMan City miss chance to move into top four with dull derby draw\nFans 'should be ashamed' of Foden chants - Guardiola\nNo wins for top five - how race for Europe stands\nUnited's problems are huge.\nIt is difficult to imagine Amorim choosing many of the players available to him in an ideal squad.\nBut the fundamental point is a lack of goal threat. United have failed to score in 11 of their 31 Premier League games this season. Aside from matches against the three teams destined to go down, they have scored two goals or more on six occasions, including when they lost at home to Nottingham Forest on 7 December.\n\"We had the same lack of goal [threat],\" said Amorim, when asked about comparisons to last Tuesday's defeat by Forest at the City Ground.\nUnited need to be significantly better at recruitment in the summer than they have been on the pitch this term.\nWing-backs, central defenders and central midfield are all areas of weakness, let alone up front, where Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee continue to toil for little reward. It is now a combined four goals in 48 appearances for the pair since the Europa League win over Viktoria Plzen on 12 December, when Hojlund scored twice.\nOn Sunday, Amorim talked about how he thinks things are going on the good days. That implied there have been other days when he has wondered if United are heading in the right direction.\n\"In the moment it's still really hard every day, but of course you can imagine that the next season is going to be so much different,\" he said. \"That's why I'm always saying I'm in a rush. Everybody here is suffering a lot with all these changes. We have to show something in the next year, right away.\n\"In the good days you think like that, that it was important to come [here] in the middle of the season, to work with the players, to improve the players as soon as possible, to start the next season with the better idea of what we want.\"\nFor City, the journey to the preferred destination is far easier to navigate and there is more belief in Guardiola to keep everyone on the right path.\nYet, for them too there are hazards, not least in the unknowns. \nBy his own admission, he kept faith in too many of his long-serving players last summer. That will not happen again. \nWe already know Kevin de Bruyne is leaving but there are questions over plenty of others in his squad, not all of them fringe, injured or unwanted players. \nThe futures of Jack Grealish, Bernardo Silva and Ederson, all involved against United, have to be determined. \nJuventus full-back Andrea Cambiaso and Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Florian Wirtz are mentioned most frequently as likely additions to Guardiola's squad - but there will probably be more than two new faces.\nClearly, who they can sign will be impacted by the outcome of the hearing into the 115 charges of alleged Premier League financial rule breaches. Guardiola cannot control that situation. \nCity's status and the pull of the manager will ensure they remain an attractive proposition even if they fail to qualify for next season's Champions League. \nHowever, it would be a blow to his pride if, for the first time in his senior managerial career, he fails to take a team into the elite club competition. Not that he is thinking so far ahead. \n\"Eight games, Crystal Palace [next], go for it,\" he said. \"I'd prefer to have 10 or 12 more points but it is what it is. I'm not concerned about next season right now, I'm just concerned about recovery.\n\"Crystal Palace, Everton, Aston Villa and the FA Cup semi-final [against Nottingham Forest].\"\nLooking ahead for red and blue is appropriate in Manchester just now. It's the easiest way of banishing the memory of what happened (or didn't) at Old Trafford.\nPremier League Review with Darren Fletcher\nPremier League index\nPremier League table\nPremier League fixtures\nFollow your Premier League club and get news, analysis and fan views sent direct to you",

        "article_text": "Treatments to remove wrinkles and tone arms, thighs and stomachs are driving a rise in cosmetic surgery, the latest figures from UK private clinics suggest.\nThere were 27,462 procedures performed in 2024 - a 5% rise on 2023 - of which more than nine in ten were on women.\nBoob jobs remained the most popular treatment, followed by breast reduction surgery in second place.\nBut much of the rise was driven by increases in facial rejuvenation surgery, such as face and brow lifts and body contouring procedures like liposuction and tummy tucks, according to the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS).\nThe association's president said surgery has become cheaper and easier to access, while some patients say there is less stigma around cosmetic procedures.\nThe most popular cosmetic surgeries, with their change from 2023 to 2024, are:\nThere was also a 24% rise in thigh lifts, and a 13% increase in brachioplasty, or \"bingo wing\" removal.\nNon-surgical procedures like botox and fillers were also popular: nearly 10,000 were performed by BAAPS members in 2024.\nBut \"designer vagina\" labiaplasty surgery, which changes the shape or size of the labia, appeared less popular, with the number carried out down by 7%.\nNugent said that cosmetic surgery had become \"more accessible\", and while she acknowledged that treatments still were expensive, she said that they had become a bit more affordable.\nThis has coincided with a \"shift in attitude\" towards cosmetic procedures over the past decade because of a movement in society \"towards wellness and looking after oneself\", she said. Cosmetic surgery is \"more normalised\", she added.\nSome of the growth in cosmetic surgery is also caused by people who previously had non-surgical procedures, like filler and Botox, now choosing to go under the knife because they were getting \"fatigue\" from repeatedly going to clinics to get the work done, Nugent said.\nAnd the rise of weight-loss injections such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro have played a role, too. Nugent said that some people taking these medications, also known as \"skinny jabs\", are getting surgery on their face.\n\"As they lose weight they start to notice deflation and some sagging of their face,\" she said.\nThe BAAPS statistics do not show how many people have surgery after taking weight-loss drugs, but Nugent said that of the patients she has treated, \"more and more\" are people taking the medications.\nPeople have cosmetic surgery for a wide range of reasons.\nKirsten White, 33, a talent acquisition specialist from Sheffield, had a breast reduction and uplift after losing weight with a gastric sleeve.\nShe said her \"breasts were basically down to my bellybutton\" before surgery, leading to backache and the need for physiotherapy, she said.\n\"I don't think people are surprised when I tell them I've had cosmetic surgery because I think it's pretty normal now,\" she said. \n\"There's not so much the stigma that there used to be that it's really taboo and people are a lot more supportive of doing what will make you feel happy.\"\nMen underwent 1,799 surgical procedures in 2024, a slight drop from 2023 - making up just 6.6% of all surgeries in the BAAPS dataset.\nNose jobs (rhinoplasty) remained the most popular among men, with 332 surgeries done in 2024, which is a 14% drop on 2023.\nFace and neck lifts increased by 26%, with 140 done in 2024, suggesting a growing interest in anti-aging procedures among men - though Nugent said it was harder to spot trends for men due to the smaller numbers treated.\nBeauty standards are shaped by social media and celebrity culture, said Dr Beth Daniels, director of the Centre for Appearance Research at UWE Bristol. \nThe pandemic also caused a shift, when the move towards video calls \"heightened our awareness of our appearance\" because people saw their own faces on their computer screens.\nDr Daniels said that society places value on youthful looks, which could push some women to get cosmetic procedures.\n\"As women age, they're often discounted in a number of ways\" and are \"made to feel invisible in society\", she said.\nBAAPS vice president Anthony Macquillan suggested the overall increase in facelifts could be linked to societal changes, such as the rising pension age.\nHe said: \"For many, this type of surgery is not just aesthetic but also functional, helping to maintain confidence, secure employment, and reduce anxiety associated with age-related bias.\"\nThe BAAPS data is based on statistics from 233 of its members. Jim Frame, president of the UK Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons and professor at Anglia Ruskin University, said that it does not cover all of the cosmetic surgery operations that happen in the UK because some is carried out by ENT and maxillofacial surgeons, or by non-BAAPS members, especially fillers and Botox.\nThe data also does not include surgeries carried out overseas, where the lower cost of treatment in countries like Turkey attracts Brits. \nCosmetic procedures and surgery carry risks and the NHS warns that they \"can lead to serious complications if they're not done correctly\". \nIt advises people to research thoroughly beforehand, including checking the credibility of the clinic and getting information about the most common complications of the procedure.\n\"There are a lot of susceptible people that are committing to surgeries that a fairly large proportion will regret,\" Prof Frame said.",

Nugent said that some people taking these medications, also known as \"skinny jabs\", are getting surgery on their face. \"As they lose weight they start to notice deflation and some sagging of their face,\" she said.The BAAPS statistics do not show how many people have surgery after taking weight-loss drugs, but Nugent said that of the patients she has treated, \"more and more\" are people taking the medications. Cosmetic surgery is \"more normalised\", she added.Some of the growth in cosmetic surgery is also caused by people who previously had non-surgical procedures, like filler and Botox, now choosing to go under the knife because they were getting \"fatigue\" from repeatedly going to clinics to get the work done, Nugent said.And the rise of weight-loss injections such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro have played a role, too. \"Kirsten WhiteKirsten White says there's less stigma about people getting cosmetic proceduresMen underwent 1,799 surgical procedures in 2024, a slight drop from 2023 - making up just 6.6% of all surgeries in the BAAPS dataset.Nose jobs (rhinoplasty) remained the most popular among men, with 332 surgeries done in 2024, which is a 14% drop on 2023.Face and neck lifts increased by 26%, with 140 done in 2024, suggesting a growing interest in anti-aging procedures among men - though Nugent said it was harder to spot trends for men due to the smaller numbers treated.Video calls 'heightened our awareness of our appearance'Beauty standards are shaped by social media and celebrity culture, said Dr Beth Daniels, director of the Centre for Appearance Research at UWE Bristol.",

        "article_text": "Max Verstappen won the Japanese Grand Prix for the fourth successive time as he fended off McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.\nFormula 1 now heads to Bahrain for the second race of a triple-header, from 11-13 April.\nBefore that, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions.\nWhy do drivers rate Suzuka as their favourite circuit when pole usually wins and there is very little chance of overtaking? Sunday's race was quite boring once Max Verstappen got to the first corner before Lando Norris. - Stuart\nThe two things - the concept of a favourite circuit and one where overtaking is very difficult and the racing therefore sometimes uneventful - are not mutually exclusive.\nJust look at Monaco. The drivers love the challenge of the track, but accept the race is likely going to be processional. So too with Suzuka.\nSome drivers did remark on the lack of action. But Fernando Alonso had a more nuanced take.\nAlonso has won at both Monaco and Suzuka, and made one of his greatest - one of the greatest - overtaking moves there when he passed Michael Schumacher's Ferrari around the outside of 130R in 2005.\nAlonso said: \"This is Suzuka. I don't remember a race many times in the past where there is lots of overtaking without the weather changing.\n\"It seems every year we repeat always on Thursday how great Suzuka is, how great Monaco is, the glamour, the spectacular weekend, and then on Sunday we wake up and say: 'Ah, Monaco is boring, what can we do to the track? Suzuka is boring.'\n\"Instead of looking at the negative, I try to enjoy the experience, and it was another great Suzuka.\"\nOne thing is worth mentioning here. The resurfacing of the track in the first sector changed Suzuka this year from a circuit where tyre degradation was high, to one where it was low.\nThat changed the race from a two-stop strategy to a one. Add in the difficulty of overtaking to an event where there were no significant tyre-pace offsets developing, and the race was always likely to be processional.\nThis, though, led to a race that was driven pretty much flat out all the way by the drivers. And that - rare in the Pirelli era - they enjoy.\nSo just because it fell short as entertainment, as a challenge for the drivers, it was very real.\nMax Verstappen - sensational all weekend on his way to victory - said: \"It was a fun race. The whole race I saw two orange cars in my mirror and, especially those last 20 laps, we were pushing quite hard out there. You had to keep on fighting it, basically being on the limit.\"\nOn the limit for an hour and a half around the greatest circuit on the planet. No racing driver is ever going to find that boring.\nBahrain Grand Prix\n11-13 April - race starts at 16:00 BST on 13 April\nSakhir\nGiven the demotion to Racing Bulls for Liam Lawson, what are Jack Doohan's chances looking like at Alpine given that Franco Colapinto is a reserve driver? - Anjum\nWell, the first thing to say is just because Red Bull demoted Lawson, that does not necessarily mean Alpine will do the same to Doohan.\nOn the surface, the Australian has had a traumatic start to the season. In three races so far, he has had two massive, expensive crashes. One when he spun in the wet in Australia, and one in Friday practice in Japan. Both were his errors.\nDoohan was not the only driver to crash in the difficult wet conditions in Melbourne. Fernando Alonso and Carlos Sainz also did. And many more drivers spun or made mistakes.\nAnd there were some significant mitigating circumstances in Suzuka.\nDoohan's crash was caused by him entering Turn One with the DRS overtaking aid still open. So the car didn't have enough downforce to cope with the G-forces on it.\nHe had been doing the same in the simulator in preparation for the race, thinking the DRS was closing automatically. But with the small lift he had on this particular lap, it did not.\nAt the same time, given his inexperience, it perhaps would have been a good idea for the engineers to remind him of it.\nAlpine, though, had not realised he had been doing this in the simulator.\nAnother mitigating factor was Doohan was under pressure to make up time because he had missed first practice while reserve driver Ryo Hirakawa was given an outing in his car.\nWhy did Alpine not put Hirakawa in team-mate Pierre Gasly's car for first practice given Doohan's lack of experience at Suzuka? They had a difficult weekend in China and wanted to evaluate some new set-up ideas, for which they felt they needed Gasly's experience.\nDespite the two big accidents, Alpine feel Doohan has, on balance, had a positive start to the season, with some promising pace hidden by some unfortunate circumstances.\nBut he is certainly not safe yet.\nShould they decide to replace him, Alpine have two reserve drivers who could potentially step up - Colapinto and Estonian Paul Aron.\nSince signing Colapinto from Williams, following his cameo role in the final few races of last season, the theory has been the access to Latin American money the Argentine gives means Doohan is on borrowed time.\nBut that threat seems to have diminished for now, the funding perhaps more theoretical than real.\nUltimately, though, Doohan's fate rests on the whim of Alpine executive adviser Flavio Briatore. He'll decide what he decides, when he decides it.\nWas Yuki Tsunoda's Red Bull debut a success, and is he an improvement on Liam Lawson? - Ed\nTsunoda set himself the target of scoring points on debut at Red Bull, and finished the race 12th, behind the Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso. So, by the standards he set himself, it was not a success.\nRed Bull want Tsunoda to be scoring good points to boost their bid for the constructors' title. So by their standards, it was not a success either.\nHaving said that, it certainly showed promise.\nHe started off strongly, being close on pace to Max Verstappen in first practice, and was again looking decent in final practice.\nIn first qualifying, again he was only 0.1secs from Verstappen.\nFor second qualifying, Red Bull chose to give him one set of used tyres and one of new - not unusual for a quick driver in a quick car, but perhaps a mistake given his lack of experience with the team.\nThat meant he had only one realistic shot at getting into the top 10 shootout. And Tsunoda made an error on his only flying lap on new tyres, going into Turn One 15km/h faster than ever before, and having a moment.\nHis race was dictated by qualifying 14th, but he did overtake Lawson on lap one then pull off an undercut pass on Pierre Gasly's Alpine.\nAs for comparisons with Lawson before him, Tsunoda was a definite step up. He was faster than Lawson ever was, and looked a lot more in control and confident.\nBut he will have to do better than this in the future to have any chance of keeping a seat at Red Bull in 2026.\nHow likely is it that George Russell and Andrea Kimi Antonelli will race for Mercedes in 2026, with both out of contract this year? \u2013 John\nThe answer to this question depends entirely upon Max Verstappen.\nIf the world champion decides to stay at Red Bull, Mercedes will keep Russell and Antonelli next year.\nIf he decides to move, Mercedes is his most likely option, in which case Toto Wolff would have to decide which driver to keep.\nOn performance right now, that would be Russell. But Antonelli is only 18, just three races into his career, and believed to have rich promise. Jettisoning him after a year would be harsh indeed.\nIn that scenario, Russell is likely to be an attractive candidate to Red Bull, too.\nWhat will Verstappen do? For now, he is relaxed and waiting to see how the season develops. He is under contract to Red Bull until the end of 2028, but has performance-related get-out clauses if he wants to leave.\nThe difficulty in making any decision about the future is no-one is absolutely certain what next year and beyond will look like in terms of engines.\nMercedes are widely believed to be ahead on development of the new 2026 power-units. But their future is uncertain.\nFIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem is pushing for an early abandonment of the 2026 engine formula and a return to naturally aspirated V10s running on sustainable fuel. Why, he has yet to explain. But for now all that matters is he is.\nThat exact route looks unlikely to happen. Ferrari and Red Bull back the V10 idea, but it is not appealing to Mercedes, Honda or Audi - and that's more than enough manufacturers to vote that idea down under F1's rule structures.\nBut that does not mean a change won't come before 2031 - the current end of the new engine regs.\nPerhaps manufacturers would agree to a different, bigger engine - a V8, for example - with a turbo and some hybrid element, but not as much as the 50% of total power planned for next year.\nThere is a meeting to discuss F1's future engine direction in Bahrain on Friday and no-one knows what the conclusion will be - or indeed if there will be one.\nVerstappen will wait a little longer to see how things stand on many fronts before making any decision on his future.\nBetween a packed calendar, other commitments and strict regulations on costs, how much time do F1 drivers actually get to practise driving their cars during a season? Is it mostly simulator based? \u2013 Arv\nIn-season testing in current cars is forbidden by F1's regulations.\nDrivers are allowed to test in cars that are more than a year old. This was unrestricted for a while, but has for 2025 been limited for current drivers to 1,000km a year.\nDrivers can also participate in Pirelli tyre development tests in the latest cars, or whatever spec of car is required, if called upon.\nOther than that, the only \"practice\" they get is in the simulator.\nWhether the best drivers in the world need any practice in a year in which there are 24 grands prix is another question.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\nHow Verstappen stole Suzuka with McLaren stuck in 'rabbit hole'\nJapanese Grand Prix Review\nHow to follow Bahrain Grand Prix on the BBC",

The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.\nThe immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.\nBut sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.\nThe new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.\n\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.\n\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"\nThe scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.\nExperts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.\nPassengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.\nThe digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.\nLying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.\nThis would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on.\nAll died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson.\n\"They kept the lights and the power working to the end, to give the crew time to launch the lifeboats safely with some light instead of in absolute darkness,\" he told the BBC.\n\"They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern.\"\nA new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.\nIt takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.\n\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.\nThe simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.\nTitanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded. \nBut the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.\n\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.\n\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"\nUnfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.\nThe human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.\nPersonal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.\nThe scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.\n\"She's only giving her stories to us a little bit at a time,\" said Parks Stephenson.\n\"Every time, she leaves us wanting for more.\"",

        "article_text": "A photographer's iconic shot of polar bears in abandoned buildings on a Russian island shines a spotlight on wider changes in their behaviour.\nIn September 2021, Russian wildlife photographer Dmitry Kokh and his team were sailing around the wild and remote Chukotka Peninsula in Russia's extreme northeast. They were hoping to visit Wrangel Island, a well-known gathering place for polar bears, when the weather turned.\n\"We faced a heavy storm, with super-strong wind and waves, and we tried to find a place to shelter from the storm because the boat was small,\" Kokh recalls. They sheltered near the rocky shore of a small, uninhabited island called Kolyuchin, home to an abandoned Soviet-era weather station \u2013 and made an unexpected discovery.\n\"We saw some movement on the island, took out our binoculars, and saw polar bears roaming around there, many of them, maybe 15 or 20,\" Kokh says. \"We were super surprised because we never expected to meet polar bears so far to the south. At this time of the year, they should be on the sea ice already, and on Wrangel Island, normally.\"\u00a0\nThe weather station on Kolyuchin had been abandoned in the early 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Stepping on the island to take pictures of the bears was too dangerous. Instead, Kokh used a drone, taking his time to get the bears used to it, then slowly flying it closer. As he was watching them, he noticed something else: there were bears inside some of the houses.\n\"I realised that it was a perfect setting for photography, because these houses are super photogenic, they are old and ruined, and animals looking out of these houses, is a perfect picture,\" he says. \"And the weather was terrible, [there was] wind and rain and fog, which is also very good for photography! So everything came together.\"\u00a0\nOne of the photos captures a bear in the entrance to the weather station, and another one looking out of the window. Titled\u00a0\"House of Bears\", it won Kokh the prestigious Wildlife Photographer of the Year award, given out annually by the Natural History Museum in London. \"It's the best picture I've ever taken, and I think I won't be able to repeat it, ever,\" he says.\nTom Smith, a\u00a0professor\u00a0of wildlife sciences at Brigham Young University in Utah, has spent decades conducting field work among bears, including polar bears, and says it's not unusual to see polar bears in abandoned buildings. \"They're curious animals so we see them in structures often, or they will be climbing on top of cars or pipelines,\" he explains. There has, however, been a more worrying trend across the Arctic, he says: as the sea ice melts, polar bears are increasingly approaching or wandering into inhabited towns or villages, to feed on open rubbish dumps. \"They are fatefully drawn towards human settlements,\" says Smith, and this can result in conflict with humans.\nThe problem is two-fold, according to Smith. One is that isolated, northern communities often use open rubbish pits near the village. Securing garbage so it can't be accessed, for example in bear-proof bins and enclosed landfills, is expensive, he points out \u2013 and in the past, was not necessary. \"The overwhelming Western influence in the north has resulted in [throwaway] economies that never existed there,\" he says. \"Those cultures never had a throwaway society, so the notion of having to secure garbage \u2013 that's a new thing.\"\nSecondly, Smith notes that polar bears are spending more time on land due to the climate-change-driven loss of sea ice. They are also shifting their dens from the ice onto the land, to avoid the risk of denning on the increasingly unstable sea ice, research in northern Alaska shows. Without the sea ice, the bears can't hunt for their preferred, ideal diet of blubber-rich seals, and may resort to land-based food, be it prey or rubbish.\n\"So we have a prediction that more and more bears are coming onto the land, they are increasingly hungry and drawn to these pits,\" Smith says. The rubbish pits tend to be close to the villages. \"Because of that, we can expect more and more conflict with bears,\" he warns.\nHe emphasises that polar bear attacks on humans are very rare. According to one study, across more than a century, from 1870 to 2014, there were only 73 attacks by wild polar bears on humans, distributed among the five countries with polar bears: Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia and the United States. Twenty of the attacks were deadly, and 63 caused injuries. (Because the attacks often involved more than one person, the total number of deaths and injuries is higher than the number of attacks.) Smith says that humans are not part of bears' natural diet \u2013 in contrast to big cats such as tigers and lions, who do see humans as potential food. \"That is a global myth, that [polar bears] are the only bear that stalks and kills humans,\" he says.\nNevertheless, there have been cases where polar bears have attacked people, with malnourished male bears most likely to pose a threat to humans. In some cases, starving polar bears who have become used to human-provided food\u00a0may then see humans as prey, research suggests. Smith says it's the increasing proximity to humans that's the problem, rather than the bears hunting humans as such: \"The [bears] are there for the garbage, and then they will spin off into the village and of course they're quite capable of ripping doors and windows off. So we've seen an uptick in these confrontations,\" he says.\u00a0\nA 2022 research paper warns that food from human sources \u2013 especially waste \u2013 is an emerging threat to polar bears. The supply of such human-provided food including from dumps is growing, according to the paper. As a consequence, some communities in the Arctic have seen startling incursions of dozens of polar bears. The study notes that when given the choice between sea ice, and rubbish dumps on land, polar bears still prefer the sea ice \u2013 suggesting that they are resorting to the dumps out of necessity.\u00a0\nFor example, in 2019, 60 polar bears gathered at a dump near the village of Ryrkaypiy in the Chukotka region of Russia, a few 100 metres from the village, according to the study. The bears also entered the village, causing alarm, and forcing the villagers to cancel public events and keep their children at home. However, once the sea ice formed and thickened, the polar bears left the land and returned to the sea.\u00a0\nIn Novaya Zemlya, a remote Russian archipelago, a similar invasion of 52 polar bears happened in 2019, according to the study. \"Although polar bears had visited the dump in previous years, this event was unprecedented,\" the researchers note, and was likely due to the loss of sea ice. In Arviat, an Inuit community in Nunavut, Canada, the number of polar bears using the local open dump has grown each year since record keeping began in the 1960s.\u00a0\nSpending more time on land could threaten the bears' long-term survival, Smith says, as the marine diet is more suited to them. In particular, the high fat content of their preferred prey, seals, is crucial for their health. Fat, in the form of seal blubber, makes up around 70% of polar bears' natural diet on the sea ice. It contains twice the energy per gramme as muscle. In fact, when catching a seal, the bears mostly eat the blubber and leave the meat behind. To capture seals, the bears need sea ice \u2013 they stalk the seals on the ice, or wait by breathing holes in the ice for seals to appear. Over the past 50 years, as the sea ice has shrunk, the number of polar bears has fallen, studies show.\u00a0\n\"They're using [the fat from the seal] for everything: growth, maintenance, reproduction, keeping their body warm,\" says Smith. \"They just need a seal and some water and they're fine. They're unusual animals,\" he adds. They can subsist on this high-fat, seal-based diet without suffering any nutritional deficits, he says: \"It's a metabolic marvel\".\nWhen they can't access seals and instead resort to less fatty prey on land, such as Arctic birds, bird eggs, or food from dumps, the bears' health and reproduction rates decline, and they risk starvation, studies suggest. Polar bears on land lose around one kilogramme of body mass a day, research shows.\u00a0\n\"Part of the problem we have with climate change is the scale of change is so rapid,\" says Smith. There's not enough time for the highly specialised polar bears, who evolved to thrive on a diet of marine mammals, to adapt to permanently being on land again, he warns: \"We're fearful this animal can't possibly adapt back to a land-based, herbivorous diet.\" If they had to be on land constantly, \"as a species, they would die\", he says.\u00a0\nSmith and other researchers are appealing to governments to provide funding to help secure rubbish dumps near coastal villages from bears. \"It's extremely expensive. They need help. It wouldn't be asking too much to secure the garbage and make it safer for people, and for bears,\" he says. Otherwise, people confronted with growing numbers of bears in their villages may kill them to stay safe, he warns: \"It is extremely unfortunate to see bears die from such a preventable cause [as unsecured garbage].\"\nIn the town of Churchill, Canada, closing an open dump, along with other measures, decreased damage and human injury. Smith and his colleagues are also studying a range of additional steps to help communities co-exist with polar bears, such as bear spray.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The huskies that revealed the rapid shrinking of Greenland's ice\n\u2022 Why polar bears are no longer the poster image of climate change\n\u2022 The deep ocean photographer that captured a 'living fossil'\nWhile the real-life human-bear conflict is playing out, humans around the world still love seeing polar bears in pictures, the reaction to Kokh's photos suggests. In a video call, he shows a wealth of artwork and even tattoos which people made as the photos went viral.\u00a0\n\"This was an absolutely crazy time, because I got so many emails and interview requests, and many people were talking to me about these images. And they were saying something like: 'this is a post-apocalyptic picture, this is how our planet will look like if we continue to do the same things with the planet and won't change our ways',\" he says.\nFor Kokh, the award-winning photos of the polar bears opened many doors, and he has been on other expeditions to take photos of many kinds of marine wildlife. But as he reflects on that storm-swept journey to Chukotka, he comes back to the relationship between people and polar bears. For a start, even in that incredibly remote, wild region, you come across human rubbish, he says: \"What you see in this area of Russian Arctic, it's abandoned barrels, fuel barrels. It's a commonly known problem because in the Soviet Union they brought thousands of fuel barrels and abandoned them, because it was expensive to bring them back. And they still lie there, and polar bears are roaming around them.\" In the photo series of the abandoned weather station, for example, there is a shot of the bears standing in a landscape of scattered barrels.\u00a0\nBut Kokh also points out that the images can be interpreted in different ways \u2013 as a warning about our impact on the planet, but also, as testimony to the power and resilience of nature.\u00a0\n\"When I was taking the picture, I was thinking about the striking contrast between the living animals, and these destroyed buildings,\" he says, and holds up a bottle, and a cup: \"You know, all the things we make \u2013 this bottle, this cup \u2013 all the things made by humans, will be destroyed one day and will cease to exist, if we don't continue to make them. If humanity will fail, nothing will remain of us. But life will still exist.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",
