        "article_text": "An American influencer has angered conservationists after she shared a video of herself taking a wild baby wombat away from its distressed mother.\nSam Jones, who describes herself as an \"outdoor enthusiast and hunter\" on Instagram, was filmed picking up a baby wombat by an unidentified road and running across it to a car, while its mother ran after them.\nThe man behind the camera can be heard laughing: \"Look at the mother, it's chasing after her!\" The video, which was filmd in Australia, has since been deleted.\nMs Jones's \"appalling\" behaviour could have caused severe harm to the wombats, conservationists say.\nThe Wombat Protection Society said it was shocked to see the \"mishandling of a wombat joey in an apparent snatch for 'social media likes'\".\n\"[She] then placed the vulnerable baby back onto a country road - potentially putting it at risk of becoming roadkill,\" it noted in its statement, adding that it remains unclear if the joey reunited with its mother. \n\"I caught a baby wombat,\" Ms Jones exclaimed in the video, while the joey, as it's known, could be heard hissing and struggling in her grip. \nHer caption in the now-deleted post read: \"My dream of holding a wombat has been realised! Baby and mom slowly waddled back off together into the bush.\"\nFollowing the backlash, Ms Jones, who has more than 92,000 followers on Instagram, made her account private. But several media outlets had already shared the video - as well as earlier posts, said to be taken in Australia, which show her holding an echidna and a \"little shark\". \nWombats, which are native to Australia, are a legally protected species across the country. Baby wombats share a strong bond with their mothers, and any separation can be distressing and harmful, conservationists say. \n\"Wombats are not a photo prop or plaything,\" said Suzanne Milthorpe, Head of Campaigns at World Animal Protection Australia, in a statement online. \n\"It's just unacceptable, and we're glad she's being called to account. Snatching a screaming baby wombat from their mother is not just appalling, it's very possibly illegal under state or national laws,\" Ms Milthrope said. \nSome experts believe Ms Jones's broke the law because Australia prohibits people from harming or taking native wildlife. \nIt is only allowed if the joey is in need of help because its mother has died, wildlife veterinarian Tania Bishop told ABC News.\nSome Australians are calling for Ms Jones to be deported. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke told Sky News Australia her visa is being reviewed. \n\"Given the level of scrutiny that will happen if she ever applies for a visa again, I'll be surprised if she even bothers,\" he said.\nAn online petition supporting her deportation has received 10,500 signatures so far.",

        "article_text": "Parents who are worried about their children being on Roblox should not let them use it, the chief executive of the gigantic gaming platform has said.\nThe site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.\nBut its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.\nWhen asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"\n\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.\nResponding to the interview, Mumsnet boss Justine Roberts said parents on the forum had spoken of how they struggled to manage their children's use of Roblox.\n\"There are parental controls, and our users would urge constant parental supervision,\" she told the BBC.\n\"But we all know that with the best will in the world life sometimes gets in the way. \n\"If you've got multiple children you're looking after and things happen, and you probably can't 24/7 watch everything they're doing, even if you've got all your parental controls set.\"\nEllie Gibson - from the Scummy Mummies podcast - said Mr Baszucki's message risked sounding \"a bit of a get out\".\n\"It's much easier said than done, especially when all their friends are playing it,\" she told the BBC.\nUS-based Roblox is one of the world's largest games platforms, with more monthly users than Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation combined. In 2024 it averaged more than 80 million players per day \u2013 roughly 40% of them below the age of 13. Its vast empire includes some 40 million user-generated games and experiences.\nIn the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.\nBut Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.\n\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.\n\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"\nPlayers who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.\nIn November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.\nHowever, the BBC was able to create two fake accounts, one aged 15 and one aged 27, on unlinked devices and exchange messages between the two.\nWhile the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.\nWhen we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.\n\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.\nHe admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.\nWe also put to him some Roblox game titles that the BBC has discovered were recommended by the platform to an 11 year-old recently, including:\nWhen we asked whether he thought they were appropriate, he said he puts his faith in the platform's age rating systems.\n\"One thing that's really important for the way we do things here, is it's not just on the title of the experience, it's literally on the content of the experience as well,\" he says.\nHe insists that when Roblox rates experience, they go through rigorous guidelines and that the company has a \"consistent policy\" on that.\nMr Baszucki founded the platform with Eric Cassel in 2004 and released it to the public in 2006 \u2013 a year before the first Apple iPhone appeared, heralding the start of the smartphone era.\nMr Baszucki describes his younger self as \"less of a gamer, and more of an engineer\", and the pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution. But they soon noticed that kids weren't only using the product to do their homework.\n\"They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox,\" he says.\nThe name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.\nMr Cassel noticed some players \"starting to act out\" and not always behaving in a \"civilised\" way a couple of months after it launched, recalls Mr Baszucki.\nHe says the roots of building a \"trust and safety system\" therefore began \"very, very early\" and that in those earlier days there were four people acting as safety moderators.\n\"It kind of is what launched this safety civility foundation,\" he adds.\nBut despite attracting decent numbers, it was a year later, when the firm launched its digital currency Robux, that it really started to make money.\nPlayers buy Robux and use it to purchase accessories and unlock content. Content creators now get 70% of the fee, and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.\nMr Baszucki says there was some initial resistance among the leadership team about Roblox becoming more than a hobby for its players, with the introduction of a digital economy.\nRobux stayed, and the firm is now worth $41bn (\u00a331bn).\nIts share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.\nMr Baszucki compares his experience of building Roblox with how Walt Disney may have felt about his creations.\nHe describes his job as \"a little like having the opportunity he had a long time ago when he was designing the Magic Kingdom\", and is focused on Roblox's ongoing evolution into a Metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form.\nThey have also been public in their ambitions to eventually attract 10% of the world's gamers.\nAsked to describe Roblox in three words, he replies: \"The future of communication.\"\nWe finish our time together playing a couple of his favourite games: Natural Disaster Survival and Dress to Impress.\nWe use his account and he's constantly recognised by other players \u2014 but we still get smashed to pieces by a blizzard outside the Natural Disasters mansion.\nAdditional reporting by Ammie Sekhon\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the biggest developments in global technology, with analysis from BBC correspondents around the world.

        "article_text": "Lewis Hamilton is starting his 19th season in Formula 1\nAustralian Grand Prix\nVenue: Albert Park, Melbourne Date: Sunday, 16 March Race start: 04:00 GMT\nCoverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live from 03:30. Live text updates on BBC Sport website and app\nThere was no fairytale for Lewis Hamilton on his first competitive outing for Ferrari, as Formula 1's most celebrated driver began his career with the sport's most iconic team.\nThe seven-time world champion qualified only eighth for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix - one place and 0.218 seconds slower than his team-mate Charles Leclerc, and a whopping 0.877secs behind Lando Norris' McLaren on pole position.\nAfterwards, Hamilton was repeating the mantra he has been using for some time - that it is going to take a little time before he is fully up to speed with his new car and team.\n\"For me, just improving every single lap, session on session,\" he said. \"Big learning curve this weekend.\n\"The car was so much different than I have ever experienced here and it's been a lot slower process to build confidence in the car.\n\"In the high-speed [corners], I have been down all weekend to Charles, who has had confidence from the get-go. He knew what the car does. I was just building up to that. I got a lot closer in the end and to be that close to Charles in my first qualifying session against a great qualifier...\"\nNorris takes Melbourne pole with Hamilton eighth\nAustralian Grand Prix Qualifying Review\nHe didn't complete the sentence, but the meaning was clear - Leclerc is blindingly fast; everyone knows that. So from Hamilton's point of view, in terms of his own relative performance, this was a perfectly decent start.\nThe same could not be said of Ferrari themselves. Hamilton is at Ferrari with one objective only - to win an eighth world title. Leclerc himself spoke on Thursday about winning a championship with Ferrari being his \"obsession\". Neither will achieve their aims with a car that qualifies on the fourth row of the grid.\nLeclerc was perplexed by what had happened. He had been quick all weekend, and fourth fastest in the first qualifying session, just over 0.1secs off Norris, who topped all three. But it became progressively worse as the hour developed.\n\"As soon as we started to push the car more and more,\" Leclerc said, \"we found more and more inconsistency, which was a bit of a shame.\n\"We lost the pace a little bit through qualifying. In Q1 we were good, in Q2 we were less good and in Q3 we had to push a lot to try and nail the lap time. We didn't really follow the track for some reason.\n\"This car has a lot of potential but for now we don't seem to be in the right window, so we have to find it.\"\nThis video can not be played\nBig surprises & how will Hamilton do?: BBC 5 Live team share 2025 predictions\nIt was a sobering start to a season that all in F1 had expected to start with Ferrari as McLaren's closest challenger. But not everyone felt it was necessarily a reflection of the team's true potential.\nMcLaren team principal Andrea Stella said: \"I am certainly surprised at the gap between McLaren and Ferrari. But I would say more, I just don't take that gap at face value.\n\"I'm sure the potential of the red car is higher than for some reasons was possible to exploit today. I think we have seen that until possibly qualifying in every single session, even in Bahrain [at pre-season testing].\n\"So we are very realistic that Ferrari is definitely one of the main contenders.\"\nLando Norris has spent his entire F1 career with McLaren since making his debut in 2019\nHamilton at Ferrari - his personal quest for success, and the internal battle with Leclerc - is one of the dominant narratives at the start of this season.\nAnother is whether Norris can deliver on his ambition to mount a season-long title challenge from the off, rather than having to play catch-up - which he had to try to do last year because McLaren did not start on Red Bull's level.\nIn the end in Melbourne, McLaren did deliver on their potential, but not without a few scary moments.\nFacing a tougher challenge from Red Bull and Max Verstappen than they - and the four-time champion himself - had expected, Norris and Oscar Piastri both made mistakes on their first laps in the final part of qualifying.\nThat put them under pressure on their last runs - lacking a competitive first lap always makes finding the right balance of risk and reward on that all-important final lap much more difficult, because the penalty of making a mistake is so much greater.\nFor home favourite Piastri, this was bad enough - he was fourth after his first run. Norris, though, was 10th, having had his lap deleted for exceeding track limits.\nBoth absolutely nailed it. Piastri, hoping to become the first Australian to win his home grand prix in F1, improved by a second, knocking Verstappen from the top, and Norris did even better, pipping his team-mate by 0.084secs.\nNorris said. \"It's a track where you've got to commit. You know what your target is, and once you turn in you're kind of hoping for the best in a lot of cases. You want to take those risks.\n\"Obviously, I took too many on my first lap and got track limits, so I was in a difficult position knowing how much risk I wanted to take. But I put it together well. It was just a clean lap, no mistakes, and that was enough. So happy. A perfect way to start the season.\"\nMcLaren ended last year with their first constructors' championship title for 26 years, and Stella has said they have taken some risks with \"innovative\" design in pushing for more performance from a car that was the fastest in the field for the second half of last year.\nAlthough all the teams arrived in Melbourne expecting them to be at the front, Norris on Thursday described the idea they might be a chunk ahead of the rest as \"short-sighted\".\nIn the end, at least on the quick, demanding street circuit of Albert Park, he was the one who had to recalibrate.\n\"It really was not necessarily our expectation to have a bit of a gap to the rest of the cars,\" Norris said, before pointing to the fact that the errors they made were due to the difficulty in nailing a lap in a car that has taken the team to new heights.\n\"The car is extremely quick. And when you put it together, it's unbelievable. It's just difficult to put it together. So really it was like a little fight between me and Oscar today, and it was a tough one.\"\nMax Verstappen retired with a brake failure after just four laps of last year's race in Melbourne\nVerstappen might have been pleasantly surprised to be best of the rest, but the 0.385secs margin between him and Norris, while perhaps expected, will have been less palatable.\nFor his team, though, there are concerns on more than one level. On top of the apparent gap to McLaren, there was the performance of their new recruit Liam Lawson.\nAfter paying off Sergio Perez to leave just seven months after being given a new two-year contract, the last thing Red Bull will have wanted to see was Lawson more than 0.6secs off Verstappen on the first day's practice.\nLawson was then hit with an engine problem that robbed him of the entire final session on Saturday. In that context, it was no surprise that he should struggle in qualifying.\nEven so, a first lap a second off Verstappen, and a mistake on his second - putting him on to the grass and down in 18th on the grid - was not a good start.\nLawson is two places behind 18-year-old Italian Andrea Kimi Antonelli, Hamilton's replacement at Mercedes. Antonelli, who will become the third youngest driver to start an F1 race on Sunday, had his qualifying compromised by damage to the floor of his car. The other Mercedes of George Russell will start alongside Verstappen in fourth.\nThere was an impressive performance from another rookie, Gabriel Bortoleto in the Sauber, a bad start to his first full season for Haas' British novice Oliver Bearman, and promise from Fernando Alonso in the Aston Martin that was not delivered when an off in the second session damaged his floor.\nHow to follow Australian Grand Prix on the BBC\nMany would want a straightforward first race of the season. But Albert Park has a habit of throwing up curveballs, and it seems the weather may oblige on Sunday, with rain predicted.\n\"It's a new car,\" Norris said. \"So there are a lot of unknowns and question marks about how it will perform. It's not always as simple as just putting on wets and having a crack.\n\"A bit of our pace potentially goes out of the window because it's harder to extract and show the difference of pace we had today. But we're in the best position to do that if we can. I know the chances of rain have been going down, but normally wet races and inter races are pretty exciting.\"\nWhat he did not mention is that the rain brings Verstappen - who would not expect to match the McLarens in a dry race - right into the picture.\nStella was less reticent.\n\"The only thing I can say about Max in the wet is that he is mega,\" he said. \"He can be a significant threat.\"\nHamilton, too, has made a reputation for being special when it rains. But his circumstances mean he will not be treating it with the usual smile.\n\"The wet has often been something I have enjoyed,\" Hamilton said. \"So it's a comfort zone for me but I am going out for the first time in the wet in an uncomfortable position because I have never driven this car.\n\"It is going to be a shock to the system when I first get out there, but I will be learning on the fly and giving it everything.\"\nBritish driver Nigel Mansell won his first race for Ferrari, at the 1989 Brazilian Grand Prix.

Baby and mom slowly waddled back off together into the bush.\"\n\"The baby was carefully held for one minute in total and then released back to mom,\"  she wrote in the comments, responding to criticism.\n\"They wandered back off into the bush together completely unharmed. I don't ever capture wildlife that will be harmed by my doing so.\" \nFollowing the backlash, Ms Jones, who has more than 92,000 followers on Instagram, made her account private. But several media outlets had already shared the video - as well as earlier posts, said to be taken in Australia, which show her holding an echidna and a \"little shark\". \nWombats, which are native to Australia, are a legally protected species across the country. Baby wombats share a strong bond with their mothers, and any separation can be distressing and harmful, conservationists say. \n\"Wombats are not a photo prop or plaything,\" said Suzanne Milthorpe, Head of Campaigns at World Animal Protection Australia, in a statement online. \n\"It's just unacceptable, and we're glad she's being called to account. Snatching a screaming baby wombat from their mother is not just appalling, it's very possibly illegal under state or national laws,\" Ms Milthrope said. \nSome experts believe Ms Jones broke the law because Australia prohibits people from harming or taking native wildlife. \nIt is only allowed if the joey is in need of help because its mother has died, wildlife veterinarian Tania Bishop told ABC News.\nAustralia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong also weighed in on the \"dreadful\" video. \n\"I think everyone who would have seen that would have thought, leave the baby wombat alone.

Its vast empire includes some 40 million user-generated games and experiences.\nIn the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.\nBut Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.\n\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.\n\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"\nPlayers who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.\nIn November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.\nHowever, the BBC was able to create two fake accounts, one aged 15 and one aged 27, on unlinked devices and exchange messages between the two.\nWhile the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.\nWhen we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.\n\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.\nHe admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.\nWe also put to him some Roblox game titles that the BBC has discovered were recommended by the platform to an 11 year-old recently, including:\nWhen we asked whether he thought they were appropriate, he said he puts his faith in the platform's age rating systems.\n\"One thing that's really important for the way we do things here, is it's not just on the title of the experience, it's literally on the content of the experience as well,\" he says.\nHe insists that when Roblox rates experience, they go through rigorous guidelines and that the company has a \"consistent policy\" on that.\nMr Baszucki founded the platform with Eric Cassel in 2004 and released it to the public in 2006 \u2013 a year before the first Apple iPhone appeared, heralding the start of the smartphone era.\nMr Baszucki describes his younger self as \"less of a gamer, and more of an engineer\", and the pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution. But they soon noticed that kids weren't only using the product to do their homework.\n\"They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox,\" he says.\nThe name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.\nMr Cassel noticed some players \"starting to act out\" and not always behaving in a \"civilised\" way a couple of months after it launched, recalls Mr Baszucki.\nHe says the roots of building a \"trust and safety system\" therefore began \"very, very early\" and that in those earlier days there were four people acting as safety moderators.\n\"It kind of is what launched this safety civility foundation,\" he adds.\nBut despite attracting decent numbers, it was a year later, when the firm launched its digital currency Robux, that it really started to make money.\nPlayers buy Robux and use it to purchase accessories and unlock content. Content creators now get 70% of the fee, and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.\nMr Baszucki says there was some initial resistance among the leadership team about Roblox becoming more than a hobby for its players, with the introduction of a digital economy.\nRobux stayed, and the firm is now worth $41bn (\u00a331bn).\nIts share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.\nMr Baszucki compares his experience of building Roblox with how Walt Disney may have felt about his creations.\nHe describes his job as \"a little like having the opportunity he had a long time ago when he was designing the Magic Kingdom\", and is focused on Roblox's ongoing evolution into a Metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form.\nThey have also been public in their ambitions to eventually attract 10% of the world's gamers.\nAsked to describe Roblox in three words, he replies: \"The future of communication.\"\nWe finish our time together playing a couple of his favourite games: Natural Disaster Survival and Dress to Impress.\nWe use his account and he's constantly recognised by other players \u2014 but we still get smashed to pieces by a blizzard outside the Natural Disasters mansion.\nAdditional reporting by Ammie Sekhon",

        "article_text": "England head coach Thomas Tuchel has named his first squad since succeeding Gareth Southgate\nEngland manager Thomas Tuchel has named his first squad since succeeding Gareth Southgate - and it is a selection that is already prompting wide debate.\nTuchel has recalled former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, who is 35 in June, while Marcus Rashford is rewarded with a return to the squad for his fine form on loan at Aston Villa from Manchester United.\nHe has also revealed first picks at either end of the age scale from Arsenal's 18-year-old Myles Lewis-Skelly to 32-year-old Newcastle United defender Dan Burn for the World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia at Wembley next Friday (21 March) and Monday (24 March) respectively.\nSo what can be unpicked from Tuchel's first indication of England's future direction?\nReaction, analysis & your views on Tuchel\u2019s first England squad\nPick your England XI for World Cup qualifiers - and fans have their say\nTuchel's appointment as England head coach has always carried the feel of an 18-month job focussed entirely on winning the World Cup and not beyond.\nWin then move on. Lose then move on.\nThe Football Association provoked debate, and some criticism, by ignoring the claims of English candidates such as Eddie Howe in their succession plan post-Southgate, to go for the best man available regardless of nationality.\nThe strategy was clear. The long-term can wait while a proven winner takes charge and Tuchel's first England squad merely confirms it.\nThere is a nod to the next generation with the inclusion of versatile defender Lewis-Skelly with England short at left-back and Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers, who is 22, but there was the definite whiff of short-term targets in Tuchel's selection.\nHowever, the recall of Henderson is the most eye-catching example of Tuchel wanting experience for the here and now.

The bustling forward was the oldest since 38-year-old Leslie Compton in 1950.\nIt is very much a case of going back to the past for the short-term future.

He would have been hoping to make a comeback after also missing out on Euro 2024, although he has not figured regularly under manager Pep Guardiola.\nTottenham midfielder James Maddison is another who is, for now at least, consigned to the margins,\nTuchel goes with that he knows by recalling Chelsea's Reece James as he makes his return from another hamstring injury. \nHe was a key member of Tuchel's side that won the Champions League in 2021 and there is a potential opening at right-back with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, Kyle Walker, 34, and on loan at AC Milan, and with Newcastle United's Tino Livramento talented but inexperienced.\nTuchel has made no secret of his desire to utilise the natural physical aspects of the English style into his squad and this is in evidence with this selection.\nBurn, ay 6 feet 7 inches, fits the bill, while Rogers combines raw power with natural skill and strong running. James also combines physical strength with great ability -and the squad has a very powerful look.\nTuchel was asked whether that lack of physicality cost England in previous tournaments.\nHe said: \"I don't think a lot is missing.

        "article_text": "In Japan, a smelly waste product is being reimagined as a potential clean fuel of the future that is powering cars and tractors.\nWe're being eyed suspiciously by dozens of cows. Their breath fogs cartoonishly from their nostrils.\nIt's a brisk morning in snowy Hokkaido, an island in the north of Japan. The cold air carries the distinct scent of cow manure \u2013 a smelly yet familiar side-effect of the region's thriving dairy industry. Accounting for 20% of the country's landmass, this island is the second-largest in Japan. It's also home to over a million cows, which produce over half of the country's milk and dairy products.\nWe are visiting one farm in Hokkaido that wants to transform the source of the pungent aroma in the air into something valuable. They are turning cattle manure into hydrogen.\u00a0\nWhen it is burned, hydrogen does not emit carbon, making it an attractive alternative to fossil fuels. There are widespread hopes it could be used as a sustainable fuel to heat homes and power cars, trains, aircraft and ships in the future.\nBut the most common way of producing hydrogen today involves using methane \u2013 a fossil fuel piped up from deep underground, meaning it is still associated with significant carbon emissions. Hydrogen can also be produced by splitting water using electricity, but this can be expensive and is only low carbon if renewable sources of electricity are used.\nThe Shikaoi Hydrogen Farm, however, is using a different source \u2013 a waste product that there is no shortage of on Hokkaido. Around 20 million tonnes of cow manure is generated in Hokkaido annually. If not treated correctly, it can be an environmental burden, producing significant methane emissions as well as affecting water quality if allowed to leak into streams and rivers. So can it instead be used as a source of sustainable energy?\n\"This project to produce hydrogen from livestock manure originated in Japan and is unique to this place,\" says Maiko Abe from Air Water, one of several companies involved in the hydrogen farm project. We are visiting the facility in Shikaoi, a town in central Hokkaido, to film an upcoming episode of the BBC's TechXplore focusing on Japan. \"Shikaoi accounts for 30% of Hokkaido\u2019s cow waste and urine, so it has great potential for renewable energy.\"\nLaunched in 2015 by Japan\u2019s Ministry of the Environment, the project aims to convert agricultural by-products into hydrogen to supply the local, rural community in a circular economy.\u00a0The cow excrement and urine is collected from local dairy farms before being fed into a anaerobic digester at a central facility. Here bacteria break down the organic waste to produce biogas and a liquid fertiliser. The biogas is then purified into methane that is used to manufacture hydrogen.\nThe plant now has a hydrogen production capacity of 70 cubic metres (18,500 gallons), with an onsite fuelling station that can fill around 28 vehicles fitted with hydrogen fuel cells per day, says Abe. Although the fuel can be used by cars with fuel cells, the plant's fuelling station has been specially designed to accommodate agricultural vehicles such as tractors and forklift trucks. These farm vehicles are difficult to electrify with batteries due to their size and the type of work they do. The hydrogen-powered vehicles are used around the farms' sites, reducing the emissions that would otherwise be created by using other fuel sources.\u00a0\nCattle-made-hydrogen is also stored in canisters that are transported to provide power and heat to other facilities in the area, including a local sturgeon fish farm and the nearby Obihiro Zoo.\nBut hydrogen isn't without its problems. It needs to be stored in high-pressure tanks as a gas, and can be prone to leakage due to its low molecular weight. It can also degrade metal storage containers, leaving them embrittled, and is easily ignited and so requires additional safety precautions when handling it.\nHydrogen can also be stored as a liquid by chilling it to cryogenic temperatures of below \u2013253C (-423F), but this can be energy intensive and requires large amounts of additional infrastructure.\nHydrogen has nearly three times the energy content of petrol (gasoline) when taken by mass alone. But its low molecular weight also means that by volume, the energy packed into a litre of liquid hydrogen is a quarter that of petrol. Put simply, as the lightest gas in the Universe, hydrogen takes up more space kilogram for kilogram than petrol. This means a lot more storage space is needed for hydrogen compared to fossil fuels like petrol, diesel and natural gas. It also means producing and storing it at scale can require large amounts of energy and infrastructure.\nBut as well as these hurdles, the hydrogen farm project in Hokkaido also faces other challenges specific to northern Japan's climate.\nHokkaido's subzero winters means new technologies are needed to produce the hydrogen stably without the small amounts of water vapour in the methane freezing.\nUsing agricultural waste as a methane source to produce hydrogen is relatively uncommon, but it ultimately uses\u00a0the same process as is used to produce hydrogen from natural gas: steam reforming. Here, steam heated to 800C (1,472F) reacts with the methane to produce hydrogen, along with the byproducts carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide (CO2).\u00a0\nIn the case of cow manure, however, says Abe, the project remains sustainable as this carbon originated in the grass the cows grazed on: \"Since it was originally in the atmosphere, it is considered carbon neutral.\"\nIn addition, it helps to prevent the methane that would otherwise have been emitted from the manure from getting into the atmosphere, where it is a potent greenhouse gas.\nLeftover slurry from the manure after the biogas has been extracted is sprayed as fertiliser onto nearby fields, while formic acid \u2013 which is both used in and created by the processes \u2013 could be offered as a preservative for cattle feed, says Abe.\u00a0\nCurrently, the electricity needed to produce and store the hydrogen comes from the national grid. But Abe says there's potential to shift to green energy, given Hokkaido\u2019s promising sea, wind and geothermal potential, thus reducing the carbon emissions of this electricity.\nStill, other challenges remain. The high cost of the hydrogen compared to fossil fuels and low demand mean expanding the operation is difficult.\u00a0\n\"The construction costs of hydrogen stations are very high,\" says Abe. \"Since hydrogen vehicles are not yet widespread, we're keeping our filling capacity low to manage initial investment. As adoption increases, we'll expand supply.\"\nTo encourage hydrogen vehicle adoption in the area, hydrogen prices are subsidised by the plant, matching the cost of petrol. Hydrogen refuelling stations are also being developed in major Hokkaido cities like Sapporo and Muroran.\nHype Meter\nThe process to make clean hydrogen fuel from cow manure in Shikaoi Hydrogen Farm is worth paying attention to, especially as it also reduces methane which would otherwise be released from the manure. With other countries exploring how to use other types of waste, from pig dung to coconut husks, to produce hydrogen using similar processes, it appears this could be a model adaptable to other local contexts.\nWith the scale still small, however, and costs of production high, it remains to be seen how widespread this industry can be. There are also other ways of producing fuel from cow waste, such as simply using the biogas produced from manure as a fuel itself without needing to convert it to hydrogen.\u00a0\nJapan is the world leader in hydrogen vehicles and has invested considerably in developing the technology. But for now battery-powered electric vehicles remain cheaper than hydrogen powered ones.\nThough it's unlikely that cow manure alone will ever meet Japan's hydrogen demand, it could contribute significantly, and Shikaoi is creating a model for a circular economy that it hopes will show how costs can fall with the economies of scale.\u00a0\nAnd there is growing interest in other parts of the world in using waste materials to produce hydrogen, with pig dung, poultry waste and even coconut husks having been explored as potential feedstocks. In Thailand, vehicle manufacturer Toyota is even exploring the use of hydrogen made from chicken waste to fuel its vehicles.\nMeanwhile, engineers at the University of Illinois Chicago in the US recently developed another promising method to make hydrogen involving manure. In their case, they used the manure, along with sugarcane waste and corn husks, to make biochar, a carbon-rich substance which vastly reduces the amount of electricity needed to convert water to hydrogen.\n\"We are the first group to show that you can produce hydrogen utilising biomass at a fraction of a volt,\" says Meenesh Singh, a chemical engineer at the University of Illinois Chicago who led the project.\nIn the southern Japanese city of Fukuoka, on Kyushu, meanwhile, another waste product is being used to produce hydrogen \u2013 and here the dung is from humans.\nFor more than a decade, hydrogen has been created at the city's sewage treatment plant for use in hydrogen-powered vehicles. Most recently it has been used to fuel a fleet of zero-emission rubbish trucks.\nAkira Miyaoka, hydrogen utilisation manager for Fukuoka City, says trucks that transport daily products are the town's main source of CO2, rather than large factories as in many other cities. \"So we are working to reduce CO2 emissions from commercial trucks,\" she says.\nThe initiative started as a collaboration between Kyushu University and Fukuoka City, but now involves several major companies including Toyota.\n\"Sewage is something that is steadily discharged every day in the daily lives of citizens, so by making effective use of that sewage and extracting hydrogen as energy, we can achieve local production and local consumption of energy,\" says Miyaoka.\u00a0\nGenerating hydrogen from human waste starts with water from various household sources \u2013 including showers, dishwashers and toilets \u2013 arriving at the treatment plant. As the water is cleaned, the residual sludge is kept as a source of biogas and converted into hydrogen.\u00a0\n\"Sewage and biogas contain various impurities, so the process begins with the process of removing those impurities, which I think is a little different from other hydrogen production processes,\" says Miyaoka.\nIn 2024, Toyota helped the city launch Japan\u2019s first hydrogen-powered service vehicle fleet, including ambulances, delivery vans and bin trucks. Officials at the sewage treatment plant say it is capable of producing 300kg (661lbs) of hydrogen in 12 hours \u2013 enough to fuel 30 trucks.\u00a0\nThe rubbish trucks head out six nights each week, each collecting 1.7 tonnes (3,700lb) of rubbish, all while running silently and emission-free on the bodily waste of the people they are collecting other waste from.\nFukuoka's sewage-to-hydrogen fuelling station has been around since 2015, and several other countries around the world are now adopting a similar approach.\nConcord Blue has developed waste-to-energy plants in Germany, India, Japan and the US, converting waste and biomass into hydrogen and bioenergy. Several water authorities in the UK are also working on projects to derive hydrogen from sewage.\nA prototype race car has also been developed using sewage-derived hydrogen in the UK. The Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), in partnership with Severn Trent Water, is harnessing microbes that generate hydrogen fuel from waste. They anticipate the technology could hit the mainstream within five years, despite existing challenges. (Read about how sewage-powered cars could be the future of motorsport.)\nOn a larger scale, aviation accounts for 2% of global carbon emissions, and researchers in a UK lab have developed jet fuel made entirely from human sewage.\nStill, despite the promise, all of these technologies have yet to be delivered at significant scale.\nWhether in rural or city landscapes, the Japanese projects we've seen during in filming are inspiring because they have the local community at their heart.\nWhile adoption of hydrogen cars has stalled, hydrogen truck adoption is increasing gradually and it is these larger heavier industrial vehicles that contribute most significantly per vehicle to greenhouse gas emissions.\nBy reimagining waste as a resource, these projects demonstrate that energy can be found in even the most unlikely of places.\n* Paul Carter is the presenter of TechXplore.

        "article_text": "When Kajol contracted tuberculosis in January, USAID kept her alive. Now she and her family are in danger again after the Trump administration ordered most US aid spending to end.\nTB can be fatal if left untreated. The highly contagious bacterial disease, which usually infects the lungs, is not prevalent in rich countries, because treatment is relatively cheap. But in Bangladesh, it is a scourge.\nThat's especially so in neighbourhoods such as Mohammadpur, a slum in the capital Dhaka where Kajol,17, lives. \n\"We are poor people,\" she says. She is the sole breadwinner for herself, her mother and little brother. Her job in a garment factory keeps them all afloat.\nSo when she fell ill in January, it could have been catastrophic.\nInstead, help arrived through Dipa Halder. For the last three years, she has been canvassing the residents of Mohammadpur about TB and getting people the treatment they so desperately need, free of cost.\nThe initiative, which gets people tested and get them treatment they need including proper nutrition, is run by a local aid organisation, Nari Maitree. It was funded by the US Agency for International Aid (USAID) until February, when it received a letter from the US government saying the funds had been terminated.\nThat brought Kajol's treatment, only partially completed, to an abrupt end.\nCutting off medicines mid-treatment makes the chances of TB becoming drug-resistant much greater. It makes the disease much more difficult to combat and puts patients at greater risk of severe illness and death. \nThe government provides free medication but getting diagnosed and collecting the medicines can be cost prohibitive for many.\n\"Now I have to go get the medicine myself,\" she says. \"I am struggling a lot.\"\n\"The people here are quite vulnerable,\" says Dipa, 21. \"I can tell them to go to a particular doctor, which would help them save some money. \n\"Or I try to provide them with some financial assistance from our organisation so that they can continue their treatment.\"\nAccording to a US government performance report seen by the BBC, support by USAID in 2023 resulted directly in the identification and reporting of more than a quarter of a million new cases of TB in Bangladesh. In the same year, there were 296,487 new or relapse cases of TB which were cured or successfully completed as a result of USAID.\nThe agency was seen as integral to the country's fight against tuberculosis.\n\"You ask people on the street, they will say yeah, it's the US, they are the ones that are keeping it [tuberculosis] in control,\" said a director of a USAID project in Bangladesh, who is not authorised to speak publicly and did not want to be named.\n\"Bangladesh was USAID's largest programme in Asia,\" says Asif Saleh, executive director of the non-profit BRAC organisation. \"In terms of its impact, particularly in the healthcare sector, it has been massive.\n\"Particularly around vaccination, reducing child mortality and maternal mortality, USAID has played a massive role in this country.\"\nIn 2024, Bangladesh received $500m in foreign assistance. This year, that amount has cratered to $71m. To put that number into context, in the three-year period from 2021-2023, USAID committed an average of $83m annually in Bangladesh for health initiatives alone, including combating TB.\nCuts to USAID have meant Nari Maitree can no longer offer its Stop TB Program, but it also means Dipa is out of work. She supports her elderly parents and her younger sister.\n\"I am completely shattered now that I lost my job. I am carrying the burden of the family. Being unemployed is a devastating situation,\" she told the BBC.\nIn a document seen by the BBC, 113 programmes that were funded directly by the USAID office in Bangladesh have stopped. The list does not include the myriad programmes that are funded directly by US agencies in Washington.\n\"The NGO sector [In Bangladesh] employs 500,000 people at least,\" says Mr Saleh. \"It's huge. Thousands and thousands of jobs are going to be eliminated.\"\nIt's not just the United States that is moving away from foreign aid. The UK has announced cuts to its foreign assistance programmes, as has Switzerland. It is likely that other countries may follow suit.\nIt's a sobering reality for Bangladesh. The country's government was overthrown last year and the economy is shaky, with inflation near 10% and a jobs crisis, particularly among young people.\nInterim leader Muhammad Yunus says Bangladesh will come up with a new strategy on how to survive following the aid cuts \u2013 but doesn't say how.\nWhen pressed in a BBC interview on how the country will cover the shortfall from USAID, Yunus said: \"It was a small part, not a big deal. It doesn't mean Bangladesh will disappear from the map.\"\nAsif Saleh says the way the cuts have been implemented has been abrupt and chaotic. The impact on a country like Bangladesh is immeasurable.\nNowhere is that more clear than in Cox's Bazar, a coastal city in south-eastern Bangladesh, home to the world's largest refugee camp. More than one million Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority community that the United Nations calls victims of ethnic cleansing, fled violent purges in their home country, neighbouring Myanmar.\nUnable to go back home and unable to work outside the refugee camp, the Rohingya depend on international aid for their survival.\nThe United States contributed almost half of all aid to Rohingya refugees.\n\"We have run out of soap,\" says Rana Flowers, country representative for the UN children's agency Unicef. \"We are now having to truck water into the camps. It's an absolutely critical time. There is an outbreak of cholera with over 580 cases, along with a scabies outbreak.\"\nWater sanitation projects in the camps used to be funded by USAID.\nSince the order to stop work went into effect at the end of January, hospitals such as the International Red Cross hospital in Cox's Bazar are reduced to providing emergency assistance only. Any hope the money would be reinstated was crushed this week, when the Trump administration cancelled more than 80% of all the programmes at USAID.\n\nPatients like Hamida Begum, who was getting regular treatment for hypertension, are left with few options.\n\"I'm old and I don't have anyone to help me,\" she says. Her husband died last year, leaving her to care for her four children alone, including her 12-year-old daughter who cannot walk.\n\"I cannot go to another hospital far from home because of my daughter.\"\nAt a nearby UN food distribution centre, Rehana Begum is standing beside two large sacks.\nInside, she says, are six litres of cooking oil and 13kg of rice, along with basics such as onions, garlic and dried chillies. These rations, given to her by the World Food Programme (WFP), need to last her and her family a month.\nI ask how she will manage now that her rations will be cut in half beginning next month.\nShe looked shocked. Then she started to cry.\n\"How can we possibly survive with such a small amount?\" asks Rehana, 47, who shares one room with her husband and five children. \"Even now, it is difficult to manage.\"\nThe WFP says it was forced to make the drastic cut because of \"a critical funding shortfall for its emergency response operations\".\nThe rations now being allotted to the Rohingya community will only meet their basic daily dietary needs, igniting fears they will be left with just enough to live and not much more.\n\"This is an absolute disaster in the making,\" says Rana Flowers of Unicef. \"Desperate frustrated people within the camps will lead to security concerns. If that escalates to the degree it could, we won't be able to go into the camps to help.\"",

The agency said that it would investigate the cause of the incident.\nThere were no reports of serious injuries, although the airport later confirmed 12 people were taken to hospital for minor injuries.  \nThe flight took off from nearby Colorado Springs and was on the way to Dallas Fort Worth International Airport in Texas, the FAA said in a statement to the BBC. \nThe plane diverted to Denver around 17:15 local time (23:15 GMT) after the crew reported \"engine vibrations\", the FAA said. \nAfter the plane landed, it caught fire while taxiing on the tarmac at the airport. \nAmerican Airlines said the plane had 172 passengers on board, along with six crew members. All were evacuated safely, the company said. \nIt added that the plane was a Boeing 737-800 and experienced an \"engine-related issue\". \nSmoke and flames were visible from various gates at the airport, according to airport spokesman Michael Konopasek. He said the fire was doused and it did not lead to delays for other flights. \nSome of those inside the airport posted videos on social media showing the plane's passengers walking toward the edge of the wing as large clouds of black smoke filled the air. \nGround crew can be seen rushing to the wing while pushing ladders. \nVideo show flames under the plane's right engine as an inflatable evacuation slide appear at the aircraft's rear door. \nThe evacuation comes after a recent string of high-profile incidents in North America that have raised concerns about aviation safety. \nA fatal crash in Washington DC left 67 people dead when an American Airlines regional jet collided mid-air with a US Army Black Hawk helicopter. The crash in the US capital city led to questions about air traffic controller shortages and their workloads. \nUS President Donald Trump's administration has also terminated hundreds of FAA probationary workers as part of government cost-saving efforts. \nThe layoffs happened weeks after the fatal DC crash. \nThe laid-off FAA employees included maintenance mechanics, environmental compliance workers and technical assistants. \nTrump has pushed to reduce government spending with tech billionaire Elon Musk spearheading efforts as part of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).\nAdditional reporting by Kayla Epstein",

But manage sleep well, and they can maximise their ability.\nFor World Sleep Day - 14 March - BBC Sport spoke to a sleep expert and international athlete to find out how elite sportspeople manage their sleep, and how you can improve yours.\nAccording to the NHS, adults require between seven and nine hours of sleep per night.\nGiven the changeable schedules athletes in elite sports are subject to, sticking to a strict sleep routine can be very difficult.\nThat means maintaining as much consistency as possible, even when on the road, can have a huge benefit.\nRemi Mobed, a physiotherapist with an expertise in sleep who has worked with the England men's national teams in football and rugby, supports the Ineos Grenadiers cycling team.\nHe says their approach is the \"gold standard\" for managing sleep in elite-level sport.\n\"In a group stage of a Tour de France, the cyclists are going to be in approximately 20 different hotels over the course of 22 days,\" he says.\n\"Each of those cyclists has their own dehumidifier, their own mattress, their own duvet and their own pillow that come as a travel pack. The team travels with that and the soigneur goes ahead and prepares the athlete's room for them prior to arrival, every day for 22 days.\n\"The reality for other team sports is to do the basics as well as you can, like getting the athletes to travel with an eye mask and their own pillow from home.\"\nIneos Grenadiers' Carlos Rodriguez, who benefits from Mobed's insight, finished seventh in the 2024 Tour de France\nDoubles tennis player Neal Skupski - a three-time Wimbledon champion - travels all over the world on the ATP Tour. For him, the constant change of location is part of the challenge.\n\"You're sleeping in a different bed each week - some mattresses hard, some soft,\" the 35-year-old says. \n\u201cFor a lot of the guys [the problem] is the pillows - they can mess you up. You can wake up with a bad neck and then you can't turn, and that hurts you especially on the serve.\n\"In the Olympic village in Paris last summer, one of the manufacturers allowed people to go to them and change the mattress hardness or softness. There was a line way out the door of athletes going in, testing the bed, trying to get a softer or harder one that suited them. The queue was so long I couldn't believe my eyes!\"\nCompeting worldwide requires athletes to traverse time zones and adjust their sleep schedules accordingly. So far in 2025, Skupski has played in Australia, Japan, Qatar, the UAE, and the US.\n\"People see players at tournaments on TV and sometimes think that they should be playing better, but it is probably down to the fact that their body is just knackered,\" the Liverpudlian says.\n\"I stay up as long as possible on a plane. Then if I get to Australia 12 o'clock in the afternoon, I would definitely stay up all day until around 10pm, just trying getting on the new time zone straight away.\n\"For the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, Andy Murray was trying to get on time zone back in the UK a week in advance. So he was getting up around 2am and then starting his day, which I found crazy. But then he had a much better sleep when he got to Tokyo than me, so maybe I should have listened to him.\u201d\nMobed adds: \"As a general rule, if you're jumping three time zones, your body is able to cope with it. On top of that, it takes an athlete one day per hour that they've travelled to adjust.\n\"So if the difference is seven hours, the first three are fine to adjust to, and then it would be four days for the final four hours to be fully adjusted. Going across to Australia or New Zealand, 12 or 13 hours ahead, then that is a much bigger task.\"\nSkupski has represented Great Britain in the Davis Cup around the world since 2019\nIn team sports, athletes often share hotel rooms with a team-mate while travelling to away matches or international competitions.\n\"Coaches overlook sleep as a major factor,\" Mobed says. \"They often partner the strikers together, for instance, or the fly-halves, because the coaches want them to be discussing tactics. It is a mentorship system, thinking, 'this young kid can learn from Harry Kane through small conversations in the hotel room'.\n\"But the hotel room is not somewhere that should be done. That should be a place that is sacrosanct for the athletes to be in a relaxed state.\n\"You need to figure out who are the night owls and who are the morning larks. It is no good putting people in at the opposite end of the scale.\"\nAccording to NHS data, more than a million people in the UK were prescribed medication to help with sleep in 2023. Addiction to sleeping pills can lead to withdrawal symptoms including anxiety, panic attacks, sweating, headaches and shaking.\nBrentford captain Christian Norgaard revealed he feared becoming addicted to sleeping pills during his time with Brondby in his native Denmark, saying a sleep coach helped him avoid developing a serious problem.\n\"Sleeping pills are a really taboo subject in sport,\" Mobed says. \"There are many athletes, unfortunately, that are addicted to these sleep-enhancing meds.\n\"I think there is a time and a place for them, but the basics of sleep hygiene must be addressed first. Athletes often won't prioritise sleep, because they know that they can go to the doctor and get a sleeping pill.\n\"They can stay in your system for quite a prolonged period after you wake up. So let's say it gets to 1am and you're not sleeping so you take some of these meds - they are definitely still in your system the next morning.\"\nMelatonin is a hormone which can also be taken as a supplement to help sleep, but despite some of his doubles partners using it in the past, Skupski prefers to manage his sleep naturally\nNot everybody needs to be as precise about their sleep hygiene as an elite athlete, but getting good-quality sleep is important for the health and wellbeing of everyone.\n\"Naps should be no more than 40 minutes long, ideally 20,\" Mobed offers as a key tip. \"Some people will nap for one hour, two hours, three hours during the day, and that will have a massive detrimental effect.\n\"You've got this napping vicious cycle - sleeping too much in the day can actually completely put out your rhythm, and then at night you're not going to sleep well.

But the highpoint of their careers was the prefabricated timber cabins they designed in the 1970s and 1980s for holiday parks in Wales and Forestry Commission sites in Scotland, and the English counties of Cornwall and Yorkshire.\nFor Brooks, the cabins were an opportunity to distil his design ethos into its clearest, purest, most compact form, says Peter Halliday, co-author with Bethan Dalton of Cabin Crew: Hird & Brooks and the Pursuit of the Perfect Holiday House. \"He could do away with the tiresome necessities of domesticity that have to be accommodated in a conventional house, and focus on what really matters.\"\nProfessor Richard Weston, an architect and former Chair of Architecture at Cardiff University, echoes this. \"[Brooks] always said the holiday cabins were the highlight of his career,\" he writes in the book. \"They are a distillation of everything Graham stood for \u2013 the love of wood, the appreciation of proper architecture, the orientation of the Sun, and the feel for detailing and space \u2013 all stripped down for essential living.\"\nHird & Brooks were part of a worldwide boom in simple holiday homes. Many Danes and Swedes already spent their leisure time in cabins, or sommerhuse, along the coast or in forests. In 1960, Denmark had around 50,000 summerhouses. By 1975, the number had trebled, according to Cabin Crew.\nMeanwhile, the summer cottage (a close relation of the dacha) was becoming a staple of Soviet society in the Baltic states and much of Central Europe. Everyone, it seems, was at it, even the big-name architects. Le Corbusier, the grand master of modernism, created his Cabanon de Vacances in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin in the south of France in the early 1950s. And in the US, architect Paul Rudolph was behind a series of simple wooden structures on the Florida Keys.\nThe mushrooming of cabins in the UK was in part a result of increased car ownership from the 1930s, as well as the Holidays with Pay Act of 1938, explains Cabin Crew. The latter led to the construction of mass-scale seaside holiday camps equipped with prefab accommodation.\nHird & Brooks' cabins \u2013 some to be bought, others to be rented \u2013 drew on the duo's many study trips to Denmark, because Brooks was Denmark mad. \"His heroes were Danish architects, his reference points were the Danish architectural press, and his new wife helped him to embed a Danish design aesthetic into their everyday lives,\" the book explains.\n\"It was all about simple, intelligent design, woodland settings, and a close affinity with nature,\" Halliday tells the BBC. \"The entire Hird & Brooks team became fascinated, and were eager to apply the same principles here in the UK.\"\nThe firm completed their first holiday homes, for Bierwood near Tenby in Pembrokeshire, in the early 1970s. Timber-framed with exposed roof beams, these lodges were clad in pine match-boarding and had corrugated tiled roofs and Sun terraces. Inside, features included built-in beds and a galley kitchen. The colour pallet \u2013 a blue-grey stain on the exterior timber facings, and orange-red window frames and doors \u2013 was inspired by those Danish study trips.\n\"The clearest Scandinavian influence is the use of wood \u2013 from the big exposed structural beams to the cedar cladding to the built-in furniture to the little details like the wooden door handles and fitted coat hooks,\" says Halliday. He also cites the space-saving wetrooms, \"which were a complete novelty in the UK, and the wood-burning stoves, which were commonplace in Scandinavia but not available here, so the architects designed their own, and had them manufactured locally\". And for all the Welsh cabins, Brooks looked at the orientation of the Sun before positioning each cabin on its plot, so as to ensure that users could enjoy as much sunshine as possible \u2013 even if sunshine wasn't always abundant in Wales.\nLater, the Forestry Commission \u2013 a national organisation owning huge swathes of British countryside \u2013 brought in Hird & Brooks to design holiday cabins for its sites at Deerpark in Cornwall, Keldy Castle in North Yorkshire, and Taynuilt in Scotland. \"For the Forestry Commission cabins, it was all about imparting a sense of adventure,\" says Halliday. \"That was the intended function, and everything about the design reflects it.\"\nSome were A-frame designs, some were flat-roofed, and others had standard-pitch roofs. There was also some playfulness. Inside, the second bedrooms had a staggered stack of three bunks. \"High-level sleeping and play platforms offered views into the forest, and large slatted terraces with integrated benches blurred the distinctions between indoors and outdoors \u2013 all of which added to the sense of adventure the Forestry Commission was so keen to impart,\" write Cabin Crew's authors. Soft furnishings stayed with the distinctive red and orange colourways that the firm had introduced in earlier cabins.\nBy the end of the 1970s, there were at least 35 UK companies manufacturing or promoting kit-built chalets, and more than 350 holiday parks offering them. Meanwhile, on the continent, the Dutch modernist architect Jacob Berend Bakema produced designs for the holiday village chain Center Parcs.\nAt this time, the British cabin movement was in part a reaction against the \"white heat of technology\", a term used by Prime Minister Harold Wilson in the 1960s to promote science. Bruce Peter, Professor of design history at Glasgow School of Art, expands on this in the book's introduction. \"A growing environmental consciousness emerged, at least among the more politically progressive and culturally engaged. This manifested itself in growing interests in wholefoods, alternative medicine and natural living.\"\nAnd for Peter, with the benefit of half-a-century's hindsight, Hird & Brooks' holiday cabins \"appear very successfully to have withstood the test of time. Back in the 1970s, environmentalism was mostly considered to be a fringe concern, but, in recent decades, it has moved into the mainstream. The cabins' construction \u2013 using mostly natural materials in an era when synthetics were all the rage \u2013 now appears to have been highly prescient. And, with reasonable maintenance, their timber external finishes have tended to weather well.\" What's more, he writes, the type of outdoor-centred holiday-making for which the cabins were intended has also proven enduringly popular, at least among particular demographics.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0How ultra-traditional tweed found a new fanbase\n\u2022\u00a0How Scandinavian dressing can make us happier\n\u2022\u00a0How to transform your home with art\nA few factors coming together means that there is now a renewed interest in the cabins, Dalton tells the BBC. First, she cites the popularity of mid-century architecture and interior design, \"especially among those of us who grew up in the 1970s and 1980s. It evokes a nostalgic charm, reminding us of the spaces and styles we fondly remember from childhood.\"\nThen there's the \"tiny house\" movement, with cabin life appealing to people seeking a simpler, more minimal way of life, off-grid and immersed in nature. \"A cabin holiday offers a taste of that lifestyle without the full-time commitment,\" says Dalton. \"And, of course, in this digital age, people are always looking for an Instagrammable holiday image, and these cabins certainly have that covered with their striking red-painted windows and doors.\"\nSo perhaps it's no surprise that some of Brooks' cabins have endured. And several of them are still in the hands of the original families. \"For the most part, the cabins look to be in near-pristine condition,\" the authors write. \"Clearly, the owners like things the way they are.\"\nCabin Crew: Hird & Brooks and the Pursuit of the Perfect Holiday House by Peter Halliday and Bethan Dalton is published by The Modernist.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Lose then move on.\nThe Football Association provoked debate, and some criticism, by ignoring the claims of English candidates such as Eddie Howe in their succession plan post-Southgate, to go for the best man available regardless of nationality.\nThe strategy was clear. The long-term can wait while a proven winner takes charge and Tuchel's first England squad merely confirms it.\nThere is a nod to the next generation with the inclusion of versatile defender Lewis-Skelly with England short at left-back and Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers, who is 22, but there was the definite whiff of short-term targets in Tuchel's selection.\nHowever, the recall of Henderson is the most eye-catching example of Tuchel wanting experience for the here and now. He last played for England in November 2023 and missed out on selection for last summer's Euro 2024.\nTuchel described Henderson as a \"serial winner\" and this is what the coach has in mind as he plots a path to next year's World Cup.\nJordan Henderson's England career looked over when he was left out of Gareth Southgate's Euro 2024 squad\nAnd then there is the shock selection of Burn. \nA wonderful story, as Newcastle United manager Howe agreed, but a very late stage for any player to prove they are international class.\nBurn would be the oldest player to win his first England cap since Bolton Wanderers striker Kevin Davies made his debut against Montenegro on 12 October 2010 at 33 years and 200 days. The bustling forward was the oldest since 38-year-old Leslie Compton in 1950.\nIt is very much a case of going back to the past for the short-term future. Former interim boss Lee Carsley's last squad contained a total 627 caps, while this one has a tally of 664.\nTuchel is missing younger players who have been injured recently, such as Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, but is clear the German's reign is not going to be a slow burner.\nThe selection of Henderson and the return of Rashford demonstrates that Tuchel is prepared to start with a clean slate.\nHenderson's call-up came out of the blue after it looked like his England career was over when he, like Rashford, was left out of Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2024.\nThe former Liverpool captain had an ill-fated stint in Saudi Arabia before returning to Europe with Ajax, where Tuchel has clearly seen enough to recall him.\nTuchel appears to want Henderson as much for his influence off the pitch, saying: \"What he brings every time is leadership, character, personality and energy. He makes sure everyone lives by the standards and with character. He embodies everything we are trying to build.\"\nEngland's head coach has long been a fan of Rashford and wants to be the beneficiary of Aston Villa manager Unai Emery's repair job on the forward's career.\nHe said: \"I had a strong feeling we should nominate him, to push him to stay at the level he is at now not fall back into old routines.\"\nTuchel's words offer an indication that he realises Rashford had fallen by the wayside at Old Trafford but is also convinced the 27-year-old can offer much to his new England.\nHe clearly does not feel the same about Manchester City's Jack Grealish. He would have been hoping to make a comeback after also missing out on Euro 2024, although he has not figured regularly under manager Pep Guardiola.\nTottenham midfielder James Maddison is another who is, for now at least, consigned to the margins,\nTuchel goes with what he knows by recalling Chelsea's Reece James as he makes his return from another hamstring injury. \nHe was a key member of Tuchel's side that won the Champions League in 2021 and there is a potential opening at right-back with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, Kyle Walker, 34, and on loan at AC Milan, and with Newcastle United's Tino Livramento talented but inexperienced.\nThis video can not be played\n'When Rashford plays, he's one of the best'\nWatch The Football News Show on Tuchel's first England squad\nHenderson embodies everything we try to build - Tuchel\nTuchel has made no secret of his desire to utilise the natural physical aspects of the English style into his squad and this is in evidence with this selection.\nBurn, at 6 feet 7 inches, fits the bill, while Rogers combines raw power with natural skill and strong running. James also combines physical strength with great ability -and the squad has a very powerful look.\nTuchel was asked whether that lack of physicality cost England in previous tournaments.\nHe said: \"I don't think a lot is missing. Obviously a little bit is because we lost consecutive Euros finals and World Cup semi-final and quarter-finals. \n\"The feeling is a little step is needed to bring it over the line.\"\nTuchel's squad is sure to cause debate, especially in Nottingham, where Forest fans will feel Morgan Gibbs-White could have offered an \"X Factor\" after his outstanding performances in their tilt to reach the Champions League.\nThey will also offer up Callum Hudson-Odoi as an example of someone who deserves a return to the England squad after his rejuvenation, exemplified by his winning goal against Manchester City that puts Forest in such a wonderful position to reach the top four.\nEverton defender Jarrad Branthwaite, who won a full cap under Southgate, also misses out despite being in outstanding form since manager David Moyes returned to Goodison Park. He is included in Carsley's England Under-21 side.\nTottenham defender Djed Spence will have had his backers, while there is no place for Conor Gallagher despite his fine form at Atletico Madrid.\nTuchel resisted the temptation to include Arsenal 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri, who also goes into Carsley's squad.\nThis video can not be played\nHow Grealish needs 'confidence and love'\nThomas Tuchel gave a hugely impressive performance in front of the media after announcing his first squad.\nFrom suggestion he is intent on \"building a brotherhood\" in his England squad to talking about \"a parental vibe\" when handling Arsenal teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly, Tuchel was confident and comfortable in his new skin as England head coach.\nNo subject was off limits, apart from when he declined to reveal who his captain might be if Harry Kane was not available.\nTuchel was open, honest and clearly excited about the task ahead, although he admitted he was \"missing the smell of the grass\" and could not wait to get on the training ground with his new charges.\nThis is a coach who has been around the block with big clubs such as Borussia Dortmund, Paris St. Germain and Bayern Munich, while getting a feel and admiration for the English game and his players at Chelsea.\nHe is the quick winner the FA wanted with his appointment.\nNow the serious work starts with the World Cup his goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRashford returns as Tuchel names first England squad",

Lose then move on.\nThe Football Association provoked debate, and some criticism, by ignoring the claims of English candidates such as Eddie Howe in their succession plan post-Southgate, to go for the best man available regardless of nationality.\nThe strategy was clear. The long-term can wait while a proven winner takes charge and Tuchel's first England squad merely confirms it.\nThere is a nod to the next generation with the inclusion of versatile defender Lewis-Skelly with England short at left-back and Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers, who is 22, but there was the definite whiff of short-term targets in Tuchel's selection.\nHowever, the recall of Henderson is the most eye-catching example of Tuchel wanting experience for the here and now. He last played for England in November 2023 and missed out on selection for last summer's Euro 2024.\nTuchel described Henderson as a \"serial winner\" and this is what the coach has in mind as he plots a path to next year's World Cup.\nJordan Henderson's England career looked over when he was left out of Gareth Southgate's Euro 2024 squad\nAnd then there is the shock selection of Burn. \nA wonderful story, as Newcastle United manager Howe agreed, but a very late stage for any player to prove they are international class.\nBurn would be the oldest player to win his first England cap since Bolton Wanderers striker Kevin Davies made his debut against Montenegro on 12 October 2010 at 33 years and 200 days. The bustling forward was the oldest since 38-year-old Leslie Compton in 1950.\nIt is very much a case of going back to the past for the short-term future. Former interim boss Lee Carsley's last squad contained a total 627 caps, while this one has a tally of 664.\nTuchel is missing younger players who have been injured recently, such as Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, but is clear the German's reign is not going to be a slow burner.\nThe selection of Henderson and the return of Rashford demonstrates that Tuchel is prepared to start with a clean slate.\nHenderson's call-up came out of the blue after it looked like his England career was over when he, like Rashford, was left out of Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2024.\nThe former Liverpool captain had an ill-fated stint in Saudi Arabia before returning to Europe with Ajax, where Tuchel has clearly seen enough to recall him.\nTuchel appears to want Henderson as much for his influence off the pitch, saying: \"What he brings every time is leadership, character, personality and energy. He makes sure everyone lives by the standards and with character. He embodies everything we are trying to build.\"\nEngland's head coach has long been a fan of Rashford and wants to be the beneficiary of Aston Villa manager Unai Emery's repair job on the forward's career.\nHe said: \"I had a strong feeling we should nominate him, to push him to stay at the level he is at now not fall back into old routines.\"\nTuchel's words offer an indication that he realises Rashford had fallen by the wayside at Old Trafford but is also convinced the 27-year-old can offer much to his new England.\nHe clearly does not feel the same about Manchester City's Jack Grealish. He would have been hoping to make a comeback after also missing out on Euro 2024, although he has not figured regularly under manager Pep Guardiola.\nTottenham midfielder James Maddison is another who is, for now at least, consigned to the margins,\nTuchel goes with what he knows by recalling Chelsea's Reece James as he makes his return from another hamstring injury. \nHe was a key member of Tuchel's side that won the Champions League in 2021 and there is a potential opening at right-back with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, Kyle Walker, 34, and on loan at AC Milan, and with Newcastle United's Tino Livramento talented but inexperienced.\nThis video can not be played\n'When Rashford plays, he's one of the best'\nWatch The Football News Show on Tuchel's first England squad\nHenderson embodies everything we try to build - Tuchel\nTuchel has made no secret of his desire to utilise the natural physical aspects of the English style into his squad and this is in evidence with this selection.\nBurn, at 6 feet 7 inches, fits the bill, while Rogers combines raw power with natural skill and strong running. James also combines physical strength with great ability -and the squad has a very powerful look.\nTuchel was asked whether that lack of physicality cost England in previous tournaments.\nHe said: \"I don't think a lot is missing. Obviously a little bit is because we lost consecutive Euros finals and World Cup semi-final and quarter-finals. \n\"The feeling is a little step is needed to bring it over the line.\"\nTuchel's squad is sure to cause debate, especially in Nottingham, where Forest fans will feel Morgan Gibbs-White could have offered an \"X Factor\" after his outstanding performances in their tilt to reach the Champions League.\nThey will also offer up Callum Hudson-Odoi as an example of someone who deserves a return to the England squad after his rejuvenation, exemplified by his winning goal against Manchester City that puts Forest in such a wonderful position to reach the top four.\nEverton defender Jarrad Branthwaite, who won a full cap under Southgate, also misses out despite being in outstanding form since manager David Moyes returned to Goodison Park. He is included in Carsley's England Under-21 side.\nTottenham defender Djed Spence will have had his backers, while there is no place for Conor Gallagher despite his fine form at Atletico Madrid.\nTuchel resisted the temptation to include Arsenal 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri, who also goes into Carsley's squad.\nThis video can not be played\nHow Grealish needs 'confidence and love'\nThomas Tuchel gave a hugely impressive performance in front of the media after announcing his first squad.\nFrom suggestion he is intent on \"building a brotherhood\" in his England squad to talking about \"a parental vibe\" when handling Arsenal teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly, Tuchel was confident and comfortable in his new skin as England head coach.\nNo subject was off limits, apart from when he declined to reveal who his captain might be if Harry Kane was not available.\nTuchel was open, honest and clearly excited about the task ahead, although he admitted he was \"missing the smell of the grass\" and could not wait to get on the training ground with his new charges.\nThis is a coach who has been around the block with big clubs such as Borussia Dortmund, Paris St. Germain and Bayern Munich, while getting a feel and admiration for the English game and his players at Chelsea.\nHe is the quick winner the FA wanted with his appointment.\nNow the serious work starts with the World Cup his goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRashford returns as Tuchel names first England squad",

        "article_text": "Thomas Tuchel's 18-month contract as England head coach started in January 2025\nEngland's new head coach Thomas Tuchel will name his first squad on Friday morning as the Three Lions prepare for the start of World Cup qualifying.\nEngland play Latvia and Albania on 21 and 24 March, and Tuchel has just seven international windows and roughly 450 days between now and the ultimate challenge of winning the 2026 World Cup.\nBBC Sport looks at some of the talking points around Tuchel's first announcement, including:\nForwards: Kane a definite but injuries and poor form limit attackers\nFull-backs: Ben White return? Myles Lewis-Skelly debut?\nWill Palace midfielder Adam Wharton be called up?\nTuchel has spoken to more than 55 players on the phone to \"build connections\"\nWill selection give any clues of a 4-2-3-1 formation or 3-4-2-1?\nWildcards: Ethan Nwaneri, Jamie Gittens, Liam Delap, Elliott Anderson\nFollow the BBC Sport's live page on Friday as the squad is announced, including a Tuchel news conference live stream.\nTuchel has planned his squad announcement for Friday to take into account the English players playing on Thursday in Europe for Manchester United, Tottenham and Chelsea.\nOver the past few weeks, Tuchel has spoken to more than 55 players individually on the phone, sources told BBC Sport. FA chief Mark Bullingham said Tuchel was \"building connections\".\nTuchel has been partly working remotely from Germany, although Bullingham clarified last week that Tuchel is based at St George's Park and living in London.\nThe England boss is often shown on TV cameras at Premier League matches and has travelled to Milan to watch Kyle Walker, Madrid to see Jude Bellingham and also been to Germany to watch England captain Harry Kane.\nTuchel's assistant Anthony Barry has also been to watch games individually and Tuchel has been at St George's Park between two to three days a week, with his backroom team planning next week's camp.\nLineker and Shearer defend England criticism after Kane comments\nTuchel making brilliant impact - FA chief Bullingham\nGiven Tuchel's job description has been underlined as an 18-month trophy quest, will he focus on experienced players he knows well to win now? Interim Lee Carsley's preference was to experiment with youth and prioritise the long-term development of the squad.\nEngland's established centre-back pairing of Harry Maguire and John Stones are both injured, with a younger crop of centre backs such as Marc Guehi, Levi Colwill and Jarrad Branthwaite in strong contention.\nBen White made himself unavailable for England selection after the World Cup in Qatar in 2022 when he left the squad but Tuchel has spoken to the Arsenal defender who can play both at right back and centre back. While Chelsea captain Reece James is also known and liked by Tuchel.\nJude Bellingham and Declan Rice are two near certainties to play for England in midfield with the third place up for grabs if Tuchel plays with a three-man midfield.\nKobbie Mainoo took that role at Euro 2024 but is currently injured, whilst Carsley introduced Angel Gomes, Morgan Gibbs-White and Curtis Jones during his interim time in charge.\nAnd Tuchel has been at Selhurst Park for their past two Premier League matches and Adam Wharton. The former Blackburn man was included in the Euro 2024 squad but did not play a minute, yet has impressed since coming back from injury and could be the 'number 6' that England are craving.\nRecord goalscorer Kane's England place was one of the biggest talking points of the summer. But any discussion of evolving away from the Bayern striker has disappeared with the appointment of his former boss Tuchel and Kane's 10 Champions League and 21 Bundesliga goals this season.\nUnusually for this squad, form and fitness means England's usual array of attacking talent is partly reduced.\nCole Palmer, Phil Foden and Jack Grealish are all out of form, Bukayo Saka and Noni Madueke are injured. They are competing with Anthony Gordon, Ollie Watkins and Morgan Rogers who are all having good periods. Could Aston Villa's Marcus Rashford, on loan from Manchester United, get a surprise recall?\nIn terms of formation, Tuchel has used both the 4-2-3-1 formation and a variation of 3-4-2-1, which he implemented at Chelsea in an impressively short amount of time for Champions League glory.\nHis sides can be described as pragmatic with an extremely high level of detail put onto each player. Not afraid of a direct style, his Bayern side knocked Arsenal out of last season's Champions League maximising long diagonal balls into pacey wingers for one v one situations.\nThe biggest clue as to whether Tuchel will play three at the back will be if six centre-backs options are chosen to cover the two games, rather than four or five, including versatile players like White. Another hint would be the inclusion of Crystal Palace's Tyrick Mitchell, who is playing as left wing-back under Oliver Glasner. \nThomas Tuchel at Crystal Palace v Ipswich in March\nSouthgate was criticised for his failed Luke Shaw fitness gamble in the summer and left-back remains a dilemma for Tuchel.\nIn-form Newcastle defender Lewis Hall - who was given his Chelsea debut by Tuchel - was nailed on, before being ruled out for the rest of the campaign with an injury.\nHowever, Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly has had an impressive breakthrough season despite actually being a midfielder at youth level.\nPalace defender Mitchell has not added to his two England caps since making his debut in 2022, but with Tuchel being a regular visitor to Selhurst Park, he may be an outside bet.\nThen there is Tottenham's Djed Spence, a right-footed left wing-back nominated for February's Premier League Player of the Month after finally getting a run of games under Ange Postecoglou.\nEthan Nwaneri - Arsenal's exciting 17-year-old has scored eight goals in 30 games in his debut season, and is attracting high praise from pundits, team-mates and his manager, Mikel Arteta.\nJamie Gittens - Another England youth international flourishing at Dortmund, the 20-year-old has four goals in 12 Champions League games this season\nLiam Delap - Tipped as a long-term Kane replacement as England's central striker, the 21-year-old Ipswich star has 10 Premier League goals despite his side's relegation fears.\nElliott Anderson - High-flying Nottingham Forest's 22-year-old midfielder has played for both England and Scotland at Under 21s level.\nTuchel: How did we get here so quickly and quietly?\nWhat challenges lie ahead for Tuchel?\nTuchel - a sacrifice of principle or best man for England job?",

        "article_text": "Listen to Esme read this article\nDonald Trump's return to the White House is a \"major blow to global climate action\". So said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief, after he was elected in November.\nSince taking office, Trump has withdrawn the US from what is considered the most important global climate pact, the Paris Climate Agreement. He has also reportedly prevented US scientists from participating in international climate research and removed national electric vehicle targets.\nPlus, he derided his predecessor's attempts to develop new green technology a \"green new scam\".\nAnd yet despite his history on the issue of climate, Trump has been eager to make a deal with the Ukrainian president on critical minerals. He has also taken a strong interest in Greenland and Canada \u2013 both nations rich in critical minerals.\nCritical mineral procurement has been a major focus for Trump since he took office. These minerals are crucial in industries including aerospace and defence, but intriguingly, they have another major use too - to manufacture green technology.\nSo, could Trump's focus on obtaining these minerals have a knock-on effect, and help unlock the US's potential in the green technology sector?\nTrump's right-hand man understands more than most the importance of critical minerals in the green transition. Space X and Tesla \u2013 the companies Elon Musk leads - rely heavily on critical minerals like graphite (in electric vehicles), lithium (in batteries) and nickel (in rockets).\nElizabeth Holley, an associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines, explains that each nation has its own list of critical minerals, but they are generally made up of rare earths and other metals like lithium.\nShe says demand is booming - in 2023, demand for lithium grew by 30%. This is being driven mostly by the rapid growth in the clean energy and electric vehicle sectors.\nWithin two decades, they will make up almost 90% of the demand for lithium, 70% of the demand for cobalt, and 40% for rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency.\nSuch has been Musk's concern with getting hold of some of these minerals that three years ago he tweeted: \"Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.\"\nHe went on to write that there is no shortage of the element, but the pace of extraction is slow.\nThe weakness of the US position in rare earths and critical minerals (such as cobalt and nickel) was addressed in a report published by a US Government Select Committee in December 2023. It said: \"The United States must rethink its policy approach to critical mineral and rare earth element supply chains because of the risks posed by our current dependence on the People's Republic of China.\"\nFailure to do so, it warned, could cause \"defense production to grind to a halt and choke off manufacturing of other advanced technologies\".\nChina's dominance in the market has come from its early recognition of the economic opportunities that green technology offers.\n\"China made a decision about 10 years ago about where the trend was going and has strategically pursued the development of not just renewables but also electric vehicles and now dominates the market,\" says Bob Ward, policy director at The London School of Economics (LSE) Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.\nDaisy Jennings-Gray, head of prices at price reporting agency Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, explains that they are critical minerals because they are geologically restricted. \"You cannot guarantee you will have economically recoverable reserves in every country.\"\nSome minerals like lithium are abundant on Earth, but often they are located in difficult to reach places, so the logistics of a mining project can be very expensive. In other cases, there is dependency on one country that produces a large share of global supply \u2013 like cobalt from the the Democratic Republic of Congo. This means that if there is a natural disaster or political unrest it has an impact on the price, says Ms Jennings-Gray.\nChina has managed to shore up supply by investing heavily in Africa and South America, but where it really has a stronghold on the market is in processing (or the separation of the mineral from other elements in the rock).\n\"China accounts for 60% of global rare earth production but processes nearly 90% - [it] is dominant on this stage,\" says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC. \nShe says the country understands how important this is in economic trade - a few days after Trump introduced tariffs on China its government hit back by imposing export controls on more than 20 critical minerals including graphite and tungsten.\nWhat is motivating Trump is a fear of being at a disadvantage, argues Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). \n\"I think what is driving this is because China is the dominant player on the processing side,\" he says. \"It is that processing stage, which is the high-margin stage of the business, so China is making a lot of money.\"\nAs he puts it, it is a \"happy coincidence\" that this could end up supporting green technology.\nThe key question, though, is whether the US is too late to fully capitalise on the sector.\nIn the early days, the green transition was \"framed as a burden\" for countries, according to LSE's Bob Ward. \nThe Biden administration was highly supportive of green technology industries through its introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which offers tax credits, loans and other incentives to technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from battery technologies for electric vehicles to solar panels. \nBy August 2024, it was estimated to have brought $493bn (\u00a3382bn) of investment to US green industry, according to the think tank Clean Investment Monitor.\nAnd yet little work was done to support upstream processes like obtaining critical minerals, says Ms Gray from Benchmark Intelligence. Instead, the Biden administration focused heavily on downstream manufacturing - the process of getting products from the manufacturer to the end consumer.\nBut Trump's recent moves to procure these critical minerals suggest a focus on the upstream process may now be happening.\n\"The IRA put a lot of legislation in places to limit trade and supply only from friendly nations,\" explains Ms Gray.\n\"Trump is changing tack and looking at securing critical minerals agreements that owes something to the US.\"\nThere could be further moves from Trump coming down the line. Those working in the sector say whispers in the corridors of the White House suggest that he may be about to pass a \"Critical Minerals Executive Order\", which could funnel further investment into this objective.\nThe exact details that may be included in the executive order remain unclear, but experts knowledgeable with the issue have said it may include measures to accelerate mining in the US, including fast tracking permits and investment to construct processing plants.\nAlthough work may now be under way to secure these minerals, Prof Willy Shih of Harvard Business School thinks that the US administration lacks understanding of the technical complexity of establishing mineral supply chains, and emphasises the time commitment required. \"If you want to build a new mine and processing facility, it might take you 10 years.\"\nAs a policy of his predecessor, and one that is so obviously pro-climate action, Trump has been vocally opposed to maintaining the IRA. But its success in red states mean that many Republican senators have been trying to convince him to keep it in some form in his proposed \"big, beautiful bill\" - the plan to pile all of Trump's main policy goals into one mega-bill - due to be revealed later this month.\nAnalysis by the Clean Investment Monitor shows in the last 18 months Republican-held states had received 77% of the investment.\nMIT's Dr Knittel says for states like Georgia, which has become part of what is now known as the \"battery belt\" following a boom in battery production following IRA support, these tax credits are crucial for these industries to survive.\nHe adds that failure to do so poses a real political threat for US representatives who are up for re-election in less than two years.\nIf Trump loses even just one seat to the Democrats in the 2026 mid-terms, then he loses the house majority - limiting his ability to pass key pieces of legislation. \nCarl Fleming was an advisor to former President Biden's Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee and is a partner at law firm McDermott, Will & Emery, advising clients in the clean tech and energy space. He says that despite the uncertainty, investors remain confident. \"In the last month, my practice has been busier than ever, and this is since quadrupling last year following the IRA.\"\nHe also believes that there is a recognition of the need to maintain parts of the IRA \u2013 although this may be alongside expansion of some fossil fuels. \"If you are really trying to be 'America First' and energy secure, you want to pull on all your levers. Keep solar and keep battery storage going and add more natural gas to release America's energy prowess.\"\nBut the uncertainty of the US position is little consolation for its absence on the international climate stage, says LSE's Bob Ward. \"When the Americans are on the ball it helps to move people in the right direction and that's how we got the Paris Climate Agreement.\"\nFor those in the climate space, Trump is certainly not an environmentalist. What's clear is he is not concerned with making his legacy an environmental one but an economic one - though he could achieve the former if he can be convinced it will boost the economy.\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Cases of the incredibly contagious measles virus are continuing to rise in Texas and across the US as the nation's top health official promotes treatments not supported by health experts. \nTo date this year, the US has recorded more than 250 measles cases across several states, including Oklahoma, Alaska, California, Georgia, Florida, New York, Kentucky and Rhode Island. \nThe epicentre remains in western Texas and neighbouring New Mexico, where two unvaccinated people have died from the virus. \nIt comes as Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy, Jr continues to focus on unproven treatments like cod liver oil, and his casting doubt on the safety of the vaccines. \nThe BBC has contacted the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for comment.\nMeasles is a dangerous virus that has no cure and can lead to a host of complications, including pneumonia and brain swelling. It can be deadly. \nVaccination rates must be 95% or higher for the broader population to be protected, but several communities where the virus is spreading have rates well below that.\nThe US declared measles eliminated in 2000, but outbreaks have continued to crop up in recent years as anti-vaccine sentiments have grown. \nHealth officials say cases have shown no signs of slowing down in western Texas, where two pregnant women recently reported infections. \nAcross the state's border, New Mexico now has more than 30 cases, while new infections have been confirmed in Oklahoma, New York and in Los Angeles this week.  \nIn several instances, unvaccinated Americans have spread measles to others after contracting the virus outside of the country, including on Long Island in New York, where a baby caught the virus while traveling with family, health officials say. \nCases are also on the rise in Canada, which has reported 146 infections. \nKennedy has so far offered mixed messages about the outbreaks. \nAt first, he suggested the rising cases were \"not unusual\" for the US, before backtracking and calling the situation \"serious\".\nThen, this week, in an interview with Fox News, Kennedy suggested cod liver oil and other alternative measles treatments had proven \"miraculous\". \nThe remarks are resonating with some residents in western Texas, said Ron Cook, a family physician and health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak in Lubbock, where a child died of measles this month. \nThere, a handful of physicians are handing out cod liver oil to parents of sick children who are sceptical of measles immunizations, Dr Cook said. One physician told NBC News he was just trying to help families with the alternative treatment \"like Bobby Kennedy is trying to do\". \nVitamin A - a nutrient found in cod liver oil - is sometimes offered as a part of a treatment for measles, especially if someone is deficient, Dr Cook said. But, he added, it is difficult to monitor the levels of the vitamin in cod liver oil, which could endanger children if they are given too much of the vitamin or other nutrients it contains. \n\"What disappoints me the most is that they're not talking about the vaccine,\" Dr Cook said.\nHe said he believed that it was a missed opportunity to engage with vaccine-sceptical communities to help slow the spread of measles.\nKennedy, this week, offered a conditional endorsement of the vaccine, telling Fox News it was \"recommended\" for the Texas Mennonite community - the origin of the outbreak - while also suggesting some of the children had been harmed by the vaccines, which have been thoroughly studied and found to be safe. \nThis week, the Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine nonprofit that Kennedy founded, updated and re-promoted a 2021 book in which Kennedy called measles vaccines \"risky\". \n\"Measles outbreaks have been fabricated to create fear that in turn forces government officials to 'do something,'\" he said, adding that benefits of the vaccine had been \"exaggerated\".

In several instances, unvaccinated Americans have spread measles to others after contracting the virus outside of the country, including on Long Island in New York, where a baby caught the virus while traveling with family, health officials say.

        "article_text": "Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is set to unveil details of how the government plans to cut billions of pounds from the working-age welfare bill. \nThe focus will be on reducing spending on health-related and disability benefits.\nThat bill is rising rapidly and many argue it needs to be curbed for the sake of the UK's public finances \u2013 as well as the economic and individual benefits of getting people back into work.\nBut this is not the first government to seek savings from the welfare budget, and to try to encourage more people into employment.\nAnd charities are warning about the adverse impact on vulnerable recipients.\nThere are three broad approaches which the government is believed to be examining:\nBBC Verify has examined the past 15 years of policies in this area to see what might be effective \u2013 and what risks being counterproductive.\nThe working-age health and disability benefits bill has certainly been increasing in recent years, and is rising rapidly.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the official forecaster, has projected that total state spending on these benefits for people in the UK aged between 18 and 64 will increase from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.\nThat would represent an increase from 1.7% of the size of the UK economy to 2.2%.\nBy 2030, around half of the expenditure is projected to be on incapacity benefit, which is designed to provide additional income for people whose health limits their ability to work.\nThe other half is projected to be on Personal Independence Payments (PIP), which are intended to help people of working age with disabilities manage the additional day-to-day costs arising from their disability.\nOne straightforward way for ministers to curb this projected rise would be to hold payments flat in cash terms, rather than allowing them to rise in line with prices each year.\n\"Reducing award amounts is the easiest way to get savings in the short term,\" says Eduin Latimer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\nFreezing incapacity benefits in cash terms until 2030 would save \u00a31bn a year, according to the Resolution Foundation.\nBut you can only receive incapacity benefit if your income and savings are below a certain level, so freezing payments would impact people who are worse off.\nAlso, people on disability benefits such as PIP are considerably more likely to be in poverty and material deprivation.\nUnder previous governments between 2014 and 2020, most working-age benefits did not rise in line with inflation - to save money.\nAnd from 2015, more and more people claimed incapacity benefit.\nSo cutting the value of individual payments might save some money up front, but still not have a dramatic impact on the overall bill in the longer term if claimants continue to rise.\nRather than cutting the value of these benefits for all recipients, the government could seek to save money by making it harder for people to claim them in the first place.\nFor instance, the previous government had proposed making it harder for people with mental health conditions to claim PIP, arguing that the monthly payment was not proportionate to the additional financial needs created by their conditions.\nBut it is important to note that efforts to change the eligibility criteria for these benefits over the past 15 years have not yielded the results hoped for.\nPIP was introduced in 2013 to replace the old Disability Living Allowance, with the intention it would lead to savings of \u00a31.4bn a year relative to the previous system by reducing the number of people eligible.\nPIP was initially projected to reduce the number of claimants by 606,000 (28%) in total.\nYet the reform ended up saving only \u00a3100m a year by 2015 and the number of claimants rose by 100,000 (5%).\nAnother attempt in 2017 to limit access to PIP was also reversed.\nThe reason was that many people appealed against refusals that had been triggered by the tightened eligibility criteria. Also, the emergence of cases in the media which seemed unfair meant ministers, often under pressure from their own backbench MPs, ultimately ordered the eligibility rules to be relaxed.\nOfficial decisions not to award PIP and incapacity benefit to claimants are still often challenged and around a third of those challenges are ultimately upheld at an independent tribunal.\n\"Britain's chequered history of benefit reform shows that the government should proceed cautiously, rather than rush ahead to find savings which could backfire,\" says Louise Murphy of the Resolution Foundation.\nAnother way for the government to try to achieve savings is by encouraging more people to come off these benefits and enter work.\nAround 93% of incapacity benefit claimants are not in work and the same is true of 80% of PIP claimants.\nOne potential route to increase employment rates could be regular reassessments of people in receipt of incapacity benefit and a requirement for them to start looking for jobs if they are found to be fit for work.\nThe fall in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit in the early 2010s has been attributed by the OBR to reassessments of a large number of people in receipt of an older form of the benefit.\nHowever, an aggressive or onerous reassessment regime could risk imposing distress on people who are unable to work and could also create unexpected distortions in the system.\nThe OBR has suggested the sanctions introduced to the wider benefits system by the last government, requiring people judged fit to work to be actively looking for employment or risk losing their benefits, had the counterproductive effect of increasing the incentive for people to try to claim incapacity benefits (for which these work-searching requirements did not apply).\nAnother potential policy avenue to boost employment rates is through providing much greater support to find jobs.\nSome advocate increasing government investment in official schemes, working with employers, to help people to enter the workplace.\nThere have been various schemes designed to achieve this over the past 15 years, though they have not been on a large scale.\nEvaluations have shown some positive employment effects from them.\nHowever, the OBR concluded last year that the evidence base was still limited and did not suggest such programmes have, so far, made a \"significant contribution\" to getting people into work.\nThat implies the official forecaster may hesitate to assume greater state investment in these schemes will pay for itself through higher employment and tax revenues, and result in net savings in public expenditure.\nNevertheless, some experts argue it would make sense for the government to re-assess more regularly whether people in receipt of health and disability benefits are still unable to work and - if their circumstances are found to have changed - to provide them with additional support to get into the workforce.\n\"Not doing reassessments and work-focused interviews definitely makes things worse,\" says Jonathan Portes, a former chief economist at the Department for Work & Pensions.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

The focus will be on reducing spending on health-related and disability benefits.That bill is rising rapidly and many argue it needs to be curbed for the sake of the UK's public finances \u2013 as well as the economic and individual benefits of getting people back into work.But this is not the first government to seek savings from the welfare budget, and to try to encourage more people into employment.And charities are warning about the adverse impact on vulnerable recipients.There are three broad approaches which the government is believed to be examining:Cutting the level of benefit paymentsTightening the eligibility for benefitsAttempting to get people off benefits and into workBBC Verify has examined the past 15 years of policies in this area to see what might be effective \u2013 and what risks being counterproductive.Cutting paymentsThe working-age health and disability benefits bill has certainly been increasing in recent years, and is rising rapidly.The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the official forecaster, has projected that total state spending on these benefits for people in the UK aged between 18 and 64 will increase from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.That would represent an increase from 1.7% of the size of the UK economy to 2.2%.By 2030, around half of the expenditure is projected to be on incapacity benefit, which is designed to provide additional income for people whose health limits their ability to work.The other half is projected to be on Personal Independence Payments (PIP), which are intended to help people of working age with disabilities manage the additional day-to-day costs arising from their disability.One straightforward way for ministers to curb this projected rise would be to hold payments flat in cash terms, rather than allowing them to rise in line with prices each year. \"Not doing reassessments and work-focused interviews definitely makes things worse,\" says Jonathan Portes, a former chief economist at the Department for Work & Pensions.What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?Chancellor's Spring Statement Does cutting benefits work?4 hours agoShareSaveBen ChuBBC VerifyShareSaveBBCWork and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is set to unveil details of how the government plans to cut billions of pounds from the working-age welfare bill.",

        "article_text": "Newcastle, Aston Villa and Fulham are all in the race for Champions League football\nThe Premier League title race and relegation battles look ominously like 'done deals' - but what about the fight for Champions League football?\nEngland's top division is on course to gain an additional spot in Europe's elite club competition for next season thanks to Uefa's coefficient ranking table, which you can find out more about here.\nAs a result, as many as seven Premier League clubs could qualify but that would require Arsenal - though unlikely - or Aston Villa to finish outside the top five and win the Champions League, and either Tottenham or Manchester United to win the Europa League.\nOf the likely five spots on offer through the league, leaders Liverpool - 15 points clear at the top - will surely take one. Arsenal, in second, have an eight-point cushion to Newcastle in sixth so should secure another.\nHowever, with 10th-placed Fulham just five points off fifth, as many as eight teams probably remain in the mix for the final three places.\nCrystal Palace, in 11th, are in great form but closing a nine-point feels too big an ask, especially given the number of sides they would have to overhaul.\nWith 10 games left for most, BBC Sport looks at the eight clubs in contention and the challenges they will have to overcome to claim one of those lucrative places. Plus Phil McNulty gives his predictions on where each club will finish and fans have their say on why they back their team in the race for Europe...\nThis video can not be played\nNottingham Forest manager Nuno reflects on big win against Manchester City\nNuno Espirito Santo's side have been this season's surprise package (and a big one at that), going from a relegation scrap last term to challenging at the top, claiming famous wins at Anfield and Old Trafford along the way. Dreams of the title have faded since the start of the year but they remain in a great position to end a memorable campaign celebrating Champions League qualification.\nKey fixtures: The week after March's international break looks huge for Forest. After an FA Cup quarter-final at Brighton, they host Manchester United on 1 April before travelling to fellow top-five hopefuls Aston Villa four days later.\nShould it go down to the wire, expect quite the atmosphere when Forest face Chelsea at the City Ground on the final day of the season in what could be a winner-takes-all match.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Fourth\nWhat a story it will be for this great old club with the rich history of two European Cup wins under Brian Clough to return to the elite competition.\nAnd the surge of belief that swept around the atmospheric City Ground after the win against Manchester City makes you believe the force is with Nuno's side.\nThey have a top-class goalkeeper in Matz Sels, formidable central defenders in Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic, quality in midfield and out wide with Morgan Gibbs-White and Callum Hudson-Odoi. Throw in a striker having the season of his life in Chris Wood and a top-four place is there for the taking.\nOpta's prediction: 73.1% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nMossy: Best defence in the Premier League.\nStuart: Great business, great recruitment, great morals and an incredible work-rate.\nSteve: Forest will continue to do what they've done for most of the games so far, defend well and catch teams on the break.\nCole Palmer is Chelsea's top goalscorer in the Premier League but has gone seven league games without a goal\nAs recently as December, Chelsea were being mentioned as title challengers. Manager Enzo Maresca was quick to dismiss such talk before a post-Christmas slump that led to them dropping out of the Champions League spots. Back-to-back league wins suggest they might be finding form again at just the right time, though.\nKey fixtures: If Chelsea are to make the top five, they will really have earned it given their remaining fixtures. They travel to Arsenal on Sunday, then host rivals Tottenham before tricky games at Brentford and Fulham in April.\nIn May they face Liverpool and Manchester United at Stamford Bridge, either side of a trip to Newcastle, before that potentially crucial trip to Nottingham Forest on the last day.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Fifth\nTouted as title contenders at one point, there has been a drop off in form but Maresca still has lots of quality at his disposal. Cole Palmer is the shining symbol of that.\nMaresca's studied passing style of football has yet to fully win over Stamford Bridge and the fixture list is tough, but they should have enough to claim the fifth place which may secure Champions League football next season.\nOpta's prediction: 54.5% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nJohn: We'll qualify for Champions League because key players - including Nico Jackson - will come back from injury, Cole Palmer will find his form, and Enzo Maresca will loosen his system a bit and let these guys play the way they want to play.\nFahey: Our remaining 10 fixtures should result in 19-21 points, making 68-70 points overall. I think 65 will be enough to get fifth place.\nMatthew: Chelsea will qualify for the Champions League not on merit but because everyone else's form is also sketchy and others' inability to get results over the line will get us top five by default.\nThis video can not be played\n'He knows he should have saved that' - Hart on Ederson\nIn Pep Guardiola's time as manager, Champions League qualification has been a formality for City. However, injury problems and a once-formidable squad starting to show signs of age means it is just a matter of time before the defending champions relinquish their crown - and they still have work to do to book their place at Europe's top table next season.\nKey fixtures: In-form Brighton travel to the Etihad on Saturday with the chance to leapfrog City with a win, while Guardiola's side face Manchester United at Old Trafford early in April.\nBournemouth at home and Fulham away end City's league season and that could be very interesting should either side remain in the top-five hunt.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Third\nCity finishing in third place in the Premier League was unthinkable at the start of the season after four straight titles but they would gratefully settle for it now after a mediocre campaign by their own standards.\nThey still have some ground to make up, but with the quality still in Guardiola's squad and the goals of Erling Haaland, they should get that top-three place and go into the Champions League next season.\nOpta's prediction: 81.3% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nScott: Manchester City will qualify for the Champions League via their league position after a run of eight wins from their final 10 games.\nMark: City will qualify because the teams around them are even more unreliable when it comes to winning games.\nOnly Mohamed Salah and Erling Haaland have scored more than Alexander Isak in the Premier League this season\nAfter a taste of the Champions League last season, a year without European football looked like the perfect opportunity for Newcastle to get themselves back there. Alexander Isak spearheaded a brilliant mid-season run to raise hopes they could kick on for a top-three finish, but three losses in their last five games, coupled with some untimely injuries, slowed their momentum.\nKey fixtures: An away game against Aston Villa is the standout of a busy April in which Newcastle play six times in the league - with four home matches. A very tricky May follows, in which they travel to Brighton and Arsenal with Chelsea coming to St James' Park in between.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Sixth\nThis has been a mixed season, but eyes are firmly on that first major domestic prize in 70 years with the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool at Wembley on Sunday.\nEddie Howe has a talented squad when fully fit, with a world-class striker in Isak. Top four may be beyond them but European football should not, irrespective of whether they end that long wait for a big trophy - their first since the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1969.\nOpta's prediction: 50.7% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nJohn: It's not a difficult run-in and with six of the final 10 games at home, Eddie Howe has the expert ability to implement the right tactics to deliver success.\nConnor: Eddie Howe is the best thing at this club in over 20 years and knows exactly what he's doing.\nBen: Alexander Isak - nothing more to say.\nBrighton are on their longest winning run in the league since April 2017\nBrighton look to have hit form at just the right time in Fabian Hurzeler's first season in charge, winning their past four league matches. With an FA Cup quarter-final to look forward to as well, the Seagulls could be heading for a thrilling conclusion to the campaign.\nKey fixtures: After taking on Manchester City on Saturday, Brighton host Aston Villa in their first league match after the international break, then travel to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace. Home games against Newcastle and Liverpool follow in May before a trip to Tottenham on the final day.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Ninth\nMomentum is all in the latter stages of the season and Brighton have it, as Hurzeler has engineered a remarkable run of six straight wins since the 7-0 loss at Nottingham Forest.\nThey can exact revenge on Forest in the FA Cup quarter-final, and anything is possible in their current form. They could yet make a nonsense of this prediction if it carries on, and they will really fancy their chances in the FA Cup.\nOpta's prediction: 18.1% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nPeter: The team play as a cohesive unit, believing in their potential to win against any opposition and backed up by an exemplar management structure, other clubs would be proud of.\nIan: Brighton have the momentum and there are no immovable objects in our way.\nMax: They have belief in themselves and are not afraid of any club.\nThis video can not be played\nEmery praises 'fantastic' Aston Villa defence\nIt has been a strange year for Aston Villa with Unai Emery's side thrilling in Europe but frustrating in the league. Given their Champions League exertions, perhaps the inconsistent league form shouldn't be too much of surprise. But, with one fewer game left to play than their rivals, Villa need to find last season's consistency for the next two months if they want to be back among Europe's elite in 2025-26.\nKey fixtures: For all that two-legged quarter-final against Paris St-Germain will draw the eye, Villa have got some tricky league fixtures in April as well.\nBrighton at home and Forest away start the month, Newcastle at Villa Park and Manchester City away end it. With Fulham, Bournemouth, Tottenham and Manchester United to follow in May, it doesn't get a whole lot easier.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Seventh\nVilla's Premier League form has been up and down but Emery is the master of Europe and cup competitions and they are in the quarter-finals of the Champions League and FA Cup. They must be serious contenders in the latter with a last-eight game at Preston North End.\nWill this be a distraction from the league? Time will tell, but Europe can still be achieved through the league, although repeating last season's top-four finish may be out of reach.\nOpta's prediction: 6.9% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nPrit: Strength in depth and the master strategist that is Unai Emery.\nMichael: We have a better manager, better squad and a much better fanbase than the opposing teams!\nThis video can not be played\n'Desire and intent' - Rooney full of praise for Bournemouth's front three\nDespite a terrible run with injuries, Bournemouth have continued to impress under Andoni Iraola this season. They've beaten Arsenal, Manchester City and Nottingham Forest at home, thumped Newcastle at St James' Park and reached an FA Cup quarter-final. Adding Champions League qualification to the list should not be ruled out.\nKey fixtures: With games at Arsenal and Manchester City to come in May, as well as a home match against Aston Villa, Bournemouth are likely to need a big April if they're to break into the top five. Given their only match against another side in the top half is at home to Fulham, the chance is there for them.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Eighth\nBournemouth are another team who will have eyes on what looks like a wide-open last eight in the FA Cup, although they have to navigate their way past Manchester City in the quarter-final.\nIraola has produced a top-class team with an intensity that makes them an eye-catching, entertaining watch. Will the FA Cup focus their minds more than the league?\nEither way it has been another season of progress for the Cherries and a top-10 place is surely theirs.\nOpta's prediction: 14.3% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nAndrew: We will qualify for the Champions League because Iraola will keep them running and pushing forward until the very last second of the very last game.\nJules: Bournemouth play an aggressive game, press hard, never give up and they've got a great manager.\nRoss: Andoni Iraola has transformed Bournemouth and he and the team deserve it.\nRaul Jimenez is Fulham's top scorer with 10 goals in the Premier League\nFulham are enjoying another excellent season with Marco Silva leading them to an FA Cup quarter-final and keeping them firmly in contention for a European place. The Cottagers are outsiders for a Champions League spot but draws against Arsenal and Liverpool, plus league doubles over Nottingham Forest and Newcastle, have shown what they're capable of.\nKey fixtures: Fulham face the top two in the space of five days in April - Arsenal away followed by Liverpool at Craven Cottage. Then it's Bournemouth and Chelsea before they go to Aston Villa and local rivals Brentford in May, finishing at home to Manchester City.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Tenth\nFulham have enjoyed another solid season of progress under the excellent coaching of Marco Silva and - add them to the list - will feel they have real chances in the FA Cup after winning on penalties at Manchester United.\nTenth is probably the highest they can reach but that represents another fine campaign. Could the FA Cup provide the icing?\nOpta's prediction: 1.2% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nPatrick: Only two more of our league games for the season are against teams below us but we have proven our worth against the elite teams and that mindset will allow us to make it into a Champions League position.\nLuke: We have by far the hardest set of fixtures which I think favours Fulham because we play well against the best.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "To celebrate World Sleep Day, here's our science-based guide to getting the best slumber you can \u2013 from varying sleep with the seasons to taking inspiration from the past.\nIt's a typical weekday morning, and you're just beginning to stir in bed. There's light streaking through the windows, while the many chirps and caws of birds announce that it's probably time to get up\u2026 but surely that can't be right? Cue the familiar feeling of dread, as you remember a night filled with restless, low-quality sleep.\u00a0\u00a0\nAcross the world, people are struggling with insufficient sleep. In the US alone, it's been estimated that between 50 and 70 million people suffer from the affliction, and on a global scale, it has even been called an epidemic. However, there are some simple adjustments \u2013 both psychological and physical \u2013 that might help to improve the quality of your sleep. Here's our guide to having a delicious, restful slumber, inspired by the latest scientific research and some long-forgotten historical tricks.\u00a0\u00a0\nToday, when people wake up in the middle of the night, it's not unusual to panic \u2013 after all, we tend to believe that we should sleep for a continuous eight hours. But this has not always been the case. For millennia, people had a short first sleep \u2013 and then they woke up. These little slumber-gaps were filled with an endless variety of activities, from household chores to gossip in the dark (and even the occasional murder). Then after a couple of hours, people went back to bed and slept through until the morning.\u00a0\nThis is the forgotten ancient practise of \"two sleeps\". It was rediscovered by Roger Ekirch, a university distinguished professor of history at Virginia Tech, Virginia, in the 1990s. He believes that an awareness of the habit's historical prevalence might help to reframe the experiences of those who suffer from insomnia today \u2013 and perhaps lessen their anxiety about waking up in the night. Read more about the lost ancient habit of \"biphasic sleep\" in this article by Zaria Gorvett.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs spring arrives, you might notice that you need less sleep and are finding it easier to leave your bed in the morning. Research shows that we need more sleep during the dark, cold winter months than we do during the summer. This is because humans experience seasonal sleep. According to one German study, people experienced both longer REM and deep sleep in December than in June. REM sleep is the most active stage of sleep, when we dream and our heart rate increases, while deep sleep is when the body repairs muscle and tissues and is important for the consolidation of long-term memory.\u00a0Read more about the seasonality of human sleep in this article by Isabelle Gerretsen.\u00a0\nIn many countries having a catnap is a daily ritual, and research shows that regular naps are good for our health. According to a 2023 study, habitual napping helps keep our brains bigger for longer and can delay brain ageing by between three to six years. A smaller brain volume has been linked to diseases such as Alzheimer's and vascular dementia.\nThere are also short-term benefits. Short naps, lasting no longer than 15 minutes, can immediately improve how well we perform mentally, with results lasting up to three hours after we wake up. The key to power naps is to keep them short (after 20 minutes we start drifting into deep sleep) and to make sure you have one mid-afternoon so that it doesn't disrupt your sleep at night. Read more about the health benefits of napping here.\u00a0\nBut not all naps are good for us. Some last mere seconds and these microsleeps can result in serious harm if they occur when you're driving. Analysis of dashcam footage from 52 drivers from a single truck company in Japan found that three quarters of them showed signs of microsleep before they were involved in a collision.\nMicrosleeps are more common among people who suffer from narcolepsy or people who don't get enough sleep at night. One study found that when people slept for just six hours a night for 14 days in a row, they had as many microsleeps as those who missed a whole night's sleep. If you're regularly experiencing microsleeps, it's therefore probably a sign that you're not getting enough sleep generally.\u00a0Read more about the naps that only last a few seconds in this article by Claudia Hammond.\u00a0\nAs we snuggle up in bed for the night \u2013 particularly if it's just with a good podcast \u2013 we might wonder why it's so cold under the covers, or even a bit lonely.\nHistorically, having your own bed was highly unusual. Like it or not, most people had to share \u2013 and not just with their siblings in childhood, or as a married couple. Until the 19th Century, the majority of people would have slept communally, routinely slumbering alongside friends, colleagues and even total strangers. A good bedfellow would provide warmth and conversation into the early hours of the morning \u2013 though you might have to overlook their morning breath and contribution to a bedful of biting parasites. Read more about the forgotten habit of communal sleep in this article by Zaria Gorvett.\u00a0\nHow much sleep we all need can vary from person to person, with most recommendations for between seven and nine hours. But the amount of sleep you get is only one part of the equation. Quality matters as much, if not more.\nMost of us will have experienced feeling less refreshed after a night of tossing and turning. That's partly because when we sleep, our brains flood with cerebrospinal fluid to clear out accumulated debris and toxins. This waste-clearance system is called the glymphatic system, which works best at the same time every day. This means that when we get our shuteye is important. Syncing sleep with our natural circadian rhythms \u2013 the brain's 24-hour internal clock that regulates the cycle of alertness and sleepiness \u2013 gives rise to the best-quality rest.\u00a0Read more about the importance of sleep quality in this feature by Sandy Ong.\u00a0\nToday most people in the Western world are lucky enough to wake up on a soft bed, perhaps with a spring mattress or memory foam. However, things have not always been so comfortable.\u00a0\nIn the medieval era, many people opened their eyes each morning to stuffy air and pitch-blackness \u2013 the conditions inside a \"box bed\". These popular sleeping-cupboards were completely enclosed, and helped to keep people warm at night, though they were sometimes not much bigger than a wardrobe. Slightly later there came the \"tick\" mattress, a bag of cheap materials such as straw or leaves. Unfortunately, they also provided the ideal hiding place for ticks, fleas and bedbugs. But the true inventors of a bad night's sleep might arguably have been the Victorians, who created a variety of unpleasant solutions for homeless people, from rows of coffin-beds to a rope to hang oneself over for a rest. Read more about the curious history of beds through the centuries, or top up your knowledge on why medieval people slept in cupboards, in these articles by Zaria Gorvett.\u00a0\nSo, find yourself some bedfellows, allow for more sleep in the winter, and if you occasionally wake up in the night, consider yourself a modern pioneer of the lost ancient habit of biphasic sleep. We still can't promise that you'll be leaping out of bed on a Monday morning, but it's a start.\u00a0\n--\nThis story was originally published on 15/03/2024.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\nJoin one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Lewis Hamilton is starting his 19th season in Formula 1\nAustralian Grand Prix\nVenue: Albert Park, Melbourne Date: Sunday, 16 March Race start: 04:00 GMT\nCoverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live from 03:30. Live text updates on BBC Sport website and app\nThere was no fairytale for Lewis Hamilton on his first competitive outing for Ferrari, as Formula 1's most celebrated driver began his career with the sport's most iconic team.\nThe seven-time world champion qualified only eighth for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix - one place and 0.218 seconds slower than his team-mate Charles Leclerc, and a whopping 0.877secs behind Lando Norris' McLaren on pole position.\nAfterwards, Hamilton was repeating the mantra he has been using for some time - that it is going to take a little time before he is fully up to speed with his new car and team.\n\"For me, just improving every single lap, session on session,\" he said. \"Big learning curve this weekend.\n\"The car was so much different than I have ever experienced here and it's been a lot slower process to build confidence in the car.\n\"In the high-speed [corners], I have been down all weekend to Charles, who has had confidence from the get-go. He knew what the car does. I was just building up to that. I got a lot closer in the end and to be that close to Charles in my first qualifying session against a great qualifier...\"\nNorris takes Melbourne pole with Hamilton eighth\nAustralian Grand Prix Qualifying Review\nHe didn't complete the sentence, but the meaning was clear - Leclerc is blindingly fast; everyone knows that. So from Hamilton's point of view, in terms of his own relative performance, this was a perfectly decent start.\nThe same could not be said of Ferrari themselves. Hamilton is at Ferrari with one objective only - to win an eighth world title. Leclerc himself spoke on Thursday about winning a championship with Ferrari being his \"obsession\". Neither will achieve their aims with a car that qualifies on the fourth row of the grid.\nLeclerc was perplexed by what had happened. He had been quick all weekend, and fourth fastest in the first qualifying session, just over 0.1secs off Norris, who topped all three. But it became progressively worse as the hour developed.\n\"As soon as we started to push the car more and more,\" Leclerc said, \"we found more and more inconsistency, which was a bit of a shame.\n\"We lost the pace a little bit through qualifying. In Q1 we were good, in Q2 we were less good and in Q3 we had to push a lot to try and nail the lap time. We didn't really follow the track for some reason.\n\"This car has a lot of potential but for now we don't seem to be in the right window, so we have to find it.\"\nThis video can not be played\nBig surprises & how will Hamilton do?: BBC 5 Live team share 2025 predictions\nIt was a sobering start to a season that all in F1 had expected to start with Ferrari as McLaren's closest challenger. But not everyone felt it was necessarily a reflection of the team's true potential.\nMcLaren team principal Andrea Stella said: \"I am certainly surprised at the gap between McLaren and Ferrari. But I would say more, I just don't take that gap at face value.\n\"I'm sure the potential of the red car is higher than for some reasons was possible to exploit today. I think we have seen that until possibly qualifying in every single session, even in Bahrain [at pre-season testing].\n\"So we are very realistic that Ferrari is definitely one of the main contenders.\"\nLando Norris has spent his entire F1 career with McLaren since making his debut in 2019\nHamilton at Ferrari - his personal quest for success, and the internal battle with Leclerc - is one of the dominant narratives at the start of this season.\nAnother is whether Norris can deliver on his ambition to mount a season-long title challenge from the off, rather than having to play catch-up - which he had to try to do last year because McLaren did not start on Red Bull's level.\nIn the end in Melbourne, McLaren did deliver on their potential, but not without a few scary moments.\nFacing a tougher challenge from Red Bull and Max Verstappen than they - and the four-time champion himself - had expected, Norris and Oscar Piastri both made mistakes on their first laps in the final part of qualifying.\nThat put them under pressure on their last runs - lacking a competitive first lap always makes finding the right balance of risk and reward on that all-important final lap much more difficult, because the penalty of making a mistake is so much greater.\nFor home favourite Piastri, this was bad enough - he was fourth after his first run. Norris, though, was 10th, having had his lap deleted for exceeding track limits.\nBoth absolutely nailed it. Piastri, hoping to become the first Australian to win his home grand prix in F1, improved by a second, knocking Verstappen from the top, and Norris did even better, pipping his team-mate by 0.084secs.\nNorris said. \"It's a track where you've got to commit. You know what your target is, and once you turn in you're kind of hoping for the best in a lot of cases. You want to take those risks.\n\"Obviously, I took too many on my first lap and got track limits, so I was in a difficult position knowing how much risk I wanted to take. But I put it together well. It was just a clean lap, no mistakes, and that was enough. So happy. A perfect way to start the season.\"\nMcLaren ended last year with their first constructors' championship title for 26 years, and Stella has said they have taken some risks with \"innovative\" design in pushing for more performance from a car that was the fastest in the field for the second half of last year.\nAlthough all the teams arrived in Melbourne expecting them to be at the front, Norris on Thursday described the idea they might be a chunk ahead of the rest as \"short-sighted\".\nIn the end, at least on the quick, demanding street circuit of Albert Park, he was the one who had to recalibrate.\n\"It really was not necessarily our expectation to have a bit of a gap to the rest of the cars,\" Norris said, before pointing to the fact that the errors they made were due to the difficulty in nailing a lap in a car that has taken the team to new heights.\n\"The car is extremely quick. And when you put it together, it's unbelievable. It's just difficult to put it together. So really it was like a little fight between me and Oscar today, and it was a tough one.\"\nMax Verstappen retired with a brake failure after just four laps of last year's race in Melbourne\nVerstappen might have been pleasantly surprised to be best of the rest, but the 0.385secs margin between him and Norris, while perhaps expected, will have been less palatable.\nFor his team, though, there are concerns on more than one level. On top of the apparent gap to McLaren, there was the performance of their new recruit Liam Lawson.\nAfter paying off Sergio Perez to leave just seven months after being given a new two-year contract, the last thing Red Bull will have wanted to see was Lawson more than 0.6secs off Verstappen on the first day's practice.\nLawson was then hit with an engine problem that robbed him of the entire final session on Saturday. In that context, it was no surprise that he should struggle in qualifying.\nEven so, a first lap a second off Verstappen, and a mistake on his second - putting him on to the grass and down in 18th on the grid - was not a good start.\nLawson is two places behind 18-year-old Italian Andrea Kimi Antonelli, Hamilton's replacement at Mercedes. Antonelli, who will become the third youngest driver to start an F1 race on Sunday, had his qualifying compromised by damage to the floor of his car. The other Mercedes of George Russell will start alongside Verstappen in fourth.\nThere was an impressive performance from another rookie, Gabriel Bortoleto in the Sauber, a bad start to his first full season for Haas' British novice Oliver Bearman, and promise from Fernando Alonso in the Aston Martin that was not delivered when an off in the second session damaged his floor.\nHow to follow Australian Grand Prix on the BBC\nMany would want a straightforward first race of the season. But Albert Park has a habit of throwing up curveballs, and it seems the weather may oblige on Sunday, with rain predicted.\n\"It's a new car,\" Norris said. \"So there are a lot of unknowns and question marks about how it will perform. It's not always as simple as just putting on wets and having a crack.\n\"A bit of our pace potentially goes out of the window because it's harder to extract and show the difference of pace we had today. But we're in the best position to do that if we can. I know the chances of rain have been going down, but normally wet races and inter races are pretty exciting.\"\nWhat he did not mention is that the rain brings Verstappen - who would not expect to match the McLarens in a dry race - right into the picture.\nStella was less reticent.\n\"The only thing I can say about Max in the wet is that he is mega,\" he said. \"He can be a significant threat.\"\nHamilton, too, has made a reputation for being special when it rains. But his circumstances mean he will not be treating it with the usual smile.\n\"The wet has often been something I have enjoyed,\" Hamilton said. \"So it's a comfort zone for me but I am going out for the first time in the wet in an uncomfortable position because I have never driven this car.\n\"It is going to be a shock to the system when I first get out there, but I will be learning on the fly and giving it everything.\"\nBritish driver Nigel Mansell won his first race for Ferrari, at the 1989 Brazilian Grand Prix.

Poland is ready to host this nuclear weapon.\"\nPresident Duda also welcomed proposals made by France's president, Emmanuel Macron, to extend the French nuclear weapons umbrella to other Nato states.\nThe US already rotates about 10,000 troops at a time through Poland. \nWhen asked how the presence of nuclear weapons would make Poland safer, Mr Duda said it would deepen America's commitment to Polish security.\n\"Every strategic kind of infrastructure, American and Nato infrastructure, which we have on our soil is strengthening the inclination of the US and the North Atlantic Alliance to defend this territory.\"\nPoland spends almost 5% of its national income on defence. That is more than any other member of Nato, including the United States.\nLast week, Poland's prime minister, Donald Tusk, made a speech in parliament warning that a \"profound change in American geopolitics\" was putting both Poland and Ukraine into an \"objectively more difficult situation\".\nPrime Minister Tusk called for further increases in Polish defence spending and proposed that Poland should consider reaching for \"opportunities related to nuclear weapons.\"\nMr Tusk is on the centre left, unlike President Duda who is on the right and considers himself a friend of Donald Trump. \nReferring to President Putin's refusal on Thursday to agree immediately to the 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, Mr Duda said he was confident that the US president had a plan, as he put it, to \"to encourage the Russian side to act reasonably\".\nMr Duda will not criticise Mr Trump nor accept that his actions and words have cast a doubt on the US commitment to Article 5, the mutual defence clause of the North Atlantic Treaty. \nBut he has much harsher words for Putin's Russia than Donald Trump ever uses.\nAnd he backs calls for the EU to seize Russian assets worth around 200 billion euros that have been frozen in European banks.\n\"I believe it is obvious that Russian assets collected and locked in banks in Western Europe should be used to support Ukraine, and it should be a double support,\" he says.\n\"First of all, Ukraine should be supported in defending itself against the Russian aggression. And secondly, this should be used to support the rebuilding of Ukraine.\"\n\"I cannot imagine that after the destruction of Ukraine, Russia can simply take this money away without paying war reparations and compensation.\"",

        "article_text": "Tens of thousands of people have descended on Serbia's capital to protest against the deaths of 15 people in a railway station collapse.\nThe government has put attendance at 107,000 across Belgrade. Organisers and independent monitors have yet to give their estimates. \nEither way, it probably ranks as the largest demonstration Serbia has ever seen.\nThe Novi Sad collapse last November has galvanised anger towards the government and President Aleksandar Vucic. Demonstrators blame corruption and corner-cutting for the loss of life.\nThey believe the disaster reflects more than a decade of governing by the Progressive Party of Vucic - who closely associated himself with the station's recent renovation.\nDespite multiple resignations - and Vucic's insistence that he is going nowhere - the protests have only continued to grow.\n\"We just want a country that works,\" law student Jana Vasic told the BBC in the growing crowd in Belgrade.\n\"We want institutions that do their jobs properly. We don't care what party is in power. But we need a country that works, not one where you don't get justice for more than four months.\"\nRepublic Square - just one of the four meeting points around Serbia's capital for the \"15th for 15\" protest - was full to overflowing on Saturday.\nSome took refuge on the plinth of Prince Mihajlo's statue - the traditional spot for Belgraders to meet, the equivalent of Eros in London's Piccadilly. \nOthers queued up along the road in front of the National Museum, stretching all the way back to Students' Square.\nThe other meeting points were every bit as crowded ahead of the planned rendezvous in front of the National Assembly.\nWhile the protests over the Novi Sad collapse began with students, they have been joined by taxi drivers, farmers and lawyers.\nAhead of the big protest, motorbike riders pulled up outside the National Assembly, facing off against the tractors surrounding a camp of pro-government counter-protesters. \nThen a parade of military veterans received a rousing welcome. They said they would make a citizen's arrest on anyone who attacked the students.\nThe students have been calling for full transparency and accountability over the collapse of a concrete and glass canopy at the station in Serbia's second city, which was renovated and only reopened - by Vucic - in 2022.\nThey want the government to publish all the documentation relating to the renovation project and say they are not satisfied with the papers the authorities have released so far.\nThey also want those responsible for the disaster to be charged and convicted. Prosecutors have indicted at least 16 people, including former construction minister Goran Vesic. \nBut the charges have yet to go to trial. And the students insist they will continue with their protests until the authorities meet all their demands.\n\"We're making progress,\" a student representing Belgrade University's philosophy faculty told the BBC. \"But at this point none of our demands have been met completely.\"\n\"A couple of politicians have resigned from their offices,\" noted another. \"But they weren't fired. We're yet to see anything but empty promises\".\nPrime Minister Milos Vucevic announced his resignation at the end of January. But that has yet to be ratified by the National Assembly and he remains in his post.\nBut the real power in Serbia lies with Vucic, who insists that he is going nowhere.\n\"I don't give in to blackmail,\" he told a media conference on the eve of the big protest. \"I won't allow the street to pave a horrible future for this country.\"\nVucic described the student protests as \"well-intentioned\". But he had less flattering words for opposition parties, labelling them members of a \"criminal cartel\". He accused them of attempting to force the formation of a \"fraudulent interim government\".\nBorko Stefanovic does not deny that the opposition parties are looking for the establishment of a \"government of experts\".\nThe deputy president of the Party of Freedom and Justice describes it as the \"only rational way out\" of the political crisis, which would establish the conditions for fresh elections. \nLike other opposition leaders, Stefanovic says that free elections are not currently possible due to the Progressive Party's domination of the media and state institutions.\nBut this is not one of the students' demands. They are simply calling for the truth behind the Novi Sad disaster to be established.\nAs law professor Miodrag Jovanovic puts it \"they are asking for the things I've been lecturing about - the rule of law, respect for the constitution, and the responsibility and accountability of public officials\".\nWhatever happens during the \"15th for 15\" protest, it seems unlikely that the students will relent until they receive some satisfactory answers.",

        "article_text": "The record for a single trip into space currently stands at 437 days, but prolonged periods in orbit can alter an astronaut's body in some surprising ways, changing their muscles, brains and even their gut bacteria.\nAstronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore never intended to stay for nine months. Their initial trip to the International Space Station onboard the Boeing Starliner spacecraft was scheduled to be just eight days in June 2024. But after technical problems with the spacecraft meant it had to return to Earth without them, their stay in space has been longer than expected.\u00a0\nOf course, neither are new to the rigours of space travel. They are both experienced astronauts. But any extended time in the strange, low gravity environment of space is likely to have affected their bodies. To understand how, we need to look at those who have stayed for longer.\u00a0\nThe longest single spaceflight by an American to date was by Nasa astronaut Frank Rubio after he spent 371 days\u00a0living aboard the\u00a0American-football-field-sized collection of modules and solar panels that make up the ISS.\nHis time in orbit \u2013 which surpassed the previous US record of 355 consecutive days \u2013 was extended in March 2023 after the spacecraft he and his crewmates had been due to fly home in developed a coolant leak. He eventually came home in October 2023. The extra months in space allowed Rubio to clock up a total of 5,963 orbits around the Earth, travelling 157.4 million miles (253.3 million km).\nEven so, he was still around two months short of the record for the longest ever spaceflight by a human \u2013 Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov spent 437 days onboard the Mir Space Station in the mid 1990s.\nAnd in September 2024, two Russian cosmonauts \u2013 Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub \u2013 broke the record for the longest stay on the ISS after spending 374 days in orbit. The pair departed the ISS in the Soyuz MS-25 spacecraft along with US astronaut Tracy Dyson, who had spent six months onboard. With a huge grin on his face, Kononenko gave a double thumbs up as he was helped from the re-entry capsule after it bumped back to Earth in a cloud of dust near the remote town of Dzhezkazgan on the Kazakhstan Steppe. He now also holds the record for the longest cumulative time in space \u2013 a total of 1,111 days in orbit.\nKononenko and Chub travelled more than 158 million miles during their 5,984 orbits of the Earth in the latest mission to the ISS. But spending so much time in the low gravity environment of the space station took a toll on their bodies, so they had to be lifted out of the capsule by the recovery teams.\nRubio's own extended trip in space provided valuable insights into how humans can cope with long-duration spaceflight and how best to counteract the problems it can present. He is the first astronaut to participate in\u00a0a study examining how exercising with limited gym equipment can affect the human body.\nWhile the results have yet to be published, it is information that will prove vital as humans set their sights on sending crews on missions to explore deeper into the Solar System. A return journey to Mars, for example, is\u00a0expected to take around 1,100 days\u00a0(just over three years) under current plans. The spacecraft they will travel in will be far smaller than the ISS, meaning smaller lightweight exercise devices will be needed.\nBut problems keeping fit aside, just what does spaceflight do to the human body?\nMuscles and bones\nWithout the constant tug of gravity on our limbs, muscle and bone mass quickly begins to diminish in space. The most affected are those\u00a0muscles that help to maintain our posture\u00a0in our back, neck, calves and quadriceps \u2013 in microgravity they no longer have to work nearly as hard and begin to atrophy. After just two weeks\u00a0muscle mass can fall by as much as 20%\u00a0and on longer missions of three-to-six months it can fall by 30%.\nSimilarly, because astronauts are not putting their skeletons through as much mechanical strain as they do when subject to Earth's gravity, their bones also start to demineralise and lose strength. Astronauts can lose 1-2% of their bone mass every month they spend in space and up to 10% over a six-month period (on Earth, older men and women lose bone mass at a rate of 0.5%-1% every year). This can increase their risk of suffering fractures and increase the amount of time it takes to heal. It can take up to four years for their bone mass to return to normal after returning to Earth.\nTo combat this, astronauts undertake 2.5 hours a day of exercise and intense training while in orbit on the ISS. This includes a series of squats, deadlifts, rows and bench presses using a resistive exercise device installed in the ISS's \"gym\", alongside regular bouts tethered to a treadmill and on an exercise bike. They also take diet supplements to help keep their bones as healthy as possible.\nA recent study, however, highlighted that even this exercise regime was not enough to prevent losses in muscle function and size. It recommended testing whether higher loads in resistance exercises and high intensity interval training might help to counteract this muscle loss.\nThe lack of gravity pulling down on their bodies can also mean that astronauts find they grow a little taller during their stay on the ISS as their spines elongate slightly. This can lead to issues such as back pain while in space and slipped disks once back on Earth. During a briefing onboard the ISS ahead of his return to Earth, Rubio himself said his spine was growing and said it might help him to avoid a common neck injury that astronauts can suffer when their spacecraft hit the ground if they try to crane out of their seats to see what is happening.\n\"I think my spine has extended just enough that I'm kind of wedged into my seat liner, so I shouldn't move much at all,\" he said.\nWeight loss\nAlthough weight means very little while in orbit \u2013 the microgravity environment means anything not tethered down can float around the ISS habitat freely, including human bodies \u2013 maintaining a healthy weight is a challenge while in orbit. Although Nasa tries to ensure its astronauts have a diverse range of nutritious foods, including most recently a few salad leaves grown on board the space station, it can still affect an astronaut's body. Scott Kelly, a Nasa astronaut who took part in the most extensive study of the effects of long-term spaceflight after staying onboard the ISS for 340 days while his twin brother stayed back on Earth, lost 7% of his body mass while in orbit.\nEyesight\nOn Earth, gravity helps to force the blood in our bodies downward while the heart pumps it up again. In space, however, this process becomes messed up (although the body does adapt somewhat), and blood can accumulate in the head more than it normally would. Some of this fluid can pool at the back of the eye and around the optic nerve, leading to oedema. This can lead to changes in vision such as decreased sharpness and structural changes in the eye itself. These changes can start to occur after just two weeks in space but as that time goes on, the risk increases. Some of the vision changes reverse within about a year of astronauts returning to Earth, but others can be permanent.\nExposure to galactic cosmic rays and energetic solar particles can also lead to other eye problems. The Earth's atmosphere helps to protect us from these but once in orbit on the ISS, this protection disappears. While spacecraft can carry shielding to help keep out excess radiation, astronauts onboard the ISS have reported seeing flashes of light in their eyes as cosmic rays and solar particles hit their retina and optical nerves.\nNeural shuffling\nAfter his long stay on the ISS, however, Kelly's cognitive performance was found to have changed little and had remained relatively the same as his brother's on the ground. However, researchers did notice that the speed and accuracy of Kelly's cognitive performance did decrease for around six months after he landed, possibly as his brain readjusted to the Earth's gravity and his very different lifestyle back home.\nA study on a Russian cosmonaut who spent 169 days on the ISS in 2014 also revealed some changes to the brain itself seem to occur while in orbit. It found there were changes in the levels of neural connectivity in parts of the brain relating to motor function \u2013 in other words, movement \u2013 and also in the vestibular cortex, which plays an important role in orientation, balance and perception of our own motion. This is perhaps unsurprising given the peculiar nature of weightlessness while in space; astronauts often have to learn how to move efficiently without gravity to anchor them to anything and adjust to a world where there is no up or down.\nA more recent study has raised concerns about other changes in brain structure that can occur during long-term space missions. Cavities in the brain known as the right lateral and third ventricles (responsible for storing cerebrospinal fluid, providing nutrients to the brain and disposing of waste) can swell and take up to three years to shrink back to normal size.\nFriendly bacteria\nIt is apparent from research in recent years that a significant key to good health is the make up and diversity of the microorgansims that live in and on our bodies. This microbiota can influence how we digest food, affect the levels of inflammation in our bodies and even alter the way our brains work.\nResearchers examining Kelly after his trip to the ISS found that the bacteria and fungi living in his gut had altered profoundly compared to before he flew into space. This is perhaps not entirely surprising, given the very different food he was eating and the change in the people he spent his days with (we obtain a horrifying amount of gut and oral microorganisms from the people we live alongside). But exposure to radiation and the use of recycled water, along with changes to his physical activity could all also have played a role. (Find out more about how exercise affects your gut microbes.)\nSkin\nAlthough there have now been five Nasa astronauts who have spent more than 300 days in orbit, we have Kelly to thank again for insights into how his skin fared while in orbit. His skin was found to have heightened sensitivity and a rash for around six days after he returned from the space station. Researchers speculated that a lack of skin stimulation during the mission may have contributed to his skin complaint.\nGenes\n\nOne of the most significant findings from Kelly's prolonged journey into space were the effects it had on his DNA. At the end of each strand of DNA are structures known as telomeres, which are thought to help protect our genes from damage. As we age, these get shorter, but research on Kelly and other astronauts has revealed that space travel seems to alter the length of these telomeres.\n\"Most striking, however, was the finding of significantly longer telomeres during spaceflight,\" says Susan Bailey, a professor of environmental and radiological health at Colorado State University who was part of the team studying Kelly and his brother. She has done separate studies with another 10 unrelated astronauts who have taken part in shorter missions of around six months. \"Also unexpected was that telomere length shortened rapidly on return to Earth for all crewmembers. Of particular relevance to long-term health and ageing trajectories, astronauts in general had many more short telomeres after spaceflight than they did before.\"\nExactly why this happens is still being unravelled, she says. \"We have some clues, but additional long-duration crewmembers \u2013 like Rubio, who spent one year in space \u2013 will be critical to really characterising and understanding this response and its potential health outcomes.\"\nOne possible cause could be exposure to the complex mix of radiation while in space. Astronauts who experience long-term exposure while in orbit show signs of DNA damage, she says.\nThere were also some changes in gene expression \u2013 the mechanism that reads the DNA to produce proteins in cells \u2013 seen in Kelly that may have been related to his journey into space. Some of these related to the body's response to DNA damage, bone formation and the immune system's response to stress. Most of these changes, however, had returned to normal within six months of his return to Earth.\nIn June 2024, a new study highlighted some potential differences between the way the immune systems of male and female astronauts respond to spaceflight. Using gene expression data from samples obtained from the crew of the SpaceX Inspiration 4 mission, who spent just under three days in orbit in the autumn of 2021, it identified changes in 18 proteins related to the immune system, ageing and muscle growth.\nComparing their gene activity to those of 64 other astronauts on previous missions, the study found in the expression of three proteins that play a role in inflammation compared to before the flight. The men tended to be more sensitive to spaceflight, with more disruption to their gene activity and they took longer to return to a normal state after returning to Earth.\nIn particular, the researchers found the gene activity of two proteins known as interleukin-6, which helps to control levels of inflammation in the body, and interleukin-8, which is produced to gulde immune cells to sites of infection, were more affected in the men compared to the women. Another protein, called firbrinogen, which is involved in blood clotting, was also affected more in male astronauts.\nBut the researchers say they still need to unravel why women appear to be less sensitive to these particular effects of spaceflight, but it could be related to their response to stress.\nYou can hear Nasa astronaut Peggy Whitson describe how her own time in space has changed her body in the video below. With an accumulated 675 days in space, she has spent more time in orbit than any other American, although the world record is currently held by Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who has clocked up 878 days in space.\nImmune system\n\nKelly received a series of vaccines before, during and after his trip into space and his immune system\u00a0was found to react normally. But Bailey's research has found that astronauts do suffer some decreases in white blood cell counts that fall in line with the doses of radiation they receive while in orbit.\nThere are still many questions to be answered, however, about what impact space travel can have on a bipedal, big-brained species that evolved to live on Earth. As researchers pour over Rubio's medical tests, blood samples and scans following his 371 days in space, they will doubtless be hoping they will learn more.\n* This article was originally published on 27 September 2023.

Lose then move on.\nThe Football Association provoked debate, and some criticism, by ignoring the claims of English candidates such as Eddie Howe in their succession plan post-Southgate, to go for the best man available regardless of nationality.\nThe strategy was clear. The long-term can wait while a proven winner takes charge and Tuchel's first England squad merely confirms it.\nThere is a nod to the next generation with the inclusion of versatile defender Lewis-Skelly with England short at left-back and Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers, who is 22, but there was the definite whiff of short-term targets in Tuchel's selection.\nHowever, the recall of Henderson is the most eye-catching example of Tuchel wanting experience for the here and now. He last played for England in November 2023 and missed out on selection for last summer's Euro 2024.\nTuchel described Henderson as a \"serial winner\" and this is what the coach has in mind as he plots a path to next year's World Cup.\nJordan Henderson's England career looked over when he was left out of Gareth Southgate's Euro 2024 squad\nAnd then there is the shock selection of Burn. \nA wonderful story, as Newcastle United manager Howe agreed, but a very late stage for any player to prove they are international class.\nBurn would be the oldest player to win his first England cap since Bolton Wanderers striker Kevin Davies made his debut against Montenegro on 12 October 2010 at 33 years and 200 days. The bustling forward was the oldest since 38-year-old Leslie Compton in 1950.\nIt is very much a case of going back to the past for the short-term future. Former interim boss Lee Carsley's last squad contained a total 627 caps, while this one has a tally of 664.\nTuchel is missing younger players who have been injured recently, such as Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, but is clear the German's reign is not going to be a slow burner.\nThe selection of Henderson and the return of Rashford demonstrates that Tuchel is prepared to start with a clean slate.\nHenderson's call-up came out of the blue after it looked like his England career was over when he, like Rashford, was left out of Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2024.\nThe former Liverpool captain had an ill-fated stint in Saudi Arabia before returning to Europe with Ajax, where Tuchel has clearly seen enough to recall him.\nTuchel appears to want Henderson as much for his influence off the pitch, saying: \"What he brings every time is leadership, character, personality and energy. He makes sure everyone lives by the standards and with character. He embodies everything we are trying to build.\"\nEngland's head coach has long been a fan of Rashford and wants to be the beneficiary of Aston Villa manager Unai Emery's repair job on the forward's career.\nHe said: \"I had a strong feeling we should nominate him, to push him to stay at the level he is at now not fall back into old routines.\"\nTuchel's words offer an indication that he realises Rashford had fallen by the wayside at Old Trafford but is also convinced the 27-year-old can offer much to his new England.\nHe clearly does not feel the same about Manchester City's Jack Grealish. He would have been hoping to make a comeback after also missing out on Euro 2024, although he has not figured regularly under manager Pep Guardiola.\nTottenham midfielder James Maddison is another who is, for now at least, consigned to the margins,\nTuchel goes with what he knows by recalling Chelsea's Reece James as he makes his return from another hamstring injury. \nHe was a key member of Tuchel's side that won the Champions League in 2021 and there is a potential opening at right-back with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, Kyle Walker, 34, and on loan at AC Milan, and with Newcastle United's Tino Livramento talented but inexperienced.\nThis video can not be played\n'When Rashford plays, he's one of the best'\nWatch The Football News Show on Tuchel's first England squad\nHenderson embodies everything we try to build - Tuchel\nTuchel has made no secret of his desire to utilise the natural physical aspects of the English style into his squad and this is in evidence with this selection.\nBurn, at 6 feet 7 inches, fits the bill, while Rogers combines raw power with natural skill and strong running. James also combines physical strength with great ability -and the squad has a very powerful look.\nTuchel was asked whether that lack of physicality cost England in previous tournaments.\nHe said: \"I don't think a lot is missing. Obviously a little bit is because we lost consecutive Euros finals and World Cup semi-final and quarter-finals. \n\"The feeling is a little step is needed to bring it over the line.\"\nTuchel's squad is sure to cause debate, especially in Nottingham, where Forest fans will feel Morgan Gibbs-White could have offered an \"X Factor\" after his outstanding performances in their tilt to reach the Champions League.\nThey will also offer up Callum Hudson-Odoi as an example of someone who deserves a return to the England squad after his rejuvenation, exemplified by his winning goal against Manchester City that puts Forest in such a wonderful position to reach the top four.\nEverton defender Jarrad Branthwaite, who won a full cap under Southgate, also misses out despite being in outstanding form since manager David Moyes returned to Goodison Park. He is included in Carsley's England Under-21 side.\nTottenham defender Djed Spence will have had his backers, while there is no place for Conor Gallagher despite his fine form at Atletico Madrid.\nTuchel resisted the temptation to include Arsenal 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri, who also goes into Carsley's squad.\nThis video can not be played\nHow Grealish needs 'confidence and love'\nThomas Tuchel gave a hugely impressive performance in front of the media after announcing his first squad.\nFrom suggestion he is intent on \"building a brotherhood\" in his England squad to talking about \"a parental vibe\" when handling Arsenal teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly, Tuchel was confident and comfortable in his new skin as England head coach.\nNo subject was off limits, apart from when he declined to reveal who his captain might be if Harry Kane was not available.\nTuchel was open, honest and clearly excited about the task ahead, although he admitted he was \"missing the smell of the grass\" and could not wait to get on the training ground with his new charges.\nThis is a coach who has been around the block with big clubs such as Borussia Dortmund, Paris St. Germain and Bayern Munich, while getting a feel and admiration for the English game and his players at Chelsea.\nHe is the quick winner the FA wanted with his appointment.\nNow the serious work starts with the World Cup his goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRashford returns as Tuchel names first England squad",

But when push comes to shove in those last two furlongs, when you've got to dig deep, this guy seems to have reserves of energy.\n\"And it's also mental. It's his heart. He just gets down, you know, when the going gets tough, the tough get going and that's what he is. He's tough.\"\nMullins has more than 200 horses in training, and over the past 35 years has trained some stars of the sport.\nBut he said Galopin Des Champs - affectionately nicknamed \"the good one\" by stable staff - will rank as the best of them all if he wins the Cheltenham Festival showpiece on Friday.\n\"I've had some wonderful horses here. If he does the treble, we'll probably have to give him that accolade, but until then we'll wait,\" said Mullins, 68.\nBut does he know how good he is?\n\"The more he wins, the more bigger he gets in himself,\" said Galopin's groom Adam Connolly. \"You'll be trying to wash him off and he'll be kicking and biting at you.

        "article_text": "As millions of people break their Ramadan fast, many believers around the world reach for a wildly popular dish tied to an unbelievable legend.\nOn a hot and sultry August evening in 2011, I sat at a table in my favourite restaurant in Kuwait City, facing the calm waters of the Persian Gulf, waiting for my iftar platter to arrive. The elaborate meal \u2013 consisting of fresh juices, stuffed dates, vegetable samosas, lamb pilaf, shish tawook (a marinated chicken kebab), local bread, coffee and desserts \u2013 was delicious.\u00a0\nYet, what still lingers on my tongue and in my mind more than a decade later isn't the delightful crunch of the samosa or the sapid juiciness of the shish tawook but the sweet taste of Om Ali, a simple-but-flavourful Egyptian dessert with a surprisingly dark history.\nFlash forward to 2025 and I'm standing in a small confectionery store in downtown Cairo, sharing another bowl of Om Ali, this time with my 12-year-old son, and I still can't stop drooling over the dish, despite having tried it in every Middle Eastern city I've visited during the last 14 years.\n\"A good bowl of Om Ali is unforgettable,\" says Nermine Mansour, a former Egyptian diplomat-turned-food writer and founder of the food blog, Chez Nermine. \"It is the perfect balance of flavours, textures and nutrition \u2013 the star of Egyptian cuisine,\" she adds.\u00a0\nOm Ali (also known as Umm Ali or Oum Ali) is a decadent bread pudding made from spice-infused milk, puff pastry, roasted nuts and sugar. Traditionally baked in a deep clay dish for about 20-25 minutes, it has a crunchy, caramelised coating at the top and a silky, creamy layer at the bottom, giving the dessert a unique texture. According to Mansour, the creaminess of the milk, the juiciness of the soaked puff pastry, the crunch from the nuts and the sweet earthiness of lent by the clay pot come together to give Om Ali a rare appeal, making it one of the most popular desserts in Egypt.\nWhere to find Om Ali\nAlthough Om Ali is available at all major cafes and bakeries in Egypt throughout the year, the variety and volume are staggering during Ramadan. Some of the best places to sample authentic Om Ali in Cairo are El Malky, Simonds Bakery & Caf\u00e9 and Nola Bakery.\nOm Ali is also a favourite across the Middle East, particularly during Ramadan and Eid celebrations when dessert consumption skyrockets. Earlier this year, B Laban, one of the fastest-growing Middle Eastern dessert companies, posted a video of Om Ali on Instagram and thousands of people quickly swooned over it.\n\"I get why Om Ali is so popular. It is affordable, easy to digest and can be prepared quickly using ingredients available at home, making it equally accessible to the rich and the poor,\" says Moustafa Omran, an Egyptologist and my local tour guide in Cairo. \"Despite the fame of this dish, a question always lingers in the minds of [Om Ali] lovers: who is Ali and who is his mother, after whom this dish is named?\" Omran points out, drawing my attention to the dessert's name.\nWith my mouth stuffed with soaked puff pastry and my mind going nuts over the creaming pudding at El Malky, one of the most famous dessert chains serving Om Ali in Cairo, I cannot help but agree.\nOm Ali, which means\u00a0\"Mother of Ali\" in Arabic, is an admittedly unusual\u00a0name for a dessert. Yet, what's even more unusual, as many Egyptians tell me, is that it is rumoured to be named after a murderer.\u00a0\nOm Ali was the first wife of\u00a0the first sultan of the Mamluk dynasty, which ruled Egypt from the mid-13th to early 16th Centuries. In 1250, her then-husband, Izz Al-Din Aybak overthrew the Ayyubid dynasty and established the Mamluk reign in Egypt, marrying Al-Durr, the last Ayyubid queen, to solidify his rule. The marriage was merely a political union and Al-Durr\u00a0had frequent disagreements with Aybak before finally deciding to murder him as he took a bath.\u00a0\nIn a bizarre turn of events, Om Ali decided to avenge her husband's death by beating\u00a0Al-Durr to death with wooden clogs. After killing\u00a0Al-Durr,\u00a0Om Ali instructed her cook to\u00a0bake something special to commemorate her success\u00a0and the eponymous dessert was allegedly born and named in her honour.\nAs surprised as I am to learn that Om Ali's origins may be rooted in murder and betrayal, deeper research reveals that the dish's origins are even more complex, and still baffle historians.\u00a0\n\"There are no historical records that tell us if the dessert Om Ali is connected to the murder of Al-Durr,\" says Dr Mennat-Allah El Dorry, a food historian at the American University in Cairo. \"Although we know for sure that Queen Om Ali killed Al-Durr, we do not have any concrete evidence linking the dessert to the murder\u2026 I have absolutely no idea how the narrative came about and how the dessert got its name.\"\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table\u00a0\"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nFurther, the oldest recorded recipe for Om Ali comes from a more recent 19th-Century Arabic cookbook titled Kit\u0101b nas\u1ecb\u0304h\u1ea1t al-an\u0101m f\u012b h\u1ee5sn al-t\u1ea1\u02bb\u0101m, which adds another layer of mystery to the dish's origins and nomenclature.\nYet, according to Mansour, the 13th-Century Om Ali narrative may hold some truth. \"Egyptians have eaten a thin phyllo bread called roqaq since ancient times,\" she says. According to the book The Pharaoh's Kitchen by Magda Mehdawy and Amr Hussein, roqaq has been a staple at Nubian banquets since the 3rd Century BCE. \"So, it is quite possible that Om Ali's cook used the leftover roqaq in the palace and baked it with milk and nuts to create the iconic dessert that we all love today.\"\nDespite the dessert's muddled origins, its connection to the killer of Al-Durr live on in Egyptian popular culture. Today, the name Om Ali is synonymous with good triumphing over evil \u2013 in this case, the unjust queen.\n\"We love it because of its association with the story of the victory of justice over injustice,\" says Omran. \"Also, we [Egyptians] love stories; therefore, this dish has gained immense popularity,\" he explains. The legend continues to endure in social media, food blogs and television, such as the 2004 popular drama series Abbas Al Abiad Fi Al Yawm Al Aswad, in which famous Egyptian actor Yehia El-Fakharany recounts the legend of Om Ali to his onscreen family.\u00a0\nThe popularity of Om Ali swells during Ramadan, as sugar-based desserts take centre stage in iftar meals around the globe, providing instant nourishment to a fasting body that has run out of glucose. \"In addition to sugar, Om Ali contains protein and calcium from milk, vitamins and fibre from nuts, and carbohydrates from bread,\" Mansour points out. \"That's why, [Om Ali] is a guilty pleasure you can easily justify. It feels like a warm hug in a clay pot filled with goodness,\" she adds. (A calorie analysis reveals that Om Ali has fewer calories compared to other Middle Eastern desserts like kunefe and baklava.)\nBesides, Om Ali is an easy dessert to make. \"It requires only simple ingredients found in every Egyptian kitchen,\" Mansour adds. Depending on the size of the iftar parties, this dish can be scaled up or down, making it a favourite among chefs and home cooks during Ramadan and Eid.\nOm Ali holds a special place in Egyptian cuisine because it is simple, nutritious and evokes feelings of warmth and goodness. \"The creaminess of the pudding, the crunch of roasted nuts and the story of the victory of good over bad \u2013 a bowl of Om Ali just feels right and makes me happy after a long day of fasting,\" says Omran.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "In pockets of the British countryside, it's possible to stumble across clusters of beautifully designed, Scandi-style cabins. These aren't a product of the latest trend for off-grid retreats, but were created half a century ago by a pair of Welsh architects, Hird & Brooks. How did they become gripped by crafting the perfect holiday home? And why were they so inspired by Denmark?\nBy the 1970s, John Hird and Graham Brooks had already won a slew of major awards for their sleek, modernist post-war villas across the Vale of Glamorgan in Wales. But the highpoint of their careers was the prefabricated timber cabins they designed in the 1970s and 1980s for holiday parks in Wales and Forestry Commission sites in Scotland, and the English counties of Cornwall and Yorkshire.\nFor Brooks, the cabins were an opportunity to distil his design ethos into its clearest, purest, most compact form, says Peter Halliday, co-author with Bethan Dalton of Cabin Crew: Hird & Brooks and the Pursuit of the Perfect Holiday House. \"He could do away with the tiresome necessities of domesticity that have to be accommodated in a conventional house, and focus on what really matters.\"\nProfessor Richard Weston, an architect and former Chair of Architecture at Cardiff University, echoes this. \"[Brooks] always said the holiday cabins were the highlight of his career,\" he writes in the book. \"They are a distillation of everything Graham stood for \u2013 the love of wood, the appreciation of proper architecture, the orientation of the Sun, and the feel for detailing and space \u2013 all stripped down for essential living.\"\nHird & Brooks were part of a worldwide boom in simple holiday homes. Many Danes and Swedes already spent their leisure time in cabins, or sommerhuse, along the coast or in forests. In 1960, Denmark had around 50,000 summerhouses. By 1975, the number had trebled, according to Cabin Crew.\nMeanwhile, the summer cottage (a close relation of the dacha) was becoming a staple of Soviet society in the Baltic states and much of Central Europe. Everyone, it seems, was at it, even the big-name architects. Le Corbusier, the grand master of modernism, created his Cabanon de Vacances in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin in the south of France in the early 1950s. And in the US, architect Paul Rudolph was behind a series of simple wooden structures on the Florida Keys.\nThe mushrooming of cabins in the UK was in part a result of increased car ownership from the 1930s, as well as the Holidays with Pay Act of 1938, explains Cabin Crew. The latter led to the construction of mass-scale seaside holiday camps equipped with prefab accommodation.\nHird & Brooks' cabins \u2013 some to be bought, others to be rented \u2013 drew on the duo's many study trips to Denmark, because Brooks was Denmark mad. \"His heroes were Danish architects, his reference points were the Danish architectural press, and his new wife helped him to embed a Danish design aesthetic into their everyday lives,\" the book explains.\n\"It was all about simple, intelligent design, woodland settings, and a close affinity with nature,\" Halliday tells the BBC. \"The entire Hird & Brooks team became fascinated, and were eager to apply the same principles here in the UK.\"\nThe firm completed their first holiday homes, for Bierwood near Tenby in Pembrokeshire, in the early 1970s. Timber-framed with exposed roof beams, these lodges were clad in pine match-boarding and had corrugated tiled roofs and Sun terraces. Inside, features included built-in beds and a galley kitchen. The colour pallet \u2013 a blue-grey stain on the exterior timber facings, and orange-red window frames and doors \u2013 was inspired by those Danish study trips.\n\"The clearest Scandinavian influence is the use of wood \u2013 from the big exposed structural beams to the cedar cladding to the built-in furniture to the little details like the wooden door handles and fitted coat hooks,\" says Halliday. He also cites the space-saving wetrooms, \"which were a complete novelty in the UK, and the wood-burning stoves, which were commonplace in Scandinavia but not available here, so the architects designed their own, and had them manufactured locally\". And for all the Welsh cabins, Brooks looked at the orientation of the Sun before positioning each cabin on its plot, so as to ensure that users could enjoy as much sunshine as possible \u2013 even if sunshine wasn't always abundant in Wales.\nLater, the Forestry Commission \u2013 a national organisation owning huge swathes of British countryside \u2013 brought in Hird & Brooks to design holiday cabins for its sites at Deerpark in Cornwall, Keldy Castle in North Yorkshire, and Taynuilt in Scotland. \"For the Forestry Commission cabins, it was all about imparting a sense of adventure,\" says Halliday. \"That was the intended function, and everything about the design reflects it.\"\nSome were A-frame designs, some were flat-roofed, and others had standard-pitch roofs. There was also some playfulness. Inside, the second bedrooms had a staggered stack of three bunks. \"High-level sleeping and play platforms offered views into the forest, and large slatted terraces with integrated benches blurred the distinctions between indoors and outdoors \u2013 all of which added to the sense of adventure the Forestry Commission was so keen to impart,\" write Cabin Crew's authors. Soft furnishings stayed with the distinctive red and orange colourways that the firm had introduced in earlier cabins.\nBy the end of the 1970s, there were at least 35 UK companies manufacturing or promoting kit-built chalets, and more than 350 holiday parks offering them. Meanwhile, on the continent, the Dutch modernist architect Jacob Berend Bakema produced designs for the holiday village chain Center Parcs.\nAt this time, the British cabin movement was in part a reaction against the \"white heat of technology\", a term used by Prime Minister Harold Wilson in the 1960s to promote science. Bruce Peter, Professor of design history at Glasgow School of Art, expands on this in the book's introduction. \"A growing environmental consciousness emerged, at least among the more politically progressive and culturally engaged. This manifested itself in growing interests in wholefoods, alternative medicine and natural living.\"\nAnd for Peter, with the benefit of half-a-century's hindsight, Hird & Brooks' holiday cabins \"appear very successfully to have withstood the test of time. Back in the 1970s, environmentalism was mostly considered to be a fringe concern, but, in recent decades, it has moved into the mainstream. The cabins' construction \u2013 using mostly natural materials in an era when synthetics were all the rage \u2013 now appears to have been highly prescient. And, with reasonable maintenance, their timber external finishes have tended to weather well.\" What's more, he writes, the type of outdoor-centred holiday-making for which the cabins were intended has also proven enduringly popular, at least among particular demographics.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0How ultra-traditional tweed found a new fanbase\n\u2022\u00a0How Scandinavian dressing can make us happier\n\u2022\u00a0How to transform your home with art\nA few factors coming together means that there is now a renewed interest in the cabins, Dalton tells the BBC. First, she cites the popularity of mid-century architecture and interior design, \"especially among those of us who grew up in the 1970s and 1980s. It evokes a nostalgic charm, reminding us of the spaces and styles we fondly remember from childhood.\"\nThen there's the \"tiny house\" movement, with cabin life appealing to people seeking a simpler, more minimal way of life, off-grid and immersed in nature. \"A cabin holiday offers a taste of that lifestyle without the full-time commitment,\" says Dalton. \"And, of course, in this digital age, people are always looking for an Instagrammable holiday image, and these cabins certainly have that covered with their striking red-painted windows and doors.\"\nSo perhaps it's no surprise that some of Brooks' cabins have endured. And several of them are still in the hands of the original families. \"For the most part, the cabins look to be in near-pristine condition,\" the authors write. \"Clearly, the owners like things the way they are.\"\nCabin Crew: Hird & Brooks and the Pursuit of the Perfect Holiday House by Peter Halliday and Bethan Dalton is published by The Modernist.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Parents who are worried about their children being on Roblox should not let them use it, the chief executive of the gigantic gaming platform has said.\nThe site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.\nBut its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.\nWhen asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"\n\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.\nResponding to the interview, Mumsnet boss Justine Roberts said parents on the forum had spoken of how they struggled to manage their children's use of Roblox.\n\"There are parental controls, and our users would urge constant parental supervision,\" she told the BBC.\n\"But we all know that with the best will in the world life sometimes gets in the way. \n\"If you've got multiple children you're looking after and things happen, and you probably can't 24/7 watch everything they're doing, even if you've got all your parental controls set.\"\nEllie Gibson - from the Scummy Mummies podcast - said Mr Baszucki's message risked sounding \"a bit of a get out\".\n\"It's much easier said than done, especially when all their friends are playing it,\" she told the BBC.\nUS-based Roblox is one of the world's largest games platforms, with more monthly users than Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation combined. In 2024 it averaged more than 80 million players per day \u2013 roughly 40% of them below the age of 13. Its vast empire includes some 40 million user-generated games and experiences.\nIn the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.\nBut Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.\n\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.\n\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"\nPlayers who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.\nIn November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.\nHowever, the BBC was able to create two fake accounts, one aged 15 and one aged 27, on unlinked devices and exchange messages between the two.\nWhile the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.\nWhen we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.\n\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.\nHe admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.\nWe also put to him some Roblox game titles that the BBC has discovered were recommended by the platform to an 11 year-old recently, including:\nWhen we asked whether he thought they were appropriate, he said he puts his faith in the platform's age rating systems.\n\"One thing that's really important for the way we do things here, is it's not just on the title of the experience, it's literally on the content of the experience as well,\" he says.\nHe insists that when Roblox rates experience, they go through rigorous guidelines and that the company has a \"consistent policy\" on that.\nMr Baszucki founded the platform with Eric Cassel in 2004 and released it to the public in 2006 \u2013 a year before the first Apple iPhone appeared, heralding the start of the smartphone era.\nMr Baszucki describes his younger self as \"less of a gamer, and more of an engineer\", and the pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution. But they soon noticed that kids weren't only using the product to do their homework.\n\"They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox,\" he says.\nThe name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.\nMr Cassel noticed some players \"starting to act out\" and not always behaving in a \"civilised\" way a couple of months after it launched, recalls Mr Baszucki.\nHe says the roots of building a \"trust and safety system\" therefore began \"very, very early\" and that in those earlier days there were four people acting as safety moderators.\n\"It kind of is what launched this safety civility foundation,\" he adds.\nBut despite attracting decent numbers, it was a year later, when the firm launched its digital currency Robux, that it really started to make money.\nPlayers buy Robux and use it to purchase accessories and unlock content. Content creators now get 70% of the fee, and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.\nMr Baszucki says there was some initial resistance among the leadership team about Roblox becoming more than a hobby for its players, with the introduction of a digital economy.\nRobux stayed, and the firm is now worth $41bn (\u00a331bn).\nIts share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.\nMr Baszucki compares his experience of building Roblox with how Walt Disney may have felt about his creations.\nHe describes his job as \"a little like having the opportunity he had a long time ago when he was designing the Magic Kingdom\", and is focused on Roblox's ongoing evolution into a Metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form.\nThey have also been public in their ambitions to eventually attract 10% of the world's gamers.\nAsked to describe Roblox in three words, he replies: \"The future of communication.\"\nWe finish our time together playing a couple of his favourite games: Natural Disaster Survival and Dress to Impress.\nWe use his account and he's constantly recognised by other players \u2014 but we still get smashed to pieces by a blizzard outside the Natural Disasters mansion.\nAdditional reporting by Ammie Sekhon\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the biggest developments in global technology, with analysis from BBC correspondents around the world.

That gave me motivation to [make sure] every game I play is my best to help my club and then give myself the best possible chance to be in the England squad.\n\"Once it comes around, that is my main ambition - to be picked in that squad.\"\nEngland face Latvia on 21 March and Albania three days later and sources have told BBC Sport over the past few weeks, Tuchel has spoken to more than 55 players individually on the phone.\nBranthwaite confirmed he was one of those players, sharing a video call as well as exchanging messages with the German boss, adding: \"It is nice to have that connection with the new manager and to know he is watching you play and lets you know how you have done.\"\nWhat to look out for from Tuchel's first England squad\nEverton have enjoyed a remarkable turnaround since David Moyes replaced Sean Dyche as manager in January, currently on a run of eight unbeaten games in the Premier League and losing just twice in all competitions.\nThe Toffees were just one point above the relegation zone after losing the Scot's opening game against Aston Villa, but a notable upturn in form has seen them move 16 points clear of the bottom three.\nThe side scored 15 goals in 19 league games under Dyche this season, but have since found their goalscoring prowess by netting 16 in nine under Moyes.\n\"When the old manager was here, we had the defensive structure and we still have that now - he brought that to us,\" said Branthwaite. \"When the new manager came in, he has kept that pretty similar.\n\"He has maybe added a bit more attacking threat and knowledge, we have kept the ball better as a team.

I think if you ask him now, he probably reflects on that as a pretty low point in his career, but also probably kind of the making of him because he certainly managed to develop some resilience.\n\"I've got nothing but good things to say about Gregor. I wanted him to be in the starting Scotland team from the second week of this Six Nations to be honest.

        "article_text": "Netflix's latest big-budget film The Electric State, starring Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt, is one of the most expensive movies ever made, and had some of the most scathing reviews in recent memory. But that doesn't mean it will flop.\nFilm critics haven't minced their words when delivering their verdicts on The Electric State.\nIt is \"a turgid eyesore\" and \"top-dollar tedium\", according to the Times. It's \"slick but dismally soulless\", declared the Hollywood Reporter, while the New York Times called it  \"obvious, garish and just plain dumb\".\nPaste pointed out its eye-watering budget, billing it as \"the most banal way you can spend $320m\". Warming to the theme, the magazine summed it up as \"one hell of an artistically neutered, sanitized boondoggle\".\nThere have been some kinder reviews. Empire said it was \"breezily watchable\" and worth three stars, while the Telegraph awarded four stars to the \"Spielbergian treat\".\nBut overall, its 15% Rotten Tomatoes score is a meagre return for any major film, especially one costing such a lot. The $320m (\u00a3247m) figure has been widely reported but neither confirmed nor denied by Netflix. It would make The Electric State the most expensive streaming film ever.\nCritics' opinions, however, have become more irrelevant in the streaming age. The bad reviews didn't stop The Electric State from going straight to number one on Netflix's chart after its release on Friday. \nIt fits into Netflix making star-packed, entertaining and escapist movies that often get panned by reviewers - but are watched by hundreds of millions of subscribers.\n\"I would love to say that what I've written and what other critics have written will matter, but I just don't think it will,\" says Digital Spy movies editor Ian Sandwell.\nSandwell awarded the film two stars out of five, noting that the action and visual effects are \"decent\", the robots are \"impressive\" and the finale is \"epic\".\n\"My main problem was they'd created this really impressive, visually spectacular world and then just told quite a generic seen-it-all-before story inside it,\" he says.\nBad reviews might have put people off paying to see the film if it had been released in cinemas, he says. \"But on Netflix, I think it will still be absolutely massive. I don't think bad reviews will matter at all.\"\nWhile a critic's job is to analyse a movie, \"audiences probably do just want a big, spectacular blockbuster to watch at home, with two massive stars\", he adds.\nThe Electric State follows Brown, Pratt and a succession of zany robots in an alternative version of 1990s America, where there has been a war between humans and intelligent bots.\nIt also stars Ke Huy Quan, Stanley Tucci and the voices of Woody Harrelson and Brian Cox, and is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo - who have made four Marvel movies, including the wildly successful Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame.\nThe Electric State is based on the graphic novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag, although some critics pointed out that Netflix had missed the book's point about the perils of a consumerist society addicted to technology.\nThe film is \"absolutely not\" value for money in terms of quality, says City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford.\nAnd it remains to be seen whether the film makes financial sense for Netflix, she says.\nThe streaming giant's most popular ever film, 2021's Red Notice, has had 231 million views, according to Netflix's measurements. \n\"The Electric State will be hoping for that kind of performance, just as a $320m theatrically released movie would be aiming to break box office records,\" Luxford says.\n\"The higher the price, the higher the target for success, even with a business model as opaque as Netflix's.\"\nRed Notice, an action-packed art crime caper starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, has a lukewarm 39% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes - but a 92% audience rating.\nOther recent Netflix hits have been lapped up by viewers more than reviewers.\nBrooke Shields' lightweight multi-generational rom-com Mother of the Bride has a 13% critics' score, Jennifer Lopez's AI action thriller Atlas is on 19%, Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx's family spy escapade Back In Action has 29%, and Kevin Hart's heist comedy Lift is on 30%.\nThey are enjoyable but forgettable - and easy to watch in the midst of potential distractions at home. The Hollywood Reporter described Atlas as \"another Netflix movie made to half-watch while doing laundry\" - summing up this new genre.\nIn December, N+1 magazine quoted several screenwriters as saying a common request from Netflix executives is for characters to announce what they're doing \"so that viewers who have this programme on in the background can follow along\".\n\"Electric State does feel like that,\" Sandwell continues, \"where there are just random big dumps of the characters explaining exactly what's happened, sometimes something we've seen recently, just in case you're not following along.\n\"But it does depend on the movie.\"\nNetflix does have serious and critically-acclaimed movies, too, of course, but they are often not such crowd-pleasers. Emilia Perez, which led this year's Oscar nominations, has not troubled the Netflix global top 10 charts.\nAnother critic, Gav Squires, says many of Netflix's films are \"very average\", but don't usually have such astronomical budgets as The Electric State.\n\"Netflix know what they're doing,\" he says. \"They know that people are probably watching on a second screen, they're not paying full attention. So when they're putting stuff out that costs $30m that people aren't really watching and is kind of average, I'm not too fussed about it.\n\"But when they're spending $320m on a movie, I start getting really angry. $320m would have paid the budgets for the last, I think, 10 best picture Oscar winners.\n\"And it just feels like really, really bad value for money at that point.\"",

Leah BurgessThe stages of a lunar eclipse pictured in County Wexford in 2019, and patched togetherBut there's a catch - as the Moon enters total eclipse, it will be setting in the west while the Sun rises in the east.This will wash out the deep red hue typically seen during a total lunar eclipse. \"By the time the moon is totally eclipsed, it will be practically daylight, so we won't see the blood moon that they will get in America. \"The first hour or so, when the first chunk is taken out of the moon, will be the best part,\" according to David Moore, from Astronomy Ireland.",

Text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app. Listen live on BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Radio 5 Live.\nInterim Wales head coach Matt Sherratt will find himself in an unusual situation this weekend.\nIn his final game in temporary charge, the English-born coach will be plotting the downfall of England when the two sides meet in the Six Nations finale in Cardiff.\nBorn in Gloucester within a drop-kick of the famous Kingsholm ground, Sherratt grew up in a household that was fiercely divided on rugby days between an English father and his Tredegar-born mother.\n\"I used to have to sit between my mum and dad to split them up and then I'd switch sides depending on who won,\" Sherratt joked.\n\"I probably went through the generations. In the 1970s I was probably wearing red a little bit more and then come the 1990s and early 2000s my dad's voice probably took over the house a little bit more.\n\"He's going to the game at the weekend and I've managed to change him I think [from England to Wales].

Family interest in tickets for this weekend's game has peaked even more.\nSherratt was emotional this week when asked about his final game in charge as he highlighted the role his family have played.\n\"The Cardiff boys will tell you, I have a wobble probably two or three times a season, as soon as it becomes about family it's pretty easy to go,\" said Sherratt.\n\"But I have loved it, I'm not going to hide away from it, it's something I'm proud of and enjoyed and so have the family.\n\"My son's main motivation is getting on the pitch afterwards. I had to knock on the door of the Scottish changing room so he could have photos with Finn Russell. \n\"He enjoys that and he's pestering me about trying to meet Fin Smith and Marcus Smith this weekend. I think he's more interested in his Instagram account.\"\nEngland's Marcus Smith returns as Freeman starts at centre\nWales bring in Roberts and Wainwright for England\nHawkins eligible for Wales after Scarlets signing\nMatt Sherratt has introduced some fun into training sessions during his time in charge of Wales\nSherratt has added positivity to the beleaguered Wales team with plenty of fun on show in the final training session before the England game.\nThere have still been two more defeats against Ireland and Scotland which has taken the losing sequence to 16. \nOn Six Nations 'Super Saturday' Wales have traditionally been in the hunt for Six Nations titles or Grand Slams. Now they are hoping to avoid a second successive Wooden Spoon.\nThe statistics are stark. Wales' most recent Test match victory came against World Cup pool opponents Georgia in October 2023.\nHaving been beaten in all four games of this campaign, Wales are bidding to avoid a 17th successive Test defeat, which would be the most for a tier one nation in the professional era.\nThey hope to miss out on an 11th Six Nations consecutive loss with the previous win against Italy in March 2023.\nWales are bidding to avoid a clean sweep of defeats in successive tournaments for the first time in their history.\nThe myth Cardiff provides home comforts has also been dispelled.

        "article_text": "As an engineer who flies into hurricanes for the US government, Josh Ripp is accustomed to turbulence. But the last two weeks have been far bumpier than he's used to.\nIn late February, the Trump administration fired Mr Ripp and over 800 recently hired or promoted staff at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration using a form email, part of ongoing cuts to the federal workforce.\nSuddenly, he and several other members of the elite Hurricane Hunters flight team were out of a job - until around 21:00 Friday when he received a second email. He was to report back to work in Lakeland, Florida, 12 March, it said.\nFor Mr Ripp, a retired US Navy officer who voted for Donald Trump, the confusion highlighted the dangers of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency slashing thousands of government jobs to cut costs without agency input.\nAs soon as this week, the Trump administration could consider axing more than 1,000 additional staffers at NOAA, according to BBC News partner CBS News. Those potential cuts, plus losses from previous firings and buyouts, would cost the agency up to 20% of its workforce, the New York Times reported. \nThe White House did not comment on additional cuts, but a Trump administration official said an \"extensive process was conducted\" to ensure \"mission critical functions\" were not compromised during the first round of dismissals.\n\"NOAA provides vital information to the entire country and we do it at a fraction of the cost that anyone else could do,\" Mr Ripp said. \"There's a lot of jobs out there that are very important. NOAA is a small agency. Every little bit hurts.\"\nThe cuts will not only harm government functions, staffers and weather experts warn, but they could disrupt the daily lives of Americans who rely on accurate NOAA data more than they know.\nThe data that powers Americans' smartphone weather apps and informs local meteorologists comes from NOAA and its subsidiary, the National Weather Service. Americans use it to decide what to wear, and whether to meet friends in the park or indoors. They rely on it during hurricanes, tornadoes or blizzards.  \nAirlines and federal aviation officials need forecasts to safely guide planes through the sky. Retailers use them to schedule customer deliveries. Shipping companies and fisheries in the Great Lakes rely on NOAA updates about ice conditions and algae blooms.\n\"People take for granted how accurate the weather forecasts are,\" said Andy Hazelton, a NOAA climate scientist who modelled hurricane paths and was fired in February. \"Forecasts are going to get worse because offices are understaffed.\"\nHurricane Hunters measure hurricanes from the inside, gauging their strength and paths. As a flight engineer for the P-3 aircraft, Mr Ripp ensures that the nearly 50-year-old planes NOAA uses are safe. Missions cannot take off without team members like him aboard.\nThe original staffing cuts would have limited hurricane flights, said Lt Kerri Englert, a flight director for the Hurricane Hunters -  also cut in February then reinstated. \n\"That means data doesn't get ingested into the models, and forecasting for those hurricane tracks and intensity will be less accurate,\" she said. A disruption would impact evacuations, money allocated for storm preparation and disaster response.\nAlready, local National Weather Service offices have scaled back lesser known but crucial work, due to cuts.\nFor example, scientific balloon launches from Alaska - vital to national forecasts because the location allows them to assess systems moving from west to east - were curtailed, weather experts told the BBC. Launches in New York and Maine also were reduced.\nNOAA spokeswoman Susan Buchanan declined to comment on individual staffing decisions, citing agency policy.\nBut, she said, \"NOAA remains dedicated to its mission, providing timely information, research, and resources that serve the American public and ensure our nation's environmental and economic resilience.\"\n\"We continue to provide weather information, forecasts and warnings pursuant to our public safety mission.\"\nSome of NOAA's long-term, climate-focused initiatives also face cuts.\nBefore he was fired, NOAA scientist Zack Labe studied using artificial intelligence to prepare for deadly heat waves. Others in his division, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, also were fired and their specialities make them difficult to replace, he said.\n\"People who were impacted were definitely the key people who were leading the development of the US weather models,\" Mr Labe told BBC.\nEven private sector weather companies rely on accurate NOAA and NWS data for their products.\n\"We operate on razor thin margins to keep costs low,\" said Ryan Hickman, owner and chief technology officer at AllisonHouse, which takes data from NOAA and other sources to create custom weather visualisations.\nFor AllisonHouse, NOAA is both a data source and a client.\nMr Hickman was particularly worried that the agency's radar and satellite services could be impacted. \"Nobody else has these satellite capabilities NOAA has,\" he said.\n\"Unless someone has a billion dollars to build a weather satellite and launch it into geostationary orbit, and have it sit there and read all this data, and bring it back down to Earth so that everyone else can see it and use it, then what are we doing here?\"\nThe prospect of more cuts alarms scientists and private businessmen like Mr Hickman, who believe they will strain the agency's maintenance of the complex and delicate instruments needed to produce real-time as well as future forecasts.\nNOAA's primary goal is to keep Americans informed about the future, in ways both mundane and urgent, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\"There is almost unanimous horror among people who really understand how this works,\" he said.\nHe feared some in the administration believe in a \"philosophy that not only can we not plan for the future, but we also should not even try to prevent bad things from happening.\"\nBack in Florida, Mr Ripp still doesn't know what the future holds.\nDuring his brief unemployment, he explored opportunities flying for a private firefighting company \u2013 and still would not rule out leaving NOAA. He remains angry that fellow veterans were caught up in the layoffs.\nHe backed Trump due to the president's commitment to the rule of law, he said, but now Mr Ripp thinks Trump is flouting the correct procedures for reducing the federal workforce.\n\"We're very good stewards of the money we're given by the government. We're not out here committing waste or anything like that,\" Mr Ripp said. \"If you're looking for government savings, NOAA's not the place.\"",

        "article_text": "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.\nMark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.\nHe had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.\nBut unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States. \nBut holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.\nAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.\nWith three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.\nThe son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. \nIn 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs. \n\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race. \n\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"\nIn 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.\nIn 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.\nAlthough central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. \nThat move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.\nHe is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.\nIn 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.\nInterest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.\nConfusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.\nUnlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.\nIn 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.\nBefore the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.\nIn the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.\nHe described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.\nThe Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.\nHis final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\". \nCarney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.\nFrom 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.\nHe was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.\nAlthough he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.\nAfter Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.\n\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said. \n\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"\nHe seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".\nThe Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.\n\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.\nThings changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.\nReports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.\nFreeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.\n\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\" \nStill, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. \nThe Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.\nThey have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament. \nHis team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.\nIn addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.\nHe is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\nOne of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.\nShortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.\nOn immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.\nHis biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US. \nThere are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre.

The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PMA simple guide to Canada's federal electionHow Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politicsEarly life and childhoodAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship.",

And for Ukraine and its Western partners. many of them are going to prove unacceptable or impossible to fulfil.\n\"We agree with the proposals to cease hostilities,\" he started positively, only to add: \"This cessation must be such that it would lead to long-term peace and eliminate the root causes of this crisis.\"\nNobody would disagree with the need for long-term peace, but Putin's idea of the root causes of the war revolve around Ukraine's desire to exist as a sovereign state, beyond Russia's orbit.\nUkraine wants to be part of Nato and the European Union - so much so, it is enshrined in the constitution.\nPresident Trump has already cast doubt on Nato membership, but Putin has repeatedly dismissed the idea of Ukraine as a state at all.\nAnd that underpins many of the nuances he sketched out.\nHe wants to stop Ukraine from reinforcing its army and replenishing its weapons supply - so there would be no more deliveries from the West. He wants to know who would ensure that was verified.\nFrom the start of this war, Putin has demanded the \"demilitarisation\" of Ukraine, which is anathema to Kyiv and its allies.\nIn essence, Putin is looking for security guarantees in reverse.\nWould Russia agree to halt rearming or mobilising its forces? That seems implausible and there was no hint of any concession on his part, as he addressed reporters in the Kremlin.\nPutin has just come back in bullish mood from the front line in Kursk, a Russian border region that has been partially occupied since last August by Ukraine.\nRussia has the upper hand in Kursk. Putin clearly feels he is negotiating from a position of strength and doesn't want to lose it.\n\"If we stop military actions for 30 days, what does that mean? Will everyone who is there leave the battle?\"\nRussia's defence ministry announced on Thursday that its forces had now taken full control of the biggest city the Ukrainians had managed to seize, Sudzha. Putin says all the Ukrainians have left is a wedge, so why would Russia stop now?\n\"If a physical blockade occurs in the coming days, no-one will be able to leave at all. There will be only two options \u2013 to surrender or die.\"\nThe same applied to the whole of the 1,000km (620-mile) front line, where he claimed the situation on the ground was changing rapidly, with Russian troops \"advancing in practically all areas\".\nThat is not the case, as most of the front is at a stalemate, even if Russia has had some recent success in the east.\nPutin believes a 30-day ceasefire would deprive Russia of its advantage and enable the Ukrainians to regroup and rearm.\n\"What are our guarantees that nothing like that will be allowed to happen,\" he asked rhetorically.\nAs yet, no mechanism has been offered to ensure that the terms of any ceasefire would hold.\nAlthough 15 Western countries have tentatively offered peacekeeping troops, they would only come in the event of a final peace deal, not a ceasefire.\nNot that Russia would allow that arrangement anyway.\nGiven all these \"nuances\", Putin appeared to be sceptical of how a ceasefire could benefit Russia, especially when his troops were on the front foot. His entire outlook was \"based on how the situation on the ground develops\".\nPutin was meeting Trump's envoys on Moscow late on Thursday, notably Steve Witkoff.\nWhatever happens in those talks, Putin knows that ultimately, his most important conversation will be with the president.\n\"I think we need to talk to our American colleagues\u2026 maybe have a phone call with President Trump and discuss this with him,\" he said.\nBut Putin was setting out his stall ahead of those conversations, with a message that the road to a ceasefire was littered with conditions that would be almost impossible to meet.",

        "article_text": "Mark Carney, an economist and political newcomer, has been sworn in as Canada's new prime minister, and delivered remarks vowing to \"never\" become a part of the United States.\nHe took office on Friday just days after being elected leader of the governing Liberal Party and amid an ongoing trade war with US President Donald Trump.\n\"We know that by building together, we can give ourselves far more than anyone else can take away,\" he said after the ceremony. \nCarney replaces outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in office for nine years, after a landslide victory in last week's Liberal leadership race. \n\"We will never, in any shape or form, be part of the US,\" Carney told reporters in Ottawa on Friday, referring to Trump's musings that Canada join the US as its \"51st state\".\n\"We are very fundamentally a different country,\" he said, later adding the notion is \"crazy\". \nHe declined to answer questions about the timing of Canada's next federal election - currently scheduled for October - but hinted he would move quickly to seek \"as strong a mandate that is needed for the time\".\nIn his first order as prime minister, Carney moved to end a policy that had been frequent attacked against by political opponents. \nHe ended the consumer carbon pricing programme - a key environmental policy under Trudeau that had become deeply unpopular in recent years amid high inflation. \nConservatives have criticised the tax, saying it raised the price of goods and energy for Canadian families.\nAt an afternoon cabinet meeting, Carney said his government will still take steps to fight climate change. An industrial carbon tax on large emitters remains in place. \nCanadians receive a rebate to offset the cost of carbon pricing and will get their final cheque in April.\nCanadian politics in recent months have largely been overshadowed by the trade war Trump launched after taking office in January - and with a general election on the horizon, Carney is expected to pitch himself as the candidate best equipped to take on Trump. \nHe previously held roles as governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, and of the Bank of England, and helped both countries weather major financial disruption. \nHe intends to travel to the UK and France as his first foreign trip as PM next week.\nCarney said he also looks forward to speaking with Trump. \n\"We respect the United States. We respect President Trump,\" he said.\n\"President Trump is has put some very important issues at the top of his agenda.\"\nCarney has promised to uphold Canada's reciprocal tariffs on specific American goods for as long as Trump maintains 25% universal tariffs on Canadian goods not  covered by the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) trade deal.\nCanada is dependent on trade with the US. Economists say it risks a recession if Trump's tariffs are fully imposed. \nSeveral of Carney's new cabinet members served under Trudeau, and in particular he kept on those who have been working directly with the Trump administration in recent months. \nThey including M\u00e9lanie Joly, who remains in foreign affairs; David McGuinty, who remains in public safety; Jonathan Wilkinson, staying on as energy minister; Dominic Leblanc, who has moved from finance to trade; and Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, moved from industry to finance. \nWhen the federal election comes, Carney's main rival will be Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre. \nBefore the the threat of tariffs, Conservatives enjoyed a 20-point lead in some election polls. Now polls are indicating a much closer race. \nSpeaking after Carney on Friday, Poilievre argued that Liberals do not deserve a fourth term in office, arguing adding they have already had nine years to improve affordability and other issues in the country.\n\"It will be the same Liberal results,\" he said. \nPoilievre added that if he were to be elected prime minister, he would \"face off against President Trump directly, respond with counter tariffs and take back control\".\nWhen Canadians next go to the polls, the Liberals will face not only the Conservatives - who are the official opposition with 120 seats in the House of Commons - but also the Bloc Quebecois, who have 33 seats, and the New Democrats (NDP), who have 24.\nReacting to Carney's swearing in, the leader of the NDP argued that his cabinet appointments show that there is no room for progressive Liberals under his leadership. \nJagmeet Singh said that he had failed to create separate cabinet portfolios for minister of women, youth, or people with disabilities, and described Carney as someone who has made billionaires \"very rich at the cost of workers\".",

For everyone, or for the majority of people watching, looking at it afterwards, everyone felt like it was a rugby incident which was really unfortunate.\n\"No player goes out to injure another player, it just doesn't happen.

I think it could have been a different discussion, a different platform to air those frustrations that maybe France had.\n\"We and World Rugby and the Six Nations believe there was no case to answer and certainly it didn't help, it almost sort of fanned the flames of what was a really unfortunate incident.\n\"But it was a rugby incident and that's the bottom line. Unfortunately, these things happen.\"\nEasterby was speaking after restoring Jack Crowley as Ireland's starting fly-half for Saturday's final Six Nations encounter with Italy in Rome.\nCrowley, who has been second-choice behind Sam Prendergast recently, returns amid reports linking him, external with a move to English Premiership side Leicester Tigers when his Munster deal expires in the summer. \nEasterby, however, is \"confident\" the 25-year-old will remain in Ireland. \n\"Jack knows how important he is to us,\" said Easterby, who added he does not think speculation will affect Crowley's performance on Saturday. \n\"Regardless of selection across the last four games, he understands the role that he has and the standing he has in the group. \n\"He's a brilliant person first and foremost. He's a great pro, he's always looking to get better.\n\"We believe that for him to keep getting better, to keep getting experiences at this level and keep driving us forward as a team and being competitive in the number 10 position in particular, it's important that he plays his rugby in Ireland and we're confident that will continue to happen.\"\nThis video can not be played\nKidnapping their dads, crazy tattoos & hairy shoulders\n2025 Six Nations permutations - who can still win?",

On Tuesday, the same faction took control of Adigrat, Tigray's second-largest city.Getachew Reda, president of Tigray's interim administration, has accused the rival group, led by Debretsion Gebremichael, of attempting to forcefully remove him from office.Getachew became Tigray's leader following a 2022 peace deal which ended two years of conflict in the region, which killed an estimated 500,000 people.Debretsion Gebremichael was previously the region's leader but over the past year, relations have soured with the man who replaced him.On Thursday, members of Debretsion's faction accompanied by armed soldiers took control of Mekelle FM radio station and the mayor's office in the city. Rival forces seize mayor's office in key Ethiopian town amid fears of new conflict  3 hours agoShareSaveKalkidan YibeltalBBC News, MekelleShareSaveAmensisa Ifa / BBCMekelle, a key city in northern Ethiopia, is still reeling from the two-year conflict A dissident faction of the main political party in Ethiopia's northern region of Tigray has seized control of key offices and a radio station in the regional capital, Mekelle, amid growing fears of a fresh conflict. Two close allies of Debretsion have rejected the accusation they are linked to Eritrea, and downplayed the possibility of another round of conflict.Speaking to BBC's Newsday, Getachew accused high-ranking Tigrayan military officers of attempting to orchestrate an \"open coup\".The tensions have sparked fresh anxiety in the region, which is yet to recover from the conflict that ended in 2022 after the TPLF and the Ethiopian government signed a peace deal.The agreement led to the creation of the interim administration, which is supposed to govern Tigray until regional elections are held.But delays in implementing the agreement have fuelled sharp divisions within the TPLF. Gunshots were heard on Wednesday night in Adi-Gudem, a town near Mekelle,  when forces from the dissident faction attempted to occupy a government building.The forces reportedly arrested the town's mayor and took control of the office.Getachew has suspended three generals of the Tigray Defence Forces, accusing the rival faction of trying to destabilise the region.",

        "article_text": "Deena Ghazarian had only been in business for a year when the trade policies of President Donald Trump's first term of office sent her company into a tailspin.\nIt was 2019 and her California-based firm, Austere, had just agreed to supply several big US retailers with its high-end audio and video accessories that are largely manufactured in China.\nThen Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.\nShe was forced to absorb the costs and for a while thought she would go bust.\n\"I literally thought I am going to start and end a business in less than a year,\" she says. \"I had spent all this time, money and effort, and to have something like this blindside you was shocking.\"\nThe firm pulled through, but like numerous other US businesses it now finds itself in a strikingly similar situation.\nSince returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.\nThe president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.\nBut the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.\nGoods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher. \n\"US importers have to pay these taxes not the exporters,\" says Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a North American trade body that represents more than 1,200 tech firms.\n\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"\nBusinesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.\nMeanwhile, 87% of US video game console imports came from China that year, 78% of smartphones, 79% of laptops and tablets, and two-thirds of monitors, says the CTA.\nWhile many American companies like Austere have diversified their supply chains away from China since Mr Trump's first term, countries such as Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam still do not offer the same manufacturing capabilities and expertise. \nAt the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.\n\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.\n\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"\nResearch suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.\nIn February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.\nMs Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.\n\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"\nDuring Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.\nInsiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.\nFears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.  \nFor the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute. \nHe plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.  \nThere is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.\nMs Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.\nShe hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.\n\"That might mean finding a more cost-effective way to produce the product or doing something completely different. It's frustrating I have to focus on survival rather than growing my business.\"  ",

        "article_text": "Disney's live-action remake of Snow White is set to be released in UK cinemas next week, marking the latest efforts by the film studio to revive a beloved old classic.\nBut the film, which stars Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot, has faced several issues throughout its production. \nThe movie is being released amid a debate about how the seven dwarfs are represented on screen, while Zegler has made headlines for critical comments about the original 1937 film.\nThe European premiere was held on Wednesday at a castle in Northern Spain, instead of a more traditional and high-profile location such as London's Leicester Square.\nThe debate around the film began making headlines in January 2022, when Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, an actor with Dwarfism, described the decision to retell the story of \"seven dwarfs living in a cave\" as \"backward\".\nDisney has used computer-generated dwarfs in the remake and said it would \"avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film\". \nBut this week, other actors with Dwarfism have said they would have liked the opportunity to play the roles. \nSpeaking to the Daily Mail, performer Choon Tan said the decision to use CGI was \"absolutely absurd and discriminating in a sense\".\n\"There really is nothing wrong casting someone with dwarfism as a dwarf in any given opportunity,\" he said.\n\"As long as we are treated equally and with respect, we're usually more than happy to take on any acting roles that are suitable for us,\" he added.\nAnother performer, Blake Johnston, told the newspaper that \"we have plenty of dwarf actors out there who are dying for roles like this\".\nHe said he also said he believed Disney had \"succumb to peer pressure on political correctness, which has now given top dwarf actors less work\".\nDinklage, who has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, criticised the film in 2022 during an interview with podcaster Marc Maron.\n\"I was a little taken aback by [the fact] they were very proud to cast a Latina actress as Snow White,\" he said, referring to Colombian-American actress Zegler.\n\"You're progressive in one way, but then you're still making that backward story about seven dwarfs living in a cave together? Have I done nothing to advance the cause from my soapbox? I guess I'm not loud enough.\" \nThe actor had previously spoken about the representation of dwarfism, saying it was \"bad writing\" to make it a \"dominant character trait\".\nIn a statement released after Dinklage's comments, Disney said they were \"taking a different approach with these seven characters\" and had made their decision to use CGI after \"consulting with members of the dwarf community\".\nThe film's European premiere took place on Wednesday at a remote castle in Spain, which was the inspiration behind the castle in the 1937 original animated film.\nZegler performed a rendition of original song Waiting On a Wish at the event on Wednesday evening in Segrovia, north-West of Madrid. \nMost media outlets were not invited to the medieval castle, and Zegler instead performed to a relatively small crowd.\nThe Los Angeles premiere, meanwhile, will be reportedly smaller than usual for a film of this magnitude, with the stars only expected to pose for photographs and speak to Disney's in-house crews. \nNews journalists have not been invited to attend the red carpet and therefore will not have the opportunity to interview the film's cast and creatives. \nHowever, the cast are taking part in a few select sit-down interviews with some outlets as part of a press junket which is taking place this week.\nThe debate about the seven dwarfs is not the only controversy which has surrounded the film, which has reportedly cost \u00a3217m to make.\nEarly in the film's production, there was controversy around Disney's decision to cast Zegler, a Latina actress, in the role of a character deemed to have skin \"as white as snow\".\nIt was part of a drive by Disney to cast a more diverse range of actors to play updated versions of some classic characters. \nHalle Bailey, a black actress, was cast in another recent Disney live-action movie, The Little Mermaid. Both actresses faced abuse online after their casting was announced.\nZegler also made headlines after she made critical comments about some elements of the previous animated film. \n\"The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so,\" Zegler said in 2022. \"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"\nZegler also called the original film \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power,\" adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"\nElsewhere, fans have speculated that there may have been a behind-the-scenes rift between Zegler and Gadot, who plays the wicked stepmother, because the actresses have opposing views on the Israel-Palestine conflict.\nZegler has publicly taken a pro-Palestine stance, whilst Gadot is Israeli and served in the country's army for two years. \nHowever, others have said rumours of a rift are misguided, noting Gadot and Zegler have appeared publicly together on several occasions, including when they jointly presented an award at last week's Oscars.\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the latest in a long line of classic animated Disney stories which have been remade as live-action films.\nOther recent live-action remakes the studio has produced include Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, Dumbo and The Jungle Book.",

        "article_text": "In pockets of the British countryside, it's possible to stumble across clusters of beautifully designed, Scandi-style cabins. These aren't a product of the latest trend for off-grid retreats, but were created half a century ago by a pair of Welsh architects, Hird & Brooks. How did they become gripped by crafting the perfect holiday home? And why were they so inspired by Denmark?\nBy the 1970s, John Hird and Graham Brooks had already won a slew of major awards for their sleek, modernist post-war villas across the Vale of Glamorgan in Wales. But the highpoint of their careers was the prefabricated timber cabins they designed in the 1970s and 1980s for holiday parks in Wales and Forestry Commission sites in Scotland, and the English counties of Cornwall and Yorkshire.\nFor Brooks, the cabins were an opportunity to distil his design ethos into its clearest, purest, most compact form, says Peter Halliday, co-author with Bethan Dalton of Cabin Crew: Hird & Brooks and the Pursuit of the Perfect Holiday House. \"He could do away with the tiresome necessities of domesticity that have to be accommodated in a conventional house, and focus on what really matters.\"\nProfessor Richard Weston, an architect and former Chair of Architecture at Cardiff University, echoes this. \"[Brooks] always said the holiday cabins were the highlight of his career,\" he writes in the book. \"They are a distillation of everything Graham stood for \u2013 the love of wood, the appreciation of proper architecture, the orientation of the Sun, and the feel for detailing and space \u2013 all stripped down for essential living.\"\nHird & Brooks were part of a worldwide boom in simple holiday homes. Many Danes and Swedes already spent their leisure time in cabins, or sommerhuse, along the coast or in forests. In 1960, Denmark had around 50,000 summerhouses. By 1975, the number had trebled, according to Cabin Crew.\nMeanwhile, the summer cottage (a close relation of the dacha) was becoming a staple of Soviet society in the Baltic states and much of Central Europe. Everyone, it seems, was at it, even the big-name architects. Le Corbusier, the grand master of modernism, created his Cabanon de Vacances in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin in the south of France in the early 1950s. And in the US, architect Paul Rudolph was behind a series of simple wooden structures on the Florida Keys.\nThe mushrooming of cabins in the UK was in part a result of increased car ownership from the 1930s, as well as the Holidays with Pay Act of 1938, explains Cabin Crew. The latter led to the construction of mass-scale seaside holiday camps equipped with prefab accommodation.\nHird & Brooks' cabins \u2013 some to be bought, others to be rented \u2013 drew on the duo's many study trips to Denmark, because Brooks was Denmark mad. \"His heroes were Danish architects, his reference points were the Danish architectural press, and his new wife helped him to embed a Danish design aesthetic into their everyday lives,\" the book explains.\n\"It was all about simple, intelligent design, woodland settings, and a close affinity with nature,\" Halliday tells the BBC. \"The entire Hird & Brooks team became fascinated, and were eager to apply the same principles here in the UK.\"\nThe firm completed their first holiday homes, for Bierwood near Tenby in Pembrokeshire, in the early 1970s. Timber-framed with exposed roof beams, these lodges were clad in pine match-boarding and had corrugated tiled roofs and Sun terraces. Inside, features included built-in beds and a galley kitchen. The colour pallet \u2013 a blue-grey stain on the exterior timber facings, and orange-red window frames and doors \u2013 was inspired by those Danish study trips.\n\"The clearest Scandinavian influence is the use of wood \u2013 from the big exposed structural beams to the cedar cladding to the built-in furniture to the little details like the wooden door handles and fitted coat hooks,\" says Halliday. He also cites the space-saving wetrooms, \"which were a complete novelty in the UK, and the wood-burning stoves, which were commonplace in Scandinavia but not available here, so the architects designed their own, and had them manufactured locally\". And for all the Welsh cabins, Brooks looked at the orientation of the Sun before positioning each cabin on its plot, so as to ensure that users could enjoy as much sunshine as possible \u2013 even if sunshine wasn't always abundant in Wales.\nLater, the Forestry Commission \u2013 a national organisation owning huge swathes of British countryside \u2013 brought in Hird & Brooks to design holiday cabins for its sites at Deerpark in Cornwall, Keldy Castle in North Yorkshire, and Taynuilt in Scotland. \"For the Forestry Commission cabins, it was all about imparting a sense of adventure,\" says Halliday. \"That was the intended function, and everything about the design reflects it.\"\nSome were A-frame designs, some were flat-roofed, and others had standard-pitch roofs. There was also some playfulness. Inside, the second bedrooms had a staggered stack of three bunks. \"High-level sleeping and play platforms offered views into the forest, and large slatted terraces with integrated benches blurred the distinctions between indoors and outdoors \u2013 all of which added to the sense of adventure the Forestry Commission was so keen to impart,\" write Cabin Crew's authors. Soft furnishings stayed with the distinctive red and orange colourways that the firm had introduced in earlier cabins.\nBy the end of the 1970s, there were at least 35 UK companies manufacturing or promoting kit-built chalets, and more than 350 holiday parks offering them. Meanwhile, on the continent, the Dutch modernist architect Jacob Berend Bakema produced designs for the holiday village chain Center Parcs.\nAt this time, the British cabin movement was in part a reaction against the \"white heat of technology\", a term used by Prime Minister Harold Wilson in the 1960s to promote science. Bruce Peter, Professor of design history at Glasgow School of Art, expands on this in the book's introduction. \"A growing environmental consciousness emerged, at least among the more politically progressive and culturally engaged. This manifested itself in growing interests in wholefoods, alternative medicine and natural living.\"\nAnd for Peter, with the benefit of half-a-century's hindsight, Hird & Brooks' holiday cabins \"appear very successfully to have withstood the test of time. Back in the 1970s, environmentalism was mostly considered to be a fringe concern, but, in recent decades, it has moved into the mainstream. The cabins' construction \u2013 using mostly natural materials in an era when synthetics were all the rage \u2013 now appears to have been highly prescient. And, with reasonable maintenance, their timber external finishes have tended to weather well.\" What's more, he writes, the type of outdoor-centred holiday-making for which the cabins were intended has also proven enduringly popular, at least among particular demographics.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0How ultra-traditional tweed found a new fanbase\n\u2022\u00a0How Scandinavian dressing can make us happier\n\u2022\u00a0How to transform your home with art\nA few factors coming together means that there is now a renewed interest in the cabins, Dalton tells the BBC. First, she cites the popularity of mid-century architecture and interior design, \"especially among those of us who grew up in the 1970s and 1980s. It evokes a nostalgic charm, reminding us of the spaces and styles we fondly remember from childhood.\"\nThen there's the \"tiny house\" movement, with cabin life appealing to people seeking a simpler, more minimal way of life, off-grid and immersed in nature. \"A cabin holiday offers a taste of that lifestyle without the full-time commitment,\" says Dalton. \"And, of course, in this digital age, people are always looking for an Instagrammable holiday image, and these cabins certainly have that covered with their striking red-painted windows and doors.\"\nSo perhaps it's no surprise that some of Brooks' cabins have endured. And several of them are still in the hands of the original families. \"For the most part, the cabins look to be in near-pristine condition,\" the authors write. \"Clearly, the owners like things the way they are.\"\nCabin Crew: Hird & Brooks and the Pursuit of the Perfect Holiday House by Peter Halliday and Bethan Dalton is published by The Modernist.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

She's probably one of the smartest businesswomen I've ever seen,\" Riley says. \nSwift is famously re-recording six albums after her former music manager Scooter Braun gained control of the master recordings.\nShe has said she saw it as a an act of aggression that \"stripped me of my life's work\". \nRiley said Swift's experiences showed her the importance of keeping the rights to her songs and gave her the confidence to explore other genres of music.\n\"You're na\u00efve when you're younger,\" says Riley, who was 11 when she was introduced to Swift's music by a school friend, inspiring her to write her own songs. \n\"You think 'I'll write the songs, I'll wear the dresses, I'll play on the stages and somebody else will handle the business aspect of things' but actually Taylor has shown me that's not the case.\"\nFollowing Swift's example, Riley worked hard and saved to produce her own music \"song by song, one by one\", while retaining the rights to them.\nSince starting her career at age 17, Riley has toured with fellow Scottish artists ili and Tide Lines.\nRecent trips to Nashville to collaborate and meet others in the industry have helped develop her career and the confidence to stay as an independent artist until the time is right.\n\"I used to hate the thought of being independent. It had a stigma attached that they're not good enough to get signed or they won't be able to do it,\" she says.\n\"When I realised what that word meant - that you don't need anyone and can accomplish things by yourself - I look back at my music that I've saved up song by song to produce, it was a ton of work but it's so worth it to see people listen to those songs.\"\nRiley's passion for music began after being introduced to artists like James Taylor and Joni Mitchell by her dad. Her grandmother gave her a book of poetry, leading her to write her own \"poems to a tune\".\nLike many teenagers, Riley enjoyed attending concerts but felt something different when she saw country artists perform.\n\"These country music gigs absolutely blew me away,\" she says.\n\"It had a hold on me and it made me realise I wanted to do that myself.\"\nRiley soon began to appreciate other country music artists - Ella Langley, Megan Moroney, Carter Faith and - to her, \"the Queen of everything\"- Kelsea Ballerini.\nFunding from charity Help Musicians was the key that allowed Riley to visit the country music city of Nashville and work on her new EP.\nThe EP even has nods to her hometown, mentioning Glasgow streets as well as a song dedicated to Maggie's Rock n Rodeo, a popular venue for country music fans.\n\"My song writing inspiration absolutely comes mixed from Glasgow and Nashville,\" she says.\n\"Glasgow feels a lot like Nashville to me. \n\"When I got to Nashville the first time, I phoned my mum and she asked how it was. I said it literally feels just like home.\"\nRiley is performing at King Tut's as part of the Country to Country festival on Sunday 16 March.",

        "article_text": "US tariffs on alcohol from the European Union have the \"potential to be devastating\", the Irish Whiskey Association has warned.\nOn Thursday, US President Donald Trump threatened a 200% tariff on all alcohol coming out of the bloc unless a \"nasty 50% tariff on [US] whisky\" is stopped.\nIt's the latest step in a global trade war, after the EU announced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imported in the US on Wednesday.\nThe body, which is in Washington for St Patrick's Day celebrations, said the escalation was \"extremely concerning\" and that a US-EU trade war puts jobs, investments and businesses at risk.\nIrish Whiskey has enjoyed a decade of spectacular growth with global sales more than doubling from 7.3m cases in 2014 to 15.6m in 2023.\nThe US is by far the biggest export market, taking 5.7m cases in 2023.\nThat trade is dominated by big brands like Jameson and Powers, but dozens of new craft distilleries have also been targeting the US market.\nIn a statement, the Irish Whiskey Association said: \"There is no winner in a trade war.\n\"The imposition of tariffs will impact on our businesses and our consumers. \n\"Having our sector implicated in this dispute puts jobs, investments and businesses at risk and has the potential to be devastating for Irish Whiskey.\"\nIt called on the EU and US to de-escalate, adding \"the need to remove spirits from this dispute is immediate, and the clock is ticking\".\n\"We note that there is no tariff currently in place, and now is the time for dialogue,\" the association said.\nTaoiseach (Irish prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin has called for the EU to adopt a \"strategic approach\" to the issue of US tariffs.\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, the taoiseach said the tariffs were \"very concerning\" for Ireland's spirits industry.\nMartin met with Trump in the White House on Wednesday as part of St Patrick's Day events in the US capital.\nIn the meeting, Trump accused the EU of acting \"very badly\" towards the US and that counter-tariffs create \"ill-will\".\nThe taoiseach added the only way to resolve a deepening trade dispute between the US and EU is \"through dialogue\".\n\"Tariffs increase inflation and are not good for the consumer and are not good for business, and that is our view,\" he said.\n\"But I do believe there will be some distance to go yet. There will be an EU Council towards the end of next week, and again, there will be discussions and consultations within the European Union in respect of European actions.\n\"And obviously, again, in that scenario, we'll be endeavouring to protect Irish interests in terms of specific Irish products and Irish sectors.\"\nBy John Campbell, BBC News NI business and economics editor\nNorthern Ireland's unique post-Brexit trading arrangements could give distilleries a way round Trump's threatened tariffs.\nWhiskey distilled in Northern Ireland is logically and legally Irish whiskey.

        "article_text": "Sweet, tangy and packed with probiotics, gira has long been a go-to winter tonic \u2013 and is now making a comeback in craft breweries and kombucha-style artisanal brands.\nWhen Tadas Eidukevi\u010dius was crafting his latest winter menu at Demoloftas in Vilnius, Lithuania, the Michelin-starred chef turned to an unassuming staple: the turnip. But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, Eidukevi\u010diusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it with gira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.\n\"I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things \u2013 it was a no brainer,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius. \"The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.\"\nWhile Eidukevi\u010dius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity \u2013 particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce \u2013 in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.\nDating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known as kvass across north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.\n\"Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,\" says Tomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. \"Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria \u2013 meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.\"\nA traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics that benefit gut health and immunity. In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\"When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick \u2013 consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,\" explained Ieva \u0160idlait\u0117, a cultural historian and the author of Naturally Fermented\u00a0who teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. \"In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,\" she added. \"Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.\"\nJosas agrees. \"Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus \u2013 like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,\" he says.\nThe early '80s is what Josas describes as \"the golden age of gira\" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.\n\"Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,\" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been \"hyped\" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.\u00a0\nOne of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira is Gubernija Brewery in northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Japan's ancient fermented 'superdrink'\n\u2022\u00a0The national park that draws mushroom hunters from around the world\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,\" says Jogail\u0117 \u010coj\u016bt\u0117, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. \"For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.\"\n\"In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,\" she continues, \"while export sales volume grew by 47%.\"\nGlobally, interest in non-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinks is soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods of Beaver Brewing Company in Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while at Honey's in East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.\nWhere to try Gira\nIn Vilnius, traditional restaurants like Lokys have kvass on the menu; it pairs incredibly well with a plate of smoked cold cuts. Elsewhere around the city, small batch gira made traditionally with bread can be found in health food shops as well as popular city bakery Kmynin\u0117, which uses its leftover sourdough rye.\nIn Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such as Three Mills Bakery in the nation\u2019s capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK, Northern Monk releases a seasonal kvass each year.\nWhile some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. \"It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,\" says \u010coj\u016bt\u0117.\nInstead, Eidukevi\u010dius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.\n\"Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,\" Eidukevi\u010dius adds. \"There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.\"\nSo, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. \"Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius.\"It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Miniature models of Belfast's lost theatres created by set designer Stuart Marshall are bringing the city's vibrant theatre history back into the the limelight. \nThey are part of an exhibition at Ulster University for the Children's Festival. \nMr Marshall told BBC News NI that the models, which are made from cardboard, have a cross generational appeal.\n\"Children appreciate the miniature dolls house type model making, adults appreciate the skill that goes into making them, and older people who may remember when some of these places still stood.\" \n\"It all started as a lockdown project,\" Mr Marshall told BBC News NI. \n\"I started working on a model of the Grand Opera House as part of the heritage exhibition and through doing that got interested in looking at all the other theatres that aren't about anymore.\"\nThe models are \"mostly made of different types of cardboard, like mounting card or coloured paper and then they're glued together\".\n\"The Hippodrome was the most complicated and detailed one I've made, it took me around six weeks to make.\"\nHe said he mostly works from old photographs, but it can be hard to get enough accurate detail because \"with a black and white photograph that you can't move around, it's basically static\". \nWhen photographs of the old theatres are not available or poor quality, Mr Marshall refers to old newspaper articles which sometimes have written descriptions of what materials the theatre was built from and how it appeared. \nOpening in the early 1870s, the Alhambra was Belfast's first music hall and was a \"real spit on the floor type joint\", according to Mr Marshall. \n\"In the early days, the Alhambra was more of a variety house, and I've heard that it wasn't the most enticing establishment, quite a rowdy place.\n\"The Alhambra didn't cater for the more refined clientele,\" he added. \nA typical bill from the early days of the Alhambra shows performances which \"would nowadays be contentious\" included events such as a minstrel show and a Japanese troupe. \n\"I've seen other things listed, which were more overtly racist, but that was kind of the way at the time,\" he added.\nTo adapt to the evolution of mass entertainment, the Alhambra converted to a full time cinema house in 1936. \nBetween the late 1800s and it's closure in 1959, the Alhambra suffered four separate fires. \nThe Theatre Royal was Belfast's original high-end theatre, opening in the late 1700s with a capacity of just over 1,000. \nThe building was demolished and rebuilt a number of times.\n\"As these places go, they kept getting burnt down or demolished and rebuilt again - there's always a renewal aspect to them.\"\nThe Theatre Royal was to be Belfast's \"higher class establishment\", which in the end became \"a mixed-use building of shops and place called the 'boom boom room', which was like a dance hall upstairs, which then became the starlight ballroom upstairs\". \n\"Now,  there's a little Starbucks in the corner where the building stood,\" he added.\nNot to be mistaken with the pub and music hall on Botanic Avenue, The Empire Theatre was situated on Victoria Square and opened to the public in 1894. \nAccording to Mr Marshall, the Empire \"operated at a similar time to the Alhambra from the 1890s up until the early 1960s, and then it was it was knocked down.\n\"It was eventually replaced by a Little Woods department store, which has been redeveloped again and again, until finally becoming Victoria Square shopping centre.\" \nWhile it did adapt to the growing popularity of cinema, The Empire \"stayed true to theatre for all of its life\", Mr Marshall said. \nThe Hippodrome was \"more fiddly [model to make] than some of the other ones\". \nMr Marshall describes how there aren't too many quality photographs of the Hippodrome, so he \"had to use his judgement\" when designing the model in terms of colour scheme and scale. \nComing quite late, the \"Hippodrome was was built in 1907 originally with a cinema in mind\" as to take full advantage of the advent of modern cinema and growing popularity of picture shows. \n\"And then there was the Ritz...\" which opened in 1938. \nThe Ritz was, according to Mr Marshall, \"a giant cinema more or less, but it called itself the Ritz Theatre\". However, it did produce shows as part of the night's entertainment. \n\"They would have a brass band, dancers or a ballet, and then a film at the end.\"\n\"It also did huge concerts, people like the Stones, The Beatles and Billy Connolly all performed at the Ritz during their time,\" he added. \nIt was the biggest in Northern Ireland at the time, with just over 2,000 capacity. \nThe Ritz was damaged by bombs hidden in the seats and the theatres interior and roof was destroyed in 1977. \nThe Belfast 'Young at Art' Children's Festival finishes on 15 March.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nHampson reflects on life-altering injury and life-changing influence\nMatt Hampson could not breathe by himself and was drifting in and out of consciousness when medics cut his England jersey off him.\nIt was half a lifetime ago that the now 40-year-old was in intensive care, having been left paralysed from the neck down when a scrum collapsed in a training session with the Under-21 national team.\nHe recalls the faces around him immediately after the incident, the \"shell-shocked\" looks, the sense of helplessness when he could not feel his arms and legs, and waking up in the back of an ambulance after \"blacking out\" before being resuscitated.\nHe was only 20 years old then. Now, 20 years on, the former Leicester Tigers prop remembers how it all felt \"so surreal\" when he was rushed to Northampton General Hospital.\nThe injury left Hampson only able to breathe through a ventilator and as \"bizarre and scary\" as that struck him at the time, he admits he was momentarily distracted from the life-changing chaos of it all.\n\"Having my England kit that I was so proud of being cut off me with scissors was a small trivial thing I was thinking of,\" Hampson told BBC East Midlands Today.\n\"I was so proud of playing for England with the rose on my chest, and then having that kit cut off me, I was just thinking of that rather than thinking of myself.\"\nHampson had started the day - 15 March, 2005 - by slipping that England shirt on as one of the nation's finest rising rugby union prospects.\nIt was with the academy at Leicester Tigers, a club renowned for developing forwards of fierce pedigree, that Hampson worked hard to gain that reputation.\n\"I wasn't a natural rugby player, but I wanted it, I was hungry for it and was passionate about it,\" he said.\n\"Rugby was my purpose and what I could do to channel my energy. I felt like it was my calling.\"\nHampson reflects on foundation's work as he turns 40\nI was too busy to die - Hampson\n'Get busy living or get busy dying' - Hampson reflects on injury 10 years on \nThat calling, however, was silenced in harrowing circumstances which sent him in a different direction.\nHe would go on to spend 18 months at Stoke Mandeville Hospital - home of the National Spinal Injuries Centre - and after that he said there was \"a lot of soul searching\" about what would come next.\n\"You are a rugby player, so to redefine yourself was massively important,\" he said.\n\"It was obviously a turning point in my life and initially I struggled to justify why it happened to me and why life would never be the same again. But now I understand.\"\nHe says this while at the Get Busy Living Centre, a state-of-the art facility that he is the driving force behind, which offers total support to those in a similar situation.\nThe centre, which is nestled among farmland outside Melton Mowbray in rural Leicestershire, is also home of the foundation set up in Hampson's name.\n\"I come into the driveway and see the foundation and centre and this is what it's all about,\" he said.\n\"This is why it happened. Realising how much support I had and how many people that I'd be able to help and influence, just through my journey and my story - to show people that there is a great life to be had in this situation.\"\nMatt Hampson was awarded an OBE in 2022 and received an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Leicester in January\nIt was the support that Hampson got after his accident that made him realise what could be possible.\nIn hospital he was visited by so many people that he ended up needing a booking system to stay on top of it all. As a high-profile injury that rocked the rugby world, there was also a lot of money donated to help him and his family cope.\nHe knew he was \"blessed\" to be in that position, but also saw that many were not so fortunate.\n\"It didn't just come to me straightaway,\" Hampson said of plans for his foundation and the centre. \"The trust fund was sort of thrust upon me where people were raising money for me. \n\"I felt very grateful for that and I felt that I needed to give something back. The natural progression for the trust was to turn into a foundation, a charity to help other people.\n\"The most worthwhile thing we can do in our life is to make an impression on someone else's life.\"\nHow many people the foundation and centre have supported over the years, Hampson can't put an exact number on.\nBut it is hundreds who have sought access to expert physiotherapists, specialist personal trainers, wellbeing support and other tailored healthy living advice at the centre.\nAccommodation has been set up there recently to help offer even greater levels of access, and there are further redevelopment plans for the site and aspirations to expand its reach with satellite centres around the country.\nSome people who have come through the centre have even gone on establish themselves as athletes, competing at the Paralympic Games. Among them are Nick Cummins and Jamie Stead, who were both part of ParalympicsGB's gold medal-winning wheelchair rugby side at the Tokyo games in 2021.\nGraham Lee, a Grand National-winning jockey who suffered a spinal injury in 2024 in a riding accident, went direct to the centre from hospital to start his rehabilitation.\n\"The second I got out of the van, Matt was there,\" Lee said. \"He is a class act in every way.\"\nWhen Hampson turned 40 last year, he spoke of his pride in how he, and those he works with, have \"shaken things up for the disability world\".\n\"The world is a lot more inclusive. You were just existing back then,\" Hampson said when reflecting on the support he received after he first left hospital with his injury.\n\"Now you can get busy living and you can do things. It's a challenge, every day is a challenge, but it makes it enjoyable and makes it worthwhile.\n\"You feel like you are actually getting somewhere, actually changing the world for disabled people but also changing the world for a lot of other people as well.\n\"I'm immensely proud of what we do here.\"\nNatalie Jackson, BBC East Midlands Today sports editor:\nI have been covering Matt Hampson's story for 20 years and first met him in Stoke Mandeville Hospital not long after his accident. \nWhen he was first injured he could only communicate by blinking and clicking, and his injury is the worst level of tetraplegia \u2013 paralysed  from the neck down and on a ventilator.  \nHe was in hospital for 18 months and I filmed with him during his last week in hospital before he came home. \nI was nervous about meeting him because I was worried about saying the wrong thing but he instantly put me at ease with his smile, humour and positivity. And that mental strength he has used ever since to change the way people view disability and to shake up the disability world, changing and saving hundreds of lives. \nHe has an incredible ability to know what people need. \nI have seen people take their first steps at his centre and seen him take people from a dark place and transform their lives, proving that you can have a full and incredible life after a spinal injury \u2013 Getting Busy Living.",

He told us he hoped the intervention would lead to ''concrete change'' for people like him.\nThe 19-year-old worker, who we're calling Alan, told us in January he had been repeatedly subjected to \"degrading and humiliating\" verbal abuse by his colleagues, and faced \"homophobic slurs\".\nAlan still works there. He says things are not much different and he wants to \"get away\" from it.\nThe letter from the EHRC called the allegations in our investigation \"troubling\" and noted there have been \"repeated incidents\".\nThe vast majority of McDonald's restaurants are run by franchises, which means individual operators are licensed to run the outlets and employ the staff.\nIn February 2023, the watchdog entered into a legally binding agreement with McDonald's to prevent sexual harassment in its restaurants.\nFranchises were not covered by that agreement.\nBut in its latest letter, the EHRC said all businesses in Britain, small or large, must comply with the Equality Act.\n''It is your duty to ensure that any anti-discrimination and harassment measures you currently have in place are effective, and to take any necessary steps to protect your workers,\" the chief executive of the EHRC, John Kirkpatrick, told the restaurants.\nThe letter sets out the ''reasonable steps\" that restaurants could take to prevent sexual harassment.\nThese include regular risk assessments, ensuring younger and more vulnerable workers are properly safeguarded and ensuring complaints are dealt with sensitively and effectively through an established procedure.\nIt added that any franchise restaurant that does not comply with its legal duties \"may be at risk of enforcement action''.\nThe EHRC has a range of statutory enforcement powers open to it, including the ability to launch formal investigations.\nIf an organisation repeatedly refuses to comply, then the watchdog can take it through the courts, where an unlimited fine could be issued.\nLiam Byrne, chair of the Business and Trade Select Committee, said the BBC's investigation of abuse at McDonald's had \"exposed malpractice which was totally and utterly unacceptable\".\nHe called for the EHRC to explain \"why it is only now writing to McDonald's restaurants about their new duty under the law, to prevent sexual harassment from taking place, when it came into effect nearly six months ago\".\nHe said it was \"especially concerning because the regulator has known about hundreds of allegations of harassment for several years\".\nHe added: \"Parliamentary committees have now twice found the vigour of their enforcement to be disappointing. It's now vital the public are reassured they're on top of the problem - and not behind the curve.\"\nEHRC head John Kirkpatrick told the BBC's Today programme that the letter was a \"starting point\".\n\"If it's not proving successful, we can investigate further. If we can find legal robust evidence of breaches of the law then we can impose an action plan on them and if they don't follow that, a court can impose fines on them,\" he said.\n\"The most effective and efficient way to make progress is through agreements but if that's not progressing adequately that's when we can take stronger and further action.\"\nThe BBC first began investigating working conditions at McDonald's more than two years ago, after the fast-food chain signed its agreement with the EHRC.\nIn July 2023, we published our initial investigation, which reported claims by workers, some as young as 17, of being groped and harassed almost routinely.\nAt the time, McDonald's apologised and set up a new unit to deal with complaints.\nSince then, more than 160 people have approached the BBC with allegations while the EHRC has heard 300 reported incidents of harassment.\nEarlier this year, we reported that the watchdog plans to intervene again, \"in light of serious allegations raised by our work with the company, and the BBC investigation\".\nThe BBC understands the action plan will involve strengthening the existing measures - which included providing more training and conducting a survey of workers - as well as announcing new steps.\nAlistair Macrow, the boss of McDonald's in the UK, has been summoned twice to Parliament to answer questions in front of MPs since our initial investigation.\nIn January, he said 29 people had been dismissed over sexual harassment allegations over the past 12 months.\nIn a statement, a McDonald's spokesperson said the agreement with the EHRC was signed \"with the intention that it continues to evolve to ensure the robust measures we have in place are aligned with any updated guidance\".\nIt said the letter was sent \"to remind our franchisees of their legal obligations to provide a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace for their employees - which is the same legal requirement of all employers,\" adding that it \"welcomes\" any steps that mean it is continuing to make progress in this area.\nIt said that together with its franchisees, it is committed to doing everything it can to ensure a safe working environment for all employees, with initiatives and measures as part of a cultural action plan.\n\"These actions include everything from enhanced training programmes and onboarding practices, through to the launch of a new digital speak up channel designed with our and our franchisees' restaurant crew in mind,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"We are confident that the plan we have in place is working and making a difference to the near 170,000 people currently employed by McDonald's and our franchisees across McDonald's in the UK & Ireland today.\"\nThey added that its latest anonymous employee survey showed that 94% of people are aware of ways in which they can speak up.\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this story, information and support is available via the BBC Action Line.\nSome of the names in this story have been changed to protect identities.\nGet our flagship daily newsletter delivered straight to your inbox first thing, with all the latest headlines you need to start the day.

        "article_text": "Harley Watson was on a path to what he calls a \"gangster\" life.\nThe 17-year-old, from Clacton, in Essex, was a \"lost and troubled kid\", having grown up without a dad.\n\"I was behaving very badly in school and, if I'd carried on, I would almost certainly have been excluded.\"\nHis experience is echoed in a new report, which says young men who lack a positive male role model are in crisis.\nFatherlessness has a significant impact on boys' mental health, education and future prospects, the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) report found.\nAged 14, Harley joined Lads Need Dads, a local programme that equips boys with life skills and confidence.\nMale mentors work with small groups of eight boys at a time, teaching them about healthy relationships, anger management and what makes a good dad.\nHarley says it changed his life. He learned how to take care of himself and \"become a better man\".\n\"Now they are supporting me to join the Army,\" he adds. \"They've bought me the kit and helped me meet the right people. It's a career path I wouldn't even have looked into but I'm really excited by it.\"\nSonia Shaljean, who runs the organisation, says she knew Harley had huge potential, even though he was \"quite shut down\" when he joined them.\nShe believes fatherlessness is a key factor in issues from crime and addiction to school exclusions, homelessness and male suicide.\n\"It's not taken seriously enough,\" she says. \"We skirt around the issue, and it's almost controversial to say it, but boys need a supportive father figure.\n\"Some people are offended by our name - Lads Need Dads - but I stand by it. We're not taking away from the importance of a mother, but that male influence is also important.\n\"Ultimately, we're helping women and girls too by raising boys who are more emotionally intelligent, stable and secure.\"\nSource: CSJ - a Conservative think-tank focused on tackling poverty.\nSonia, who is a mother of three young men, says some boys who have grown up in violent homes can be fearful of men, so positive male role models are crucial.\n\"We work with them in the same group for up to eight years, so they build real friendships and it becomes like a family.\n\"Our groups are incredibly diverse. It's a misconception that father absence is just an issue in certain communities.\"\nNot all fathers are absent by choice, she says.\n\"Some were wonderful dads but have sadly passed away. Some boys have been abandoned by their fathers but others desperately want to be involved in their sons' lives and some even struggle with suicidal thoughts as a result.\"\nAround the eight-month mark of the programme, boys often start to talk about their fathers, she says.\n\"As their confidence grows, some feel ready to explore the possibility of reconnecting and many go on to re-establish a relationship with their dads.\"\nSonia set up Lads Need Dads 10 years ago, with an initial grant of \u00a34,000, having worked for more than 20 years on the frontlines of criminal justice, addiction, domestic abuse and homelessness.\n\"I kept seeing the same heartbreaking pattern - so many men stuck in cycles of crime, addiction, and hopelessness. And nearly every time, there was one thing they had in common: growing up without a father or a positive male role model.\n\"I thought 'I've got to do something'. If we don't provide a service for these boys we won't break this cycle,\" she says.\nAbout 250 boys have been helped by the organisation. \nCharlie Howlett, 19, says it saved his life when he joined six years ago.\nHis mother had died when he was a two, leaving his father to bring him and his younger brother up alone.\n\"My dad didn't take it too well and it wasn't the best situation growing up,\" he adds.\nThe brothers moved in with their nan and aunt a few years later, but still remained close to their dad until he died suddenly from a blood clot when Charlie was 12.\nCharlie tried to be strong for everyone and be the father figure. \"But I couldn't cope,\" he says. \"I was lashing out at everyone and started thinking about taking my own life.\"\nLads Need Dads has given him an \"unimaginable\" amount of support, he says.\n\"I thought I was the only person going through it, then I met this group of boys my age who were also growing up without a dad.\n\"The mentors were a huge part of it for me. You grow to trust them like your own dad.\"\nSonia and her team supported Charlie three years ago when his nan, who he was still living with, also died.\n\"They have helped me be a better big brother and I think that has kept him on a good path too,\" he adds.\nSonia helped Charlie get a plumbing apprenticeship and, for the last year, he has also been mentoring boys on the programme.\n\"It's a really good feeling to know I'm giving something back. I can see parts of myself in all of them,\" he says.\nLads Need Dads also runs a reading mentor programme in primary schools and is piloting a new programme in September where, for the first time, male teachers will deliver a three-month intervention to Year 7 boys.\nDespite its impact, Sonia says Lads Need Dads is struggling for funding.\n\"It's so frustrating because I feel like we have this blueprint that works that could be rolled out nationwide, but I have to turn away mothers who don't live in Essex, who are desperate for help for their sons.\"\nSonia says society has to believe in boys like Harley and Charlie, and help them reach their potential and break the cycle of fatherlessness.\nAs for Charlie, he says he wants to carry on plumbing, see more of the world and continue mentoring boys. But his ultimate wish is to be a father.\n\"I can't wait to be a dad. It's the one thing in my life I know is exactly what I want. I want to be the best dad ever.\"\nIf you are suffering distress or despair, details of help and support in the UK are available at BBC Action Line\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

        "article_text": "Sue Nelson explores how asteroids can inform our understanding of the Earth's past \u2013 or threaten our future.\nEach year, according to Nasa, a chunk of rock the size of a car hurtles through space on a collision course with our planet. Fortunately, thanks to the Earth's atmosphere acting as a natural shield, instead of crash landing on the ground, the asteroid burns up and produces an impressive light show, streaking across the sky as a meteor or fireball.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, other, much larger asteroids have the potential to be far more threatening than entertaining. \"Asteroids come in all sizes,\" says Michael K\u00fcppers, a planetary scientist for the European Space Agency (ESA). \"The really big ones, like the 10km (6.21 mile) [wide] or so asteroid that we think led to the extinction of the dinosaurs, happen maybe once every 100 million years.\"\nThe asteroid 2024 YR4, which was discovered in December 2024, has been making headlines around the world recently. At around 40-90m (131-295ft) wide, it is larger than a 12-storey building. In January this year, the ESA calculated the rock's trajectory and initially predicted that there was a 1.2% chance of impact with Earth on 22 December 2032.\nThis officially crossed the comfortable threshold of risk for a near-Earth object \u2013 1% \u2013 and triggered the need for investigation by several planetary defence organisations, as well as the US President and US Congress.\u00a0\nLuckily YR4 is not large enough to be capable of making our species extinct but it could still be a \"city killer\", according to some experts, if it is at the upper end of the estimated size range and landed in a heavily populated area.\u00a0\nIn February 2025, the risk of the asteroid hitting the Earth briefly climbed to 3.1% or one in 32. Luckily, humanity managed to avoid mass panic and the risk has since reduced to a more reassuring 0.001%. But where did this asteroid come from in the first place? And how concerned should we be about a similar scenario emerging in the future?\u00a0\nWhen it comes to understanding asteroids, astronomers and scientists are still being dealt the cards in order to understand the rules of this potentially risky celestial game.\n\"Scientifically there's a huge amount we can learn from asteroids,\" says Alan Fitzsimmons, an astronomer at Queens University Belfast and a member of one of Nasa's sky surveys that searches and tracks Near Earth Objects (NEOs). These are asteroids whose orbit brings them within 195 million km (121 million miles) of the Sun.\n\"Any asteroid we detect is generally a fragment of a much larger body that was formed at the birth of our Solar System\" says Fitzsimmons. \"So by studying their chemical make-up we get some idea of the conditions in the initial Solar System as since then, over 4.6 billion years, it has evolved dynamically.\"\u00a0\nThese ancient rocky remnants are sometimes referred to as minor planets. Often irregular and cratered, they can also be spherical. They can spin slow, fast or tumble. Usually solitary, they can sometimes be found in pairs (binary or double asteroids) and some even have their own moon. Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory's website keeps tabs on their numbers and at the last count there are over 1.4 million in our Solar System. The majority are located within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter but millions more are too small to be detected.\u00a0\nMost of the time these asteroids remain restrained within that interplanetary belt by Jupiter's gravitational field, unable to coalesce into a larger body. But occasionally another asteroid or the influence of Jupiter's gravity can nudge some into another orbit around the Sun, towards the inner Solar System.\nOnce an asteroid has been ejected from its usual path and is potentially heading our way, the first challenge is to detect it.\u00a0\n\"All an asteroid looks like in a telescope is a point of light against other points of lights that are stars, except it's moving,\" says Kelly Fast, Nasa's acting planetary defence officer, \"and it's reflecting sunlight.\"\nThe brighter the asteroid, the bigger it will be. But its colour also affects the brightness as a small white asteroid might reflect more light than a much larger dark one. It's not an exact science, which is why YR4's size is estimated at 40-90m (131-295ft) wide. The more information we have, however, the more precise that number will become.\n\"A team at Nasa and an ESA team will be using the James Webb Space Telescope to take infrared observations of YR4,\" says Fast. These measurements of an asteroid's thermal emissions \"may be helpful for constraining that size range\", she adds.\nYR4, in common with most asteroids,\u00a0is from the asteroid belt. \"Which part of the belt is hard to tell,\" says Fitzsimmons. \"One clue that we have is a spectrum of its surface.\" By examining the intensity of light emitted over a range of wavelengths, specific materials on the surface of the asteroid can be identified. \"YR4 is a rocky asteroid that's deficient in lighter elements such as carbon, which tells us that it probably came from the inner asteroid belt,\" says Fitzsimmons. \"But exactly where we don't know \u2013 and we may never know.\"\nAsteroids are not all the same either. \"There are different populations,\" says Fast. \"Some are stony, some are carbonaceous and some have metallic content depending on the parent bodies they came from.\"\nWhile there are rare types of asteroids, more than three out of four are carbonaceous, or C-type, and contain carbon, appearing black as coal. The rest are mostly S-type or silicaceous \u2013 a mix of metal and silicate crystals \u2013 or metallic or M-type asteroids, which contain predominantly iron and nickel.\u00a0\nOne asteroid scientists are particularly interested in is\u00a0 \u2013 a large, metal-rich rock the shape of a potato, which inhabits the Solar System's main asteroid belt. It's thought this asteroid could be up to 95% nickel and iron, which is similar to the Earth's core. Studying it will therefore increase our understanding of how our own planet formed. Nasa's Psyche mission is currently on its way there and is due to arrive in August 2029.\nIn terms of metal content, asteroids like Psyche 16 are also potentially extremely valuable \u2013 it's thought to contain resources worth approximately US$10 quadrillion (\u00a37.8 quadrillion). In the future, if asteroid mining ever became necessary as well as economically and technically feasible, it's thought they could provide an abundance of resources.\nKnowing an asteroid's composition is key for defence reasons too. An iron-rich asteroid, for example would do more damage on impact than carbonaceous ones as it is more dense, has more mass and would have more energy if it smashed into a moon or planet. The Earth's Moon, as can be seen, is littered by asteroid impact craters since it only has a thin atmosphere, or exosphere, which cannot protective it. Although the Earth is unlikely to receive an impact by YR4, there remains a 1.7% chance it could hit our Moon.\nThe level of damage also depends on the asteroid's structure. \"If you know more about the structure of these objects,\" says Fitzsimmons, \"then you can calculate more accurately what happens when it hits the Earth's atmosphere.Most asteroids below 10km [6.2 miles] across are almost all either heavily fractured solid objects or rock piles \u2013 smaller fragments of asteroids grouped together mostly by gravity.\"\nDoes this mean a rubble pile asteroid would be more likely to burn up in the atmosphere and therefore be less dangerous? \"Unfortunately not,\" says Fitzsimmons. \"If an asteroid is hitting the Earth at 17km per second (over 38,000 mph), it's in the atmosphere for less than 10 seconds before it reaches impact.\"\nWhile the Earth's atmosphere acts as a protective barrier, that still doesn't prevent all damage. \"Something the size of YR4 would probably only make it to a few kilometres above the Earth's surface. It will lose its energy and explode at altitude. Although we wouldn't get a crater, we would have an air blast and that could be just as devastating as if it hit the ground,\" says Fitzsimmons.\u00a0\nAt the moment we don't know if YR4 is one solid object or whether it's a rock pile, but an air blast could have been significant considering what happened in 2013. A fireball \u2013 which is what an asteroid is called once it enters Earth's atmosphere \u2013 exploded about 14 miles (22.5km) above the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia. Eyewitnesses described the light as brighter than the Sun, and the blast's shockwave damaged over 4,000 buildings and injured 1,200 people.\n\"The asteroid was around 20m (66ft) in size,\" says K\u00fcppers. \"This is maybe about the limit size where you would start worrying if it hits populated areas.\"\nCoincidentally, on the day of the Chelyabinsk event, a United Nations committee was underway in Vienna about defending Earth from future asteroid impacts. The meeting resulted in the International Asteroid Warning Network, chaired by Nasa, and a Space Missions Planning Advisory Group for space agencies around the world to collaborate.\nFortunately, there have already been a number of missions which have studied asteroids, starting with Galileo when it flew past two asteroids in the early 1990s. In 2000, Nasa's Near Shoemaker became the first spacecraft to orbit an asteroid, Eros, and \u2013 a year later \u2013 to land on one too. The Japanese Huyabusa 2 mission visited the C-type asteroid 162173\u00a0Ryugu in 2018 and 2019 and even sent back a sample to Earth in a hermetically sealed container in 2005.\nThe US OSIRIS-REx mission (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security\u2013Regolith Explorer) collected dust and rocks from asteroid Bennu and returned them to Earth in 2023. Earlier this year, the first in-depth analysis of the samples' minerals and molecules were published. It included finding 14 of the 20 amino acids used by life to make proteins on Earth. The spacecraft, renamed OSIRIS-APEX, is now on its way to explore asteroid Apophis.\u00a0\nAll these missions, and more, have allowed scientists to study the composition and particle size of several asteroids, as well as the magnetic properties of samples to inform our understanding of the Solar System's early magnetic field. But there is another reason for studying asteroids, brought home by the concerns over YR4: to protect our planet.\nIn 2022, Nasa's Dart (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) mission deliberately aimed itself at a harmless \u2013 from the Earth's point of view \u2013 binary asteroid system consisting of asteroid Didymos (780m, or 2,559 ft) and its smaller orbiting asteroid or moonlet, Dimorphos (160m, or 525ft). The spacecraft used itself as a kinetic impactor, targeting Dimorphos at around 22,530km (14,000 miles) per hour. This was Nasa's first test to see if it could deflect an asteroid's path and it was a success. After impact, Dimorphos' orbit was altered. Does this mean, in future, that Nasa asteroid missions will focus on planetary defence rather than understanding more about the science?\u00a0\n\"We're very much interested in both,\" says Fast, \"and it's a really good partnership. The planetary defence coordination office at Nasa sits inside of the planetary science division because there is so much asteroid science involved in it. We want to protect the planet but we also want to study these amazing leftovers from the formation of the Solar System, both to understand the history of the Solar System and to see what the effects might be should they impact, or should we need to deflect one in space.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.\nMeanwhile, 87% of US video game console imports came from China that year, 78% of smartphones, 79% of laptops and tablets, and two-thirds of monitors, says the CTA.\nWhile many American companies like Austere have diversified their supply chains away from China since Mr Trump's first term, countries such as Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam still do not offer the same manufacturing capabilities and expertise. \nAt the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.\n\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.\n\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"\nResearch suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.\nIn February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.\nMs Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.\n\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"\nDuring Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.\nInsiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.\nFears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.  \nFor the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute. \nHe plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.  \nThere is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.\nMs Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.\nShe hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.\n\"That might mean finding a more cost-effective way to produce the product or doing something completely different.

        "article_text": "A lack of this vital nutrient is one of the world's leading causes of disability \u2013 but exactly when it becomes a problem, and the best way to treat it, remains unclear.\nWhen Megan Ryan first noticed her fatigue, she assumed it was normal. After all, she was a single parent to a three-year-old.\u00a0She also worked full-time. Almost every day, when she picked her son up from daycare, she'd fall asleep with him during his afternoon nap. She didn't think much about it. \"I just thought, 'Oh, this is motherhood',\" says Ryan, who lives in upstate New York, US. At a routine medical check-up in June 2023, her doctor asked if she felt exhausted. Blood test results showed that Ryan had iron deficiency anaemia.\nLooking back, there had been other signs. Despite regularly working out, Ryan had suddenly started to feel winded on routine hikes. She had also had iron deficiency before, during pregnancy. That time, her midwife suspected it after Ryan mentioned that her only pregnancy craving was ice \u2013 a classic sign of pica, which is, in turn, a symptom of iron deficiency.\u00a0\nIron deficiency is the\u00a0most common micronutrient deficiency in the world today, affecting roughly one in three people. It is especially prevalent among children as well as women of reproductive age, including pregnant women.\nThe condition can cause a wide range of consequences. When a pregnant woman doesn't have adequate iron stores, for example, it can affect the foetus' brain development and there is also a higher risk of low birth weight, preterm birth, dying during pregnancy and stillbirth. For babies and toddlers, not having enough iron can affect long-term development, with studies finding that children are at risk\u00a0of exhibiting behavioural issues \u2013 they are less happy and contented, and tend to be more socially inhibited. It can also influence children's motor skills, and cognitive ability even years after a deficiency has been corrected. In adults, iron deficiency is one of the world's leading causes of disability. In rare cases, it can be life-threatening.\n\"It's a major global problem,\" says Michael Zimmermann, professor\u00a0of human nutrition at the University of Oxford in the UK and a long-time researcher of micronutrient deficiencies. \"It's very common. It's not going away very fast. And it is associated with a lot of disability.\"\nMost scientists agree that iron deficiency is a common condition. But other questions persist, such as how exactly to define iron deficiency, or how likely it is, in the absence of other symptoms, to raise the risk of poor health outcomes. So, when should, and shouldn't, someone supplement their iron?\u00a0\nWhat isn't disputed is that some groups are more susceptible to iron deficiency than others.\nIn women, for example, iron-deficiency anaemia \u2013 where the body does not have enough iron to make sufficient red blood cells \u2013 is a leading cause of disability worldwide. One study of first-time US blood donors found that iron levels were low in 12% of women, but in less than 3% of men, reflecting the impact made by regular blood loss through menstruation. Then there's the impact of pregnancy, which diverts nutrition to the foetus, meaning that women in this group are particularly at risk. One study found that 46% of UK women had anaemia at some point during pregnancy \u2013 though not all cases stemmed from iron deficiency.\nEndurance athletics, vegetarianism or veganism and frequent blood donation can all put both men and women at increased risk. People with certain health conditions might also be prone to lower iron levels. Kidney disease and coeliac disease can decrease iron absorption, for example.\nBut children are among the most vulnerable group to iron deficiency because the mineral is so important for their development.\n\"What's the most rapid period of growth in our entire lifespan? Infancy,\" says Mark Corkins, chair of the Committee on Nutrition at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). \"You triple your birth weight by a year of age. You double your length.\" As our bodies grow, they need more blood. And red blood cells are built \u2013 in part \u2013 on iron. Without that necessary iron, says Corkins, you risk not able to produce enough red blood cells to deliver oxygen to your growing tissues, including the brain.\nIron deficiency is especially common in children from lower income countries. \"In studies I've done in Africa, 70% of babies between six and 12 months of age have clear iron-deficiency anaemia,\" says Zimmermann.\nEven in wealthier countries, which have better overall nutrition and which are more likely to fortify certain food products with iron, this deficiency persists. Up to 4% of toddlers in the US, for example, have iron-deficiency anaemia, while some 15% have iron deficiency.\nIron deficiency, iron-deficiency anaemia, and anaemia\nAnaemia occurs when someone is not producing enough normal red blood cells or haemoglobin, the substance that carries oxygen around in your blood. While this can be due to various factors, around half of all anaemia cases are caused by iron deficiency. Adults with this condition, iron-deficiency anaemia, might experience weakness, extreme fatigue, or shortness of breath, among other symptoms. Symptoms in babies and small children are similar, though they might also have sleep issues \u2013 particularly frequent night wakes, restlessness during sleep, and difficulty falling asleep.\nJust because someone is iron deficient does not necessarily mean they will have anaemia. \"Iron deficiency can be considered a stage prior to anaemia,\" says clinical haemotologist Sant-Rayn Pasricha, the head of the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health who specialises in iron deficiency and related conditions.\nThe severity of the deficiency plays a key role, Pasricha explains. When someone gets low on iron, their body begins to form red blood cells differently, he says. They get smaller and, eventually, the amount of oxygen-carrying haemoglobin in that person's blood drops below a healthy level. \"That's when we reach iron deficiency anaemia,\" Pasricha says.\nIron deficiency and anaemia are generally diagnosed with a blood test \u2013 usually one that examines levels of ferritin, a protein that helps store iron, or haemoglobin.\nSome specialists question whether iron deficiency is always a cause for concern \u2013 especially if it arises in the absence of any physical symptoms and if the patient does not have anaemia.\nPasricha co-authored a review to help inform the World Health Organization's guidelines on iron supplementation in women. In that research, he found something interesting.\u00a0\nWhile those women in clinical trials who were iron deficient and reported feeling fatigued found that their fatigue improved upon taking iron supplements, the intervention didn't change the energy levels of women who were also iron deficient, but who had not reported fatigue.\u00a0\n\"This hints to us that, at least in adults, if you're clinically unwell with an iron deficiency, then of course you should be treated and that will improve how you feel,\" Pasricha says. \"But it also suggests that, if you're feeling perfectly fine, and someone just finds that you have a low iron level \u2013 then it's hard to be sure that that treating you then would boost you to feel any different.\"\nOverall, iron deficiency in the absence of anaemia has been studied less than iron-deficiency anaemia. But there are some broad conclusions we can make, researchers say.\n\"The consensus is that iron-deficiency anaemia is certainly worse,\" says Zimmermann. \"But iron deficiency is also associated with impairment.\"\nAccording to some studies, the effects of iron-deficiency anaemia \u2013 particularly in children \u2013 can be long-lasting. \"It's not just about [poor health outcomes] \u2013 it is that you didn't maximise your development,\" Corkins says.\nOne review, for example, found a \"consistent association\" between children with iron-deficiency anaemia having poorer cognitive performance compared to controls. However, the researchers note, perhaps it's not iron-deficiency anaemia that's the problem. It could be the effect of anaemia in general, which depresses energy levels. The researchers also say in their review that it is hard to rule out the influence of socioeconomic factors on children\u2019s behaviour and cognition.\nThis complexity lies at the heart of all nutrition research: is it the absence of a nutrient itself that's the problem, or is that deficiency a sign of something else going on?\nTo complicate matters further, the criteria for defining iron deficiency in children is still up for debate, says Zimmermann. Because children are growing so fast, he adds, iron deficiency normally quickly leads to anaemia \u2013 which means it's not easy to find, and study, iron-deficient children who are not anaemic.\nGiven that, and the potential consequences for their development, guidelines often advise supplementing children with iron at any sign of deficiency \u2013 or even to supplement as a prevention measure.\u00a0\nIn the US, for example, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies who are exclusively breastfed receive iron drops from four months old, for example. This is because breastmilk has low levels of iron, while formula milk is usually fortified.\nBut some researchers question this approach.\nPasricha was involved in the largest trial to date that has examined the effect of supplementation on child development, he says. The study, of 3,300 eight-month-old babies in Bangladesh, randomised children into groups that received either daily iron supplementation for three months, or a placebo. He and colleagues measured the children's neurodevelopment before and after the supplementation. \"We did not see any evidence of a functional benefit,\" he says, although they also saw no harm either way.\n\"We did see that haemoglobin and iron status did improve in the children that received iron \u2013 but we didn't see that affect child development,\" says Pasricha. The \"why\", he says, \"is something that the team is really grappling with\".\nOther research has yielded similar findings. For example, in one study, even after infants with iron-deficiency anaemia received supplementation that corrected their anaemia, they continued to show more restless sleep patterns than their cohorts \u2013 sometimes even years later.\nOne possible reason might be that even a brief period of deficiency can lead to long-lasting harm. One study, for example, found that when children had had iron deficiency at birth, they had less activation in the regions of their brain related to cognitive control at eight to 11 years old \u2013 even if their iron levels had been corrected.\u00a0\nBut another possibility, Pasricha says, is that it isn't the low iron itself that causes poorer development, but that low iron is an indicator of something else \u2013 such as other nutrients in a person's diet that are missing.\nMeanwhile, there could also be downsides to supplementing children who don't actually have a deficiency. Some studies have found that babies and toddlers who had adequate iron levels, but received supplementation, had poorer weight gain and less growth compared to controls. Randomised controlled trials have found that babies randomly assigned to high-iron formula milk scored more poorly on cognitive tests of abilities like visual memory, reading comprehension and mathematics at both 10 years old and 16 years old, compared to those on a low-iron formulation. However, exactly how much iron supplementation would avoid these effects remains unclear, the researchers say as other factors could also be involved.\nGiven results like this, however, some experts have criticised US guidelines to supplement all breastfed infants.\nSupplements can also have other side effects. Zimmermann, for example, has studied how supplementation can affect people's microbiome. Bacteria thrive on iron, he says. The very small amount of iron that breastmilk has is bound to protective substances like lactoferrin, which helps to keep iron away from potential pathogens in the gut \u2013 especially protective for babies, who have immature immune systems. Giving a baby aged six months old micronutrient powders containing iron, which is what many experts recommend, could result in a negative outcome, says Zimmermann.\n\"These powders have very high amounts of iron in them\u2026 which can cause a very rapid shift in the microbiome,\" says Zimmermann. The babies can't absorb all that iron, which ends up impacting their gut microbiome \u2013 potentially towards a balance favouring \"the pathogens we worry most about in babies\", he says. This includes E. coli, which grows prolifically in the presence of iron.\nMany clinicians and researchers agree, however, that when someone has iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anaemia along with symptoms, supplementing can be one of the fastest ways to help them improve. One review of iron deficiency in endurance athletes, for example, found that supplementation not only improved ferritin and haemoglobin, but athletes' aerobic capacity, too.\u00a0\nWhether to take supplements \u2013 or give them to a child \u2013 is something that people should decide with the help of a doctor, experts say.\nBut in an ideal world, people would get sufficient iron by eating a balanced diet that includes iron-rich foods, and avoid developing a deficiency in the first place \u2013 though this is not always possible. Ingredients such as liver or red meat, pulses, including kidney and edamame beans and chickpeas, as well as nuts and dried fruits are all considered good sources of iron.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants aged six to 12 months need 11 mg of iron per day. For toddlers, they recommend 7 mg, and for four- to eight-year-olds, 10 mg.\nPart of the higher recommendation for younger babies is because of their rapid development, experts say. But it's also because there is an assumption being made that most infants' first solids will be foods like iron-fortified cereals, as well as fruits and vegetables \u2013 non-heme sources of iron, which the body absorbs less readily than heme sources, which are animal-derived, like meat, fish and eggs.\n\"Diet is the best approach. Your body tends to take it up better. Your body tends to use it better,\" Corkins says. \"Now, if someone is profoundly anaemic, and you're trying to get them fixed faster \u2013 then you do supplementation.\"\nAs for Ryan, she was able to correct her iron deficiency both times it happened: in pregnancy, with a supplement, and in 2023, with iron infusions, administered at her hospital, every two weeks for five months. \"It wasn't a quick fix,\" she says. With time, however, she noticed her fatigue fade.\nDisclaimer\n All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of a doctor or any other health care professional.

What isn't disputed is that some groups are more susceptible to iron deficiency than others.When someone gets low on iron, their body begins to form red blood cells differently \u2013 Sant-Rayn PasrichaIn women, for example, iron-deficiency anaemia \u2013 where the body does not have enough iron to make sufficient red blood cells \u2013 is a leading cause of disability worldwide. \"That's when we reach iron deficiency anaemia,\" Pasricha says.Iron deficiency and anaemia are generally diagnosed with a blood test \u2013 usually one that examines levels of ferritin, a protein that helps store iron, or haemoglobin.A matter of debateSome specialists question whether iron deficiency is always a cause for concern \u2013 especially if it arises in the absence of any physical symptoms and if the patient does not have anaemia.Pasricha co-authored a review to help inform the World Health Organization's guidelines on iron supplementation in women. But another possibility, Pasricha says, is that it isn't the low iron itself that causes poorer development, but that low iron is an indicator of something else \u2013 such as other nutrients in a person's diet that are missing.Meanwhile, there could also be downsides to supplementing children who don't actually have a deficiency. One study, for example, found that when children had had iron deficiency at birth, they had less activation in the regions of their brain related to cognitive control at eight to 11 years old \u2013 even if their iron levels had been corrected.",

Lose then move on.\nThe Football Association provoked debate, and some criticism, by ignoring the claims of English candidates such as Eddie Howe in their succession plan post-Southgate, to go for the best man available regardless of nationality.\nThe strategy was clear. The long-term can wait while a proven winner takes charge and Tuchel's first England squad merely confirms it.\nThere is a nod to the next generation with the inclusion of versatile defender Lewis-Skelly with England short at left-back and Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers, who is 22, but there was the definite whiff of short-term targets in Tuchel's selection.\nHowever, the recall of Henderson is the most eye-catching example of Tuchel wanting experience for the here and now. He last played for England in November 2023 and missed out on selection for last summer's Euro 2024.\nTuchel described Henderson as a \"serial winner\" and this is what the coach has in mind as he plots a path to next year's World Cup.\nJordan Henderson's England career looked over when he was left out of Gareth Southgate's Euro 2024 squad\nAnd then there is the shock selection of Burn. \nA wonderful story, as Newcastle United manager Howe agreed, but a very late stage for any player to prove they are international class.\nBurn would be the oldest player to win his first England cap since Bolton Wanderers striker Kevin Davies made his debut against Montenegro on 12 October 2010 at 33 years and 200 days. The bustling forward was the oldest since 38-year-old Leslie Compton in 1950.\nIt is very much a case of going back to the past for the short-term future. Former interim boss Lee Carsley's last squad contained a total 627 caps, while this one has a tally of 664.\nTuchel is missing younger players who have been injured recently, such as Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, but is clear the German's reign is not going to be a slow burner.\nThe selection of Henderson and the return of Rashford demonstrates that Tuchel is prepared to start with a clean slate.\nHenderson's call-up came out of the blue after it looked like his England career was over when he, like Rashford, was left out of Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2024.\nThe former Liverpool captain had an ill-fated stint in Saudi Arabia before returning to Europe with Ajax, where Tuchel has clearly seen enough to recall him.\nTuchel appears to want Henderson as much for his influence off the pitch, saying: \"What he brings every time is leadership, character, personality and energy. He makes sure everyone lives by the standards and with character. He embodies everything we are trying to build.\"\nEngland's head coach has long been a fan of Rashford and wants to be the beneficiary of Aston Villa manager Unai Emery's repair job on the forward's career.\nHe said: \"I had a strong feeling we should nominate him, to push him to stay at the level he is at now not fall back into old routines.\"\nTuchel's words offer an indication that he realises Rashford had fallen by the wayside at Old Trafford but is also convinced the 27-year-old can offer much to his new England.\nHe clearly does not feel the same about Manchester City's Jack Grealish. He would have been hoping to make a comeback after also missing out on Euro 2024, although he has not figured regularly under manager Pep Guardiola.\nTottenham midfielder James Maddison is another who is, for now at least, consigned to the margins,\nTuchel goes with what he knows by recalling Chelsea's Reece James as he makes his return from another hamstring injury. \nHe was a key member of Tuchel's side that won the Champions League in 2021 and there is a potential opening at right-back with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, Kyle Walker, 34, and on loan at AC Milan, and with Newcastle United's Tino Livramento talented but inexperienced.\nThis video can not be played\n'When Rashford plays, he's one of the best'\nWatch The Football News Show on Tuchel's first England squad\nHenderson embodies everything we try to build - Tuchel\nTuchel has made no secret of his desire to utilise the natural physical aspects of the English style into his squad and this is in evidence with this selection.\nBurn, at 6 feet 7 inches, fits the bill, while Rogers combines raw power with natural skill and strong running. James also combines physical strength with great ability -and the squad has a very powerful look.\nTuchel was asked whether that lack of physicality cost England in previous tournaments.\nHe said: \"I don't think a lot is missing. Obviously a little bit is because we lost consecutive Euros finals and World Cup semi-final and quarter-finals. \n\"The feeling is a little step is needed to bring it over the line.\"\nTuchel's squad is sure to cause debate, especially in Nottingham, where Forest fans will feel Morgan Gibbs-White could have offered an \"X Factor\" after his outstanding performances in their tilt to reach the Champions League.\nThey will also offer up Callum Hudson-Odoi as an example of someone who deserves a return to the England squad after his rejuvenation, exemplified by his winning goal against Manchester City that puts Forest in such a wonderful position to reach the top four.\nEverton defender Jarrad Branthwaite, who won a full cap under Southgate, also misses out despite being in outstanding form since manager David Moyes returned to Goodison Park. He is included in Carsley's England Under-21 side.\nTottenham defender Djed Spence will have had his backers, while there is no place for Conor Gallagher despite his fine form at Atletico Madrid.\nTuchel resisted the temptation to include Arsenal 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri, who also goes into Carsley's squad.\nThis video can not be played\nHow Grealish needs 'confidence and love'\nThomas Tuchel gave a hugely impressive performance in front of the media after announcing his first squad.\nFrom suggestion he is intent on \"building a brotherhood\" in his England squad to talking about \"a parental vibe\" when handling Arsenal teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly, Tuchel was confident and comfortable in his new skin as England head coach.\nNo subject was off limits, apart from when he declined to reveal who his captain might be if Harry Kane was not available.\nTuchel was open, honest and clearly excited about the task ahead, although he admitted he was \"missing the smell of the grass\" and could not wait to get on the training ground with his new charges.\nThis is a coach who has been around the block with big clubs such as Borussia Dortmund, Paris St. Germain and Bayern Munich, while getting a feel and admiration for the English game and his players at Chelsea.\nHe is the quick winner the FA wanted with his appointment.\nNow the serious work starts with the World Cup his goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRashford returns as Tuchel names first England squad",

        "article_text": "Thomas Tuchel's 18-month contract as England head coach started in January 2025\nEngland's new head coach Thomas Tuchel will name his first squad on Friday morning as the Three Lions prepare for the start of World Cup qualifying.\nEngland play Latvia and Albania on 21 and 24 March, and Tuchel has just seven international windows and roughly 450 days between now and the ultimate challenge of winning the 2026 World Cup.\nBBC Sport looks at some of the talking points around Tuchel's first announcement, including:\nForwards: Kane a definite but injuries and poor form limit attackers\nFull-backs: Ben White return? Myles Lewis-Skelly debut?\nWill Palace midfielder Adam Wharton be called up?\nTuchel has spoken to more than 55 players on the phone to \"build connections\"\nWill selection give any clues of a 4-2-3-1 formation or 3-4-2-1?\nWildcards: Ethan Nwaneri, Jamie Gittens, Liam Delap, Elliott Anderson\nFollow the BBC Sport's live page on Friday as the squad is announced, including a Tuchel news conference live stream.\nTuchel has planned his squad announcement for Friday to take into account the English players playing on Thursday in Europe for Manchester United, Tottenham and Chelsea.\nOver the past few weeks, Tuchel has spoken to more than 55 players individually on the phone, sources told BBC Sport. FA chief Mark Bullingham said Tuchel was \"building connections\".\nTuchel has been partly working remotely from Germany, although Bullingham clarified last week that Tuchel is based at St George's Park and living in London.\nThe England boss is often shown on TV cameras at Premier League matches and has travelled to Milan to watch Kyle Walker, Madrid to see Jude Bellingham and also been to Germany to watch England captain Harry Kane.\nTuchel's assistant Anthony Barry has also been to watch games individually and Tuchel has been at St George's Park between two to three days a week, with his backroom team planning next week's camp.\nLineker and Shearer defend England criticism after Kane comments\nTuchel making brilliant impact - FA chief Bullingham\nGiven Tuchel's job description has been underlined as an 18-month trophy quest, will he focus on experienced players he knows well to win now? Interim Lee Carsley's preference was to experiment with youth and prioritise the long-term development of the squad.\nEngland's established centre-back pairing of Harry Maguire and John Stones are both injured, with a younger crop of centre backs such as Marc Guehi, Levi Colwill and Jarrad Branthwaite in strong contention.\nBen White made himself unavailable for England selection after the World Cup in Qatar in 2022 when he left the squad but Tuchel has spoken to the Arsenal defender who can play both at right back and centre back. While Chelsea captain Reece James is also known and liked by Tuchel.\nJude Bellingham and Declan Rice are two near certainties to play for England in midfield with the third place up for grabs if Tuchel plays with a three-man midfield.\nKobbie Mainoo took that role at Euro 2024 but is currently injured, whilst Carsley introduced Angel Gomes, Morgan Gibbs-White and Curtis Jones during his interim time in charge.\nAnd Tuchel has been at Selhurst Park for their past two Premier League matches and Adam Wharton. The former Blackburn man was included in the Euro 2024 squad but did not play a minute, yet has impressed since coming back from injury and could be the 'number 6' that England are craving.\nRecord goalscorer Kane's England place was one of the biggest talking points of the summer. But any discussion of evolving away from the Bayern striker has disappeared with the appointment of his former boss Tuchel and Kane's 10 Champions League and 21 Bundesliga goals this season.\nUnusually for this squad, form and fitness means England's usual array of attacking talent is partly reduced.\nCole Palmer, Phil Foden and Jack Grealish are all out of form, Bukayo Saka and Noni Madueke are injured. They are competing with Anthony Gordon, Ollie Watkins and Morgan Rogers who are all having good periods. Could Aston Villa's Marcus Rashford, on loan from Manchester United, get a surprise recall?\nIn terms of formation, Tuchel has used both the 4-2-3-1 formation and a variation of 3-4-2-1, which he implemented at Chelsea in an impressively short amount of time for Champions League glory.\nHis sides can be described as pragmatic with an extremely high level of detail put onto each player. Not afraid of a direct style, his Bayern side knocked Arsenal out of last season's Champions League maximising long diagonal balls into pacey wingers for one v one situations.\nThe biggest clue as to whether Tuchel will play three at the back will be if six centre-backs options are chosen to cover the two games, rather than four or five, including versatile players like White. Another hint would be the inclusion of Crystal Palace's Tyrick Mitchell, who is playing as left wing-back under Oliver Glasner. \nThomas Tuchel at Crystal Palace v Ipswich in March\nSouthgate was criticised for his failed Luke Shaw fitness gamble in the summer and left-back remains a dilemma for Tuchel.\nIn-form Newcastle defender Lewis Hall - who was given his Chelsea debut by Tuchel - was nailed on, before being ruled out for the rest of the campaign with an injury.\nHowever, Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly has had an impressive breakthrough season despite actually being a midfielder at youth level.\nPalace defender Mitchell has not added to his two England caps since making his debut in 2022, but with Tuchel being a regular visitor to Selhurst Park, he may be an outside bet.\nThen there is Tottenham's Djed Spence, a right-footed left wing-back nominated for February's Premier League Player of the Month after finally getting a run of games under Ange Postecoglou.\nEthan Nwaneri - Arsenal's exciting 17-year-old has scored eight goals in 30 games in his debut season, and is attracting high praise from pundits, team-mates and his manager, Mikel Arteta.\nJamie Gittens - Another England youth international flourishing at Dortmund, the 20-year-old has four goals in 12 Champions League games this season\nLiam Delap - Tipped as a long-term Kane replacement as England's central striker, the 21-year-old Ipswich star has 10 Premier League goals despite his side's relegation fears.\nElliott Anderson - High-flying Nottingham Forest's 22-year-old midfielder has played for both England and Scotland at Under 21s level.\nTuchel: How did we get here so quickly and quietly?\nWhat challenges lie ahead for Tuchel?\nTuchel - a sacrifice of principle or best man for England job?",

        "article_text": "On Friday, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, found himself in a particularly uncomfortable position.\nPresident Donald Trump was singing his praises. And former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other influential Democrats were expressing their dismay with him \u2013 or worse.\nThis was Schumer's fate the day after he decided to back a Republican-crafted measure to avert a possible US government shutdown this weekend. \nLater, he followed through on his promise, voting with nine other Democrats and all but one Republican to overcome the key procedural hurdle that - if Democrats had stuck together in opposition - would have prevented  the funding bill from coming to a final vote.\nThe Senate bill, which passed that final vote shortly after, contained a number of provisions that angered liberals. These included cuts to non-military programmes, increased spending on border security, limits on how Congress can rescind Trump's tariffs and draconian restrictions on Washington DC's budget.\nSchumer acknowledged all of this, but said he was backing the bill because a shutdown, which would allow the president to determine what government services and employees to suspend, would be worse.\n\"I believe it is the best way to minimise the harm that the Trump administration will do to the American people,\" he said on Friday. \"Allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via government shutdown is a far worse option.\"\nIt didn't take long after Schumer's announcement for Democratic second guessing \u2013 and straight-up outrage \u2013 to ensue.\n\"Chuck Schumer is unwilling and unable to meet the moment,\" the Democratic group Pass the Torch, which led calls for Joe Biden to end his re-election bid last summer, said in a statement.\nPelosi, who wields considerable influence among House Democrats despite having stepped down from her leadership position, decried what she said was a \"false choice\" between a shutdown and accepting the Republican measure.\n\"We must fight back in a better way,\" she said, suggesting a short-term funding extension and new bipartisan negotiations. She called the Republican bill a \"blank cheque that makes a devastating assault on the well-being of working families across America\".\nIn a Friday press conference, the current House Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries of New York, dodged questions about Schumer. When asked if he still had confidence in his Senate counterpart, he tersely replied: \"Next question.\"\nOthers in the party were less circumspect. Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia told reporters that he expected \"new leadership\" in the Senate next year \u2013 or after the next presidential election in 2028.\nA group of 60 House Democrats \u2013 who joined all but one in their party to vote against the Republican bill in that chamber \u2013 penned a letter to Schumer, saying that the legislation \"potentially legitimises President Trump and the Republican party's dismantling of government\".\n\"If Republicans in Congress want to pass this bill,\" they wrote, \"they should do so with their own votes.\"\nAs if to add rub salt on Democratic wounds, Trump took to his Truth Social website on Friday morning to praise what he said was a \"good and smart move\" by Schumer \u2013 and to promise that more Republican legislation on taxes, spending and \"so much more\" was coming.\n\"This could lead to something big for USA,\" he wrote, \"a whole new direction and beginning!\"\nWhile many rank-and-file Democrats and liberal activists clamoured for Schumer and Senate Democrats to block the House measure even if it triggered a government shutdown, it is unclear whether such a move would have pressured Trump and Republicans to negotiate a less partisan government-funding bill.\nIn fact, there are many on the right, including Trump's designated government slasher, Elon Musk, who were relishing an opportunity to use a shutdown to further hamstring the federal bureaucracy. \nAfter days, or weeks, of shutdown pain that would disproportionately affect their supporters, the Democratic Party could have found itself in the same place it is now \u2013 with limited power and few good options.\n\"Neither House Democrats nor the people voting 'no' in the Senate nor the people getting mad on Twitter have an actual strategy for getting what the base wants out of this, which is some kind of act of Congress saying that Trump and Musk need to conduct the government differently,\" writes Matthew Yglesias, a left-leaning commentator.\nDemocrats have the power to block Republican legislation, but they simply don't have the votes to advance their own alternative either in the House or the Senate.\nThat doesn't make the situation Schumer and the Democrats have found themselves in any easier to stomach, however. Republicans, by sticking together, have been able to exert their will in Congress, while Trump pushes the boundaries of presidential power.\nElections, as they say, have consequences. And 2024's results have left Democrats deep in the wilderness.",

        "article_text": "Vladimir Putin has said he agrees with the idea of a ceasefire in Ukraine, but that \"questions\" remain about the nature of a truce - as he set out a number of tough conditions for peace.\nThe Russian president was responding to a plan for a 30-day ceasefire, which Ukraine agreed to earlier this week following talks with the US. \nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described Putin's response to the plan as \"manipulative\" and called for more sanctions on Russia. \nMeanwhile, the US placed further sanctions on Russian oil, gas and banking sectors.\nRussian officials said Putin was expected to hold talks on the ceasefire on Thursday evening with US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, who had flown to Moscow earlier that day. \nIt is not clear whether that meeting actually took place. On Friday, Russia's state media quoted the air traffic monitor Flightradar as saying the plane believed to be carrying Witkoff had left Moscow.\nMoscow and Washington have not commented on the issue.\nLate on Thursday and overnight, both Russia and Ukraine reported new enemy drone attacks. \nUkraine said seven people - including children - were injured in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv.\nRussia reported a large fire at an oil facility in the southern city of Tuapse. \nSpeaking at a news conference in Moscow on Thursday, Putin said of the ceasefire proposal: \"The idea is right - and we support it - but there are questions that we need to discuss.\"\nA ceasefire should lead to \"an enduring peace and remove the root causes of this crisis\", Putin said. \n\"We need to negotiate with our American colleagues and partners,\" he said. \"Maybe I'll have a call with Donald Trump.\"\nPutin added: \"It will be good for the Ukrainian side to achieve a 30-day ceasefire.\n\"We are in favour of it, but there are nuances.\"\nOne of the areas of contention is Russia's western Kursk region, Putin said, where Ukraine launched a military incursion last August and captured some territory. \nHe claimed Russia was fully back in control of Kursk, and said Ukrainian troops there \"have been isolated\".\n\"They are trying to leave, but we are in control. Their equipment has been abandoned,\" Putin said.\n\"There are two options for Ukrainians in Kursk - surrender or die.\"\nUkraine's top commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said a day earlier that Ukrainian troops would hold defensive positions in the Kursk region \"as long as it is expedient and necessary\" despite \"increased\" pressure from Russian forces.\nAt Thursday's press conference, Putin also outlined some of his questions over how a ceasefire would work. He asked: \"How will those 30 days be used? For Ukraine to mobilise? Rearm? Train people? Or none of that? Then a question - how will that be controlled?\n\"Who will give the order to end the fighting? At what cost? Who decides who has broken any possible ceasefire, over 2,000km? All those questions need meticulous work from both sides. Who polices it?\"\nPutin \"doesn't say no directly\", Zelensky said in his nightly video address, but \"in practice, he's preparing a rejection\".\nHe added: \"Putin, of course, is afraid to tell President Trump directly that he wants to continue this war, wants to kill Ukrainians.\" \nThe Russian leader had set so many pre-conditions \"that nothing will work out at all\", Zelensky said. \nAfter Putin's remarks and Zelensky's response, there is now a clear divide between both sides' positions. \nUkraine wants a two-stage process: a quick ceasefire and then talks about a longer-term settlement. \nRussia believes you cannot separate the two processes and all the issues should be decided in a single deal. Both sides seem content to argue their differences. \nUkraine believes it can put pressure on Russia, painting it as a reluctant peacemaker, playing for time. Russia, equally, believes it has a chance now to raise its fundamental concerns, about Nato expansion and Ukraine's sovereignty. \nBut this presents a problem for Donald Trump. He has made it clear he wants a quick result, ending the fighting in days. \nAnd right now, Putin does not appear to want to play ball. \nSpeaking at the White House following Putin's remarks, Trump said he would \"love\" to meet the Russian leader and that he hoped Russia would \"do the right thing\" and agree to the proposed 30-day truce. \n\"We'd like to see a ceasefire from Russia,\" he said. \nSpeaking earlier at a meeting in the Oval Office with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump told reporters he had already discussed specifics with Ukraine.\n\"We've been discussing with Ukraine land and pieces of land that would be kept and lost, and all of the other elements of a final agreement,\" Trump said.\n\"A lot of the details of a final agreement have actually been discussed.\"\nOn the subject of Ukraine joining the Nato military alliance, Trump said \"everybody knows what the answer to that is\".\nThe fresh sanctions on Russian oil and gas came as the Trump administration further restricted access to US payment systems, making it harder for other countries to buy Russian oil.\nEarlier in the day, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov rejected the ceasefire proposal put forward by the US.\nOn Wednesday, the Kremlin released a video it said showed Putin visiting Russia's Kursk region, symbolically dressed in military fatigues. Russia later said it recaptured the key town of Sudzha.\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022, and now controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.\nMore than 95,000 people fighting for Russia's military have been killed in the war, according to data analysed so far and confirmed by the BBC. The actual death toll is believed to be much higher.\nRussia's military has not publicly revealed its battlefield casualties since September 2022, when it said 5,937 soldiers had been killed.\nUkraine last updated its casualty figures in December 2024, when Zelensky acknowledged 43,000 Ukrainian deaths among soldiers and officers. Western analysts believe this figure to be underestimated.",

        "article_text": "Parents who are worried about their children being on Roblox should not let them use it, the chief executive of the gigantic gaming platform has said.\nThe site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.\nBut its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.\nWhen asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"\n\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.\nResponding to the interview, Mumsnet boss Justine Roberts said parents on the forum had spoken of how they struggled to manage their children's use of Roblox.\n\"There are parental controls, and our users would urge constant parental supervision,\" she told the BBC.\n\"But we all know that with the best will in the world life sometimes gets in the way. \n\"If you've got multiple children you're looking after and things happen, and you probably can't 24/7 watch everything they're doing, even if you've got all your parental controls set.\"\nEllie Gibson - from the Scummy Mummies podcast - said Mr Baszucki's message risked sounding \"a bit of a get out\".\n\"It's much easier said than done, especially when all their friends are playing it,\" she told the BBC.\nUS-based Roblox is one of the world's largest games platforms, with more monthly users than Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation combined. In 2024 it averaged more than 80 million players per day \u2013 roughly 40% of them below the age of 13. Its vast empire includes some 40 million user-generated games and experiences.\nIn the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.\nBut Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.\n\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.\n\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"\nPlayers who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.\nIn November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.\nHowever, the BBC was able to create two fake accounts, one aged 15 and one aged 27, on unlinked devices and exchange messages between the two.\nWhile the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.\nWhen we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.\n\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.\nHe admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.\nWe also put to him some Roblox game titles that the BBC has discovered were recommended by the platform to an 11 year-old recently, including:\nWhen we asked whether he thought they were appropriate, he said he puts his faith in the platform's age rating systems.\n\"One thing that's really important for the way we do things here, is it's not just on the title of the experience, it's literally on the content of the experience as well,\" he says.\nHe insists that when Roblox rates experience, they go through rigorous guidelines and that the company has a \"consistent policy\" on that.\nMr Baszucki founded the platform with Eric Cassel in 2004 and released it to the public in 2006 \u2013 a year before the first Apple iPhone appeared, heralding the start of the smartphone era.\nMr Baszucki describes his younger self as \"less of a gamer, and more of an engineer\", and the pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution. But they soon noticed that kids weren't only using the product to do their homework.\n\"They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox,\" he says.\nThe name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.\nMr Cassel noticed some players \"starting to act out\" and not always behaving in a \"civilised\" way a couple of months after it launched, recalls Mr Baszucki.\nHe says the roots of building a \"trust and safety system\" therefore began \"very, very early\" and that in those earlier days there were four people acting as safety moderators.\n\"It kind of is what launched this safety civility foundation,\" he adds.\nBut despite attracting decent numbers, it was a year later, when the firm launched its digital currency Robux, that it really started to make money.\nPlayers buy Robux and use it to purchase accessories and unlock content. Content creators now get 70% of the fee, and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.\nMr Baszucki says there was some initial resistance among the leadership team about Roblox becoming more than a hobby for its players, with the introduction of a digital economy.\nRobux stayed, and the firm is now worth $41bn (\u00a331bn).\nIts share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.\nMr Baszucki compares his experience of building Roblox with how Walt Disney may have felt about his creations.\nHe describes his job as \"a little like having the opportunity he had a long time ago when he was designing the Magic Kingdom\", and is focused on Roblox's ongoing evolution into a Metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form.\nThey have also been public in their ambitions to eventually attract 10% of the world's gamers.\nAsked to describe Roblox in three words, he replies: \"The future of communication.\"\nWe finish our time together playing a couple of his favourite games: Natural Disaster Survival and Dress to Impress.\nWe use his account and he's constantly recognised by other players \u2014 but we still get smashed to pieces by a blizzard outside the Natural Disasters mansion.\nAdditional reporting by Ammie Sekhon\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the biggest developments in global technology, with analysis from BBC correspondents around the world.

They said doing so would prevent politicians from interfering too much in how front line services are run - but critics say that change has made it harder to carry out reform or drive improvement.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer believes that overhauling management structures will put NHS in England \"back into democratic control\" and free up money for front-line services. \nNHS England is also responsible for other functions like overseeing training and collecting data, as well as managing GP services.\nThere are separate organisations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, so these changes only impact England.\nWithin the NHS and Westminster, the writing has been on the wall for NHS England for some months.\nEven in the latter years of the Tory government, health ministers expressed frustration that they were not in charge of the day-to-day running of the health service.\nWhen Labour came into power, it was clear Health Secretary Wes Streeting wanted more control of the NHS and saw a lot of duplication and bureaucracy.\nNHS England's chief executive Amanda Pritchard recently said she would step down at the end of the March and a number of her senior leadership team have followed suit.\nIn that respect, it was clear there was going to be significant reform - but this is as big a change as you could possibly get at the heart of the NHS management structure.\nThese are two words we have heard the government use a lot when setting out why it is scrapping NHS England and bringing the health service under closer government control.\nIn this context, bureaucracy is a stand-in word for a system that is particularly complicated, or requires excessive amounts of administration, paperwork, regulations or layers of management.\nStarmer made it clear he thinks this sort of admin is getting in the way of delivering health services.\nWe also heard him describe NHS England as the \"world's largest quango\" - a term that stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation.\nIn short, quangos are bodies like regulators and advisory groups, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by central government. They do things on behalf of the government, but are not directly controlled by ministers.\nThey range from big organisations like NHS England, Network Rail and the Environment Agency to smaller ones like the British Film Institute and Gambling Commission. \nTheir numbers have fallen by more than half since 2010 because David Cameron's coalition government abolished nearly 300 - but there are still more than 300 across the UK.\nLabour has set up more than 20 since winning the election last July, including Great British Energy and Skills England.\nThe total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - when the latest figures were published - was \u00a3353bn.\nWe do not yet know all of the detail about how health services in England will be managed in the future but it is likely that some of the responsibilities NHS England currently holds will be devolved down to regional bodies.\nOne of the arguments being made about NHS reform is that if you move decision-making down to a local level and nearer to patients, it will be health leaders who are more attuned to the needs of patients in the area making those calls.\nThey will know what local populations need and where the weaknesses are - and that, in theory, could improve services for patients in different parts of the country.\nThursday's announcement was not about funding - that is expected in the summer.\nWe already know NHS is getting an uplift of about 3-4% next year and we do not yet know what spending will look like beyond that.\nBut government sources believe scrapping NHS England will save the government \u00a3500m a year.\nOn access to medicines, it is the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - which is separate from NHS England - which sets the guidelines on what treatments are judged affordable and cost effective.\nWhen a new drug is produced by the pharmaceutical industry, the institute will decide if the NHS can afford it and whether it is better than other drugs that are used.

Ministers have requested urgent advice on the issue.\"\nAlthough not a cure, abiraterone can help stop prostate cancer spreading to other parts of the body. \nIn England and Northern Ireland, the drug is only approved for men with very advanced prostate cancer which has spread already. \nIn Wales and Scotland, people with the disease that has not yet spread can also get it.\nResearch has shown that for these earlier stage patients, the survival rate after six years is improved and that the drug halved the rate of progression of the cancer.\nThe charity says many lives could be extended by the drug, given the findings from a trial called Stampede, published in 2022. \nIt found improved odds of survival among men given the drug alongside usual care, and concluded that abiraterone should be considered a new standard treatment. \nAccording to figures from NHS England, each year about 8,400 patients have high-risk prostate cancer that has not yet spread. \nUsing the Stampede assumptions, 672 of those men could die prematurely without access to abiraterone.\nIn October 2023, BBC News spoke to Giles Turner, a retired banker living in Sussex. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier that year but was told that abiraterone could not be obtained on the NHS in England. \nHe chose to pay for treatment with the drug at \u00a3250 a month. He told us then that he felt \"very fortunate\" to be able to afford it, but outraged for others who could not. \nAt the time, NHS England said it was reviewing the drug's use for a wider range of men. \nHowever, in December 2024 it told Prostate Cancer UK that \"it has not been possible to identify the necessary recurrent headroom in revenue budgets\". \nBecause abiraterone is a generic drug which has gone \"off patent\" and is licensed for only one group of prostate cancer patients, there is a complicated process to get it approved for wider use.\nEach year, NHS England can make \"discretionary\" investment decisions with a specialist advisory group, but it has chosen not to for this drug. \nSmyth's letter earlier this month said the process had to look at \"the overall budget impact of introducing a new treatment based on patient volumes\", and ministers would not intervene.\nMr Turner said he was \"stunned\" that nearly one-and-a-half years after the BBC report, NHS England had not caught up with NHS Scotland and NHS Wales. \nHe has spent \u00a320,000 so far on his treatment, and said he felt it was wrong that while expensive new patented drugs treatments could be funded, abiraterone - costing the NHS \u00a377 per pack per month - could not be.

        "article_text": "Netflix's latest big-budget film The Electric State, starring Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt, is one of the most expensive movies ever made, and had some of the most scathing reviews in recent memory. But that doesn't mean it will flop.\nFilm critics haven't minced their words when delivering their verdicts on The Electric State.\nIt is \"a turgid eyesore\" and \"top-dollar tedium\", according to the Times. It's \"slick but dismally soulless\", declared the Hollywood Reporter, while the New York Times called it  \"obvious, garish and just plain dumb\".\nPaste pointed out its eye-watering budget, billing it as \"the most banal way you can spend $320m\". Warming to the theme, the magazine summed it up as \"one hell of an artistically neutered, sanitized boondoggle\".\nThere have been some kinder reviews. Empire said it was \"breezily watchable\" and worth three stars, while the Telegraph awarded four stars to the \"Spielbergian treat\".\nBut overall, its 15% Rotten Tomatoes score is a meagre return for any major film, especially one costing such a lot. The $320m (\u00a3247m) figure has been widely reported but neither confirmed nor denied by Netflix. It would make The Electric State the most expensive streaming film ever.\nCritics' opinions, however, have become more irrelevant in the streaming age. The bad reviews didn't stop The Electric State from going straight to number one on Netflix's chart after its release on Friday. \nIt fits into Netflix making star-packed, entertaining and escapist movies that often get panned by reviewers - but are watched by hundreds of millions of subscribers.\n\"I would love to say that what I've written and what other critics have written will matter, but I just don't think it will,\" says Digital Spy movies editor Ian Sandwell.\nSandwell awarded the film two stars out of five, noting that the action and visual effects are \"decent\", the robots are \"impressive\" and the finale is \"epic\".\n\"My main problem was they'd created this really impressive, visually spectacular world and then just told quite a generic seen-it-all-before story inside it,\" he says.\nBad reviews might have put people off paying to see the film if it had been released in cinemas, he says. \"But on Netflix, I think it will still be absolutely massive. I don't think bad reviews will matter at all.\"\nWhile a critic's job is to a analyse a movie, \"audiences probably do just want a big, spectacular blockbuster to watch at home, with two massive stars\", he adds.\nThe Electric State follows Brown, Pratt and a succession of zany robots in an alternative version of 1990s America, where there has been a war between humans and intelligent bots.\nIt also stars Ke Huy Quan, Stanley Tucci and the voices of Woody Harrelson and Brian Cox, and is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo - who have made four Marvel movies, including the wildly successful Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame.\nThe Electric State is based on the graphic novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag, although some critics pointed out that Netflix had missed the book's point about the perils of a consumerist society addicted to technology.\nThe film is \"absolutely not\" value for money in terms of quality, says City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford.\nAnd it remains to be seen whether the film makes financial sense for Netflix, she says.\nThe streaming giant's most popular ever film, 2021's Red Notice, has had 231 million views, according to Netflix's measurements. \n\"The Electric State will be hoping for that kind of performance, just as a $320m theatrically released movie would be aiming to break box office records,\" Luxford says.\n\"The higher the price, the higher the target for success, even with a business model as opaque as Netflix's.\"\nRed Notice, an action-packed art crime caper starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, has a lukewarm 39% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes - but a 92% audience rating.\nOther recent Netflix hits have been lapped up by viewers more than reviewers.\nBrooke Shields' lightweight multi-generational rom-com Mother of the Bride has a 13% critics' score, Jennifer Lopez's AI action thriller Atlas is on 19%, Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx's family spy escapade Back In Action has 29%, and Kevin Hart's heist comedy Lift is on 30%.\nThey are enjoyable but forgettable - and easy to watch in the midst of potential distractions at home. The Hollywood Reporter described Atlas as \"another Netflix movie made to half-watch while doing laundry\" - summing up this new genre.\nIn December, N+1 magazine quoted several screenwriters as saying a common request from Netflix executives is for characters to announce what they're doing \"so that viewers who have this programme on in the background can follow along\".\n\"Electric State does feel like that,\" Sandwell continues, \"where there are just random big dumps of the characters explaining exactly what's happened, sometimes something we've seen recently, just in case you're not following along.\n\"But it does depend on the movie.\"\nNetflix does have serious and critically-acclaimed movies, too, of course, but they are often not such crowd-pleasers. Emilia Perez, which led this year's Oscar nominations, has not troubled the Netflix global top 10 charts.\nAnother critic, Gav Squires, says many of Netflix's films are \"very average\", but don't usually have such astronomical budgets as The Electric State.\n\"Netflix know what they're doing,\" he says. \"They know that people are probably watching on a second screen, they're not paying full attention. So when they're putting stuff out that costs $30m that people aren't really watching and is kind of average, I'm not too fussed about it.\n\"But when they're spending $320m on a movie, I start getting really angry. $320m would have paid the budgets for the last, I think, 10 best picture Oscar winners.\n\"And it just feels like really, really bad value for money at that point.\"",

        "article_text": "Abercrombie & Fitch must pay for the legal fees of former CEO Mike Jeffries as he defends criminal charges of sex trafficking, a US court has ruled.\nThe fashion brand, which has previously said it was \"appalled and disgusted\" by Mr Jeffries' alleged conduct, had signed an agreement in 2014 when the ex-CEO resigned, covering him for the costs of any criminal proceedings which arose from his position.\nThe company had argued in court that the charges, which allege Mr Jeffries ran an international prostitution and sex trafficking business, related to his personal life and not his work.\nBut a judge found that the \"horrific\" charges, filed last year, were tied to his corporate role.\nThe court's ruling could have significant financial and legal ramifications for Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F) - a billion-dollar public company with more than 750 stores worldwide, including the Hollister brand. Legal experts told the BBC the bill for the company is likely to run into millions of dollars.\nThe decision also raises questions about why the company made the far-reaching indemnity agreement when Mr Jeffries stepped down more than a decade ago. The BBC has previously asked A&F about the circumstances surrounding this agreement, and if it had been aware of any allegations against Mr Jeffries at the time, but it declined to comment.\nMr Jeffries, who ran the retailer for 22 years, is currently on bail after pleading not guilty to the charges along with his British life partner, Matthew Smith, and their middleman in the alleged trafficking operation, James Jacobson.\nThe arrests followed a BBC investigation in 2023 that revealed Mr Jeffries and his partner were at the centre of a sophisticated operation scouting young men for sex in the US and abroad.\nRuling that Mr Jeffries' indemnification agreement does cover the criminal charges against him, Judge Paul Fioravanti said: \"In my view, Jeffries's conduct, as alleged in the indictment, as horrific as it is, has a causal connection to his official capacity and status as CEO of Abercrombie.\"\nThe criminal legal costs come in addition to fees in Mr Jeffries' civil cases, which A&F was ordered to pay last year on similar grounds.\nAlong with Mr Jeffries, A&F is defending multiple civil lawsuits from alleged victims, accusing the brand of having facilitated and funded his \"criminal enterprise\".\n\"Jeffries' legal fees will be millions of dollars when it's all said and done,\" said Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of West Coast Trial Lawyers.\nA former federal prosecutor and partner at Shihata & Geddes, Elizabeth Geddes, added: \"You'll have high-paid lawyers charging by the hour, especially if this leads to both a civil and criminal trial which can be expensive and time-consuming.\" \nCompanies can indemnify executives, even for criminal charges, she said, though this would typically be in cases of white-collar crime such as fraud and not sex trafficking.\nMr Rahmani said the Abercrombie & Fitch agreement was \"unique\" in its coverage of criminal conduct. \"Generally, criminal conduct is not something that you can insure for because it falls outside the scope of any company's business,\" he said.\nThe criminal charges against Mr Jeffries date from 2008 to 2015. He stepped down as chief executive of A&F in December 2014 after two decades in charge.\nUS prosecutors allege he had used his wealth, power and status as CEO \"to traffic men for his own sexual pleasure\" and for the pleasure of his partner, Mr Smith.\nA&F is not a defendant in the criminal case, but the latest ruling means it will now have to reimburse Mr Jeffries for legal fees dating back to 2023, as well as advance him funds for his ongoing defence.\nOn top of the legal fees of its former CEO, the company may also face further costs in civil cases it is defending if a court orders compensation to be paid out or both parties agree a settlement.\nDespite the severity of the allegations, the company has been reporting record sales, amounting to $4.95bn (\u00a33.84bn) in the past year.\n\"It doesn't appear as though A&F are at a detriment financially [in sales or share price] due to the lawsuits surrounding Mike Jeffries,\" said Heather Cucolo, a New York Law School professor.\nShe said it was interesting that the company appeared to have been able to \"spin\" or \"stifle some of the information that's out there\".\nFollowing the BBC's investigation, A&F opened an independent investigation and suspended $1m (\u00a3770,000) annual retirement payments to Mr Jeffries.\nIt added that new leadership has transformed the company, and it has \"zero tolerance for abuse, harassment or discrimination of any kind\".",

        "article_text": "Meta has won an emergency ruling in the US to temporarily stop a former director of Facebook from promoting or further distributing copies of her memoir.\nThe book, Careless People by Sarah Wynn-Williams, who used to be the company's global public policy director, includes a series of critical claims about what she witnessed during her seven years working at Facebook.\nFacebook's parent company, Meta, says the ruling - which orders her to stop promotions \"to the extent within her control\" - affirms that \"the false and defamatory book should never have been published\".\nThe UK publisher Macmillan says it is \"committed to upholding freedom of speech\" and Ms Wynn-Williams' \"right to tell her story\".\nIt told the BBC that she had been due to do \"extensive media\" in the UK and internationally and \"has been prevented from doing so\".\nAt a hearing on Wednesday at the American Arbitration Association - a neutral third party which resolves disputes out of court - Ms Wynn-Williams was told she must refrain from engaging in or \"amplifying any further disparaging, crucial or otherwise detrimental comments\".\nAll previous disparaging comments \"to the extent within her control\" must also be retracted, the ruling also said.\nThe book is former New Zealand diplomat Ms Wynn-Williams' account of joining Facebook in 2011 and watching it grow from a \"front row seat\".\nHer allegations include that executives had worked \"hand in glove\" with the Chinese government on potential ways of allowing Beijing to censor and control content in exchange for access to the lucrative market.\nMeta disputes the allegations contained in the book. Regarding China, it says it is \"no secret we were once interested\" in operating services there. \"We ultimately opted not to go through with the ideas we'd explored.\"\nMs Wynn-Williams has also filed a whistleblower complaint with the US markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging Meta misled investors - which Meta also denies. The BBC has reviewed the complaint.\nDuring the emergency hearing the arbitrator, Nicholas Gowen, found Meta had provided enough evidence that Ms Wynn-Williams had potentially violated her severance contract. She did not personally attend Thursday's hearing.\nIn his ruling, Mr Gowan said Meta would suffer \"immediate and irreparable loss\" in the absence of a temporary ruling in the case.\nHe did not order the book's publisher, Flatiron Books, or its parent company, Macmillan, to take any action.\nThe ruling will remain in effect unless it is modified or lifted following a full hearing.\nFollowing the decision, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a post on X: \"This ruling affirms that Sarah Wynn-Williams' false and defamatory book should never have been published.\"\nCareless People was released in the US, where it is number six on the Amazon chart, on Tuesday.

She did not personally attend Thursday's hearing.In his ruling, Mr Gowan said Meta would suffer \"immediate and irreparable loss\" in the absence of a temporary ruling in the case.He did not order the book's publisher, Flatiron Books, or its parent company, Macmillan, to take any action.The ruling will remain in effect unless it is modified or lifted following a full hearing.Following the decision, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a post on X: \"This ruling affirms that Sarah Wynn-Williams' false and defamatory book should never have been published. \"Ms Wynn-Williams has also filed a whistleblower complaint with the US markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging Meta misled investors - which Meta also denies. \"We ultimately opted not to go through with the ideas we'd explored. \"MetaFacebookPublishing",

        "article_text": "The fabled route leading to Machu Picchu is one of the world's most jaw-droppingly beautiful treks \u2013 but it's also plagued by controversies that travellers can avoid.\nAt 2,840m above sea level, the trail leaves the rushing Urubamba River that carves Cusco's Sacred Valley and winds its way uphill. It ascends past Andean cloud forests to Warmiwa\u00f1usca, the infamous \"Dead Woman's Pass\" at 4,215m, before descending to the ancient Inca citadel of Machu Picchu, one of the Seven New Wonders of the World.\nThis is the legendary Inca Trail, South America's most popular hike and one of the world's most jaw-droppingly beautiful treks. In an effort to protect the path, which was designed and built more than 600 years ago by Inca engineers, the Peruvian government limits the number of passes available to visitors during the trail's March-to-January opening (the trail opens 31 March 2025). As a result, every year permits for the 43km hike sell out quickly as travellers try to secure one of the roughly 200 daily passes allocated daily for tourists.\nIronically, the Inca Trail's popularity contrasts with frequent protests that often leave hundreds of travellers stranded, as the porters tasked with hauling hikers' gear across the mountains petition for better working conditions. While these protests rarely reach English-language publications, the Porters' Voice Collective (an organisation aiming to elevate the rights of Inca Trail workers) released a documentary in 2024 detailing these struggles.\nHow can such an idyllic place hike generate so much conflict? According to the trail's Indigenous guides, the problem is a lack of law enforcement governing porters' working conditions.\nSince mules are prohibited on the Inca Trail because their hooves would destroy the ancient stone paving and stairs, trekkers are required to hire porters to haul their camping equipment. Porters' days often begin at 05:00 and end after 22:00. While a 2022 law mandates that porters receive s/650 Peruvian Nuevo Soles (\u00a3140 or $176) for the four-day trek, very few trekking agencies abide by this and pay as little as s/350 (\u00a375 or $95) per trek. Since the law was passed, trekking agency lawyers have been fighting it, and in the meantime refusing to pay the legal wage.\nInca Trail permits\nTrekking independently on the Inca Trail isn't allowed. Instead, travellers must obtain a permit and hire porters through a licensed tour operator such as Evolution Treks Peru or Intrepid Travel.\nIn addition to trekking agencies not compensating porters properly, many companies require their porters to carry more weight than the 20kg maximum that is also stipulated in the law.\n\"Most [male] porters carry about 30kg, and I've seen 40kg packs,\" says Natalia Amao Huillca, who has been guiding travellers along the Inca Trail since 2007. \"About 80% of the injuries I see in porters are knee injuries. The others are mostly back injuries. They frequently ask me for pain pills in the evening.\"\nAccording to Cenovia Quispe Flores, who has worked as a porter for Evolution Treks Peru since 2018, \"The law for women is 15kg,\" but she says she has seen women working for other companies carrying 25 to 30kg. To get around weight limits, many companies either send gear around the first checkpoint where porters' backpacks are weighed or simply pay those off who enforce these limits.\n\"In theory, the checkpoint is strict, but in practice, it's not strict for everybody,\" explains Shandira Arque Lucana, who has guided hikers on the Inca Trail since 2016. She says that big companies cut deals with people working the checkpoints but that small companies don't have enough influence to evade enforcement.\nThoughtful Travel\nWant to travel better?\u00a0Thoughtful Travel\u00a0is a series on the ways people behave while away, from ethics to etiquette and more.\nEven companies that want to play by the rules can find themselves stymied by the strict limit of 500 total people (which includes 300 non-tourist porters and guides) allowed on the trail each day. Sometimes there is extra weight but no way to add an extra porter.\n\"I've seen many porters working with hernias, bad knees and ankle problems,\" says Pedro, a guide who asked not to be identified by his real name. \"I know a porter who became an alcoholic because he couldn't get treatment for his injured knee. He still works on the Inca Trail, and he dulls the pain with ca\u00f1azo (a liquor made from sugarcane)\".\nPorters also suffer from dehydration. They drink unclean water from streams and handwashing taps near bathrooms, though paying customers get filtered and boiled water.\nWith all this in mind, what should travellers know if they want to trek South America's most famous ruins in a responsible, ethical way? According to local guides, the first thing to remember is that there are other treks that lead to Machu Picchu.\n\"The Inca Trail is not the only option,\" says Liz Montesinos Pumayalle, who has worked as a guide on the Inca Trail for eight years and notes that mules are used instead of porters on all other trails. \"People who want to connect with Indigenous communities should hike the Lares Trek. The Salkantay Trek (which has two options that connect to Machu Picchu directly and other routes that connect indirectly) is best for people who want to sleep in eco-domes or lodges, rather than tents.\"\nAmao Huillca notes that companies who hire many female porters often treat their staff better than those who only have one or none. \"I like working with porter teams that are half women and have a woman head porter,\" she says. \"Most companies send one or two token women porters.\" She says that because female porters are more inclined to go to a doctor when they're injured than their male colleagues, tourists who request women porters are more likely to trek with healthier porters.\n\"One way to ensure that porters are treated and paid well is for there to be women porters,\" echoes Inca Trail guide Edson Lucana Mej\u00eda. He explains that it has historically been common for male porters to sleep in the dining tent, which doesn't have a floor and is often muddy. Women usually insist on individual tents, so in a team with more women, you can be sure that more porters have a decent place to sleep. \u00a0\nMarco Antonio Carri\u00f3n, who has been guiding treks on the Inca Trail for 20 years offers other recommendations. \"Look for photos of porters with ergonomic backpacks and for reviews that mention something about how porters are treated,\" he says. \"If a company is sustainable and treats the porters well, it will show in the online reviews.\"\nThe lighter, the better\nMany operators still require porters to carry heavy canvas tents, tables and chairs. When considering a company, ask how much their camping equipment weighs and if they have lightweight options.\nIn addition, Carri\u00f3n says travellers should ask if porters are required to wear their employer's uniforms. While it may be a small detail in some cultures, for many Indigenous Peruvians, traditional Quechua clothing is an important part of their identity.\nDespite allegations of mistreatment by certain Inca Trail operators, many guides and porters not only feel fulfilled, but also fortunate to work in such a stunning natural setting. \"I love this work\" says Quispe Flores. \"I like the mountains and working with my friends, the other women porters. Working in agriculture is harder and doesn't pay.\"\nWhile it isn't always easy to determine which companies follow the law and which don't, Lucana Mej\u00eda has one message he wishes the many thousands of travellers hoping to hike the fabled route will remember: \"Without porters, there is no Inca Trail.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "As leaders around the world try to figure out how best to deal with the new Trump administration, one Canadian official has come out swinging.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford, a regular on major US networks where he has addressed Americans directly, was among the first in Canada to pull US alcohol off the shelves as a trade war between the two neighbours ramped up.\nFord has also ripped up a multi-million dollar contract with Elon Musk's Starlink, and has been unafraid to use energy exports to the US as a bargaining chip - all in a bid to get Trump to withdraw his tariff threats against Canada.\nThe right-wing, plain-spoken politician admitted he was initially delighted Donald Trump won re-election and viewed him as an ally.\nBut then, Ford said, using an expletive, the US president pulled a knife and \"yanked it into us\".\nThis week, it appeared that Ford's unusual tactics had grabbed Trump's attention.\nSpeaking to reporters on the White House lawn on Tuesday, the US president described Ford as a \"very strong man\" as he addressed Ontario's threat to slap a 25% surcharge on US-bound electricity.\nFord has since shelved that plan pending further discussions with the Trump administration. But his threat to hike the price of electricity on Americans seems to have earned him a grudging nod of respect from Trump, who later backed off from doubling tariffs on aluminium and steel to 50%.\nIt also helped Ford score a meeting with US officials in Washington to discuss the future of the Canada-US trade relationship. \nFord sat on Thursday with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The meeting was also attended by Canada's Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc.\nThe meeting was \"very, very productive\" though \"bumps in the road\" remain, he said afterwards. \nIt is unclear whether Ford's defiant stance will earn Canada more favours from Trump. It is also an approach that is not unanimously agreed on, with Premier Danielle Smith of the oil-rich Alberta vehemently refusing to withhold any of her province's energy exports to the US.\nTrump's recent willingness to turn down the heat, however, signals that Ford may be succeeding in grabbing the attention of the US, said Shakir Chambers, a Canadian Conservative strategist at the Toronto-based Oyster Group.\n\"That's how you deal with Trump, through a position of strength,\" Mr Chambers told the BBC. \"Ford understands the language of Trump's people and inner circle.\"\nIt at least earned him a rare compliment from the US president, who for several months has berated Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau repeatedly by calling him \"governor,\" while expressing his desire to absorb Canada and make it \"the 51st state\".\nAlso rare is seeing the Oval Office pay attention to the premier of a Canadian province, whose day-to-day is ordinarily preoccupied with domestic matters such as infrastructure projects, healthcare funding and co-operating with the federal government.\nBut these are no ordinary times in Canada. The country is in the middle of a transfer of power, from outgoing Trudeau to Prime Minister-designate Mark Carney.\nIt is also facing what has been referred to as an \"existential threat\" from its neighbour and long-time ally to the south.\nAnnouncing his intention to pause energy tariffs pending trade talks, Ford vowed to Canadians that he will not \"roll over\" and warned that using Ontario's energy supply as a bargaining chip remains on the table. \nBut he said he will not ignore the chance to resolve this dispute with Americans.\nHis emergence as the face of Canada's fight is, in many ways, understandable. As Ontario premier, he is at the helm of a province that is home to 16 million people and Canada's large auto manufacturing sector, which is deeply intertwined with that of the US, leaving it vulnerable to any broad tariff threats.\nHe is also chair of the Council of the Federation, a multilateral congress that includes all of Canada's provincial and territorial premiers.\nOn Wednesday, Ford kept busy ahead of his meeting with the Americans. He sat down for breakfast with incoming Prime Minister Carney, where the two discussed the need to \"stand firm and strong\" to Trump.\nAmericans will undoubtedly see more of Ford in the coming weeks and months. The premier just decisively secured four more years in office after campaigning on standing up against the US president.\nFor Ontarians, Ford is a well-known figure. He has led the province since 2018 and is only the second premier in its history to secure three consecutive majority government wins.\nHe is the product of a Toronto political dynasty known as \"Ford Nation\". For many years, he was overshadowed by his younger brother, the late Rob Ford, who was the mayor of Toronto from 2010 to 2014 before he was ousted after a crack cocaine scandal.\nLocally, the Fords are infamous for their \"authentic\" and approachable style of politics, said Mr Chambers, who was coached high school football by the younger Ford.\nPremier Ford is known for handing out his personal cell phone number to constituents, encouraging them to contact him directly. During a news conference on US tariffs last week, he urged people to be patient as he worked to respond to more than 4,000 text messages he has received lately.\nDespite his popularity, the premier is also embroiled in several controversies. Chief among them is an ongoing police investigation into a now-scrapped deal his government made that would have allowed the development of environmentally-protected land.\nOn the national stage, he has run up against Alberta Premier Smith, who has called for a more measured and cautious response to Trump and his tariffs. \nThat caution has also been practised by other leaders, namely France's Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, both of whom struck a more diplomatic tone in their February visits to the White House. \nBut Ford's defiant stance against Trump is widely supported in Canada. Polls show the majority of Canadians support retaliating against the US, and a swell of nationalism has since emerged across the country.\nWhile Ford has been forceful, he has also been careful in his direct appeals to Americans.\n\"Believe me when I say I don't want to do this,\" he said earlier this week when he announced his plan to hike electricity prices, before underscoring that his priority is to protect Ontario jobs.",

        "article_text": "A fashion show held last week in a picturesque, snow-clad town in Indian-administered Kashmir has sparked a major controversy that is still simmering.\nThe show, by the well-known fashion brand Shivan & Narresh, was held last Friday at a ski resort in Gulmarg to display their skiwear collection. The label is the first big, non-local brand to hold a fashion show in Kashmir, a scenic Himalayan region which has seen decades of violence.\nBut it soon sparked outrage among locals, politicians and religious leaders in Muslim-majority Kashmir after fashion publisher Elle India posted a video on social media which showed some models wearing underwear or bikinis. Locals were also angry over another video - shared by online magazine Lifestyle Asia - of a party held after the show, which showed people drinking alcohol outdoors.\nMany took offence with the show being held in the holy month of Ramadan - a time of fasting and prayer for Muslims - and accused the designers of \"mocking their faith\" and \"disregarding local culture and sentiments\". Some clerics called the show \"obscene\" and said it was like \"soft porn\". \nSome others explained that the outrage had arisen not only from religious conservatism, but also from a fear of cultural imposition from \"outsiders\". Kashmir has witnessed decades of armed separatist insurgency against Indian rule since the late 1980s. \nThe backlash prompted Elle India and Lifestyle Asia to delete their videos. Shivan Bhatiya and Narresh Kukreja, the designers behind the label, also apologised, saying that their \"sole intention was to celebrate creativity\" and that they didn't intend to offend religious sentiments.\nKashmir - known as the land of saints and Sufism (Islamic mysticism) - has a rich tradition of spirituality which influences many aspects of peoples' lives. The traditional attire is modest, with locals - both men and women - often wearing the pheran, a long, loose cloak.\nThe row also moved off social media and a discussion about the show and the after-party caused a ruckus in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly.\nThe opposition criticised the government, accusing it of giving permission for the event despite being aware of local sensitivities. Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah distanced his government from the event, saying it had been organised by private entities, and asking local authorities to investigate the matter and submit a report.\n\"If law has been violated, strict action will be taken,\" he said in the assembly on Monday. The police have not yet given details about who organised the event and what laws, if any, have been violated.\nThe fashion brand did not respond to the BBC's questions about the show, including about permissions it obtained.\nIt's not surprising that scenic Gulmarg - one of India's few skiing destinations and a favourite with tourists - was the choice of venue for a show highlighting a skiwear collection.\nFashion journalist Shefalee Vasudev says it's not uncommon for designers to want to hold fashion shows in exquisite locations.\nIn fact, international designers like Alexander McQueen and Karl Lagerfeld are remembered as much for their creative, theatrical fashion shows as they are for their iconic designs.\nBut experimentation brings with it the risk of controversy and so, it's important to be mindful of the political and cultural sensitivities of a place, Ms Vasudev told the BBC.\nAnd this holds especially true in a place like Kashmir, which has witnessed wars and decades of armed conflict.\nBoth India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full but control it only in parts. Since India's partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought two wars over the territory.\nThousands of people have been killed since the late 1980s, when a separatist insurgency broke out against Indian rule. Though the separatist movement has lost steam over the years, many locals continue to view the administration in Delhi with distrust.\nThese sentiments have deepened since 2019 when the federal government, led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, stripped the region of its autonomy.\nSo some locals told the BBC that they were not surprised by the reactions to the show.\n\"Everything in Kashmir is political; people see things through a political prism,\" says Mir, a professor at a local university (he asked for his surname to be withheld to protect his identity). He adds that people are sceptical about big corporate events like the fashion show and - even if they are organised by private players - they believe that the government is trying to dilute their culture.\nArshid Ahmad, a researcher, uses stronger words to express public angst. \"The government is trying to dilute the spirit of resistance in Kashmiris,\" he says.\nThis isn't the first time an event held by non-locals has triggered a controversy in Kashmir. In 2013, separatists and human rights activists in the region protested against a show by renowned conductor Zubin Mehta. They said it was an attempt by the government to show the world that all was well in Kashmir when people were \"suffering and dying\".\nSome of the recent apprehensions around culture and identity can also be tied to the increase in tourists to Kashmir from other states in India. The federal government has often connected this boom in tourism to the abrogation of Article 370, which stripped the region of its autonomy.\nNousheen Fatima, 34, says because of government messaging, people outside Kashmir now see the region as being safer and \"more assimilated with India\". But she alleges that many tourists do not respect the region's culture.\nLast year, a video showing tourists drinking alcohol during a boat ride on the famous Dal Lake in Srinagar evoked outrage from political and religious leaders, who called the behaviour \"un-Islamic and unethical\".\nIn February, locals put up posters in Srinagar, asking tourists to \"respect local culture and traditions\" and \"avoid alcohol and use of drugs\", but these were later pulled down by the police.\nIn an editorial for The Voice of Fashion magazine, Ms Vasudev argues that the outrage needs to be examined from a critical lens. She asks if it would have been all right for the show to have been held in another Indian city instead of Kashmir, where Muslims would also be observing Ramadan. And whether it would have been acceptable to hold the show in Kashmir if it featured only outfits perceived as modest.\nShe also points out that Kashmir is home to the \"world's finest wool yarn; some of the finest handspun, handwoven pashmina creations and its artisans\".\n\"What Kashmir creates and stands for cannot be replicated anywhere. Shouldn't a fashion show at Gulmarg then, with innovative garments made with 100% wool, be seen as regenerating interest in untried ways?\" she asks.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Sweet, tangy and packed with probiotics, gira has long been a go-to winter tonic \u2013 and is now making a comeback in craft breweries and kombucha-style artisanal brands.\nWhen Tadas Eidukevi\u010dius was crafting his latest winter menu at Demoloftas in Vilnius, Lithuania, the Michelin-starred chef turned to an unassuming staple: the turnip. But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, Eidukevi\u010diusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it with gira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.\n\"I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things \u2013 it was a no brainer,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius. \"The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.\"\nWhile Eidukevi\u010dius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity \u2013 particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce \u2013 in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.\nDating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known as kvass across north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.\n\"Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,\" says Tomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. \"Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria \u2013 meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.\"\nA traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics that benefit gut health and immunity. In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\"When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick \u2013 consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,\" explained Ieva \u0160idlait\u0117, a cultural historian and the author of Naturally Fermented\u00a0who teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. \"In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,\" she added. \"Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.\"\nJosas agrees. \"Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus \u2013 like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,\" he says.\nThe early '80s is what Josas describes as \"the golden age of gira\" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.\n\"Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,\" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been \"hyped\" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.\u00a0\nOne of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira is Gubernija Brewery in northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Japan's ancient fermented 'superdrink'\n\u2022\u00a0The national park that draws mushroom hunters from around the world\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,\" says Jogail\u0117 \u010coj\u016bt\u0117, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. \"For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.\"\n\"In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,\" she continues, \"while export sales volume grew by 47%.\"\nGlobally, interest in non-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinks is soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods of Beaver Brewing Company in Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while at Honey's in East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.\nWhere to try Gira\nIn Vilnius, traditional restaurants like Lokys have kvass on the menu; it pairs incredibly well with a plate of smoked cold cuts. Elsewhere around the city, small batch gira made traditionally with bread can be found in health food shops as well as popular city bakery Kmynin\u0117, which uses its leftover sourdough rye.\nIn Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such as Three Mills Bakery in the nation\u2019s capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK, Northern Monk releases a seasonal kvass each year.\nWhile some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. \"It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,\" says \u010coj\u016bt\u0117.\nInstead, Eidukevi\u010dius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.\n\"Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,\" Eidukevi\u010dius adds. \"There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.\"\nSo, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. \"Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius.\"It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "To celebrate World Sleep Day, here's our science-based guide to getting the best slumber you can \u2013 from varying sleep with the seasons to taking inspiration from the past.\nIt's a typical weekday morning, and you're just beginning to stir in bed. There's light streaking through the windows, while the many chirps and caws of birds announce that it's probably time to get up\u2026 but surely that can't be right? Cue the familiar feeling of dread, as you remember a night filled with restless, low-quality sleep.\u00a0\u00a0\nAcross the world, people are struggling with insufficient sleep. In the US alone, it's been estimated that between 50 and 70 million people suffer from the affliction, and on a global scale, it has even been called an epidemic. However, there are some simple adjustments \u2013 both psychological and physical \u2013 that might help to improve the quality of your sleep. Here's our guide to having a delicious, restful slumber, inspired by the latest scientific research and some long-forgotten historical tricks.\u00a0\u00a0\nToday, when people wake up in the middle of the night, it's not unusual to panic \u2013 after all, we tend to believe that we should sleep for a continuous eight hours. But this has not always been the case. For millennia, people had a short first sleep \u2013 and then they woke up. These little slumber-gaps were filled with an endless variety of activities, from household chores to gossip in the dark (and even the occasional murder). Then after a couple of hours, people went back to bed and slept through until the morning.\u00a0\nThis is the forgotten ancient practise of \"two sleeps\". It was rediscovered by Roger Ekirch, a university distinguished professor of history at Virginia Tech, Virginia, in the 1990s. He believes that an awareness of the habit's historical prevalence might help to reframe the experiences of those who suffer from insomnia today \u2013 and perhaps lessen their anxiety about waking up in the night. Read more about the lost ancient habit of \"biphasic sleep\" in this article by Zaria Gorvett.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs spring arrives, you might notice that you need less sleep and are finding it easier to leave your bed in the morning. Research shows that we need more sleep during the dark, cold winter months than we do during the summer. This is because humans experience seasonal sleep. According to one German study, people experienced both longer REM and deep sleep in December than in June. REM sleep is the most active stage of sleep, when we dream and our heart rate increases, while deep sleep is when the body repairs muscle and tissues and is important for the consolidation of long-term memory.\u00a0Read more about the seasonality of human sleep in this article by Isabelle Gerretsen.\u00a0\nIn many countries having a catnap is a daily ritual, and research shows that regular naps are good for our health. According to a 2023 study, habitual napping helps keep our brains bigger for longer and can delay brain ageing by between three to six years. A smaller brain volume has been linked to diseases such as Alzheimer's and vascular dementia.\nThere are also short-term benefits. Short naps, lasting no longer than 15 minutes, can immediately improve how well we perform mentally, with results lasting up to three hours after we wake up. The key to power naps is to keep them short (after 20 minutes we start drifting into deep sleep) and to make sure you have one mid-afternoon so that it doesn't disrupt your sleep at night. Read more about the health benefits of napping here.\u00a0\nBut not all naps are good for us. Some last mere seconds and these microsleeps can result in serious harm if they occur when you're driving. Analysis of dashcam footage from 52 drivers from a single truck company in Japan found that three quarters of them showed signs of microsleep before they were involved in a collision.\nMicrosleeps are more common among people who suffer from narcolepsy or people who don't get enough sleep at night. One study found that when people slept for just six hours a night for 14 days in a row, they had as many microsleeps as those who missed a whole night's sleep. If you're regularly experiencing microsleeps, it's therefore probably a sign that you're not getting enough sleep generally.\u00a0Read more about the naps that only last a few seconds in this article by Claudia Hammond.\u00a0\nAs we snuggle up in bed for the night \u2013 particularly if it's just with a good podcast \u2013 we might wonder why it's so cold under the covers, or even a bit lonely.\nHistorically, having your own bed was highly unusual. Like it or not, most people had to share \u2013 and not just with their siblings in childhood, or as a married couple. Until the 19th Century, the majority of people would have slept communally, routinely slumbering alongside friends, colleagues and even total strangers. A good bedfellow would provide warmth and conversation into the early hours of the morning \u2013 though you might have to overlook their morning breath and contribution to a bedful of biting parasites. Read more about the forgotten habit of communal sleep in this article by Zaria Gorvett.\u00a0\nHow much sleep we all need can vary from person to person, with most recommendations for between seven and nine hours. But the amount of sleep you get is only one part of the equation. Quality matters as much, if not more.\nMost of us will have experienced feeling less refreshed after a night of tossing and turning. That's partly because when we sleep, our brains flood with cerebrospinal fluid to clear out accumulated debris and toxins. This waste-clearance system is called the glymphatic system, which works best at the same time every day. This means that when we get our shuteye is important. Syncing sleep with our natural circadian rhythms \u2013 the brain's 24-hour internal clock that regulates the cycle of alertness and sleepiness \u2013 gives rise to the best-quality rest.\u00a0Read more about the importance of sleep quality in this feature by Sandy Ong.\u00a0\nToday most people in the Western world are lucky enough to wake up on a soft bed, perhaps with a spring mattress or memory foam. However, things have not always been so comfortable.\u00a0\nIn the medieval era, many people opened their eyes each morning to stuffy air and pitch-blackness \u2013 the conditions inside a \"box bed\". These popular sleeping-cupboards were completely enclosed, and helped to keep people warm at night, though they were sometimes not much bigger than a wardrobe. Slightly later there came the \"tick\" mattress, a bag of cheap materials such as straw or leaves. Unfortunately, they also provided the ideal hiding place for ticks, fleas and bedbugs. But the true inventors of a bad night's sleep might arguably have been the Victorians, who created a variety of unpleasant solutions for homeless people, from rows of coffin-beds to a rope to hang oneself over for a rest. Read more about the curious history of beds through the centuries, or top up your knowledge on why medieval people slept in cupboards, in these articles by Zaria Gorvett.\u00a0\nSo, find yourself some bedfellows, allow for more sleep in the winter, and if you occasionally wake up in the night, consider yourself a modern pioneer of the lost ancient habit of biphasic sleep. We still can't promise that you'll be leaping out of bed on a Monday morning, but it's a start.\u00a0\n--\nThis story was originally published on 15/03/2024.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\nJoin one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.",

It is not clear who might have filmed the incident. \nPolice said the 17-year-olds, who were drunk at the time, were detained soon after the incident. \nThere is no suggestion anyone consumed the affected broth. Haidilao has apologised to customers, saying it has replaced all hotpot equipment and dining utensils, as well as disinfecting other crockery and utensils. \nThe incident happened late in February, though the company's management only found out about it days later, after videos circulated on social media. \nHaidilao said the staff on duty at the time had failed to stop the teens.\nIt took another week to find out which outlet it was, the company said, as it has dozens of outlets in the city. \nDiners in Haidilao use their own personal hotpot equipment to cook their food, and broths are not re-used again for other customers. However, it is unclear in this case if the hotpot in question was thoroughly cleaned and disinfected before it was used by the next customer.\n\"We fully understand that the distress caused to our customers by this incident cannot be fully compensated for by any means, but we will do our utmost to take responsibility,\" the company said in a statement. \nHaidilao said customers who dined at the outlet between 24 February and 8 March will receive a full refund, followed by cash compensation that is 10 times the amount they were billed. \nThe company has expanded quickly since it opened its first restaurant in Jianyang in Sichuan province. It now operates more than 1,000 restaurants across the world. \nHaidilao is known for its customer service and family-friendly atmosphere, where ladies can receive manicures and kids are treated to candy floss while waiting for a table.

        "article_text": "We are surrounded by an invisible killer. One so common that we barely notice it shortening our lives.\nIt's causing heart attacks, type 2 diabetes and studies now even link it to dementia.\nWhat do you think it could be?\nThe answer is noise - and its impact on the human body goes far beyond damaging hearing.\n\"It is a public health crisis, we've got huge numbers of people exposed in their everyday life,\" says Prof Charlotte Clark, from St George's, University of London.\nIt's just a crisis we don't talk about.\nSo I've been investigating when noise becomes dangerous, chatting to the people whose health is suffering and seeing if there's any way of overcoming our noisy world.\nI started by meeting Prof Clark in an eerily silent sound laboratory. We're going to see how my body reacts to noise and I've been kitted out with a device that looks like a chunky smartwatch.\nIt's going to measure my heart rate and how much my skin sweats.\nYou can join in too if you have some headphones. Think about how these five sounds make you feel.\nThe one I find really grating is the traffic noise from Dhaka, Bangladesh, which has the title of the noisiest city in the world. I immediately feel like I'm in a ginormous, stressful traffic jam.\nAnd the sensors are picking up my agitation - my heart rate shoots up and my skin is sweating more.\n\"There's really good evidence that traffic noise affects your heart health,\" says Prof Clark, as the next sound is prepared.\nOnly the joyful sounds of the playground have a calming effect on my body. The dogs barking and the neighbour's party in the early hours lead to a negative response.\nBut why is sound changing my body?\n\"You have an emotional response to sound,\" says Prof Clark.\nSound is detected by the ear and passed onto the brain and one region \u2013 the amygdala \u2013 performs the emotional assessment.\nThis is part of the body's fight-or-flight response that has evolved to help us react quickly to the sounds like a predator crashing through the bushes.\n\"So your heart rate goes up, your nervous system starts to kick in and you release stress hormones,\" Prof Clark tells me.\nAll of this is good in an emergency, but over time it starts to cause damage.\n\"If you're exposed for several years, your body's reacting like that all the time, it increases your risk of developing things like heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke and type 2 diabetes,\" says Prof Clark.\nInsidiously, this even happens while we're fast asleep. You might think you adapt to noise. I thought I did when I lived in a rental near an airport. But the biology tells a different story.\n\"You never turn your ears off; when you're asleep, you're still listening. So those responses, like your heart rate going up, that's happening whilst you're asleep,\" adds Prof Clark.\nNoise is unwanted sound. Transport - traffic, trains and aeroplanes \u2013 are a major source, but so too are the sounds of us having a good time. One person's great party is another's insufferable noise.\nI meet Coco at her fourth-floor flat in the historic Vila de Gr\u00e0cia area of Barcelona, Spain.\nThere's a bag of freshly picked lemons tied to her door gifted by one neighbour, her fridge contains a tortilla cooked by another and she offers me fancy cakes made by a third neighbour who's training in patisserie.\nFrom the balcony you can see the city's famous cathedral, the Sagrada Familia. It is easy to see why Coco has fallen in love with living here, but it comes at a huge price and she thinks she'll be forced to leave.\n\"It's extremely noisy\u2026 it's 24-hour noise,\" she tells me. There's a dog park for owners to walk their pooches which \"bark at 2, 3, 4, 5am\" and the courtyard is a public space that is used for everything from children's birthday parties to all-day concerts finished off with fireworks.\nShe gets out her phone and plays the recordings of the music being blasted out so loud it makes the glass in her windows vibrate.\nHer home should be a refuge from the stress of work, but the noise \"brings frustration, I feel like crying\".\nShe has been \"hospitalised twice with chest pain\" and \"absolutely\" thinks noise is causing the stress, which is damaging her health. \"There is a physical change that I feel, it does something to your body, for certain,\" she says.\nIn Barcelona there are an estimated 300 heart attacks and 30 deaths a year just from traffic noise, according to researcher Dr Maria Foraster, who has reviewed evidence on noise for the World Health Organization.\nAcross Europe noise is linked to 12,000 early deaths a year as well as millions of cases of severely disturbed sleep as well as serious noise annoyance which can impact mental health.\nI meet Dr Foraster at a caf\u00e9 that is separated from one of Barcelona's busiest roads by a small park. My sound meter says the noise from the distant traffic is just over 60 decibels here.\nWe can easily chat over the noise without raising our voices, but this is already an unhealthy volume.\nThe crucial number for heart health is 53 decibels, she tells me, and the higher you go the greater the health risks.\n\"This 53 means that we need to be in a rather quiet environment,\" says Dr Foraster.\nAnd that's just in daytime, we need even lower levels for sleep. \"At night we need quietness,\" she says.\nAlthough it is not just about the volume, how disruptive the sound is and how much control you have over it affect our emotional response to noise.\nDr Foraster argues the health impact of noise is \"at the level of air pollution\" but is much harder to comprehend.\n\"We are used to understanding that chemicals can affect health and they are toxic, but it's not so straightforward to understand that a physical factor, like noise, affects our health beyond our hearing,\" she says.\nA loud party can be the fun that makes life worth living and someone else's intolerable noise.\nThe sound of traffic has the greatest impact on health because so many people are exposed to it. But traffic is also the sound of getting to work, doing the shopping and taking the children to school. Tackling noise means asking people to live their lives differently - which creates problems of its own.\nDr Natalie Mueller, from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, takes me for a walk around the city centre. We start on a busy road \u2013 my sound meter clocks in at over 80 decibels \u2013 and we head to a quiet tree-lined avenue where the noise is down to the 50s.\nBut there is something different about this street \u2013 it used to be a busy road, but the space was given over to pedestrians, cafes and gardens. I can see the ghost of an old cross roads by the shape of the flowerbeds. Vehicles can still come down here, just slowly.\nRemember earlier in the lab, we found that some sounds can soothe the body.\n\"It is not completely silent, but it's a different perception of sound and noise,\" Dr Mueller says. My heart rate went down and I stopped sweating.\nThe initial plan was to create more than 500 areas like this, termed \"superblocks\" - pedestrian-friendly areas created by grouping several city blocks together.\nDr Mueller performed the research projecting a 5-10% reduction in noise in the city, which would prevent about \"150 premature deaths\" from noise alone each year. And that would be \"just the tip of the iceberg\" of the health benefits.\nBut in reality only six superblocks were ever built. The city council declined to comment.\nThe dangers of noise though are continuing to grow. Urbanisation is putting more people into noisy cities.\nDhaka, Bangladesh, is one of the fastest growing megacities in the world. This has brought more traffic and given the city a cacophonous soundtrack of honking horns.\nArtist Momina Raman Royal earned the label of the \"lone hero\" as his silent protests have focused attention on the city's noise problem.\nFor about 10 minutes each day, he stands at the intersection of a couple of busy roads with a big yellow placard accusing drivers who honk their horns loudly of causing a massive nuisance.\nHe took on the mission after his daughter was born. \"I want to stop all honking from not only Dhaka, but from Bangladesh,\" he says.\n\"If you see the birds or trees or rivers, no one's making noise without humans, so humans are responsible.\"\nBut here there are the beginnings of political action too. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, who's the environment adviser and minister for the government of Bangladesh, told me she was \"very worried\" about the health impacts of noise.\nThere is a crackdown on honking horns to get the noise levels down - with an awareness campaign and stricter enforcement of existing laws.\nShe said: \"It's impossible to get it done in one year or two years, but I think it is possible to ensure that the city becomes less noisy, and when people feel that, they feel better when it's less noisy, I'm sure their habit will also change.\"\nThe solutions to noise can be difficult, complicated and challenging to solve.\nWhat I'm left with is a new appreciation for finding some space in our lives to just escape the noise because in the words of Dr Masrur Abdul Quader, from the Bangladesh University of Professionals, it is \"a silent killer and a slow poison\".\nLOUD was produced by Gerry Holt.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has threatened a 200% tariff on any alcohol coming to the US from the European Union (EU) in the latest twist of an escalating trade war.\nThe threat is a response to the EU's plans for a 50% tax on imports of US-produced whiskey as part of its retaliation to Trump's tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports to the US.\nThe US president called for the immediate removal of the EU's \"nasty\" tariff on US whiskey, calling the bloc \"hostile and abusive\" and \"formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States\".\nA European Commission spokesperson said that \"calls are being prepared\" between between the US and the EU to discuss the situation.\nIt confirmed that its trade commissioner, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, had \"reached out to his American counterparts\" after Trump's latest threat.\nThe stand-off marked another escalation of a trade war which has rattled financial markets and raised concerns over the impact on the economies and consumers in many countries around the world, including the US.\nEurope sends more than \u20ac4.5bn ($4.89bn; \u00a33.78bn) worth of wine each year to the US, which is its largest export market, according to the Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en des Entreprises Vins, which represents the European wine industry.\nIgnacio S\u00e1nchez Recarte, secretary-general of the group, said if Trump carried through on his threats, it would destroy the market, costing thousands of jobs.\n\"There is no alternative to sell all this wine,\" he said, pleading with the two sides to \"keep wine out of this fight\".\nThe latest clash came after new US tariffs on steel and aluminium came into effect on Wednesday, hitting imports of the metals with a blanket duty of 25% and ending exemptions from the duties that the US had previously granted for shipments from some countries, including from the EU and Canada.\nCanada and Europe - which are among America's biggest trade partners - called the new taxes unjustified and struck back with their own tariffs on a range of US products. The EU's measures are due to go into force 1 April. \nThe clash reprises a battle that played out during Trump's first term, when he first announced tariffs on steel and aluminium. \nThe EU responded with its own tariffs, including a 25% tax on American whiskey.\nIn the aftermath, whiskey sales to the EU dropped 20%, falling from roughly $552m in 2018 to $440m in 2021, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the US. Trump in turn\nThe tariffs were lifted after Trump left office, after the two sides reached an agreement that exempted a certain amount of European metals from the duties.\nBut Trump has indicated little appetite for deal-making so far, at least when it comes to steel and aluminium.\n\"If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the US will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all wines, champagnes & alcoholic products coming out of France and other EU represented countries,\" he wrote on social media, using all capital letters for some of the message. \nThe targeting of wine and whiskey is symbolic - there are few consumer goods more iconic than French Bordeaux or Tennessee whiskey. From a value standpoint, drinks trade is worth less than some of the other items facing tariffs.\nBut Mary Taylor, a US-based importer of European wines, said the measures would be catastrophic for her business and industry, with an impact that would ripple out to restaurants, bars and distributors across the US. \n\"It just looks like a big, giant threat to our livelihoods,\"  she said.\nMs Taylor, who brings in 2 million bottles a year, weathered the 25% tariff Trump put on certain EU bottles during his first term by expanding her distribution in Europe, but she said, \"200% is a whole different ball game\".\nShares in the US fell again on Thursday. \nThe S&P 500 dropped nearly 1.4%, taking it down roughly 10% from its most recent peak - a milestone known as a correction. The Dow slumped 1.3%, while the Nasdaq dropped almost 2%. \nIn Europe, London's FTSE 100 was flat, while Germany's Dax ended about 0.5% lower. \nIn Paris, the Cac 40 fell 0.6%, as shares of major spirit-makers were hit, with Pernod Ricard down 4% and Hennessy cognac maker LVMH falling 1.1%.\nIn interviews with US business media on Thursday, White House officials blamed the EU for escalating the dispute.\n\"Why are Europeans picking on Kentucky bourbon or Harley-Davidson motorcycles? It's disrespectful,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg Television, describing the back-and-forth as \"off the topic\".\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that a trade war was likely to inflict more economic pain on the EU than on the US, dismissing concerns that the clash could spiral.\n\"One or two items, with one trading bloc \u2013 I'm not sure why that's a big deal for the markets,\" he said.\nIn an interview with the BBC's HardTalk, European central bank president Christine Lagarde, said that the EU had \"no choice\" but to retaliate.\n\"At the moment, everybody is positioning,\" she said, adding that she expected the two sides to sit down and negotiate.\n\"Everybody will suffer\" if the dispute were to develop into a full blown trade war, she warned.\nSo far, Trump has shown little tolerance for retaliation from countries over the tariffs he has introduced.\nEarlier this week, he blasted Canada with the threat of a 50% tariff on its steel and aluminium after the Canadian province of Ontario responded to new tariffs with a surcharge on electricity exports to the US.\nHe rescinded that threat after Ontario agreed to suspend the charges.\nFormer Trump adviser Stephen Moore, now an economist with the Heritage Foundation, said he thought the EU would have to make a concession to defuse the situation, noting that Trump had consistently voiced concerns about rules on agricultural products.\n\"Absolutely this is going to end up with a deal,\" he said. \"It's only a question if it ends up in a deal in a day, a week, a month or six months, but there will eventually be a negotiated settlement.\" \nThe full HARDtalk will be available from 14 March on the BBC News Channel, iPlayer, the World Service and as a podcast.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has threatened a 200% tariff on any alcohol coming to the US from the European Union (EU) in the latest twist of an escalating trade war.\nThe threat is a response to the EU's plans for a 50% tax on imports of US-produced whiskey as part of its retaliation to Trump's tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports to the US.\nThe US president called for the immediate removal of the EU's \"nasty\" tariff on US whiskey, calling the bloc \"hostile and abusive\" and \"formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States\".\nA European Commission spokesperson said that \"calls are being prepared\" between between the US and the EU to discuss the situation.\nIt confirmed that its trade commissioner, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, had \"reached out to his American counterparts\" after Trump's latest threat.\nThe stand-off marked another escalation of a trade war which has rattled financial markets and raised concerns over the impact on the economies and consumers in many countries around the world, including the US.\nEurope sends more than \u20ac4.5bn ($4.89bn; \u00a33.78bn) worth of wine each year to the US, which is its largest export market, according to the Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en des Entreprises Vins, which represents the European wine industry.\nIgnacio S\u00e1nchez Recarte, secretary-general of the group, said if Trump carried through on his threats, it would destroy the market, costing thousands of jobs.\n\"There is no alternative to sell all this wine,\" he said, pleading with the two sides to \"keep wine out of this fight\".\nThe latest clash came after new US tariffs on steel and aluminium came into effect on Wednesday, hitting imports of the metals with a blanket duty of 25% and ending exemptions from the duties that the US had previously granted for shipments from some countries, including from the EU and Canada.\nCanada and Europe - which are among America's biggest trade partners - called the new taxes unjustified and struck back with their own tariffs on a range of US products. The EU's measures are due to go into force 1 April. \nThe clash reprises a battle that played out during Trump's first term, when he first announced tariffs on steel and aluminium. \nThe EU responded with its own tariffs, including a 25% tax on American whiskey.\nIn the aftermath, whiskey sales to the EU dropped 20%, falling from roughly $552m in 2018 to $440m in 2021, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the US. Trump in turn\nThe tariffs were lifted after Trump left office, after the two sides reached an agreement that exempted a certain amount of European metals from the duties.\nBut Trump has indicated little appetite for deal-making so far, at least when it comes to steel and aluminium.\n\"If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the US will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all wines, champagnes & alcoholic products coming out of France and other EU represented countries,\" he wrote on social media, using all capital letters for some of the message. \nThe targeting of wine and whiskey is symbolic - there are few consumer goods more iconic than French Bordeaux or Tennessee whiskey. From a value standpoint, drinks trade is worth less than some of the other items facing tariffs.\nBut Mary Taylor, a US-based importer of European wines, said the measures would be catastrophic for her business and industry, with an impact that would ripple out to restaurants, bars and distributors across the US. \n\"It just looks like a big, giant threat to our livelihoods,\"  she said.\nMs Taylor, who brings in 2 million bottles a year, weathered the 25% tariff Trump put on certain EU bottles during his first term by expanding her distribution in Europe, but she said, \"200% is a whole different ball game\".\nShares in the US fell again on Thursday. \nThe S&P 500 dropped nearly 1.4%, taking it down roughly 10% from its most recent peak - a milestone known as a correction. The Dow slumped 1.3%, while the Nasdaq dropped almost 2%. \nIn Europe, London's FTSE 100 was flat, while Germany's Dax ended about 0.5% lower. \nIn Paris, the Cac 40 fell 0.6%, as shares of major spirit-makers were hit, with Pernod Ricard down 4% and Hennessy cognac maker LVMH falling 1.1%.\nIn interviews with US business media on Thursday, White House officials blamed the EU for escalating the dispute.\n\"Why are Europeans picking on Kentucky bourbon or Harley-Davidson motorcycles? It's disrespectful,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg Television, describing the back-and-forth as \"off the topic\".\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that a trade war was likely to inflict more economic pain on the EU than on the US, dismissing concerns that the clash could spiral.\n\"One or two items, with one trading bloc \u2013 I'm not sure why that's a big deal for the markets,\" he said.\nIn an interview with the BBC's HardTalk, European central bank president Christine Lagarde, said that the EU had \"no choice\" but to retaliate.\n\"At the moment, everybody is positioning,\" she said, adding that she expected the two sides to sit down and negotiate.\n\"Everybody will suffer\" if the dispute were to develop into a full blown trade war, she warned.\nSo far, Trump has shown little tolerance for retaliation from countries over the tariffs he has introduced.\nEarlier this week, he blasted Canada with the threat of a 50% tariff on its steel and aluminium after the Canadian province of Ontario responded to new tariffs with a surcharge on electricity exports to the US.\nHe rescinded that threat after Ontario agreed to suspend the charges.\nFormer Trump adviser Stephen Moore, now an economist with the Heritage Foundation, said he thought the EU would have to make a concession to defuse the situation, noting that Trump had consistently voiced concerns about rules on agricultural products.\n\"Absolutely this is going to end up with a deal,\" he said. \"It's only a question if it ends up in a deal in a day, a week, a month or six months, but there will eventually be a negotiated settlement.\" \nThe full HARDtalk will be available from 14 March on the BBC News Channel, iPlayer, the World Service and as a podcast.",

        "article_text": "US tariffs on alcohol from the European Union have the \"potential to be devastating\", the Irish Whiskey Association has warned.\nOn Thursday, US President Donald Trump threatened a 200% tariff on all alcohol coming out of the bloc unless a \"nasty 50% tariff on [US] whisky\" is stopped.\nIt's the latest step in a global trade war, after the EU announced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imported in the US on Wednesday.\nThe body, which is in Washington for St Patrick's Day celebrations, said the escalation was \"extremely concerning\" and that a US-EU trade war puts jobs, investments and businesses at risk.\nIrish Whiskey has enjoyed a decade of spectacular growth with global sales more than doubling from 7.3m cases in 2014 to 15.6m in 2023.\nThe US is by far the biggest export market, taking 5.7m cases in 2023.\nThat trade is dominated by big brands like Jameson and Powers, but dozens of new craft distilleries have also been targeting the US market.\nIn a statement, the Irish Whiskey Association said: \"There is no winner in a trade war.\n\"The imposition of tariffs will impact on our businesses and our consumers. \n\"Having our sector implicated in this dispute puts jobs, investments and businesses at risk and has the potential to be devastating for Irish Whiskey.\"\nIt called on the EU and US to de-escalate, adding \"the need to remove spirits from this dispute is immediate, and the clock is ticking\".\n\"We note that there is no tariff currently in place, and now is the time for dialogue,\" the association said.\nTaoiseach (Irish prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin has called for the EU to adopt a \"strategic approach\" to the issue of US tariffs.\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, the taoiseach said the tariffs were \"very concerning\" for Ireland's spirits industry.\nMartin met with Trump in the White House on Wednesday as part of St Patrick's Day events in the US capital.\nIn the meeting, Trump accused the EU of acting \"very badly\" towards the US and that counter-tariffs create \"ill-will\".\nThe taoiseach added the only way to resolve a deepening trade dispute between the US and EU is \"through dialogue\".\n\"Tariffs increase inflation and are not good for the consumer and are not good for business, and that is our view,\" he said.\n\"But I do believe there will be some distance to go yet. There will be an EU Council towards the end of next week, and again, there will be discussions and consultations within the European Union in respect of European actions.\n\"And obviously, again, in that scenario, we'll be endeavouring to protect Irish interests in terms of specific Irish products and Irish sectors.\"\nBy John Campbell, BBC News NI business and economics editor\nNorthern Ireland's unique post-Brexit trading arrangements could give distilleries a way round Trump's threatened tariffs.\nWhiskey distilled in Northern Ireland is logically and legally Irish whiskey.

        "summary": "US tariffs 'potentially devastating' for Irish whiskey5 hours agoShareSaveRaymona Crozier and Jessica LawrenceBBC News NIShareSaveGetty ImagesThe US is by far the biggest export market for Irish whiskeyUS tariffs on alcohol from the European Union have the \"potential to be devastating\", the Irish Whiskey Association has warned.On Thursday, US President Donald Trump threatened a 200% tariff on all alcohol coming out of the bloc unless a \"nasty 50% tariff on [US] whisky\" is stopped.It's the latest step in a global trade war, after the EU announced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imported in the US on Wednesday.The body, which is in Washington for St Patrick's Day celebrations, said the escalation was \"extremely concerning\" and that a US-EU trade war puts jobs, investments and businesses at risk.Irish Whiskey has enjoyed a decade of spectacular growth with global sales more than doubling from 7.3m cases in 2014 to 15.6m in 2023.The US is by far the biggest export market, taking 5.7m cases in 2023.That trade is dominated by big brands like Jameson and Powers, but dozens of new craft distilleries have also been targeting the US market. \"We note that there is no tariff currently in place, and now is the time for dialogue,\" the association said.PA MediaEoin \u00d3 Cath\u00e1in is the director of the Irish Whiskey AssociationTaoiseach (Irish prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin has called for the EU to adopt a \"strategic approach\" to the issue of US tariffs.Speaking to reporters on Thursday, the taoiseach said the tariffs were \"very concerning\" for Ireland's spirits industry.Martin met with Trump in the White House on Wednesday as part of St Patrick's Day events in the US capital.In the meeting, Trump accused the EU of acting \"very badly\" towards the US and that counter-tariffs create \"ill-will\".PA MediaSpeaking in Washington, Martin said there will be discussions in the EU following the threatened tariffsThe taoiseach added the only way to resolve a deepening trade dispute between the US and EU is \"through dialogue\". But it is exported as a UK product.That means if the tariffs happen and are applied to the EU, but not the UK,  there would be a clear cost advantage for distilleries north of the border.Bushmills, which is owned by Mexico's Proximo spirits, is the biggest distillery in NI but there are also newer, smaller operations which could see an opportunity.Worry NI could be hit by tariffsEarlier, Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn warned there could be an impact for Northern Ireland in any trade war.He said the introduction of 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imported in the US on Wednesday was \"disappointing\".Speaking at an NI Bureau breakfast event in Washington DC, Benn said he didn't want Northern Ireland to be caught in the middle.He said tariffs were not really in anybody's interest, and the UK government was working on negotiating a deal with the US.PA MediaNorthern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn said the government is negotiating a deal with the US on tariffsBenn said he had not had a chance to meet US President Donald Trump yet during his visit to Washington but attended the Speakers' lunch on Wednesday, where Trump gave an address.Former US congressman Bruce Morrison said that tariffs would be \"bad\" for Northern Ireland and could interfere with the Windsor Framework.The former Democratic politician believes that the Republican Party has \"lost its nerve\" in supporting Trump in whatever he wants to do. \"I think a lot of what's going on is a bad idea; these are bad things, but 77m people voted for him, so we need to tolerate it,\" he added.The traditional NI Bureau breakfast is an executive-run event aimed at showcasing Northern Ireland to would-be American investors and celebrating its historical and cultural bonds.What are tariffs and how could they affect Northern Ireland?Tariffs are effectively a tax on trade, applied to goods as they enter the country.The charge is paid by the domestic company that imports the goods, not the foreign company that exports them.However, the burden can ultimately fall on the exporting firm if it has to cut its prices or finds that it can no longer compete in that market.They can be used by governments to protect domestic industries by making competing imports more expensive.Under the post-Brexit deal known as the Windsor Framework, Northern Ireland is essentially still inside the EU's single market for goods and enforces the EU's customs code.If tariffs were imposed on the UK they would affect Northern Ireland goods.But even if the UK avoided US tariffs, the Windsor Framework could have implications for Northern Ireland.If, for example, the US and EU entered into a tariff war with the EU deciding to put retaliatory tariffs in place, it could lead to a situation where Great Britain is not applying tariffs to US goods, but Northern Ireland is.NI politicians praise 'good engagement' with TrumpTrump's tariffs will harm citizens, says Irish PM How will the latest Trump tariffs affect the UK?Threat of US tariffs spells uncertainty for NI businessesTrump pledges to match EU and Canada's retaliatory tariffsStarmer says 'all options on table' on US tariffsEuropeRepublic of IrelandTrump tariffs \"AnalysisBy John Campbell, BBC News NI business and economics editorNorthern Ireland's unique post-Brexit trading arrangements could give distilleries a way round Trump's threatened tariffs.Whiskey distilled in Northern Ireland is logically and legally Irish whiskey.",

The order references \"egregious actions\" by South Africa and cites \"unjust racial discrimination\" against white Afrikaners - those who descended from Dutch settlers. \nThe order also references a new law, the Expropriation Act, that the order claims targets Afrikaners by allowing the government to take away private land. \n\"As long as South Africa continues to support bad actors on the world stage and allows violent attacks on innocent disfavored minority farmers, the United States will stop aid and assistance to the country,\" according to a statement from the White House. \nThe government in South Africa denies its law is related to race, the Associated Press reported. \nA fact sheet from the White House states the country \"blatantly discriminates against ethnic minority descendants of settler groups\". \nWhile lower-ranking diplomats are sometimes expelled, it's highly unusual in the US for it to happen to a more senior official like a foreign ambassador, the Associated Press reported, noting neither the US nor Russia took such actions against one another even amid tensions during the Cold War. \nRasool previously served as the country's ambassador to the US from 2010 to 2015 before being tapped again for the post in 2025. \nHe was born and grew up in Cape Town. When he was nine, he and his family were forcibly removed from an apartment that was declared only for white people. As he grew older, he became more interested in politics and said the eviction was a significant moment in his upbringing that guided his future. ",

And I stupidly agreed.\"\nJane and daughter Megan took part in 2019, but she admitted they did \"dreadfully\", adding: \"We lost \u00a3155.\"\nThe show is made by BBC Studios in Cardiff, and remains hugely popular, pulling in an average two million viewers every day.\nIts format has also been sold to 186 countries around the world. \nEvery year the programme receives around 35,000 applications from people who want to don the famous red and blue fleeces, to see if they can spot a bargain and make a profit. \nIn total, 10,000 people have appeared on the show over the last quarter of a century.\nSo what about the bargains that have been snapped up? \nThe biggest profit ever made by a team on a single item was in 2002. \nBlue team Ally and Diane, alongside expert Michael Hogben, were shopping at Ardingly antiques fair in West Sussex. \nThey paid \u00a3140 for a George Johnson 1908 Royal Worcester flamingo trinket box. \nIt sold at auction for \u00a3800, making a profit of \u00a3660 and earning them a place in the Bargain Hunt history books.\nThe biggest loss accolade goes to expert Tim Weeks and his blue team who paid \u00a360 for a vintage, rusty ice cream fridge. \nDespite the auctioneer lowering the starting bid to just 50p, nobody bid and the item was unsold.\nThe programme has earned some surprising celebrity fans over the years too, from Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe and One Direction's Louis Tomlinson to author and presenter Richard Osman and Radio 2 DJ Tony Blackburn.\nIn 2018, for a BBC Music Day special, Bez from the Happy Mondays caused a cheating scandal that made the headlines when the band took on Pulp. \nWhen it came to the auction, it was discovered that Bez's girlfriend had been bidding on items. \nAfter the cheating was uncovered the ending was re-filmed, Bez handed back his winnings, and Pulp were victorious. \nThe programme launched on 13 March 2000 and was hosted by the then-unknown presenter David Dickinson. \nThere are now seven presenters and a pool of more than 20 antiques experts. \nEvery programme now ends with the famous Bargain Hunt kick. \nContestants, experts and the presenter all link arms in a line and kick one leg in the air. \nIt started with presenter Tim Wonnacott and is now a staple of the show. \nBut for expert-turned-presenter Danny Sebastian, one particular kick led to an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction.\nAn over-enthusiastic leg raise in tight trousers caused his front zip to rip, all caught on camera. \nDanny said he now kept a spare pair of trousers and a sewing kit to hand.\nSo what is the secret to Bargain Hunt's enduring appeal? \nIt's a game show, but there's no big money prize. \nIn fact, contestants can be absolutely delighted with a profit of just a few pounds, especially if they secure the coveted Golden Gavel - a simple lapel pin, awarded if they make a profit on every item.\nExecutive producer Paul Tucker said: \"It's simple and easy to follow and culminating with an auction always provides a platform for drama, excitement and fun. \n\"As producers we can't be complacent and we are constantly refreshing the format but very careful not to 'break' it. \n\"We have introduced new presenters providing diversity and variety to our line-up representing our broad audience. \n\"We never 'churn' episodes out. \n\"Each one is tailored and carefully scripted with considered inserts that we know our audience will connect with, whether we're featuring the largest Star Wars collection in a suburban house to the largest collection of historic hankies and tea towels.\"\nYou can watch 25 Years of Bargain Hunt on BBC iPlayer and BBC One on Thursday 13 March at 12:15 GMT",

        "article_text": "The live-action version of the classic fairy-tale animation sounded like a surefire hit. But even before it's reached cinemas, the response to it has been loud and often hostile.\nYou wouldn't think that the war in Gaza would have much impact on a Disney remake. But the live-action Snow White, a revamped version of the 1937 animated classic Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, has become a flashpoint for social and political divisions, even before its global release next week. \u00a0\nThere was some backlash to the casting of Rachel Zegler, of Colombian descent, as the heroine. More recently, there has been blowback both about Zegler's pro-Palestinian comments and about pro-Israel comments by Israeli actress Gal Gadot, who plays Snow White's stepmother, the Evil Queen. And there is an ongoing debate about whether there should have been dwarfs at all, live or CGI. The film's director, Marc Webb, said in Disney's official production notes, \"I think all good stories evolve over time. They become reflections of the world that we live in\". He has likely got more than he bargained for, as reactions to Snow White inadvertently reflect the most polarised aspects of the world today. Like political rhetoric in countries around the world, responses to the film's production have been loud, irate and sometimes ugly.\nSnow White has been in the works since 2019, and began in earnest with Zegler's casting in 2021. Since then attacks on its so-called \"wokeness\" have proliferated, making the film a lightning rod for opinions that have little to do with the fairy tale it is based on. A recent Hollywood Reporter article asked, \"Have some PR missteps combined with anti-woke outrage turned marketing the film into a poisoned apple?\" And alongside such measured reporting there have been heated responses in the media. The editorial board of the New York Post \u2013 owned by Rupert Murdoch, the conservative mogul whose company also owns Fox News \u2013 weighed in this week, declaring the film a financial disaster before it has opened, writing: \"Disney 'Snow White' controversy proves it again: Go woke, go broke!\"\nThe original film needed an update if it was going to be remade at all. In its day it set a high bar for Disney's future animated films, but it also introduced the song Someday My Prince Will Come, blighting the expectations of generations of girls by setting them up to wait for a Prince Charming to make their lives complete. Meanwhile, Snow White happily sweeps the floor for the dwarfs until he shows up to rescue her with a kiss after she bites the Queen's poisoned apple. Soon after her casting announcement, Zegler told the television show Extra that in the old Snow White \"there was a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her\". In fact, the original film states that he \"searched far and wide\" to find her after falling in love at first sight, and he disappears for most of the film, so no need to take that comment too seriously. Zegler was excited and laughing when she said it. But in an early sign of the blinkered reactions to come, social media posts complained that she was anti-love.\nSome people also rejected the idea that a Latina actress could play a character called Snow White; alongside criticisms of such non-traditional casting, she was subject to racist trolling. This was a similar reaction to that experienced by the black actress Halle Bailey when she was cast as Ariel in 2023's The Little Mermaid.\nThe film stumbled into more trouble simply because its lead actresses expressed political opinions. On X in August 2024, Zegler thanked fans for the response to the Snow White trailer, adding, \"and always remember, free Palestine\".\nGadot has posted her support for Israel on social media, and especially since the 7 October attacks by Hamas has been outspoken in defence of her country and against anti-semitism. That led to some short-lived calls by pro-Palestinian social media users to boycott the film simply because she is in it.\nThe fallout on the film intensified after the 2024 US presidential election. Zegler posted on Instagram that she was \"heartbroken\" and fearful, and that she hoped \"Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace\". In response Megyn Kelly, the former Fox news personality, attacked Zegler, saying on her radio show, \"This woman is a pig,\" and that Disney was going to have to recast the role. Zegler apologised to Trump voters, saying \"I let my emotions get the best of me\".\nEven when people reacting to the film have agreed on a basic principle, like more opportunities for actors who have dwarfism, they have disagreed on how to get there. Peter Dinklage, perhaps the world's most well-known actor with dwarfism, questioned the entire project before many details were known, calling the 1937 film \"a backwards story of seven dwarfs living in a cave together\". Disney announced the next day, \"To avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film, we are taking a different approach with these seven characters.\"\nAs it turned out, the seven characters are CGI, and Disney has reclassifed them as \"magical creatures\", not dwarfs. What do they look like? Even a glimpse at the trailer reveals that they look exactly like CGI dwarfs. They are still named Happy, Grumpy, Sleepy, Sneezy, Doc, Bashful and Dopey.\nThe changes have caused a backlash from some people with dwarfism, who have rebutted Dinklage and accused Disney of depriving them of acting roles. As recently as this week, one told the Daily Mail, \"I think Disney is trying too hard to be politically correct, but in doing so it's damaging our careers and opportunities.\" \nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a010 of the best films to watch this March\n\u2022\u00a0The real meaning of Wicked\n\u2022\u00a0Why Disney had a hard centenary year\nAmidst this swirl of controversies, Disney altered the traditional red-carpet treatment it would usually give such a major film. The premiere took place in Spain on 12 March, and the Los Angeles premiere is due to take place today at an unusual, afternoon hour. The regular red-carpet journalists have not been invited, even though as a group they are not known to ask hard-hitting questions.\nTrying to avoid more political and social discord isn't Disney's only Snow White problem, though. There is much online speculation that the film might just be bad. The first full trailer was greeted with a rush of complaints about the underwhelming CGI, with The Guardian calling the trailer \"the ugliest thing ever committed to screen\". The film has new songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the team behind La La Land, but the one released as a video, Waiting On a Wish, has a bland, generic Disney style. Box-office tracking predicts an opening weekend of around $50m (\u00a339m), solid but at the low end for a would-be blockbuster that reportedly cost over $200m (\u00a3155m) to make.\nOf course, given the Disney juggernaut \u2013 the recent Moana 2 has made more than $1bn (\u00a3773m) and Mufasa: The Lion King, which had a slow start, more than $712m (\u00a3550m) \u2013 the debacle leading up to Snow White's opening may not hurt it at the box office at all.\nOr the film may become the victim of its moment, a fairy-tale princess covered in mud.\u00a0\nSnow White is released internationally on March 21\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Steve Stich, manager of Nasa's commercial crew programme said he was delighted at the prospect.\n\"Butch and Suni have done a great job and we are excited to bring them back,\" he said.\nThe astronauts, along with their ISS workmates, Nasa's Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, will be relieved by four astronauts, from Russia, Japan and two from the US.\nThere will be a two-day handover after which the old crew are due to begin their journey back to Earth. But there could be a small further delay, as they wait for conditions on Earth to be right for a safe re-entry of the returning capsule, according to Dana Weigel, manager, of the ISS programme.\n\"Weather always has to cooperate, so we'll take our time over that if it is not favourable,\" she told reporters.\nMs Weigel explained that the astronauts had begun getting ready for the handover last week.\n\"Butch rang a ceremonial bell as Suni handed over command to cosmonaut Alexei Ovchinin,\" she said.\nThe astronauts have consistently said that they have been happy to be on board the space station, with Suni Williams describing it as her \"happy place\". But Dr Simeon Barber, of the Open University, told BBC News that there would likely have been a personal cost.\n\"When you are sent on a work trip that is supposed to last a week, you are not expecting it to take the best part of a year,\" he said.\n\"This extended stay in space will have disrupted family life, things will have happened back home that they will have missed out on, so there will have been a period of upheaval.\"\nButch and Suni arrived at the ISS at the beginning of June 2024 to test an experimental spacecraft called Starliner, which was built by the aerospace firm Boeing, a rival to SpaceX. \nThe mission had been delayed by several years because of technical issues in the spacecraft's development, and there were problems during its launch and docking on to the ISS. This included issues with some of Starliner's thrusters, which would be needed to slow the spacecraft for re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, and leaks of helium gas in the propulsion system.\nNasa decided that it would not take even a small risk in bringing back Butch and Suni on Starliner, when they had the option of returning them on SpaceX's Dragon capsule. Nasa decided the best option was to do this during a scheduled crew rotation, even though it would mean keeping the astronauts on the space station for several months.\nBoeing has consistently argued that it would have been safe to bring Butch and Suni back on Starliner, and were unhappy about the decision to use a rival's capsule instead, which will be \"embarrassing\" for Boeing, according to Dr Barber.\n\"It's not a good look for Boeing to see astronauts they took into space come back in a competitor's craft.\"\nBoth President Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have said that Butch and Suni could have been brought home sooner, most recently in a joint interview with Fox News in February.\nPresident Trump states: \"They got left in space.\"\nWhen the interviewer,  Sean Hannity, elaborates, saying \"They were supposed to be there eight days. They're there almost 300,\" Mr Trump responds with one word: \"Biden.\" Mr Musk follows up asserting: \"They were left up there for political reasons.\"\nThe assertion is denied by Nasa's Steve Stitch.\n\"We looked at a wide range of options and worked hand-in-hand with SpaceX to look at what was the best thing to do overall and when we laid all that out the best option was to have the one we are embarking upon,\" he said.\nThat decision was supported by Dr Libby Jackson, who is head of space at the Science Museum in London and worked at Europe's control centre for the ISS.\n\"Butch and Suni's wellbeing would always have been at the very forefront of everybody's minds as the decisions were being made for how best to deal with the circumstances that they were presented,\" she said.\n\"Nasa made those decisions based on good technical reasons, on programmatic reasons, and found the right solution that has kept Butch and Suni safe.\n\"I really look forward to seeing them return to Earth, safe and sound, along with the rest of their crewmates.\"",

        "article_text": "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.\nMark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.\nHe had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.\nBut unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States. \nBut holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.\nAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.\nWith three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.\nThe son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. \nIn 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs. \n\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race. \n\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"\nIn 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.\nIn 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.\nAlthough central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. \nThat move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.\nHe is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.\nIn 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.\nInterest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.\nConfusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.\nUnlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.\nIn 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.\nBefore the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.\nIn the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.\nHe described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.\nThe Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.\nHis final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\". \nCarney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.\nFrom 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.\nHe was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.\nAlthough he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.\nAfter Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.\n\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said. \n\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"\nHe seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".\nThe Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.\n\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.\nThings changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.\nReports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.\nFreeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.\n\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\" \nStill, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. \nThe Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.\nThey have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament. \nHis team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.\nIn addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.\nHe is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\nOne of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.\nShortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.\nOn immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.\nHis biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US. \nThere are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nHampson reflects on life-altering injury and life-changing influence\nMatt Hampson could not breathe by himself and was drifting in and out of consciousness when medics cut his England jersey off him.\nIt was half a lifetime ago that the now 40-year-old was in intensive care, having been left paralysed from the neck down when a scrum collapsed in a training session with the Under-21 national team.\nHe recalls the faces around him immediately after the incident, the \"shell-shocked\" looks, the sense of helplessness when he could not feel his arms and legs, and waking up in the back of an ambulance after \"blacking out\" before being resuscitated.\nHe was only 20 years old then. Now, 20 years on, the former Leicester Tigers prop remembers how it all felt \"so surreal\" when he was rushed to Northampton General Hospital.\nThe injury left Hampson only able to breathe through a ventilator and as \"bizarre and scary\" as that struck him at the time, he admits he was momentarily distracted from the life-changing chaos of it all.\n\"Having my England kit that I was so proud of being cut off me with scissors was a small trivial thing I was thinking of,\" Hampson told BBC East Midlands Today.\n\"I was so proud of playing for England with the rose on my chest, and then having that kit cut off me, I was just thinking of that rather than thinking of myself.\"\nHampson had started the day - 15 March, 2005 - by slipping that England shirt on as one of the nation's finest rising rugby union prospects.\nIt was with the academy at Leicester Tigers, a club renowned for developing forwards of fierce pedigree, that Hampson worked hard to gain that reputation.\n\"I wasn't a natural rugby player, but I wanted it, I was hungry for it and was passionate about it,\" he said.\n\"Rugby was my purpose and what I could do to channel my energy. I felt like it was my calling.\"\nHampson reflects on foundation's work as he turns 40\nI was too busy to die - Hampson\n'Get busy living or get busy dying' - Hampson reflects on injury 10 years on \nThat calling, however, was silenced in harrowing circumstances which sent him in a different direction.\nHe would go on to spend 18 months at Stoke Mandeville Hospital - home of the National Spinal Injuries Centre - and after that he said there was \"a lot of soul searching\" about what would come next.\n\"You are a rugby player, so to redefine yourself was massively important,\" he said.\n\"It was obviously a turning point in my life and initially I struggled to justify why it happened to me and why life would never be the same again. But now I understand.\"\nHe says this while at the Get Busy Living Centre, a state-of-the art facility that he is the driving force behind, which offers total support to those in a similar situation.\nThe centre, which is nestled among farmland outside Melton Mowbray in rural Leicestershire, is also home of the foundation set up in Hampson's name.\n\"I come into the driveway and see the foundation and centre and this is what it's all about,\" he said.\n\"This is why it happened. Realising how much support I had and how many people that I'd be able to help and influence, just through my journey and my story - to show people that there is a great life to be had in this situation.\"\nMatt Hampson was awarded an OBE in 2022 and received an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Leicester in January\nIt was the support that Hampson got after his accident that made him realise what could be possible.\nIn hospital he was visited by so many people that he ended up needing a booking system to stay on top of it all. As a high-profile injury that rocked the rugby world, there was also a lot of money donated to help him and his family cope.\nHe knew he was \"blessed\" to be in that position, but also saw that many were not so fortunate.\n\"It didn't just come to me straightaway,\" Hampson said of plans for his foundation and the centre. \"The trust fund was sort of thrust upon me where people were raising money for me. \n\"I felt very grateful for that and I felt that I needed to give something back. The natural progression for the trust was to turn into a foundation, a charity to help other people.\n\"The most worthwhile thing we can do in our life is to make an impression on someone else's life.\"\nHow many people the foundation and centre have supported over the years, Hampson can't put an exact number on.\nBut it is hundreds who have sought access to expert physiotherapists, specialist personal trainers, wellbeing support and other tailored healthy living advice at the centre.\nAccommodation has been set up there recently to help offer even greater levels of access, and there are further redevelopment plans for the site and aspirations to expand its reach with satellite centres around the country.\nSome people who have come through the centre have even gone on establish themselves as athletes, competing at the Paralympic Games. Among them are Nick Cummins and Jamie Stead, who were both part of ParalympicsGB's gold medal-winning wheelchair rugby side at the Tokyo games in 2021.\nGraham Lee, a Grand National-winning jockey who suffered a spinal injury in 2024 in a riding accident, went direct to the centre from hospital to start his rehabilitation.\n\"The second I got out of the van, Matt was there,\" Lee said. \"He is a class act in every way.\"\nWhen Hampson turned 40 last year, he spoke of his pride in how he, and those he works with, have \"shaken things up for the disability world\".\n\"The world is a lot more inclusive. You were just existing back then,\" Hampson said when reflecting on the support he received after he first left hospital with his injury.\n\"Now you can get busy living and you can do things. It's a challenge, every day is a challenge, but it makes it enjoyable and makes it worthwhile.\n\"You feel like you are actually getting somewhere, actually changing the world for disabled people but also changing the world for a lot of other people as well.\n\"I'm immensely proud of what we do here.\"\nNatalie Jackson, BBC East Midlands Today sports editor:\nI have been covering Matt Hampson's story for 20 years and first met him in Stoke Mandeville Hospital not long after his accident. \nWhen he was first injured he could only communicate by blinking and clicking, and his injury is the worst level of tetraplegia \u2013 paralysed  from the neck down and on a ventilator.  \nHe was in hospital for 18 months and I filmed with him during his last week in hospital before he came home. \nI was nervous about meeting him because I was worried about saying the wrong thing but he instantly put me at ease with his smile, humour and positivity. And that mental strength he has used ever since to change the way people view disability and to shake up the disability world, changing and saving hundreds of lives. \nHe has an incredible ability to know what people need. \nI have seen people take their first steps at his centre and seen him take people from a dark place and transform their lives, proving that you can have a full and incredible life after a spinal injury \u2013 Getting Busy Living.",

        "article_text": "A lack of this vital nutrient is one of the world's leading causes of disability \u2013 but exactly when it becomes a problem, and the best way to treat it, remains unclear.\nWhen Megan Ryan first noticed her fatigue, she assumed it was normal. After all, she was a single parent to a three-year-old.\u00a0She also worked full-time. Almost every day, when she picked her son up from daycare, she'd fall asleep with him during his afternoon nap. She didn't think much about it. \"I just thought, 'Oh, this is motherhood',\" says Ryan, who lives in upstate New York, US. At a routine medical check-up in June 2023, her doctor asked if she felt exhausted. Blood test results showed that Ryan had iron deficiency anaemia.\nLooking back, there had been other signs. Despite regularly working out, Ryan had suddenly started to feel winded on routine hikes. She had also had iron deficiency before, during pregnancy. That time, her midwife suspected it after Ryan mentioned that her only pregnancy craving was ice \u2013 a classic sign of pica, which is, in turn, a symptom of iron deficiency.\u00a0\nIron deficiency is the\u00a0most common micronutrient deficiency in the world today, affecting roughly two billion people. It is especially prevalent among children as well as women of reproductive age, including pregnant women.\nThe condition can cause a wide range of consequences. When a pregnant woman doesn't have adequate iron stores, for example, it can affect the foetus' brain development and there is also a higher risk of low birth weight, preterm birth, dying during pregnancy and stillbirth. For babies and toddlers, not having enough iron can affect long-term development, with studies finding that children are at risk\u00a0of exhibiting behavioural issues \u2013 they are less happy and contented, and tend to be more socially inhibited. It can also influence children's motor skills, and cognitive ability even years after a deficiency has been corrected. In adults, iron deficiency is one of the world's leading causes of disability. In rare cases, it can be life-threatening.\n\"It's a major global problem,\" says Michael Zimmermann, professor\u00a0of human nutrition at the University of Oxford in the UK and a long-time researcher of micronutrient deficiencies. \"It's very common. It's not going away very fast. And it is associated with a lot of disability.\"\nMost scientists agree that iron deficiency is a common condition. But other questions persist, such as how exactly to define iron deficiency, or how likely it is, in the absence of other symptoms, to raise the risk of poor health outcomes. So, when should, and shouldn't, someone supplement their iron?\u00a0\nWhat isn't disputed is that some groups are more susceptible to iron deficiency than others.\nIn women, for example, iron-deficiency anaemia \u2013 where the body does not have enough iron to make sufficient red blood cells \u2013 is a leading cause of disability worldwide. One study of first-time US blood donors found that iron levels were low in 12% of women, but in less than 3% of men, reflecting the impact made by regular blood loss through menstruation. Then there's the impact of pregnancy, which diverts nutrition to the foetus, meaning that women in this group are particularly at risk. One study found that 46% of UK women had anaemia at some point during pregnancy \u2013 though not all cases stemmed from iron deficiency.\nEndurance athletics, vegetarianism or veganism and frequent blood donation can all put both men and women at increased risk. People with certain health conditions might also be prone to lower iron levels. Kidney disease and coeliac disease can decrease iron absorption, for example.\nBut children are among the most vulnerable group to iron deficiency because the mineral is so important for their development.\n\"What's the most rapid period of growth in our entire lifespan? Infancy,\" says Mark Corkins, chair of the Committee on Nutrition at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). \"You triple your birth weight by a year of age. You double your length.\" As our bodies grow, they need more blood. And red blood cells are built \u2013 in part \u2013 on iron. Without that necessary iron, says Corkins, you risk not able to produce enough red blood cells to deliver oxygen to your growing tissues, including the brain.\nIron deficiency is especially common in children from lower income countries. \"In studies I've done in Africa, 70% of babies between six and 12 months of age have clear iron-deficiency anaemia,\" says Zimmermann.\nEven in wealthier countries, which have better overall nutrition and which are more likely to fortify certain food products with iron, this deficiency persists. Up to 4% of toddlers in the US, for example, have iron-deficiency anaemia, while some 15% have iron deficiency.\nIron deficiency, iron-deficiency anaemia, and anaemia\nAnaemia occurs when someone is not producing enough normal red blood cells or haemoglobin, the substance that carries oxygen around in your blood. While this can be due to various factors, around half of all anaemia cases are caused by iron deficiency. Adults with this condition, iron-deficiency anaemia, might experience weakness, extreme fatigue, or shortness of breath, among other symptoms. Symptoms in babies and small children are similar, though they might also have sleep issues \u2013 particularly frequent night wakes, restlessness during sleep, and difficulty falling asleep.\nJust because someone is iron deficient does not necessarily mean they will have anaemia. \"Iron deficiency can be considered a stage prior to anaemia,\" says clinical haemotologist Sant-Rayn Pasricha, the head of the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health who specialises in iron deficiency and related conditions.\nThe severity of the deficiency plays a key role, Pasricha explains. When someone gets low on iron, their body begins to form red blood cells differently, he says. They get smaller and, eventually, the amount of oxygen-carrying haemoglobin in that person's blood drops below a healthy level. \"That's when we reach iron deficiency anaemia,\" Pasricha says.\nIron deficiency and anaemia are generally diagnosed with a blood test \u2013 usually one that examines levels of ferritin, a protein that helps store iron, or haemoglobin.\nSome specialists question whether iron deficiency is always a cause for concern \u2013 especially if it arises in the absence of any physical symptoms and if the patient does not have anaemia.\nPasricha co-authored a review to help inform the World Health Organization's guidelines on iron supplementation in women. In that research, he found something interesting.\u00a0\nWhile those women in clinical trials who were iron deficient and reported feeling fatigued found that their fatigue improved upon taking iron supplements, the intervention didn't change the energy levels of women who were also iron deficient, but who had not reported fatigue.\u00a0\n\"This hints to us that, at least in adults, if you're clinically unwell with an iron deficiency, then of course you should be treated and that will improve how you feel,\" Pasricha says. \"But it also suggests that, if you're feeling perfectly fine, and someone just finds that you have a low iron level \u2013 then it's hard to be sure that that treating you then would boost you to feel any different.\"\nOverall, iron deficiency in the absence of anaemia has been studied less than iron-deficiency anaemia. But there are some broad conclusions we can make, researchers say.\n\"The consensus is that iron-deficiency anaemia is certainly worse,\" says Zimmermann. \"But iron deficiency is also associated with impairment.\"\nAccording to some studies, the effects of iron-deficiency anaemia \u2013 particularly in children \u2013 can be long-lasting. \"It's not just about [poor health outcomes] \u2013 it is that you didn't maximise your development,\" Corkins says.\nOne review, for example, found a \"consistent association\" between children with iron-deficiency anaemia having poorer cognitive performance compared to controls. However, the researchers note, perhaps it's not iron-deficiency anaemia that's the problem. It could be the effect of anaemia in general, which depresses energy levels. The researchers also say in their review that it is hard to rule out the influence of socioeconomic factors on children\u2019s behaviour and cognition.\nThis complexity lies at the heart of all nutrition research: is it the absence of a nutrient itself that's the problem, or is that deficiency a sign of something else going on?\nTo complicate matters further, the criteria for defining iron deficiency in children is still up for debate, says Zimmermann. Because children are growing so fast, he adds, iron deficiency normally quickly leads to anaemia \u2013 which means it's not easy to find, and study, iron-deficient children who are not anaemic.\nGiven that, and the potential consequences for their development, guidelines often advise supplementing children with iron at any sign of deficiency \u2013 or even to supplement as a prevention measure.\u00a0\nIn the US, for example, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies who are exclusively breastfed receive iron drops from four months old, for example. This is because breastmilk has low levels of iron, while formula milk is usually fortified.\nBut some researchers question this approach.\nPasricha was involved in the largest trial to date that has examined the effect of supplementation on child development, he says. The study, of 3,300 eight-month-old babies in Bangladesh, randomised children into groups that received either daily iron supplementation for three months, or a placebo. He and colleagues measured the children's neurodevelopment before and after the supplementation. \"We did not see any evidence of a functional benefit,\" he says, although they also saw no harm either way.\n\"We did see that haemoglobin and iron status did improve in the children that received iron \u2013 but we didn't see that affect child development,\" says Pasricha. The \"why\", he says, \"is something that the team is really grappling with\".\nOther research has yielded similar findings. For example, in one study, even after infants with iron-deficiency anaemia received supplementation that corrected their anaemia, they continued to show more restless sleep patterns than their cohorts \u2013 sometimes even years later.\nOne possible reason might be that even a brief period of deficiency can lead to long-lasting harm. One study, for example, found that when children had had iron deficiency at birth, they had less activation in the regions of their brain related to cognitive control at eight to 11 years old \u2013 even if their iron levels had been corrected.\u00a0\nBut another possibility, Pasricha says, is that it isn't the low iron itself that causes poorer development, but that low iron is an indicator of something else \u2013 such as other nutrients in a person's diet that are missing.\nMeanwhile, there could also be downsides to supplementing children who don't actually have a deficiency. Some studies have found that babies and toddlers who had adequate iron levels, but received supplementation, had poorer weight gain and less growth compared to controls. Randomised controlled trials have found that babies randomly assigned to high-iron formula milk scored more poorly on cognitive tests of abilities like visual memory, reading comprehension and mathematics at both 10 years old and 16 years old, compared to those on a low-iron formulation. However, exactly how much iron supplementation would avoid these effects remains unclear, the researchers say as other factors could also be involved.\nGiven results like this, however, some experts have criticised US guidelines to supplement all breastfed infants.\nSupplements can also have other side effects. Zimmermann, for example, has studied how supplementation can affect people's microbiome. Bacteria thrive on iron, he says. The very small amount of iron that breastmilk has is bound to protective substances like lactoferrin, which helps to keep iron away from potential pathogens in the gut \u2013 especially protective for babies, who have immature immune systems. Giving a baby aged six months old micronutrient powders containing iron, which is what many experts recommend, could result in a negative outcome, says Zimmermann.\n\"These powders have very high amounts of iron in them\u2026 which can cause a very rapid shift in the microbiome,\" says Zimmermann. The babies can't absorb all that iron, which ends up impacting their gut microbiome \u2013 potentially towards a balance favouring \"the pathogens we worry most about in babies\", he says. This includes E. coli, which grows prolifically in the presence of iron.\nMany clinicians and researchers agree, however, that when someone has iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anaemia along with symptoms, supplementing can be one of the fastest ways to help them improve. One review of iron deficiency in endurance athletes, for example, found that supplementation not only improved ferritin and haemoglobin, but athletes' aerobic capacity, too.\u00a0\nWhether to take supplements \u2013 or give them to a child \u2013 is something that people should decide with the help of a doctor, experts say.\nBut in an ideal world, people would get sufficient iron by eating a balanced diet that includes iron-rich foods, and avoid developing a deficiency in the first place \u2013 though this is not always possible. Ingredients such as liver or red meat, pulses, including kidney and edamame beans and chickpeas, as well as nuts and dried fruits are all considered good sources of iron.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants aged six to 12 months need 11 mg of iron per day. For toddlers, they recommend 7 mg, and for four- to eight-year-olds, 10 mg.\nPart of the higher recommendation for younger babies is because of their rapid development, experts say. But it's also because there is an assumption being made that most infants' first solids will be foods like iron-fortified cereals, as well as fruits and vegetables \u2013 non-heme sources of iron, which the body absorbs less readily than heme sources, which are animal-derived, like meat, fish and eggs.\n\"Diet is the best approach. Your body tends to take it up better. Your body tends to use it better,\" Corkins says. \"Now, if someone is profoundly anaemic, and you're trying to get them fixed faster \u2013 then you do supplementation.\"\nAs for Ryan, she was able to correct her iron deficiency both times it happened: in pregnancy, with a supplement, and in 2023, with iron infusions, administered at her hospital, every two weeks for five months. \"It wasn't a quick fix,\" she says. With time, however, she noticed her fatigue fade.\nDisclaimer\n All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of a doctor or any other health care professional.

        "article_text": "In pockets of the British countryside, it's possible to stumble across clusters of beautifully designed, Scandi-style cabins. These aren't a product of the latest trend for off-grid retreats, but were created half a century ago by a pair of Welsh architects, Hird & Brooks. How did they become gripped by crafting the perfect holiday home? And why were they so inspired by Denmark?\nBy the 1970s, John Hird and Graham Brooks had already won a slew of major awards for their sleek, modernist post-war villas across the Vale of Glamorgan in Wales. But the highpoint of their careers was the prefabricated timber cabins they designed in the 1970s and 1980s for holiday parks in Wales and Forestry Commission sites in Scotland, and the English counties of Cornwall and Yorkshire.\nFor Brooks, the cabins were an opportunity to distil his design ethos into its clearest, purest, most compact form, says Peter Halliday, co-author with Bethan Dalton of Cabin Crew: Hird & Brooks and the Pursuit of the Perfect Holiday House. \"He could do away with the tiresome necessities of domesticity that have to be accommodated in a conventional house, and focus on what really matters.\"\nProfessor Richard Weston, an architect and former Chair of Architecture at Cardiff University, echoes this. \"[Brooks] always said the holiday cabins were the highlight of his career,\" he writes in the book. \"They are a distillation of everything Graham stood for \u2013 the love of wood, the appreciation of proper architecture, the orientation of the Sun, and the feel for detailing and space \u2013 all stripped down for essential living.\"\nHird & Brooks were part of a worldwide boom in simple holiday homes. Many Danes and Swedes already spent their leisure time in cabins, or sommerhuse, along the coast or in forests. In 1960, Denmark had around 50,000 summerhouses. By 1975, the number had trebled, according to Cabin Crew.\nMeanwhile, the summer cottage (a close relation of the dacha) was becoming a staple of Soviet society in the Baltic states and much of Central Europe. Everyone, it seems, was at it, even the big-name architects. Le Corbusier, the grand master of modernism, created his Cabanon de Vacances in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin in the south of France in the early 1950s. And in the US, architect Paul Rudolph was behind a series of simple wooden structures on the Florida Keys.\nThe mushrooming of cabins in the UK was in part a result of increased car ownership from the 1930s, as well as the Holidays with Pay Act of 1938, explains Cabin Crew. The latter led to the construction of mass-scale seaside holiday camps equipped with prefab accommodation.\nHird & Brooks' cabins \u2013 some to be bought, others to be rented \u2013 drew on the duo's many study trips to Denmark, because Brooks was Denmark mad. \"His heroes were Danish architects, his reference points were the Danish architectural press, and his new wife helped him to embed a Danish design aesthetic into their everyday lives,\" the book explains.\n\"It was all about simple, intelligent design, woodland settings, and a close affinity with nature,\" Halliday tells the BBC. \"The entire Hird & Brooks team became fascinated, and were eager to apply the same principles here in the UK.\"\nThe firm completed their first holiday homes, for Bierwood near Tenby in Pembrokeshire, in the early 1970s. Timber-framed with exposed roof beams, these lodges were clad in pine match-boarding and had corrugated tiled roofs and Sun terraces. Inside, features included built-in beds and a galley kitchen. The colour pallet \u2013 a blue-grey stain on the exterior timber facings, and orange-red window frames and doors \u2013 was inspired by those Danish study trips.\n\"The clearest Scandinavian influence is the use of wood \u2013 from the big exposed structural beams to the cedar cladding to the built-in furniture to the little details like the wooden door handles and fitted coat hooks,\" says Halliday. He also cites the space-saving wetrooms, \"which were a complete novelty in the UK, and the wood-burning stoves, which were commonplace in Scandinavia but not available here, so the architects designed their own, and had them manufactured locally\". And for all the Welsh cabins, Brooks looked at the orientation of the Sun before positioning each cabin on its plot, so as to ensure that users could enjoy as much sunshine as possible \u2013 even if sunshine wasn't always abundant in Wales.\nLater, the Forestry Commission \u2013 a national organisation owning huge swathes of British countryside \u2013 brought in Hird & Brooks to design holiday cabins for its sites at Deerpark in Cornwall, Keldy Castle in North Yorkshire, and Taynuilt in Scotland. \"For the Forestry Commission cabins, it was all about imparting a sense of adventure,\" says Halliday. \"That was the intended function, and everything about the design reflects it.\"\nSome were A-frame designs, some were flat-roofed, and others had standard-pitch roofs. There was also some playfulness. Inside, the second bedrooms had a staggered stack of three bunks. \"High-level sleeping and play platforms offered views into the forest, and large slatted terraces with integrated benches blurred the distinctions between indoors and outdoors \u2013 all of which added to the sense of adventure the Forestry Commission was so keen to impart,\" write Cabin Crew's authors. Soft furnishings stayed with the distinctive red and orange colourways that the firm had introduced in earlier cabins.\nBy the end of the 1970s, there were at least 35 UK companies manufacturing or promoting kit-built chalets, and more than 350 holiday parks offering them. Meanwhile, on the continent, the Dutch modernist architect Jacob Berend Bakema produced designs for the holiday village chain Center Parcs.\nAt this time, the British cabin movement was in part a reaction against the \"white heat of technology\", a term used by Prime Minister Harold Wilson in the 1960s to promote science. Bruce Peter, Professor of design history at Glasgow School of Art, expands on this in the book's introduction. \"A growing environmental consciousness emerged, at least among the more politically progressive and culturally engaged. This manifested itself in growing interests in wholefoods, alternative medicine and natural living.\"\nAnd for Peter, with the benefit of half-a-century's hindsight, Hird & Brooks' holiday cabins \"appear very successfully to have withstood the test of time. Back in the 1970s, environmentalism was mostly considered to be a fringe concern, but, in recent decades, it has moved into the mainstream. The cabins' construction \u2013 using mostly natural materials in an era when synthetics were all the rage \u2013 now appears to have been highly prescient. And, with reasonable maintenance, their timber external finishes have tended to weather well.\" What's more, he writes, the type of outdoor-centred holiday-making for which the cabins were intended has also proven enduringly popular, at least among particular demographics.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0How ultra-traditional tweed found a new fanbase\n\u2022\u00a0How Scandinavian dressing can make us happier\n\u2022\u00a0How to transform your home with art\nA few factors coming together means that there is now a renewed interest in the cabins, Dalton tells the BBC. First, she cites the popularity of mid-century architecture and interior design, \"especially among those of us who grew up in the 1970s and 1980s. It evokes a nostalgic charm, reminding us of the spaces and styles we fondly remember from childhood.\"\nThen there's the \"tiny house\" movement, with cabin life appealing to people seeking a simpler, more minimal way of life, off-grid and immersed in nature. \"A cabin holiday offers a taste of that lifestyle without the full-time commitment,\" says Dalton. \"And, of course, in this digital age, people are always looking for an Instagrammable holiday image, and these cabins certainly have that covered with their striking red-painted windows and doors.\"\nSo perhaps it's no surprise that some of Brooks' cabins have endured. And several of them are still in the hands of the original families. \"For the most part, the cabins look to be in near-pristine condition,\" the authors write. \"Clearly, the owners like things the way they are.\"\nCabin Crew: Hird & Brooks and the Pursuit of the Perfect Holiday House by Peter Halliday and Bethan Dalton is published by The Modernist.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.\nMark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.\nHe had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.\nBut unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States. \nBut holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.\nAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.\nWith three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.\nThe son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. \nIn 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs. \n\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race. \n\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"\nIn 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.\nIn 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.\nAlthough central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. \nThat move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.\nHe is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.\nIn 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.\nInterest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.\nConfusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.\nUnlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.\nIn 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.\nBefore the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.\nIn the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.\nHe described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.\nThe Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.\nHis final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\". \nCarney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.\nFrom 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.\nHe was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.\nAlthough he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.\nAfter Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.\n\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said. \n\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"\nHe seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".\nThe Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.\n\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.\nThings changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.\nReports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.\nFreeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.\n\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\" \nStill, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. \nThe Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.\nThey have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament. \nHis team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.\nIn addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.\nHe is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\nOne of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.\nShortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.\nOn immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.\nHis biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US. \nThere are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre.

Getty ImagesJerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve (left) and Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England, walk the grounds during the Jackson Hole economic symposium in 2019Crossing paths with TrumpCarney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books. How Britain's former top banker became Canada's prime minister13 hours agoShareSaveBen King and Robin Levinson KingBBC NewsReporting fromLondon, UK and Toronto, CanadaShareSaveWatch: Key moments on Mark Carney\u2019s journey from banker to Canada's PMThe former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PMA simple guide to Canada's federal electionHow Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politicsEarly life and childhoodAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship.",

        "article_text": "Immigration officials have reportedly removed all migrants being held at Guantanamo Bay and returned them to the US, just weeks after sending the first batch to the US military base in Cuba.\nAccording to US media reports, all the remaining migrants detained there were transported to another immigration facility in Louisiana.\nIn February, a separate group of migrants were abruptly moved from the facility after only a few weeks.\nShortly after taking office in January, President Donald Trump ordered that an existing facility used to hold migrants in Guantanamo Bay be expanded to hold some 30,000 people. \nBut so far, only a few hundred appear to have been sent there.\nIt is unclear why the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has brought the latest group of migrants held at Guantanamo back to the US.

        "article_text": "As an engineer who flies into hurricanes for the US government, Josh Ripp is accustomed to turbulence. But the last two weeks have been far bumpier than he's used to.\nIn late February, the Trump administration fired Mr Ripp and over 800 recently hired or promoted staff at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency using a form email, part of ongoing cuts to the federal workforce.\nSuddenly, he and several other members of the elite Hurricane Hunters flight team were out of a job - until around 21:00 Friday when he received a second email. He was to report back to work in Lakeland, Florida, 12 March, it said.\nFor Mr Ripp, a retired US Navy officer who voted for Donald Trump, the confusion highlighted the dangers of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency slashing thousands of government jobs to cut costs without agency input.\nAs soon as this week, the Trump administration could consider axing more than 1,000 additional staffers at NOAA, according to BBC News partner CBS News. Those potential cuts, plus losses from previous firings and buyouts, would cost the agency up to 20% of its workforce, the New York Times reported. \nThe White House did not comment on additional cuts, but a Trump administration official said an \"extensive process was conducted\" to ensure \"mission critical functions\" were not compromised during the first round of dismissals.\n\"NOAA provides vital information to the entire country and we do it at a fraction of the cost that anyone else could do,\" Mr Ripp said. \"There's a lot of jobs out there that are very important. NOAA is a small agency. Every little bit hurts.\"\nThe cuts will not only harm government functions, staffers and weather experts warn, but they could disrupt the daily lives of Americans who rely on accurate NOAA data more than they know.\nThe data that powers Americans' smartphone weather apps and informs local meteorologists comes from NOAA and its subsidiary, the National Weather Service. Americans use it to decide what to wear, and whether to meet friends in the park or indoors. They rely on it during hurricanes, tornadoes or blizzards.  \nAirlines and federal aviation officials need forecasts to safely guide planes through the sky. Retailers use them to schedule customer deliveries. Shipping companies and fisheries in the Great Lakes rely on NOAA updates about ice conditions and algae blooms.\n\"People take for granted how accurate the weather forecasts are,\" said Andy Hazelton, a NOAA climate scientist who modelled hurricane paths and was fired in February. \"Forecasts are going to get worse because offices are understaffed.\"\nHurricane Hunters measure hurricanes from the inside, gauging their strength and paths. As a flight engineer for the P-3 aircraft, Mr Ripp ensures that the nearly 50-year-old planes NOAA uses are safe. Missions cannot take off without team members like him aboard.\nThe original staffing cuts would have limited hurricane flights, said Lt Kerri Englert, a flight director for the Hurricane Hunters -  also cut in February then reinstated. \n\"That means data doesn't get ingested into the models, and forecasting for those hurricane tracks and intensity will be less accurate,\" she said. adding that it would impact evacuations, money allocated for storm preparation and disaster response.\nAlready, local National Weather Service offices have scaled back lesser known but crucial work, due to cuts.\nFor example, scientific balloon launches from Alaska - vital to national forecasts because the location allows them to assess systems moving from west to east - were curtailed, weather experts told the BBC. Launches in New York and Maine also were reduced.\nNOAA spokeswoman Susan Buchanan declined to comment on individual staffing decisions, citing agency policy.\nBut, she said, \"NOAA remains dedicated to its mission, providing timely information, research, and resources that serve the American public and ensure our nation's environmental and economic resilience.\"\n\"We continue to provide weather information, forecasts and warnings pursuant to our public safety mission.\"\nA Trump administration official said an \"extensive process was conducted\" to ensure \"mission critical functions\" were not compromised.\nSome of NOAA's long-term, climate-focused initiatives also face cuts.\nBefore he was fired, NOAA scientist Zach Labe studied using artificial intelligence to prepare for deadly heat waves. Others in his division, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, also were fired and their specialities make them difficult to replace, he said.\n\"People who were impacted were definitely the key people who were leading the development of the US weather models,\" Mr Labe told BBC.\nEven private sector weather companies rely on accurate NOAA and NWS data for their products.\n\"We operate on razor thin margins to keep costs low,\" said Ryan Hickman, owner and chief technology officer at AllisonHouse, which takes data from NOAA and other sources to create custom weather visualisations.\nFor AllisonHouse, NOAA is both a data source and a client.\nMr Hickman was particularly worried that the agency's radar and satellite services could be impacted. \"Nobody else has these satellite capabilities NOAA has,\" he said.\n\"Unless someone has a billion dollars to build a weather satellite and launch it into geostationary orbit, and have it sit there and read all this data, and bring it back down to Earth so that everyone else can see it and use it, then what are we doing here?\"\nThe prospect of more cuts alarms scientists and private businessmen like Mr Hickman, who believe they will strain the agency's maintenance of the complex and delicate instruments needed to produce real-time as well as future forecasts.\nNOAA's primary goal is to keep Americans informed about the future, in ways both mundane and urgent, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\"There is almost unanimous horror among people who really understand how this works,\" he said.\nHe feared some in the administration believe in a \"philosophy that not only can we not plan for the future, but we also should not even try to prevent bad things from happening.\"\nBack in Florida, Mr Ripp still doesn't know what the future holds.\nDuring his brief unemployment, he explored opportunities flying for a private firefighting company \u2013 and still would not rule out leaving NOAA. He remains angry that fellow veterans were caught up in the layoffs.\nHe backed Trump due to the president's commitment to the rule of law, he said, but now Mr Ripp thinks Trump is flouting the correct procedures for reducing the federal workforce.\n\"We're very good stewards of the money we're given by the government. We're not out here committing waste or anything like that,\" Mr Ripp said. \"If you're looking for government savings, NOAA's not the place.\"",
