        "article_text": "Businesses are bracing for possible impact after neighbours India and Bangladesh  recently imposed tit-for-tat trade restrictions after months of verbal sparring.\nLast month, Bangladesh restricted land imports of cotton yarn from India to shield local industries from cheaper imports. \nDhaka's move came days after India abruptly stopped the transhipment facility it had offered Bangladesh to export its cargoes to third countries via its ports and airports, citing \"congestion\".\nRelations between the countries have soured since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in August after massive protests. She is currently in exile in India and an interim administration headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is in charge.\nSince then Dhaka has demanded Hasina be extradited to face charges of crimes against humanity, money laundering and corruption. Hasina denies the accusations against her, and Delhi has not officially reacted to the demand.\nIndia has also frequently criticised reports of attacks on the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh. It recently said the alleged killing of a Hindu community leader \"reflects a pattern of systematic persecution under the interim government\".\nBangladesh, a Muslim-majority nation, denies targeting minorities, calling most incidents politically motivated or ordinary crimes. Hindus make up less than 10% of its 170 million population.\nAs the countries spar, firms are counting the cost.\nYarn, vital for Bangladesh's clothing factories, can still enter by sea and air - but they are slower and costlier routes.\nIn 2024, India had exported $1.6bn (\u00a31.2bn) worth of cotton yarn to Bangladesh, a third of it via land ports.\nThe now-halted transhipment facility let Bangladeshi exporters send clothes made for high-end brands by road to Indian cities, from where it would be flown to Europe and the US.\n\"It's a blow [to Bangladesh's fast-fashion export industry],\" says Anis Ahmed, head of supply chain firm MGH Group, which ships for European fast-fashion brands. \"The India route got cargo to Western countries in a week. By sea, it takes up to eight weeks.\"\nBangladesh, the world's second-largest garment exporter after China, shipped $38bn in clothing last year. Over $1bn of this moved via the India land-air route, which Ahmed says was thriving.\nLimited air freight capacity and under-equipped airports hamper direct exports from Bangladesh.\nMany see Delhi's withdrawal of the transhipment facility as a response to remarks by Yunus during a recent China visit.\nHe had called Bangladesh the \"only guardian of the ocean\" for India's landlocked north-east and suggested that the region could become an \"extension of the Chinese economy.\"\nLeaders from India's north-eastern states called the comments \"offensive\".\nYunus's remarks, spotlighting India's strategic vulnerability in the region to China, raised alarms in Delhi.\nIndia's north-east is linked to the mainland by the 20km-wide Siliguri Corridor - dubbed the \"chicken's neck\" - flanked by Nepal and Bangladesh and close to Tibet's Chumbi Valley.\nWith a history of border tensions and having lost a war in 1962, Indian defence planners fear that China could target the corridor to cut off the north-eastern states from the rest of the country in any future conflict.\nBangladeshi analysts say Yunus's remarks were misinterpreted and aimed at promoting regional connectivity.\nDuring his China visit, Dhaka also welcomed Beijing's interest in a $1bn Teesta River project in northern Bangladesh.\nIndian analysts warn that Chinese involvement in the project, which is not far from the strategic Siliguri Corridor, could unsettle Delhi.\nBut there is concern on both sides over the frosty ties.\nResentment is growing in Bangladesh over tightened Indian visa rules, with approvals plunging since Hasina was driven from power. Previously, two million Bangladeshis visited India yearly for tourism, business, education and medical care. The number of visas issued daily has dropped by over 80% in the past few months according to local media.\nHasina's stay in India and the extradition demand remains a big irritant.\n\"They should realise that there is no way that we can just hand Hasina to them. We know what will happen to her if she's handed over. I think public opinion in India would not countenance that,\" says Shyam Saran, a former Indian foreign secretary.\nAmid rising tensions, India's clothing manufacturers' association has called for a ban on Bangladeshi garment imports via land. Bangladeshi analysts warn that more trade barriers would be counter-productive.\n\"I think there is a strong view nowadays in Bangladesh that we should also reassess the other transit and transhipment facilities given to India [for its north-eastern states] by the earlier [Hasina] government,\" Debapriya Bhattacharya, a senior economist with the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Dhaka, tells the BBC.\nIndia uses Bangladeshi ports, roads and waterways to transport goods to its landlocked north-east, cutting distance, time and costs. However, officials say transit volumes haven't reached expected levels.\nDelhi-Dhaka tensions are rising amid growing ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan.\nBangladesh, once East Pakistan, fought for independence in 1971 with Indian support. Hasina distanced herself from Pakistan during her 15-year rule.\nPakistan's Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch visited Dhaka last month, the first such visit in 15 years. A planned visit by Pakistan Deputy PM Ishaq Dar was postponed due to tensions between Delhi and Islamabad over the deadly militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir last week.\n\"I don't think there is any concern over Dhaka's reachout to Pakistan. If there is any suggestion that there is an intent to work together and make things difficult for India, then that will obviously cause concern,\" says Saran, the former Indian diplomat.\nSharp official reactions from both sides are also influencing public opinion in India and Bangladesh. There is a growing anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh, with Indian media accused of exaggerating the attacks on minorities and Islamist threats.\nThe people-to-people ties built over years seem to be on the retreat, and analysts point out that if both sides fail to stay calm, their actions could harm trade and economic relations.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

It is unbelievable,\" said TNT Sports pundit Ally McCoist as the players walked off the pitch at half-time.Inter Milan boss Simone Inzaghi gave Yamal the highest of praise afterwards.",

        "article_text": "BBC's North America team asked for your questions to mark US President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office.\nHere is a selection of those answered by our staff writers and correspondents.  \nThey have aimed to explain the context and facts behind several of the biggest topics in the Trump administration, including the economy and how Trump would handle a war.\nA UK-based reader asks how the UK economy might be impacted by tariffs.\nThe decisions made thousands of miles away will affect the UK economy. Most directly affected are those exporters selling into America, contending with that 10% extra charge (or even more in some cases) being applied to their goods: Do they try to compensate for that by cutting costs elsewhere \u2013 or risk a blow to sales?\nAnd complex supply chains mean that disruption to other economies could be felt here. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey last week referred to a \"growth shock\" \u2013 many economists have cut their forecasts. No one yet is clear on how this trade war will play out, the uncertainty itself is damaging.\nBut the impact on inflation could work the other way. Countries such as China may be tempted to divert goods here instead, given the barriers they face in America. And the drop in oil and other commodity prices, amid market turmoil, could also bode well for keeping bills down.\nSo many economists reckon that with a weaker growth and inflation outlook, interest rates could fall faster than previously thought. A cut of 0.25 percentage points is widely expected next week, another could follow in June.\nAnother reader asks how Trump's immigration policy is likely to affect Canadian-American relations, especially for dual citizens or people with mixed-status families.\nIf the first 100 days are anything to go by, relations between Canada and the US are almost certainly going to continue to be tense - both as a result of tariffs and Trump's repeated, and near constant calls for Canada to become part of the US.\nWe had a taste of that just this week, when - as Canadians headed to the polls in their general election - Trump took to Truth Social to call on Canadians to elect him, seemingly referring to himself as a candidate, to reap the benefits of being the \"cherished\" 51st state.\n\"America can no longer subsidise Canada with the hundreds of billions a year that we have been spending in the past,\" he said. \"It makes no sense unless Canada is a state\".\nHow that impacts dual citizens or mixed-status families is a bit harder to answer.\nBut we're seen a newfound sense of nationalism among many Canadians in response to Trump's rhetoric and policies, and some Americans in Canada have even reportedly given up their citizenship.\nWhile cross-border ties are very unlikely to ground to a standstill, many Canadian citizens - even those with US families - are likely to be more cautious when crossing the border, particularly after high-profile cases of Canadians being detained at the border.\nIn one case, an actress named Jasmine Moody was detained by ICE for about two weeks, later writing about her experience in a viral article in the Guardian.\nA reader asks what Trump's first 100 days tell us about how he'd handle a major international crisis, like another pandemic or a war.\nIt's hard to say how exactly Trump would handle a major international crisis, but we have had glimpses that may provide a few clues.\nTrump's first crisis came just over a week into his administration on 29 January, when a US Army helicopter collided with a passenger aircraft over the Potomac river in Washington DC, killing 67 people.\nLater that morning, I sat in the White House briefing room as Trump - with no evidence - alleged that the diversity, equity and inclusion policies at the Federal Aviation Administration may have led to the crash.\nThis suggests that in the event of a crisis, Trump is later to \"fire from the hip\", sometimes speaking before all the facts are established. Many will remember Trump's initial dismissal of the Covid-19 pandemic in his first administration, sometimes downplaying it as something that would soon \"disappear\".\nMore so than other presidents, Trump also leans heavily on the power of the executive branch, making decisions from the Oval Office that have real-world implications, sometimes bypassing any discussion on Capitol Hill.\nThose close to Trump are quick to say that he listens intently to his advisors, often letting discussions play out amongst them before his eyes. This is, for example, largely what happened with the tariffs issue.\nUltimately, however, he is the one who decides the government's course of action, even if he lets his inner circle - which is perhaps more loyal and disciplined than in the last administration - carry out the details.\nArafin in Bangladesh wants to know how developing countries can navigate this evolving trade landscape and mitigate the risks.\nThere is just no way poorer countries could ever eliminate their trade surplus with the United States.\nThe world envisioned by Donald Trump - where citizens of developing countries buy as many American products as are sold the other way - is simply not possible.\nThe average Bangladeshi citizen, for example, is 32 times poorer than the average American.\nIn this case, the best Bangladeshi officials could do is promise Washington they will reduce some non-tariff barriers that are in place that make it hard for American companies to do business there.\nFor example, they could scrap quotas on imports, cut red tape or tackle corruption more effectively.\nThese small concessions - along with the assumption that American consumers won't put up with rocketing prices - may lead to a softening or removal of Trump's tariffs.\nAfter all, if countries with large and cheap workforces can't sell Americans affordable goods, then who will?\nOne other thing that developing countries will want to consider closely is the role of China in all of this.\nIf you're a worker in a clothing factory in Bangladesh, a 37% US tax might seem a crippling blow to your livelihood - but it's still better than the 125% tariff that Chinese manufacturers are facing.\nAs a Malaysian rubber glove manufacturer told me recently: \"We're not exactly jumping with joy, but this may well benefit us\".\nLimiting dealings with China has been suggested as a way for developing countries to get a better trade deal with the White House. But that isn't very realistic.\nBeijing is by far and away the number one investor in the developing world. If you live in Africa, Asia or South America - it's probably China building your railways, factories and power plants, not the United States.\nThe American consumer market is still the richest in the world and developing countries will want to fight tooth and nail to maintain access to it - but equally there is no way they can side with the US over China.\n\nChris in County Durham, UK, asks if Donald Trump is making millions of dollars on the US stock market by initiating a slump in share values, buying heavy, then reversing his policies to watch his share prices rocket up.\nCritics are accusing President Trump of manipulating the stock market. White House officials have denied the allegations, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling it part of Trump's \"art of the deal\".\nHere's what we know so far:\nOn 9 April, Trump posted on Truth Social, in all caps: \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY! DJT.\" Shortly after, he announced he was pausing the toughest tariffs for 90 days. In between, options traders placed big bets on a market rebound, which ended up being spot on.\nThis led to accusations of market manipulation and insider trading, with Democrats like Senator Adam Schiff calling for an investigation.\nHowever, these cases are hard to prove \u2013 and even harder when you're talking about the president. Legal experts say it would be a \"high\" bar to prove Trump did something illegal in this case. Plus he posted the information publicly.\nClaims of insider trading might have some merit under the STOCK Act, which restricts public officials from profiting off non-public information. Although the White House could argue that the President can't \"gain\" information about policy changes if he \"created\" them.\nSo, it's still up in the air \u2013 but probably not something he needs to lose sleep over.\nJean-Claude asks if there any way within the US Constitution by which Congress could stop Trump's tariffs and take away his freedom to issue Executive Orders at will.\nDonald Trump has been pushing the boundaries of presidential authority with both his tariff declarations and more than 130 executive orders.\nTo do so, he has been asserting that Congress has given him the power to take these actions. To answer your question simply, then - any power that Congress gives, Congress can take back.\nTraditionally, executive orders are a presidential interpretation of how laws should be implemented. Congress could step in and tell the White House that those interpretations are wrong.\nTrump has been citing a 1977 law that grants him power to enact tariffs in cases of national emergency. Congress could amend that law or pass legislation that says no such emergency exists. There has already been a bipartisan proposal in the Senate to do exactly that.\nThe challenge for Trump's opponents is finding a majority in the two chambers of Congress, both narrowly controlled by Republicans, to do so. The House of Representatives, in particular, is full of Republicans who are marching in lockstep with the president. The House recently adopted a provision that would make it much harder to rescind Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, for instance.\nEven if Congress was able to reach agreement on curtailing presidential power, Trump could decide to exercise his veto to block it from becoming law \u2013 something he's already threated to do with the Senate tariff bill. And if he did that, it would take two-thirds of both chambers to override the president.\nSo Congress does have the ability to stop Trump, but perhaps not the interest or will to do so \u2013 at least not unless and until next year's midterm elections shift the balance of power in the legislature toward the Democrats.\nRachel in Canada wonders if we can comment on what the real threat of annexation is for Canada with Trump in office. Should we be worried?\nA lot depends on what the US president means when he talks about making Canada the 51st state.\nIt's unlikely that both the US and Canada would agree to it through formal means - the bar is high.\nIt would need to be approved by both chambers in the US Congress, including at least 60 votes in support in the Senate, which has 100 seats.\nIt would also likely require amending the Canadian constitution, which would likely require unanimous provincial consent - no easy task - as well as Parliament's approval.\nIt's also highly unlikely that the US would invade Canada militarily.\nTrump has spoken about forcing the issue through economic pressure - with Canada sending roughly 75% of its good south of the border, he does have some leverage.\nCanada has already been hit with tariffs from the US, including the blanket tariffs on goods, though there is currently an exception for products covered by the USMCA trade deal. Those US tariffs are already being felt in some sectors.\nHowever, Trump also appears willing to come to the negotiating table. He has said he is ready to start talks with Canada's prime minister after the federal election.\nKevin in Stockport has two questions for James Lansdale, BBC News diplomatic correspondent: Not long ago President Trump said that if Russia didn't agree to take serious steps towards ending the war he would apply massive sanctions. Russia has shown no desire to reach a peace settlement. So why is Trump not going to apply these threatened sanctions before considering ending the peace initiative?\nDonald Trump is becoming increasingly frustrated at the refusal of Vladimir Putin to agree an immediate unconditional ceasefire. Recently, after his talks with President Zelensky at the Vatican, Mr Trump questioned whether Mr Putin really wanted peace and wondered if the Russian leader was leading him on. He also once again threatened \"banking\" or \"secondary\" sanctions. \nThe latter refers to sanctions on countries that are still trading with Moscow, especially those countries \u2013 like China and India \u2013 that are fuelling the Russian war machine by buying cheap Russian energy. But imposing those sanctions would be a big step with serious economic and geostrategic consequences. So for now, Mr Trump appears to want to threaten these sanctions rather than impose them.\nWhat is the hold that Putin has over Trump?\nAnalysts say that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin developed a genuinely warm personal relationship during his first term in the White House. They say Mr Trump sees in Mr Putin an equal on the world stage whom he respects. \nThe US president also made clear he wants a rapprochement between the US and Russia, one that will reset the relationship and boost trade. Strategists say the White House is also currying favour with the Kremlin because it wants to divide Moscow from Beijing, with many US policymakers seeing China as the greater threat. As to whether Mr Putin has some kind of \"hold\" over Mr Trump, there have been many allegations about the close business links the President had over the years with Russian figures who helped his investments. \nThere were also many claims of secret Kompromat about the President held in Kremlin archives. The FBI investigated. But there was always more speculation than hard fact. So Mr Trump's relationship with Mr Putin remains something of a mystery.\nRay in the UK asks: As a convicted felon, Donald Trump isn't allowed in the UK, so how can he address Parliament?\nIt is a bit more complicated than that.\nGovernment guidance \u2013 which you can read here \u2013 spells out where it is mandatory that someone is refused entry and where it is discretionary.\nIn reality, the elected leader of an ally, in particular an ally as important as the United States, is always likely to be invited, because a government is likely to conclude that this is in the UK's national interest.\nThat is the conclusion of Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 and hence the state visit being offered to President Trump.\nThe opportunity, or not, to address Parliament is a separate question and something some are arguing should be blocked.\nOne reader, Ray, asks our BBC Security correspondent Frank Gardner: Is Trump going to give Europe the time to step in, if he decides to ditch Ukraine? \nThe transatlantic alliance - the strategic partnership between Europe and North America based on shared values - is now under more strain than at any time since the Suez Crisis of 1956.\nWithin his first 100 days President Trump has completely upended the policy of the previous US administrations. For most of the time since taking office, he has appeared to favour relations with Moscow over those with Kyiv. He has also gone against the wishes of most of Europe by vowing to end Russia's isolation and talked of lifting sanctions.\nWhereas the prevailing attitude in Europe towards Ukraine is to keep supporting its war effort 'for as long as it takes', Trump has been in a hurry to end the war and normalise relations with President Putin.\nTrump's oft-repeated intent to 'get' Greenland and make it a part of the US has appalled Denmark, of which it is a self-governing part and it has rattled Scandinavian governments. Denmark lost 257 soldiers killed and wounded in the US-led campaign in Afghanistan.  It had the highest per capita death toll of all America's allies in that war.\nTrump has, however, galvanised Europe into finally doing more for its own defence.  \nAfter the US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told NATO in February that Europe should no longer take US strategic protection for granted, budgets are being revised and Germany has now lifted its longstanding restrictions on defence spending.",

This is, for example, largely what happened with the tariffs issue.Ultimately, however, he is the one who decides the government's course of action, even if he lets his inner circle - which is perhaps more loyal and disciplined than in the last administration - carry out the details.Arafin in Bangladesh wants to know how developing countries can navigate this evolving trade landscape and mitigate the risks.There is just no way poorer countries could ever eliminate their trade surplus with the United States.The world envisioned by Donald Trump - where citizens of developing countries buy as many American products as are sold the other way - is simply not possible.The average Bangladeshi citizen, for example, is 32 times poorer than the average American.In this case, the best Bangladeshi officials could do is promise Washington they will reduce some non-tariff barriers that are in place that make it hard for American companies to do business there.For example, they could scrap quotas on imports, cut red tape or tackle corruption more effectively.These small concessions - along with the assumption that American consumers won't put up with rocketing prices - may lead to a softening or removal of Trump's tariffs.After all, if countries with large and cheap workforces can't sell Americans affordable goods, then who will?One other thing that developing countries will want to consider closely is the role of China in all of this.If you're a worker in a clothing factory in Bangladesh, a 37% US tax might seem a crippling blow to your livelihood - but it's still better than the 125% tariff that Chinese manufacturers are facing.As a Malaysian rubber glove manufacturer told me recently: \"We're not exactly jumping with joy, but this may well benefit us\".Limiting dealings with China has been suggested as a way for developing countries to get a better trade deal with the White House. The House recently adopted a provision that would make it much harder to rescind Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, for instance.Even if Congress was able to reach agreement on curtailing presidential power, Trump could decide to exercise his veto to block it from becoming law \u2013 something he's already threated to do with the Senate tariff bill.",

        "article_text": "A new type of tobacco product is finding growing numbers of users around the world, but there are still serious questions about how it affects human health.\nHaving smoked for nearly 30 years since the age of 13, IT consultant and freelance writer Ben Taylor was intrigued by the sound of heated tobacco products.\nAttempting to switch from cigarettes to vapes hadn't worked for Taylor. \"Vaping liquids always left me wanting,\" he posted on his blog. So he decided to try IQOS, a sleek, pen-shaped electronic device that heats sticks of rolled tobacco, developed by the American multinational tobacco company Philip Morris International (PMI).\nRather than burning tobacco, these devices heat it to a temperature high enough to create a vapour but not smoke.\nFor Taylor, it didn't quite replicate the experience of smoking a cigarette, but it came much closer than vaping \u2013 the other popular cigarette alternative, which uses handheld pens to heat a flavoured nicotine-containing liquid. \"You can tell you're consuming real tobacco,\" Taylor wrote. Over time, he says, he came to prefer IQOS due to the taste, and the lack of a lingering cigarette stench. He also says his previously near-permanent cough disappeared.\nTobacco manufacturers that sell heated tobacco devices market them as being a less harmful alternative to cigarettes. They point to industry-funded research that shows they produce lower levels of compounds known to be harmful to human health.\nBut there is growing concern in the medical community that these devices still pose a health risk to both the people who use them and those standing nearby. They also warn that as relatively new products, the long-term effects of using heated tobacco have still to be properly investigated.\nYet they are also becoming increasingly common, with next-generation heated tobacco products now available in more than 60 countries. They have experienced particularly notable growth in both\u00a0Italy and Japan,\u00a0where they have been present since 2014. And this growth is expected to continue as they start to penetrate the market in the US.\nSo, is heated tobacco really helping people enjoy nicotine in a less harmful way, or could it be a new public health crisis in the making?\nIQOS and other devices like it are the latest iteration of a concept which the tobacco industry has been intermittently toying with for the past four decades. In 1988, an American tobacco company called RJ Reynolds\u00a0attempted to commercialise the very first heated tobacco product, a device called Premier. Designed to look similar to a conventional cigarette in shape and size, the Premier had a specifically designed carbon tip that users would light to heat the tobacco. But despite a reported $300m (roughly \u00a3180m at the time) in investment, Premier\u00a0was removed from the market\u00a0after just six months as users complained about its taste and smell.\nAfter various reinventions, heated tobacco products have started to enjoy commercial success in the past decade with a new range of electronic devices that use several methods to vaporise their contents. Typically these involve encasing tobacco in either sticks, plugs, capsules or pods, which are then heated with an electronic element. As well as PMI's IQOS, leading brands include Ploom, made by Japan Tobacco International (JTI), and glo, made by British American Tobacco (BAT).\nEmploying sleek, appealing designs and backed by\u00a0multi-million dollar marketing strategies \u2013 which have included everything from social media influencers\u00a0to pop-up stores \u2013 these devices have been far more successful than the original incarnations. Celebrities\u00a0have backed heated tobacco products, with the\u00a0musician Jamiroquai and actors Alberto Amman and Monica Cruz attending the IQOS 3 launch party in Madrid in 2019. Jamiroquai also performed at\u00a0a 2018 launch event\u00a0for IQOS 3 in Milan, while American dance music DJ Steve Aoki, whose name is attached to a limited edition version of an IQOS device,\u00a0performed a concert at another event for the products in Barcelona in January 2025.\nBAT have also\u00a0employed similar marketing tactics, paying social media influencers, sponsoring boat parties and organising giveaways at Formula 1 races.\nSo far, heated tobacco products have had limited penetration in the US. While one survey of 40,000 US adults found that 8% were aware of them, only 0.5% had ever used one of the devices. But that could change. After first receiving a\u00a0limited authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration in 2019, IQOS is\u00a0now re-entering\u00a0the US market in Austin, Texas.\nThe tobacco industry\u00a0promotes this new generation of heated tobacco products as a safer, smoke-free alternative, stressing that they only heat, not burn tobacco. PMI's website, for example,\u00a0states\u00a0that they aim to remove \"combustion of tobacco, the cause of most tobacco-related diseases\", celebrating IQOS as \"the next step in tobacco harm reduction\". The company\u00a0estimates that more than 22 million adults\u00a0globally have quit smoking cigarettes and switched to its heated tobacco products.\nPMI has said in the past that it intends to stop selling cigarettes and become a smoke-free company. It is investing heavily in products such as heated tobacco and hopes for at least two-thirds of its revenues to come from smoke-free products by 2030.\u00a0\nBut independent researchers and public health experts argue that heated tobacco products are still harmful to human health and urge users to give up tobacco altogether. They express concerns at some of the marketing strategies, saying that the use of influencers and glamorous launch parties could encourage heated tobacco use among young people, who are more likely not to have smoked before, which could make these products a gateway to cigarettes.\u00a0\nPMI, JTI and BAT all insist their products are aimed at adults only. PMI says it has a robust code of conduct that does not allow marketing that appeals to minors such as cartoons, youth-orientated celebrities or models who are or appear to be under the age of 25. BAT said they carry out due diligence on any influencer partnerships to ensure that a significant majority of their followers are over 18 years old. JTI says it is \"committed to the principle that minors should never use or access nicotine-containing products\". It says it ensures it markets its heated tobacco products in a \"socially responsible way\" in accordance with applicable laws and rules.\nBut Silvano Gallus, an epidemiologist at the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, believes that existing smokers do not appear to be the main audience for these products, despite the messaging from tobacco firms. He first started monitoring the rollout of heated tobacco products more than a decade ago.\n\"We began to see the promotion of these products everywhere with advertisements, events and parties, particularly aimed at young people,\" says Gallus, reflecting on the initial launch of heated tobacco in the cities of Milan and Nagoya, Japan.\u00a0\nIn 2019, PMI suspended a social media campaign involving digital influencers after the news organisation Reuters revealed the company had been using young online personalities to market its products, including a 21-year-old woman, in breach of its own code of conduct. PMI said at the time that no laws were broken, but acknowledged that the campaign failed to meet the company's standards.\nGallus claims that the users of heated tobacco products in Italy tend to be young, pointing to surveys which have described their use as widespread among adolescents. \"They aren't 60-year-old hardcore smokers looking for an alternative to cigarettes,\" he says.\u00a0\nPMI, however, insists that unintended use among youths is low in the 70 markets where IQOS is currently available. It points to a survey in 2021 funded by the Japanese government that showed 0.9% of those questioned in junior high school (aged 13-15) and 1.4% of those in high school (aged 16-18) said they used heated tobacco. It is illegal to smoke or buy tobacco in Japan under the age of 20. Other studies in countries around the world show use among youths is in the low single digits, PMI says.\nBut there is concern among public health experts that if young people who have never smoked cigarettes really are drawn to heated tobacco products, it could introduce new groups of people to potentially harmful habits.\nIn 2024, Gallus and a group of fellow tobacco control researchers in Italy published a study based on data from more than 3,000 Italians aged between 18 and 74, who they tracked for six months during 2020. They found that non-smokers who began using heated tobacco products were 5.8 times as likely to subsequently transition to smoking within the six month study period as people who had never used heated tobacco products.\n\"We know that this product is a gateway to conventional cigarettes,\" says Gallus. It is a concern shared by other researchers.\nBut PMI describes Gallus' study as unreliable and says that heated tobacco can provide a route out of smoking. Gallus and his colleagues acknowledge themselves that their study had a limited sample size and needs to be verified with larger studies. The results may also have been impacted by the pandemic and widespread lockdowns which were taking place at the time.\nResearchers like Gallus, however, view heated tobacco products as a setback in the battle to drive down tobacco use and have accused the industry of cynically targeting young people. They point to the fact that, to date, marketing for IQOS has appeared at music festivals and film festivals in Europe, Asia and South America, alongside high profile partnerships with streetwear brands and fashion designers.\nIt is a concern echoed by the World Health Organization (WHO). In a\u00a02023 summary of evidence, experts at the WHO\u00a0warned that the lower cost of heated tobacco sticks compared to a pack of cigarettes \"undermines the progress made in reducing use that was accomplished by making products more expensive\". The report, which was by Bloomberg Philanthropies, an organisation that invests heavily in reducing tobacco use, added that the marketing of heated tobacco products often combined claims of reduced harm relative to cigarettes with \"the passion for technology of primarily young people\".\nAccording to a report produced by the non-profit organisation Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids \u2013 which also receives funding from Bloomberg Philanthropies \u2013 influencer-driven campaigns on social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube have also played a key role in raising the visibility of IQOS and other heated tobacco brands. A study by researchers at the University of Rochester in the US also found that Instagram posts featuring heated tobacco products often position the devices as lifestyle products by showing them alongside models, swimming pools or a luxury car. Posts with models or lifestyle elements received higher engagement.\u00a0\nPMI categorically denies marketing its heated tobacco products to young people and says it does not have an official account on TikTok, while its account on X is used for customer care only. The company also says at least 75% of the audience must be over the legal age for purchasing tobacco products at any third-party events it sponsors. PMI claims 82% of IQOS users are over the age of 29, according to its own estimates.\nBut the debate over the marketing of heated tobacco also obscures another issue \u2013 these products are so new that there is still little research to assess their long-term health effects.\nMost research on the vapour emissions from heated tobacco products have been funded by tobacco companies or carried out by scientists directly employed by them. They show that heated tobacco aerosols contain significantly fewer harmful compounds than cigarette smoke.\nSome studies by independent researchers have also found that switching from cigarettes to heated tobacco can be beneficial in some people \u2013 such as patients with chronic lung disease. But other scientific research also suggests that heated tobacco products are unlikely to be benign for our health.\u00a0\nIn 2017, a group of Swiss scientists published a study disputing one of PMI's central marketing claims, namely that IQOS is smoke-free because of the lack of combustion or burning of the tobacco leaves.\u00a0\nInstead, the researchers argue that the emissions from heated tobacco devices should still be considered as \"smoke\" and should fall under indoor smoking bans in the same way as cigarettes. Their study showed that IQOS tobacco reaches around 330C (626F), a finding supported by other studies, while a conventional cigarette reached around 684C (1,263F).\nIn their subsequent analysis of IQOS emissions, they concluded that the heated tobacco vapour also contained harmful chemicals which stem from pyrolysis \u2013 the term for incomplete combustion \u2013 and thermogenic degradation, making it more similar to cigarette smoke than the company was claiming. \"Smokers and non-smokers need accurate information about toxic compounds released in IQOS smoke,\" the scientists wrote.\u00a0\nPMI was quick to respond to the study, sending the authors a letter disputing many of the results. A subsequent analysis by the FDA also warned there were \"significant analytical issues\" with the study that made it difficult to compare the levels of harmful and potentially harmful compounds from heated tobacco to those from cigarettes. PMI maintains that IQOS heats tobacco but does not burn it.\nOther research, however, has examined the type and quantity of toxins present in the vapours produced by heated tobacco.\nAt the National Technical University of Athens, chemical engineer Efthimios Zervas has spent much of the past decade painstakingly analysing the chemicals present in the fumes of products including IQOS and glo. He describes it as a slow and complex process because the fumes emitted contain many thousands of different chemicals, in combinations that vary greatly from one product to another.\u00a0\n\"We try to study as much as we can, but it's difficult because as soon as we publish our results, this product we've been analysing has either been modified or is no longer on the market,\" he says. \"So you're constantly playing catch-up with the industry.\"\nStill, Zervas has drawn a number of conclusions. As with cigarettes, he has found that heated tobacco products release high concentrations of fine particles, capable of penetrating deep into the body. Other studies have identified known toxins present in the gaseous emissions. Indeed, many toxins and carcinogens were present at far lower concentrations in heated tobacco vapours than in fumes from cigarettes. But Zervas has found others, such as carbonyl methylglyoxal, that he says are actually emitted in higher concentrations by heated tobacco products.\u00a0\n\"There are toxic products in there, so we cannot say that these devices are safe,\" says Zervas.\nPMI says that its own research indicates that IQOS does not generate solid particles in the aerosol it emits.\nIndustry-backed studies have also reported a long list of compounds in the aerosols from heated tobacco \u2013 one study by BAT found more than 120 while another detected 205 compounds in the aerosols, including 82 not seen in cigarette smoke. These include compounds that are the result of heating glycerol, which is one of the ingredients in heated tobacco sticks. The WHO has called for more research to evaluate the effect of these compounds on human health when inhaled at the relatively high levels in heated tobacco aerosols.\nMeanwhile early studies in animals indicate that there may be some long-term effects of heated tobacco on cardiovascular health and the central nervous system, but these results are yet to be seen in humans.\nSuch sentiments have been noted by regulators. While the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorised PMI to market multiple heated tobacco products, it also declared that this \"does not mean these products are safe nor FDA approved\". The FDA also says, \"There are no safe tobacco products, so those who do not currently use tobacco products, especially young people, should not start.\"\nAll three of the tobacco companies the BBC spoke to acknowledge that it would be incorrect to say heated tobacco products are safe or risk free. But they say research indicates that they provide a way of reducing exposure to harmful compounds if smokers switch from cigarettes to heated tobacco products.\n\"This fundamental principle underpins the promise that smoke-free products like IQOS hold for advancing global health and further validates PMI's commitment to a smoke-free future,\" says Moira Gilchrist, PMI's global chief communications officer.\n\"The majority of risk associated with cigarettes comes from the burning of tobacco and not the nicotine,\" says a BAT spokesperson. \"glo, while not risk free, does not involve burning tobacco.\" Footnotes in their response, however, added that their statement assumes a complete switch from cigarette smoking and notes that their product is addictive and not risk free.\n\"JTI does not market any of its products including heated tobacco products as smoking cessation products,\" says a JTI spokesperson. \"They are an alternative for smokers looking for products with the potential to reduce the risks associated with smoking.\"\u00a0\nThere are some who question the science that major companies are using to promote heated tobacco products. The European Respiratory Society Tobacco Control Committee published a position paper in February 2024 on the subject. The paper states that, while the tobacco industry claims a 90-95% reduction in harmful and potentially harmful substances and toxicity for heated tobacco products, this is not the full picture. Independent research shows these products emit substantial levels of carcinogenic, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, irritants and potential carcinogens, as well as similar nicotine and tar levels to a standard cigarette, the paper states.\nSome researchers have also cast doubt on the clinical trials conducted by tobacco companies themselves. In 2022, a systematic review by the University of Bath's Tobacco Control Research Group \u2013 which receives funding from Bloomberg Philanthropies and are part of STOP, a global tobacco industry watchdog \u2013 concluded that PMI's clinical trials of its heated tobacco products were of poor quality and at high risk of bias.\u00a0\nPMI did not provide a response to these allegations when asked by the BBC, but it characterised the University of Bath's Tobacco Control Research Group as an \"unreliable and inaccurate source of information\". It did not provide any further evidence to support this accusation.\nWith other forms of smokeless tobacco also on the rise, which can be chewed, sucked or snuffed, many anti-tobacco lobbyists are frustrated by the lack of progress. Staying ahead of the proliferation of new forms of tobacco consumption is like playing a game of \"whack-a-mole\", says Sandra Mullin, senior vice-president of policy, advocacy and communication at Vital Strategies, an international non-profit organisation that has partnered with governments around the world to develop tobacco control policies.\n\"I was in China in January, and they showed us these new models of heated tobacco products that don't look like tobacco, they look like a toy,\" she says, adding that she would like to have more data that demonstrates whether there are serious health impacts from such products.\nOne aspect that is particularly worrying public health officials, including the WHO, is that these devices may actually encourage people to consume more tobacco. A 2022 systematic review by researchers in the UK concluded that there was insufficient evidence to show they help people to stop smoking. The 2023 WHO report on heated tobacco also warns that the available data indicates that most smokers become dual users and \"do not substantially reduce their risk from tobacco products\".\nGallus and his colleagues recently published a review of 26 studies on the use of heated tobacco products conducted around the world since 2022. Two out of three heated tobacco users are dual users, he and his colleagues concluded.\nAccording to Gallus, dual users have a significantly higher risk of disease and premature death compared with smokers.\n\"If you're not actually reducing tobacco consumption, it undoes any potential reduced harm effects, and the industry's just making money from people twice over,\" says Sophie Braznell, a researcher in the University of Bath's Tobacco Control Research Group and a spokesperson for STOP.\nPMI claims its own data demonstrates the majority of IQOS users have given up smoking. It estimates 72% of IQOS users are people who have fully switched from cigarettes. JTI and BAT did not respond to questions about dual use of their products.\nBut with IQOS returning to the US, starting with the devices going on sale in Austin, Texas in March 2025, Yolonda Richardson, president and chief executive of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, is concerned that more people will become users of multiple tobacco or nicotine products. E-cigarettes\u00a0remain popular among younger people while nicotine pouches that are placed between the lip and gum are now showing signs of growing in popularity, with the CDC reporting a substantial increase in nationwide sales in the US since 2016.\nHowever, Richardson says that it may take a long time before the full health consequences become apparent. When they do, it will be exceedingly difficult to pinpoint the underlying source, as individuals will have been exposed to different concentrations of nicotine in different forms, as well as varying sources of tobacco.\nZervas argues that the onus should be on the tobacco industry to prove that its products are not dangerous before they're able to enter the market, rather than the other way round.\n\"It's like with food or drugs,\" he says. \"We study them first and, if they're safe, we allow them. With the tobacco industry's products, we allow them into the market and then have to prove they're dangerous, or very dangerous.\"\n--\u00a0\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

You can probably guess what he is like...\"\nA lot of people have been asking. Because a lot of people have been watching.\nIt is not just what Pollock has done in the past 12 months - winning the Under-20 World Cup, scoring two tries on his senior England debut, being nominated for the Champions Cup player of the year, preparing to line up against Leinster in Saturday's semi-final and butting into the Lions selection conversation.\nIt is the way he has done it.\nThe 20-year-old back row has swagger and self-possession, and a side order of skulduggery.\nThere has been no dutiful trade-learning and spur-earning.\nInstead, just prodigious talent, Tigger-ish energy, galloping pace and a presumption that the world is his for the taking.\nIt gets people talking. And has done for a while.\nEighteen months ago a video circulated among Bedford's players.\nThey had been told that Pollock, then only 18, was joining them in the Championship on loan.\n\"He came with a little bit of a reputation as he was very well thought of by Saints' academy,\" says Bedford's Alex Woolford.\n\"This viral clip of him did the rounds among us. He was being interviewed after an England Under-18 win over South Africa and swore three times in about 10 seconds.\n\"We knew he was going to be very enthusiastic.\"\nHe was.\n\"We were pretty poor in the first half against Ampthill,\" adds Woolford, remembering Pollock's first start.\n\"Henry tried to give us the hairdryer treatment. He was effing and blinding and telling us we were not good enough and I remember thinking 'bloody hell, what is this kid doing?'\n\"But you have to give him credit.\n\"In rugby environments it is very easy to get confidence confused with arrogance. For all the stick he gets, I don't actually think he is an arrogant person.\"\nPollock spent part of the 2023-24 season on loan at Championship side Bedford\nStill, that perception persists.\nFreeman and Woolford say Pollock is a different, calmer character off the pitch, and his Northampton team-mates assured the rest of the England camp that the incoming youngster wasn't the \"idiot\" they were expecting., external \nTheir PR work was duly undermined by Pollock gleefully ripping the ball from Ollie Chessum when tasked with holding a tackle shield in an early training drill.\n\"Probably some of the boys were quite shocked with how I was when I first joined up with England,\" Pollock told BBC's Rugby Union Weekly.\n\"But I guess over time they realised this is just him.\n\"I am quite loud, someone that just brings a different type of energy to other types of players. Whether that is good or bad energy depends who you are talking to.\"\nPollock scored two tries when he made his senior England debut off the bench against Wales in Cardiff in March\nThere are plenty of fans.\nAt Franklin's Gardens kids wear his distinctive black head tape and make cardboard signs asking for Pollock's boots.\nThey love his celebrations. A basketball-style finger-roll lob in the direction of a beaten defender against Castres and an extravagant swallow dive against Bristol were two recent efforts. \nThey love his cunning. Pollock cheekily pulling the sock of Wales prop Gareth Thomas to milk a penalty gained social media traction during the Six Nations.\nAnd they love his abrasive style as he goes nose-to-nose with the opposition, raising tempers and the stakes.\n\"I want to entertain and get the crowd as close as possible to the team,\" he told BBC Radio Northampton's Saints Show.\n\"When I was growing up there, there was a lack of a idols. There were one or two that stick in my mind - Courtney Lawes, Michael Hooper, Richie McCaw - but not many.\n\"For this game to grow and this sport to get bigger, we need more characters, more players the fans want to come and watch.\n\"If you look to the football world, fans very much have their players and the personalities they like.\"\nThis video can not be played\nPollock ruffling feathers!\nPollock is harder to warm to when you are up against him.\nWoolford, Pollock's Bedford team-mate, also faced him in the Blues' annual pre-season fixture against Saints.\n\"On the pitch he is very loud, very confrontational, very in-your-face,\" Woolford remembers.\n\"He just exhausts you, as much mentally and emotionally as physically. But he has backed it up at every level he has stepped up to.\"\nIn the teams' most recent match, one Bedford player attempted to sledge back at Pollock, suggesting he would be back with the Blues on loan by October.\nInstead, by then, Pollock was a Premiership regular.\n\"Being annoying is part of my game,\" Pollock agrees.\n\"I want to wind the opposition up; I want to get under their skin. It is something I relish.\"\nThis weekend he will be digging into Leinster in a re-run of last season's Champions Cup semi-final.\nThe Irish giants could field back-row trio Caelan Doris, Josh van der Flier and Jack Conan.\n\"It is probably one of the best back rows there is,\" says Pollock. \"I am just excited to be able to say I played against them. To share the field with them is special.\"\nBut the deference won't last past the first whistle.\n\"They are beatable,\" he adds. \"We definitely see parts of their game we can attack and go after and hopefully ruffle a few feathers.\"\nIf Pollock's streak of success extends to the Aviva Stadium and his final and toughest Lions audition, he could well make the squad cut five days later.\n\"I have heard the rumours and stuff, but as a player you can't control that,\" he says.\n\"I just have to keep playing well, and if it happens, it happens.\"\nSo far in his career, things invariably do.\nPollock played in England A's win over an Australia second string at the start of this season before being promoted into the senior side",

Certainly I have longer legs and I always have huge bruises on my body from driving the car just because the seat is poking me in the wrong places.\"\nDespite the discomfort, the chance to step into the JPS Lotus 97T in which his late uncle achieved his first grand prix victory at a rainy Estoril on 21 April 1985 is always a huge thrill for Bruno Senna.\nNot just because Ayrton Senna is unquestionably one of the all-time greats of Formula 1, but also because he sees it as a way of maintaining an emotional connection to his life and racing legacy.\nThe statistics are simple - Ayrton Senna won three Formula 1 World Drivers' Championship titles, 41 grands prix and took pole on 65 occasions.\nHis rivalries with other drivers, primarily France's Alain Prost, but also Nigel Mansell and Michael Schumacher, are among the most epic in the sport's history. \nBut although those world titles were all achieved for McLaren, Bruno believes the 1985 Lotus was something special.\n\"It's probably the most beautiful livery ever in F1,\" he told BBC Radio Northampton. \n\"It's a very iconic, classic livery, the black and gold colour scheme. Everybody who knows anything about motor racing will recognise this car.\n\"When you look at the modern cars, they're so big and so complicated, this is like the polar opposite. They're small, they're simple and it makes you sort of sit on the road with a rocket on your back.\" \nBruno also competed in Formula 1, from 2010 to 2012, and believes modern drivers are \"spoiled\" when it comes to the machinery provided for them.\nHe stepped into the Lotus at the Goodwood 82nd Members' Meeting and described it as a \"real visceral experience\".\nThe 41-year-old said: \"I raced in modern cars my whole life and they are so refined, so simple and easy. When you drive these things it's such a stressful experience because the smallest mistake you make and it's game over.\"\n1985: Ayrton Senna and his Lotus F1 car\nSporting Witness: The fatal crash of Ayrton Senna\nKeeping the Ayrton Senna brand and legacy alive\nAyrton Senna beat Alain Prost and Keke Rosberg at the 1985 Portuguese GP\nOn 1 May, it will be exactly 31 years since Ayrton Senna died in a crash at the Tamburello corner at Imola at the age of only 34.\nHe was given a state funeral and his memory lives on thanks to the work of the Instituto Ayrton Senna, which was founded by his sister.\n\"In all sports people remember the greatest, but Ayrton sort of went above that. He was someone people connected with on the very personal side, rather than just admiring a successful sportsman,\" said Bruno.\n\"I think it's mostly because of what he stood for, what he believed in and how strongly he carried that message.\n\"When you see young kids born decades after Ayrton passed away being so passionate about him, it's because their parents or grandparents carry this on and they identify with this.\"\nHe continued: \"It's amazing that this legacy stays so strong. We are very proud of it because we believe the world needs a lot of Ayrton's values to be a better place, and the 30th anniversary (of his death) last year was a huge celebration of his legacy.\"\nBruno Senna drove in other championships including Formula E, sports cars and endurance racing\nBruno was only 18 months old when his uncle triumphed at Estoril, a victory that always remained special throughout his career.\n\"He'd always been someone who puts so much pressure on himself to deliver and I think this moment allowed him to get into his own groove and then achieve everything he achieved afterwards,\" he said.\n\"When I was three or four years old I remember watching his races but by then he was with McLaren. I didn't watch many of these Lotus races live, I watched them on replays but always the family was rooting for him back home.\n\"He was my hero and I was driving go-karts when I was five years old, so obviously I was trying to follow in his footsteps from a very early age.\"\nBruno was always fascinated to hear his uncle speak about Prost and his other rivals.\n\"In Portuguese you have so many specific expressions that don't mean anything in other languages, but he had so much respect for Alain, even at the height of their rivalry.\n\"It was a lot of fun talking to him about some races where something went wrong or something went right, he understood the challenge he had from his opponents and the whole racing career built him to what he was.\"\nSo how did it feel for him to step behind the wheel of the Lotus 97T at Goodwood, apart from the difficulty of fitting into the driver's seat?\n\"I think the moment you kind of feel emotional about it is when you do the in-lap and you're just cruising around, cooling the car.\n\"Then you can sort of interact with the crowd a little bit and see what their faces are expressing. It means so much to the people.... a lot of them never even saw this car on the race track and having this opportunity really is a special thing.\nHe added: \"We're so happy the classic Team Lotus keep this car in such great shape, but the human element here is as important as the machine.\"\nListen to The Motorsport Show on BBC Radio Northampton at 6pm on Tuesday.",

She was one of 28 trans women registered to play amateur football in England.\nShe told BBC Sport: \"It is a shock. \n\"This means for me personally, and for many people playing football, that we are no longer able to do this stuff that we were able to do last week and that we've been able to do for decades.\n\"I stopped playing in the men's game 10-12 years ago, I didn't feel it was a safe place to transition and I feel like i'm not really able to compete in that anymore.\n\"The effect that hormones have had means when I do play an occasional five-a-side kickabout with men, I don't feel like I can compete with men my sort of age and with similar physical characteristics.\n\"The reality is there are not enough transgender people in society for us to run our own sports, run our own spaces - there just aren't the numbers to make that viable.\n\"This is a lot of attention on a very small number of people who aren't causing a problem, and are just going about their lives.\n\"It is a de facto ban for transgender women from football more generally, realistically, particularly people who have been playing in women's football for decades.\n\"It's going to be very mentally challenging and actually potentially physically dangerous for those people to go back and play in the men's game - if they ever even did play in the men's game.\n\"So really this is pushing those people out of football altogether.\"\nBBC Sport has seen a letter sent by the FA to transgender players facing an immediate ban.\nAs well as the offer of \"free, fully confidential online talking therapy\" the FA said it hopes to have mixed gender football available from the 2026-27 season and even suggested players move into other areas of the game.\nDavies, 62, won a silver medal at the Moscow Olympics in 1980 and has long argued against the inclusion of trans women in women's sport.\nShe told BBC Sport: \"I'm overjoyed that women are getting their sport back at last, hopefully cricket will follow.\n\"The science is still the same. Males kick 50% harder than females, they're taller, they have bigger hands and feet, and they're more dynamic, particularly in goal.\n\"I've had heart-broken parents talking about their children, their young girls who are self-harming because they've had a season-ending injury. Or autistic daughters who've had six-match bans because they've recognised that there is a male on the opposition.\n\"A lot of people are owed an apology.\n\"It affects half the population who are actually female. It affects all young girls and all women who play football, particularly at grassroots and pathways and junior competition, so this was just about the integrity of sport and as a biological female you are entitled to that integrity just the same as a biological male.\n\"Everyone deserves to do sport and the FA must find a way to be inclusive for everybody.\"",

        "article_text": "Early summer. A Test squad due to be announced. It takes me back to the times I was bowling for a place in the England team.\nI was an international cricketer between 2010 and 2017. At the beginning of each of those summers, there was a mix of optimism, hope and determination that I would bowl well enough in Championship cricket to get the call.\nWickets were the currency. James Anderson and Stuart Broad were inked in the side, so Tim Bresnan, Graham Onions, Chris Tremlett, Chris Woakes, myself and a number of others were competing for the other spot.\nThis bred competition and hunger, because I knew the other guys were trying to do exactly the same thing. Backing up performances and demonstrating the stamina to do it over a number of weeks in the domestic game was another aspect of showing you were hardened for the intensity of international cricket.\nIn recent years, under Rob Key, Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes, the way England select their teams has changed. I wonder if the feelings of the players hoping to be selected, those feelings I remember so well, have changed too.\nThere is still the opportunity for a player to prove himself the 'old school' way, even if it does feel like that is becoming a more difficult route into the England team.\nSam Cook has 318 first-class wickets to his name, at an average of just 19.77\nSam Cook has been the outstanding seam bowler in county cricket for the past number of years. At the age of 27, with 318 first-class wickets at an average of 19.77, it seems as though his time has finally come.\nAfter he was asked to rest from Essex's Championship match against Worcestershire a couple of weeks ago, it would be surprising if he is not in the squad for the Test against Zimbabwe next month.\nEven with that overwhelming body of evidence and a stack of wickets behind him, I do feel like it is one performance that has convinced England Cook is finally worth backing.\nAt the beginning of last summer, when the pitches were flat and the Kookaburra ball was being used in the Championship, bowlers toiled. Cook took 10 wickets for Essex to lead them to victory over Nottinghamshire. It is the sort of display that will catch the eye of the selectors, who will rightly look for more than statistics when it comes to making their judgements.\nAnd that, perhaps, is the difference between what I felt I was going through more than a decade ago and what can earn selection at this moment. Now it is far more exciting.\nYes, Cook has an outstanding record, but he also needed that standout display to give Key and company a nudge. In an attack that only has room for one 'English' style seamer, an injury to Woakes has presented an opportunity. And it might actually be one outstanding performance for other England hopefuls that earns them a call-up.\nWood irritated by England's 'golf, golf, golf' narrative\nCook in line for Test call-up as England ask Essex to rest him\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nI see bowlers in the domestic game who have the raw materials to be international players. Sonny Baker and John Turner are two of them, both of Hampshire (although Turner has been on loan at Lancashire), and have been identified by England despite having almost no first-class cricket behind them.\nBaker, Turner and others who have the attributes to trouble the best batters will know that one performance, even one spell, might be enough to earn them a call-up. There's precedent for it, too. Stokes first saw off-spinner Shoaib Bashir bowl in a clip on social media, then shared it in his WhatsApp group with Key and McCullum. Not long after, Bashir was in the England squad.\nAnother difference between my time as an international cricketer and now is England's attitude towards franchise cricket, particularly the Indian Premier League (IPL).\nNow there is an acceptance players hold a lot of power and cannot be denied lucrative franchise opportunities. Who can blame the players for this? After all, it can be a short career. \nThis is in contrast to when I wanted to put my name forward for the 2013 IPL auction. I thought I had a good chance of being picked up. I was bowling quickly, had bowled nicely in a white-ball series in India, getting good players out, and had just had a good T20 World Cup.\nAt the end of 2012, we were on the famous Test tour of India, when we won 2-1. I had to ask permission from the England and Wales Cricket Board to enter the auction and, within five minutes of submitting my forms, received an email telling me I wasn't allowed but that Andy Flower, the head coach, would explain why.\nThat evening, I was having room service in the bedroom of Kevin Pietersen (who was the first England player to spot the might of the IPL), along with Eoin Morgan. I was summoned to see Flower and, as I was on the way out of the door, KP told me to tell Flower I was entering the auction whether he liked it or not.\nIt was a short meeting with Flower. He told me I had to be playing county cricket at the beginning of the following summer in order to back-up performances and be in contention to play Test cricket at the beginning of a double Ashes year. I did as I was told. To me, Test cricket was the pinnacle and I would have done anything to get a spot in that England team.\nTimes have changed. How exciting it must be to be a player now with the potential to succeed in international cricket.\nEvery time you walk on to the pitch you feel like you have the opportunity to put your name forward, to be the subject of the next clip in the England management WhatsApp group, with Key and his cohorts thinking 'we can't ignore this, can we?'",

Whether that is the response I'm not too sure.\n\"It would be great if changes were made and the drivers were at least heard and it's in the best interests of the sport, and ensuring some common sense is applied to it. We can comment on it when we see the action rather than the consideration.\"\nNorris 'not worried at all' about title challenge\nRao makes surprise FIA return as Ben Sulayem adviser\nThe FIA has given no further details on what changes might be made, but has to detail to its members any potential statutes changes that might be made at June's General Assembly by 8 May.\nAsked why the drivers and their collective body the GPDA had no formal relationship with the FIA, Russell said: \"It is unprecedented times we have been in the last 18 months with what's been changing and what's happening.\n\"The GPDA wasn't founded to talk about politics. It was to talk about safety and the racing. I find myself talking about things I don't have any intention of talking about and we are here to talk about going racing, the fastest cars, the safest cars, the best engineering, and yet we talk about fines and punishments and swearing.\n\"Maybe something should change. We are open to it but we ultimately want the best for the sport.\"\nThis video can not be played\nFive things to watch at Miami Grand Prix\nRussell's remarks are an oblique reference to the series of controversies that have emerged since Ben Sulayem was elected in December 2021.\nThese have included his views on women, a dismissal of a number of senior figures amid questions about the finances of the president's, changes to the statutes which critics say undermine accountability and good governance, whistleblower allegations against Ben Sulayem which the FIA dismissed and a lawsuit lodged against the FIA by Susie Wolff, the director of the F1 Academy for aspiring female drivers.\nThe latest was the resignation of the deputy president of sport Robert Reid last month, which was followed by the first public intervention from former FIA chief executive officer Natalie Robyn since she was forced to resign last summer after just 18 months in the role. \nFerrari driver Lewis Hamilton said: \"The GPDA is very unified. We want to be able to work closely with the FIA. We all want to work together and make the sport better.\n\"We have faced a bit of an uphill challenge in that communication over time.\n\"We don't hold a power seat at the table and that needs to change, in my opinion. Other sports have unions. We just want to collaborate more and have our voices heard.\"\nHow to follow Miami Grand Prix on the BBC\nWhat is the format for F1 sprint races in 2025?\nWill Ferrari turn their season around?\nMexico City GP signs extension until 2028",

        "article_text": "The runner who went viral and sparked a campaign for change for women\nSophie Power had not even laced up her trainers for her first run when she signed up to an ultramarathon.\nBut what was initially a fresh challenge after being made redundant has manifested into a life-changing passion that has led to positive change for women in sport.\nIn 2018, a photograph of Power breastfeeding her then three-month-old son during a 106-mile race went viral.\nThere had been no option for her to defer her place until she was fit to compete and it highlighted what she saw as a major issue facing women and mothers.\nNow, many of the world's biggest events, including the London Marathon, have implemented pregnancy deferral policies and Power's work has been central to that change.\nPower signed up for her first 250km (155-mile) ultramarathon at the age of 26, shortly after having been made redundant from her job in banking.\nAlthough she was not a runner and never had been, a friend had recently completed the challenge himself and recommended she try it, as he believed she could have the stamina needed due to her time in the air squadron at university.\n\"I went for my first run the next day and realised pretty quickly that I loved ultra-running. I love being outside, the breadth of phenomenal people you meet [who] you wouldn't come across in everyday life,\" the 42-year-old, who lives near Guildford in Surrey, told BBC Sport.\n\"And really kind of pushing my body to the limits in a new way.\"\nImmediately hooked, Power devoted her time to training and travelling to compete in stage races around world.\nShortly after the birth of her second child, Cormac, she was faced with a dilemma.\nPower juggles her campaigning and ultrarunning alongside bringing up her three children\nHaving given up her entry to the iconic Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc (UTMB) race while she recovered from the birth of her first child, Donnacha, three years before, she was not prepared to do so again.\nLike many races, UTMB had no pregnancy deferral policy at the time.\nDespite not being able to run so soon postpartum, Power entered the 106-mile event with a view to starting and maybe walking the first 10km.\nYet 43.5 hours after setting off she completed the challenge, that included 10,000m of climbing, inside the cut-off time, walking the whole way except for a short stretch after one of the highest points when she was worried she might get hypothermia. She crossed the line with then three-year-old Donnacha.\nThat moment is one she looks back on with immense pride, though it was a photograph of her taken with her younger son that day that would inspire what followed.\nFrench photographer Alexis Berg was at UTMB photographing the 2018 race, as he is at many ultra events. And it was at one of the refuelling stations that he saw something he had never previously seen at one of these events.\n\"I knew it was unusual. At that moment it was impossible to realise the photo would have such an impact, but I just pushed one button that day and everything else that has happened is because of Sophie,\" he said.\nWhat he captured was Power sitting down and breastfeeding her baby son during a break from the race.\n\"That photo has undoubtedly changed the course of my life. I worked out I should never have been on that start line,\" she said.\n\"I should have been given the opportunity to complete that kind of dream race when I was fit and healthy, not three months postpartum, trying to go 106 miles around a huge mountain by breastfeeding my baby. It was crazy.\"\nAlexis Berg's photograph of Power breast-feeding her three-month-old son, Cormac, at UTMB went viral in 2018\nPower wanted to ensure returning mums did not face the same choice and put their bodies through the same risk as she had done.\nShe founded the charity SheRaces with the core aim of breaking down barriers preventing women from entering events alongside men and safeguarding returning mothers.\nAfter the photo went viral, many male directors contacted her almost immediately to say they had added pregnancy deferrals to their programmes and expressed embarrassment that it was something they had not thought of before.\nShe engaged with more than 2,000 women to find out what prevented them from getting on the start line of races alongside men.\nHer research went far beyond elite level sport. Power is not a professional athlete herself and her real passion is for other women and girls who had been like her.\n\"Girls drop out of sport at such a high rate. There's a massive dream deficit for girls compared to boys,\" she said.\nPower believes a big reason for this is the language used when promoting sports and sporting events.\n\"It's 'hardest, toughest, baddest', and for a lot of women that's quite off-putting,\" she said.\n\"How do we redesign sport in a female lens? Can we make sure that the opportunities for girls are tailored to them, and what they want and sports provided in the right places in the right way?\"\nThe result of her research was a set of nine principles that organisers could commit to in order to make their events more inclusive for women.\nThese included adapting the use of language and imagery on websites to reflect and appeal to female runners, changing cut-off times, providing female toilets, period products, changing facilities and event T-shirts made specifically for female entrants, rather than unisex ones for all, and a safeguarding and harassment policy.\nCriteria for elite races includes equal exposure for the female race on social media coverage and prizes for female competition.\nPower has seen change in some of the world's biggest races.\nUTMB's policy, external since 2023 for some of its marquee events entitles those who are pregnant, have a pregnant partner or are adopting or birthing via surrogacy to a full refund and priority re-entry for up to five years.\nBut she says there is still a long way to go.\nAssefa sets women's record as Sawe wins men's race\nLondon Marathon breaks world record for most finishers\n'Finish lines not finish times' at London Marathon\nThe London Marathon had a world record number of finishers in 2025, surpassing the previous record of 55,646 set by the New York Marathon in November\nThe New York, Boston and London marathons now all have pregnancy deferrals in place, yet mothers must pay the entrance fee for a second time when they use the deferral scheme, she said.\nHer organisation's criteria requests races to implement a two-year deferral to allow people enough time to recover fully from their pregnancies.\n\"The majority of races are commercial, it's a business. If they can get more people on their start lines then they're going to do it and the purpose of the guidelines is they're almost non-cost. It's a no-brainer,\" she said.\n\"There are a lot of brands out there who say they are pro-women, yet they're sponsoring women's races that don't have pregnancy deferrals, that don't treat women equally.\n\"And then there are dinosaurs, they don't value the voice of female athletes.\n\"Then there are races that still need to make improvements, I put London Marathon in that bracket. They have listened to us, they are phenomenally inclusive, they've got loads of initiatives that they put out for diversity on their start lines, but they still want to make women pay twice for their place when they have a baby.\n\"I've definitely lost faith in some race organisers because of it but so many are changing and becoming better. You always feel like you fail at the battles you don't win but we're winning so many battles and driving so much change.\"\nThe London Marathon's policy, external allows entrants to defer for up to three years after giving birth. The event's organisers did not respond when asked why users of the deferral system must pay their entrance fee again.\nWhat is Couch to 5k and how do I start?\nPower suffered from hallucinations while on a world record-breaking ultramarathon across Ireland\nAs the scale of her work and its influence has grown, Power's propensity for testing her physical limits has grown with it.\nShe is now the holder of two Guinness world records - becoming the fastest woman to run the length of Ireland, last year.\nPower completed the gruelling 340-mile route in three days 12 hours and eight minutes, smashing the previous record set by Mimi Anderson by more than three hours.\nThe route took her through Munster, where husband John was born, and to County Cork, where many of the Power family live, running through torrential rainfall, experiencing the early stages of sun stroke and sleeping for little more than two hours, while sustaining herself on a diet of jam-filled tortilla wraps, gels, chews and ice cream.\nHer tongue was burned after two days of eating nothing but fruit and sweets. She pushed herself to the brink of total exhaustion.\n\"I was seeing nativity and Christmas scenes everywhere in this town. And all the trees had turned into plastic. The hallucinations were phenomenal, crazy,\" she said.\nShe has since gone on to set a second world record for the longest distance covered on a treadmill by a female in 48 hours and will be hosting her own women-only ultra races in the Peak District in August.\nSo how will she know when she has achieved what she set out to do?\n\"My ultimate goal for SheRaces is that we don't exist because it's not needed anymore and every woman is able to get on the start line,\" she added.\n\"Part of the reason I created it was to have something that wasn't just me and was owned by all women.

        "article_text": "A new Apple TV+ series explores the life of the so-called \"King of Chefs and the Chef of Kings\" \u2013 shown as a wild enfant terrible in post-Revolutionary France who blazed a trail for future generations of cooks.\nIt's described as \"the story of the first celebrity chef\". The French language series Car\u00eame is a dramatisation of the life of Antonin Car\u00eame, who was born into poverty in pre-Revolutionary Paris around 1784. His talent would make him chef for the French diplomat Charles Talleyrand, the Emperor Napoleon, the future George IV of Britain, Tsar Alexander of Russia and the Baron de Rothschild. He also wrote celebrated cookbooks and introduced the Toque (the tall chef's hat), still in use today \u2013 giving birth to the very idea of the \"celebrity\" chef.\nIndeed, Benjamin Voisin, the actor playing Antonin Car\u00eame, believes that if the chef had been working in the 2020s, \"he'd have been the one with 100 million views on TikTok. That would be the equivalent of what he did at the time,\" he tells the BBC.\nAnd Voisin's portrayal of Car\u00eame feels modern; he plays him with a touch of the rock star as well as kitchen chef. He wears an earring, his clothes seem to owe more to the 1980s New Romantic movement than 19th-Century costume, and from his affairs with women to his lack of deference to his so-called superiors, he is what could be described (in French) as an enfant terrible. He is also confident, brash and authoritative in his kitchen \u2013 a manner that echoes 21st-Century celebrity chefs such as Gordon Ramsay.\u00a0\nThe series is inspired by a biography of Car\u00eame and his gastronomy by Ian Kelly, who also co-created the series with screenwriter Davide Serino. The historical figure of the young chef is actually described by Kelly in his book as a \"bookish innocent\" when he takes his first job, but Voisin's look in the series isn't too far from Kelly's description of Car\u00eame aged 25: \"He was handsome, his hair cut and tousled forward in the fashionably Byronic manner... he was described as slight, and a slight eater.\" Kelly also describes Car\u00eame as \"ambitious, solipsistic, even narcissistic\" as a person \u2013 although the Car\u00eame on screen risks much for those he loves.\nIndeed, perhaps inevitably, the series takes various liberties with the truth, also depicting Car\u00eame as a spy for his powerful masters, something there's no historical evidence for. The show's lead director Martin Bourboulon describes the added drama as \"the charm of fiction in the show\". The reality is that the real man didn't leave much information behind. As Kelly says in his biography, \"He [Car\u00eame] would disclose the minutiae of his professional life\u2026 and the menus, guests and ingredients that made up his working days. But about his personal life he revealed nothing.\"\nWhat is true to the era is the depiction of the aristocratic kitchens he worked in, his small army of staff, and their fevered preparations for royal banquets. He's seen in the series organising a meal for Napoleon Bonaparte, and in real life he was responsible for the Emperor's wedding cake. Car\u00eame's ability to sugar-sculpt led to extraordinary creations in the shape of classical lyres and Venetian gondolas, all carefully sketched out on paper first by the chef himself. But that wasn't all he was capable of, according to Paul Freedman, Professor of History at Yale University.\n\"He helped establish a routine for how kitchens were run,\" Freedman tells the BBC. \"He also defined dishes and the repertoire of sauces, what was considered to go with what food, what kind of garnishes would be standard, and the kind of multi-course dining that would come to be characteristic [of haute cuisine]. And as his original metier was confectionery and sugar sculpting, even having a centrepiece of sculpted food is owed to Car\u00eame.\"\u00a0\nWhile some of the real-life recipes in his cookbooks still sound mouthwatering (Kelly mentions an orange flower and pink champagne jelly), others, such as a stuffed boar's head, might seem strange to today. But Bourboulon says that, above all, he wanted to make the chef himself accessible to a modern audience.\nBourboulon, responsible for two successful film adaptations of Alexandre Dumas's historical novel The Three Musketeers, tells the BBC that he wanted to avoid \"the usual period drama style\" in this story.\n\"I really wanted to bring a bit of sexiness, rock 'n' roll attitude, and a modern twist for all the main characters, especially Car\u00eame,\" he says. \"And Benjamin Voisin is like this in real life.\"\nVoisin says their idea of the chef was that he had \"a Mick Jagger aspect to him. It's really what attracted me\".\n\"I love looking to the historical story of Car\u00eame, but this rock star element, that kind of Lenny Kravitz look he has, plus the idea the show gives about his attitude to life, is really important. Maybe that's why Martin came to me to talk about playing him. I also love the story of this young man trying to find his place in society.\"\nThe historical Car\u00eame's stellar career might well have given him a swagger; he was known as \"the King of Chefs and the Chef of Kings\". He's often credited as\u00a0a founder of French gastronomy and of\u00a0Grande Cuisine\u00a0(classic French cuisine which was at its most lavish during the 19th Century).\nHowever, according to\u00a0Paul Freedman, Professor of History at Yale University, he might not even be France's first celebrity chef. The Frenchman\u00a0Guillaume Tirel, known as \"Taillevent\", is famous for cooking for French kings during his lifetime (1310-95), and wrote a cookbook that still survives, The Viandier. Several\u00a0restaurants\u00a0still bear his name.\u00a0\nCar\u00eame's status is, he says, \"a celebrity chef of modern Europe, but still almost the last of a kind. He lived still in the time of the courts and chefs finding aristocratic patrons. He doesn't have a restaurant or interact with ordinary people, [and] his tremendous number of cookbooks aren't directed towards amateurs, but towards other chefs.\n\"So he's a transitional point to the purely modern celebrity chef, who are celebrities in the sense of media exposure, their television presence or just their ability to be a character and to run a restaurant.\"\nThe young Car\u00eame's turnaround in life was remarkable. Historian Ian Kelly describes him in his biography, Car\u00eame: The First Celebrity Chef (which inspired the series) as one of multiple children in a family from one of Paris's worst slums. By 1792, around the same time that\u00a0 the \"Reign of Terror\" would begin in the French Revolution (a period of state-sanctioned violence and executions) he had been abandoned by his parents but was taken in by a cook, and then apprenticed to a notable p\u00e2tissier, Sylvain Bailly. While still a very young man, he was hired by one of the most famous politicians of the Napoleonic era: Prince Charles Maurice Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord, known as Talleyrand.\nEven if the real Car\u00eame didn't dabble in espionage, Bourboulon points out that the chef's culinary brilliance would have been exploited as a display of power by his employers, and that food would have been as much a part of diplomacy during the early 19th Century as the modern state banquet is now.\n\"We know that Car\u00eame worked for Prince of Talleyrand and for Napoleon,\" he tells the BBC. \"It's so French to share the menu, the food, and use the quality of the food to help diplomatic relationships, and historically, they really did do this. There's an example at the end of the first episode, when Car\u00eame brings in a dessert for Napoleon and an English diplomat seated at the same table. And it's exactly how we imagine it would have been done during that time.\"\nPolitics isn't the only display of passion in the narrative either, or as Bourboulon says, \"Love is as important in the lives of French people, possibly more so\". The visuals directly link the food Car\u00eame cooks with sensuality; the camera lingers over the dishes, while red fruit drips over the title sequence. The series even starts with Car\u00eame licking cream off his love interest Henriette, played by Lyna Khoudri.\u00a0\n\"The parallel between the two types of pleasure is there in the series,\" Voisin says. \"Hands are involved in both cooking and the pleasures of the flesh, that's the connection.\"\nThe link between French food and sensuality are linked was certainly there in Car\u00eame's Paris. Ian Kelly describes how the post-Revolution capital \"had become the City of Light \u2013 and the capital of food\". The talk around the young Car\u00eame, he says, would have been \"of philosophy, fashion, food and sex: what the world has come to expect from Paris\".\nCar\u00eame's fame grew across Europe because of his celebrity clientele, but he also benefited from France's growing interest in gastronomy as culture (he was also a contemporary of gourmet Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, celebrated for writing about the art of eating) and the idea that French cuisine was superior because of the sensuality of its people, Paul Freedman says.\n\"I think it goes back to the image that France continues to have today as pleasure-loving, as sophisticated, not merely gorging themselves or getting drunk, but [possessed of] a kind of sensuality that is cultivated in the sense it's tasteful and distinguished,\" he tells the BBC.\nA French chef, he explains, would become necessary as a status symbol for many aristocrats of the 19th and 20th Century. \"One of the biggest examples in literature is PG Wodehouse writing about one of Bertie Wooster's aunts, Dahlia, living in terror that her temperamental French chef, Anatole, would quit.\"\nThe era of the celebrity restaurant chef was ushered in by Car\u00eame's growing fame, and the cookbooks he wrote, according to Professor Nathalie Cooke, the author of Tastes and Traditions: A Journey Through Menu History. Before the French Revolution, restaurants existed in limited form in Paris, but most served only soup. Their proliferation, Cooke tells the BBC, was born from \"economic disaster\".\u00a0\n\"Imagine you're an aspiring young chef and you're working in Paris in the late 18th Century, and they've beheaded Marie Antoinette, and they're getting rid of all those jobs that you've aspired to, cooking for royalty and the aristocracy,\" she says. \"That's why the restaurant culture grew: these very skilled chefs needed to make money and find an audience during economic turbulence, and in a post-royalty age. That's also why Car\u00eame wrote cookbooks: he was establishing himself in this new age of print media, but also, by addressing his work to other chefs, he was training a new breed of chef that was going to serve a larger audience instead of just royalty.\"\nA later French celebrity chef who dominated European food culture, Auguste Escoffier, (1846-1935) \u2013 who ran restaurants at the Ritz hotels in Europe, and at the Savoy Hotel and Carlton Club in London \u2013 \"is really Car\u00eame's heir,\" Cooke says.\n\"Escoffier really becomes famous when he decides to write down formal French cooking methods,\" she explains. \"He was able to achieve Car\u00eame's vision [of making recipes accessible to other chefs] in a way that Car\u00eame could not, because Car\u00eame was living in the age of the birth of restaurant culture, which was only just developing and only in Paris. Escoffier took it to London too.\" (Car\u00eame did spend time in England, serving the then Prince Regent, later George IV, but although he cooked for Tsar Alexander of Russia in Paris, he refused to move there and take a job.)\nThe emergence of TV and radio (and later internet) in the 20th Century has meant that the celebrity chef has become an international phenomenon, not just confined to those writing cookbooks or running restaurants, but open to all those with a knack for connecting with their audience. The most famous chef of the television era, Julia Child, (portrayed by Meryl Streep in the 2009 film Julie and Julia) was an American who had lived in Paris, and a devotee of French cooking. She even received the Antonin Car\u00eame Medal for excellence, although this is a US, not a French, honour.\nIn another nod to modernity, the young Car\u00eame in the series is also shown taking part in a chef's competition, normalised now by the growth of shows such as Iron Chef, MasterChef, and The Great British Bake Off (which streams internationally as The Great British Baking Show.) While the latter's \"Showstopper\" category might trace its ancestry back to Car\u00eame's own sugar sculptures of the 19th Century, the first modern professional event of this kind for chefs started in 1983, when another chef, Paul Bocuse, established the Bocuse D'Or, in Lyon, France.\nBut now that TV shows, podcasting and social media also allow skilled amateurs to become celebrities, Paul Freedman says there are characteristics of how he discerns a truly \"celebrity\" chef\u00a0\n\"My definition in books and articles that I've written is that the contemporary celebrity chef is distinguished by being regarded as a genius or an artist, [as opposed to] people who are [just] excellent at their craft. The Frenchman Paul Bocuse would be the first celebrity chef according to that definition, in the 1980s. Even before he invents dishes, he created the ethos of the chef as genius, and a version of a creative artist. So the celebrity chefs of our era are excellent at their craft, but Ferran Adri\u00e0, who was at El Bulli, or Ren\u00e9 Redzepi of Noma, or Heston Blumenthal in Britain are all [also] creative geniuses, or at least that's how they're presented.\"\u00a0\nThere is though, a direct line traceable from their creations, and their kitchens, to those of Antonin Car\u00eame \u2013 and not just because some of them might still wear a Toque. Bourboulon hopes that this new portrayal of the chef, nearly 200 years after he died, will give his legacy new attention.\u00a0\n\"Although Car\u00eame's name is quite famous in France, it could be even more famous, I think,\" he says. \"I would love people to rediscover, or just discover, what he did, how this young man brought all his talents to the tables of these powerful men like Napoleon. His life is a really exciting thing to mix together \u2013 food, love and politics.\"\u00a0\nCar\u00eame premieres globally on Apple TV+ from April 30, 2025.\n--\nIf you liked this story\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X, and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "When Alberto Salagan was deported from the US in January it was the first time he'd stepped foot in Mexico since he was a baby.\nBorn in the coastal resort of Acapulco, his parents took him to the US when he was just six months old.\nGrowing up in California, he was seduced by the false glamour of gang life.\nAfter his arrest in San Diego for gang activity, Alberto was sent back to Mexico just as President Trump was taking office, and found himself homeless and alone in the country of his birth.\n\"It was a shock. It still is,\" he admits. \"When I got here to Mexico, I really felt lost. No family, no food, no clothes, no nothing.\"\n\nAlberto says he'd almost forgotten how to speak and read Spanish. \"Good thing I didn't lose it completely because it's helped me [to be bilingual],\" he reflects.\nIn fact, his language skills saved the 30-year-old from becoming destitute. Through a deportee support organisation, he heard that a local company \u2013 EZ Call Center \u2013 was looking for English-speakers.\nThe work, as telephone sales agents, isn't well paid, but employees can earn commissions, and the regular pay cheque gave Alberto the stability he craved.\n\"I had to do something to get back on my feet. Thanks to the call centre, now I have,\" he tells me during a break between calls.\nAlmost every agent at EZ Call Center is a deportee, including the company's owner, Daniel Ruiz.\nHe was also born in Mexico and grew up in the US before being deported for low-level drug crime in his early 20s. Daniel says he can relate to his employees' initial sense of disorientation in Mexico.\n\"We are all dealing with culture shock,\" he says over a steady hum of telephone calls.\n\"We all have our life over there, went to school over there, were brought up on American culture, have family over there. We're from here but we're from over there too.\"\nIn their booths, the agents work through long lists of US phone numbers, some making promotional calls or sales, others calling about debt collection and refinancing.\nAll the agents speak fluent English, and the clients at the other end of the line are none the wiser that they're talking to people in Mexico rather than the US.\nDaniel says that agents like Alberto \u2013 who fell into gangs and crime at a vulnerable age in the US, but are willing to turn over a new leaf in Mexico \u2013 are among his most trusted employees.\n\"They almost never have another mark on their criminal record, and they possess the right discipline to hold down their jobs,\" he explains.\nDaniel Ruiz's own experiences after deportation have informed his business decisions.\nAs well as the telesales company, he also co-founded a humanitarian organisation \u2013 called the Borderline Crisis Center \u2013 which provides deportees with food, shelter and support on their arrival back in Mexico.\nAfter his inauguration, President Trump said he would carry out what he calls \"the largest deportation in American history\".\nHe has spoken of the removal of millions of undocumented people from US soil, and in the early days of his presidency Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents made workplace raids from Chicago to California.\nMexican humanitarian organisations, including the Borderline Crisis Center, braced themselves for a huge influx of returnees.\nSo far, though, one hasn't materialised. There are no major bottlenecks of migrants at the border, and the migrant shelters in Tijuana are not currently overflowing. \nThe latest figures from the Mexican government actually show that the number of deportations from the US to Mexico were lower during the first three months of Trump's second administration than they were for the same period last year. \nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that Mexico received almost 39,000 deportees in February to April, of which 33,000 were Mexican. This compares with 52,000 for the same three months in 2024.\nHowever, the fall was in part due to a reduction in the number of people trying to get into the US in the first place. Migrant \"encounters\" on the US southern border by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents has dropped to their lowest level in years.\nThe threat of mass deportation combined with other factors \u2013 from military deployments at the border, to the high-profile deportations of migrants to El Salvador \u2013 may have acted as an effective deterrent.\nThe Trump Administration is also pushing the idea of self-deportation hard to undocumented immigrants through blunt warnings.\nStill, there are people being sent back to Tijuana on a near daily basis. Many face hostility as they try to resettle in the dusty and dangerous border city.\nThe few companies which offer deportees gainful employment have become even more important to avoid a slide into criminality.\nBeyond a smaller venture like EZ Call Center, a larger company called the American Survey Company or ASC also relies on a deportee workforce. \nWith its sister company, Voxcentrix, ASC has some 550 call centre stations in Tijuana, where agents make calls on everything from election polling to customer satisfaction surveys.\n\"What happened in the US stays in the US,\" laughs Nora Diaz, ASC's chief happiness officer. \"We don't really do background checks on that.\"\nNora says her job is focussed on the employees' wellbeing, to help them reintegrate.\n\"We understand everyone has a past, and we don't judge based on that. We don't ask about it during our interview process. We just need people who speak good English and good Spanish and are willing to commit to a job,\" she explains.\nThe \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy at ASC was invaluable to Luis Luna's new start.\nHe grew up in Orange Country in California having been taken to the US when he was just a few months old.\n\"Unfortunately, as a kid, I made some bad choices: joined a gang, ran around with the wrong crowd. Cost me a lot, cost me a life sentence. I was a lifer in California state prison,\" Luis explains.\nWhile in prison in California, he enrolled for every educational programme available and worked hard on his rehabilitation. On release, he was also sent back to Mexico in January, just as Trump was gearing up for his inaugural speech.\nNow 50-years-old and covered in gang-related tattoos, Luis knew he wouldn't get many more second chances in life.\n\"I got no family over here. My family is ASC, the people I met in my employment, they're my family and my friends.\"\nFor Luis, the outwardly dull telephony work has provided the anchor he needs to stay out of crime, something he says ex-gang members he knows in the US struggle with.\n\"From the first day I didn't feel any judgement at all. I felt they just opened their arms and took me in. I think I'd be in the streets right now if it wasn't for ASC,\" he adds.\nWhile the Trump Administration's mass deportation programme isn't yet at a level many in Mexico expected, some believe it could pick up pace over the coming months.\nIf so, deportees with gang pasts like Alberto and Luis will need some help to start again, irrespective of their crimes.\nIn Tijuana, many of them will find it at the end of a telephone line.",

        "article_text": "The Spanish grid operator has ruled out a cyber attack as the cause of a massive power cut that crippled Spain, Portugal and parts of France on Monday. \nRed El\u00e9ctrica's operations director Eduardo Prieto said preliminary findings suggest \"there was no kind of interference in the control systems\" to imply an attack, echoing Portuguese Prime Minister Lu\u00eds Montenegro the day before.\nBut the exact reason behind the cut is still unclear. \nThe grid operator said on Tuesday they \"cannot draw conclusions\" until they get concrete data. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said investigators were trying to pinpoint the cause, and then would take all necessary measures \"to ensure that this does not happen again.\"\nInformation is trickling out about what happened at the time of the cut, leading to theories about what could have caused it. Experts told the BBC it was likely caused by several failures.\nHere is what we know and what questions remain unanswered.\nFollow live: Travel chaos continues\nS\u00e1nchez on Monday evening said 15GW of power - the equivalent to 60% of demand at that time - was \"suddenly lost from the system... in just five seconds\".\nMr Prieto said during a news conference on Tuesday that there were two \"disconnection events\" barely a second apart in the south-west of Spain, where there is substantial solar power generation.\nOne issue that the Spanish grid operator may have been referring to was when power companies identify a mismatch of supply and demand for electricity that could lead to instability, and disconnect temporarily in order to protect their systems.\nHowever, S\u00e1nchez later said the power cut was \"not a problem of excessive renewables\". He said there was not a failure of coverage - meaning supply - and there was a relatively low demand for electricity that was quite normal in the days running up to the crisis.\nSo what exactly happened? It is unclear, especially as many systems fail in electricity supply quite frequently, not only renewables, and outages on this scale happen somewhere in the world around once a year on average.\nThe mismatch between supply and demand of electricity can change the frequency of the electricity grid, which is 50HRZ in Europe and the UK.\nIf that frequency changes out of a narrow range, it could lead to damage to equipment.\n\"When a big company detects that the frequency is moving out of their tolerance, they can go offline to protect their equipment,\" said Prof Hannah Christensen at the University of Oxford.\nIf lots of companies do that in quick succession, it can have \"cascading effects\" and lead to a black-out, she added.\nBut when it comes to renewables, operators have very accurate short-term weather forecasts to predict when there will be a surplus of wind of solar power, so they adjust power supply accordingly, Prof Christensen said.\nRenewable power has different challenges to fossil fuel energy \"because of its intermittency\", she said, but it is a well-known issue that is planned for.\n\"It is a little perplexing that this wouldn't have been predicted,\" she said.\nProf Keith Bell, at the University of Strathclyde, added that \"if a system is relying on solar and wind, they design a system to reflect that,\" suggesting that the additional supply of energy from renewables will not have been a surprise to the grid.\n\"Spain has a lot of experience of wind and solar, and a long-standing system of forecasting weather and its impacts,\" he said.\n\"All sorts of systems fail,\" he added. \"Things can and do go wrong, whether that is from renewables, fossil fuels or nuclear power. This could be the Swiss cheese model, where the holes in the system have happened to align.\"\nRed El\u00e9ctrica also suggested that the drop of power caused a grid interconnection between Spain and France to trip.\nTwo basic technologies are used to interconnect parts of a grid or countries - a standard transmission line that carries alternating currents, and increasingly, high voltage direct current lines called AC/DC lines.\nSpain has an AC/DC line that came into service seven years ago, meaning it is well-tested, Prof Bell said.\nThe Iberian peninsula is often referred to as an \"electricity island\" because it relies on just a few connections through the Pyrenees to France, meaning it can be vulnerable to failures.\nS\u00e1nchez said power was brought back online thanks to connections with France and Morocco as well as gas and hydropower sources.\nPortugal's grid operator REN refuted initial reports, attributed to the agency on Monday, which said the blackout was caused by a rare atmospheric event.\nThe message in Portuguese said that \"due to extreme temperature variations in the interior or Spain, there were anomalous oscillations in the very high voltage lines (400 KV), a phenomenon known as 'induced atmospheric vibration'\".\n\"These oscillations caused synchronisation failures between the electrical systems, leading to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network.\" \nHowever, REN spokesman Bruno Silva told AFP on Tuesday that the grid operator \"did not put out this statement,\" without giving further details.",

        "article_text": "The runner who went viral and sparked a campaign for change for women\nSophie Power had not even laced up her trainers for her first run when she signed up to an ultramarathon.\nBut what was initially a fresh challenge after being made redundant has manifested into a life-changing passion that has led to positive change for women in sport.\nIn 2018, a photograph of Power breastfeeding her then three-month-old son during a 106-mile race went viral.\nThere had been no option for her to defer her place until she was fit to compete and it highlighted what she saw as a major issue facing women and mothers.\nNow, many of the world's biggest events, including the London Marathon, have implemented pregnancy deferral policies and Power's work has been central to that change.\nPower signed up for her first 250km (155-mile) ultramarathon at the age of 26, shortly after having been made redundant from her job in banking.\nAlthough she was not a runner and never had been, a friend had recently completed the challenge himself and recommended she try it, as he believed she could have the stamina needed due to her time in the air squadron at university.\n\"I went for my first run the next day and realised pretty quickly that I loved ultra-running. I love being outside, the breadth of phenomenal people you meet [who] you wouldn't come across in everyday life,\" the 42-year-old, who lives near Guildford in Surrey, told BBC Sport.\n\"And really kind of pushing my body to the limits in a new way.\"\nImmediately hooked, Power devoted her time to training and travelling to compete in stage races around world.\nShortly after the birth of her second child, Cormac, she was faced with a dilemma.\nPower juggles her campaigning and ultrarunning alongside bringing up her three children\nHaving given up her entry to the iconic Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc (UTMB) race while she recovered from the birth of her first child, Donnacha, three years before, she was not prepared to do so again.\nLike many races, UTMB had no pregnancy deferral policy at the time.\nDespite not being able to run so soon postpartum, Power entered the 106-mile event with a view to starting and maybe walking the first 10km.\nYet 43.5 hours after setting off she completed the challenge, that included 10,000m of climbing, inside the cut-off time, walking the whole way except for a short stretch after one of the highest points when she was worried she might get hypothermia. She crossed the line with then three-year-old Donnacha.\nThat moment is one she looks back on with immense pride, though it was a photograph of her taken with her younger son that day that would inspire what followed.\nFrench photographer Alexis Berg was at UTMB photographing the 2018 race, as he is at many ultra events. And it was at one of the refuelling stations that he saw something he had never previously seen at one of these events.\n\"I knew it was unusual. At that moment it was impossible to realise the photo would have such an impact, but I just pushed one button that day and everything else that has happened is because of Sophie,\" he said.\nWhat he captured was Power sitting down and breastfeeding her baby son during a break from the race.\n\"That photo has undoubtedly changed the course of my life. I worked out I should never have been on that start line,\" she said.\n\"I should have been given the opportunity to complete that kind of dream race when I was fit and healthy, not three months postpartum, trying to go 106 miles around a huge mountain by breastfeeding my baby. It was crazy.\"\nAlexis Berg's photograph of Power breast-feeding her three-month-old son, Cormac, at UTMB went viral in 2018\nPower wanted to ensure returning mums did not face the same choice and put their bodies through the same risk as she had done.\nShe founded the charity SheRaces with the core aim of breaking down barriers preventing women from entering events alongside men and safeguarding returning mothers.\nAfter the photo went viral, many male directors contacted her almost immediately to say they had added pregnancy deferrals to their programmes and expressed embarrassment that it was something they had not thought of before.\nShe engaged with more than 2,000 women to find out what prevented them from getting on the start line of races alongside men.\nHer research went far beyond elite level sport. Power is not a professional athlete herself and her real passion is for other women and girls who had been like her.\n\"Girls drop out of sport at such a high rate. There's a massive dream deficit for girls compared to boys,\" she said.\nPower believes a big reason for this is the language used when promoting sports and sporting events.\n\"It's 'hardest, toughest, baddest', and for a lot of women that's quite off-putting,\" she said.\n\"How do we redesign sport in a female lens? Can we make sure that the opportunities for girls are tailored to them, and what they want and sports provided in the right places in the right way?\"\nThe result of her research was a set of nine principles that organisers could commit to in order to make their events more inclusive for women.\nThese included adapting the use of language and imagery on websites to reflect and appeal to female runners, changing cut-off times, providing female toilets, period products, changing facilities and event T-shirts made specifically for female entrants, rather than unisex ones for all, and a safeguarding and harassment policy.\nCriteria for elite races includes equal exposure for the female race on social media coverage and prizes for female competition.\nPower has seen change in some of the world's biggest races.\nUTMB's policy, external since 2023 for some of its marquee events entitles those who are pregnant, have a pregnant partner or are adopting or birthing via surrogacy to a full refund and priority re-entry for up to five years.\nBut she says there is still a long way to go.\nAssefa sets women's record as Sawe wins men's race\nLondon Marathon breaks world record for most finishers\n'Finish lines not finish times' at London Marathon\nThe London Marathon had a world record number of finishers in 2025, surpassing the previous record of 55,646 set by the New York Marathon in November\nThe New York, Boston and London marathons now all have pregnancy deferrals in place, yet mothers must pay the entrance fee for a second time when they use the deferral scheme, she said.\nHer organisation's criteria requests races to implement a two-year deferral to allow people enough time to recover fully from their pregnancies.\n\"The majority of races are commercial, it's a business. If they can get more people on their start lines then they're going to do it and the purpose of the guidelines is they're almost non-cost. It's a no-brainer,\" she said.\n\"There are a lot of brands out there who say they are pro-women, yet they're sponsoring women's races that don't have pregnancy deferrals, that don't treat women equally.\n\"And then there are dinosaurs, they don't value the voice of female athletes.\n\"Then there are races that still need to make improvements, I put London Marathon in that bracket. They have listened to us, they are phenomenally inclusive, they've got loads of initiatives that they put out for diversity on their start lines, but they still want to make women pay twice for their place when they have a baby.\n\"I've definitely lost faith in some race organisers because of it but so many are changing and becoming better. You always feel like you fail at the battles you don't win but we're winning so many battles and driving so much change.\"\nThe London Marathon's policy, external allows entrants to defer for up to three years after giving birth. The event's organisers did not respond when asked why users of the deferral system must pay their entrance fee again.\nWhat is Couch to 5k and how do I start?\nPower suffered from hallucinations while on a world record-breaking ultramarathon across Ireland\nAs the scale of her work and its influence has grown, Power's propensity for testing her physical limits has grown with it.\nShe is now the holder of two Guinness world records - becoming the fastest woman to run the length of Ireland, last year.\nPower completed the gruelling 340-mile route in three days 12 hours and eight minutes, smashing the previous record set by Mimi Anderson by more than three hours.\nThe route took her through Munster, where husband John was born, and to County Cork, where many of the Power family live, running through torrential rainfall, experiencing the early stages of sun stroke and sleeping for little more than two hours, while sustaining herself on a diet of jam-filled tortilla wraps, gels, chews and ice cream.\nHer tongue was burned after two days of eating nothing but fruit and sweets. She pushed herself to the brink of total exhaustion.\n\"I was seeing nativity and Christmas scenes everywhere in this town. And all the trees had turned into plastic. The hallucinations were phenomenal, crazy,\" she said.\nShe has since gone on to set a second world record for the longest distance covered on a treadmill by a female in 48 hours and will be hosting her own women-only ultra races in the Peak District in August.\nSo how will she know when she has achieved what she set out to do?\n\"My ultimate goal for SheRaces is that we don't exist because it's not needed anymore and every woman is able to get on the start line,\" she added.\n\"Part of the reason I created it was to have something that wasn't just me and was owned by all women. We can all help each other and demand fairness.\"\nPower completed the 84-hour Ireland challenge with just short 20-minute naps on the roadside ",

Sport InsightThe runner who went viral and sparked a campaign for change for womenPublished29 April 2025Image source, Phil Hill/@the_PHBalanceChris PeddyBBC Sport, London and south eastSophie Power had not even laced up her trainers for her first run when she signed up to an ultramarathon.But what was initially a fresh challenge after being made redundant has manifested into a life-changing passion that has led to positive change for women in sport.In 2018, a photograph of Power breastfeeding her then three-month-old son during a 106-mile race went viral.There had been no option for her to defer her place until she was fit to compete and it highlighted what she saw as a major issue facing women and mothers.Now, many of the world's biggest events, including the London Marathon, have implemented pregnancy deferral policies and Power's work has been central to that change.A starting dilemmaPower signed up for her first 250km (155-mile) ultramarathon at the age of 26, shortly after having been made redundant from her job in banking.Although she was not a runner and never had been, a friend had recently completed the challenge himself and recommended she try it, as he believed she could have the stamina needed due to her time in the air squadron at university. \"Image source, Alexis BergImage caption, Alexis Berg's photograph of Power breast-feeding her three-month-old son, Cormac, at UTMB went viral in 2018Power wanted to ensure returning mums did not face the same choice and put their bodies through the same risk as she had done.She founded the charity SheRaces with the core aim of breaking down barriers preventing women from entering events alongside men and safeguarding returning mothers.After the photo went viral, many male directors contacted her almost immediately to say they had added pregnancy deferrals to their programmes and expressed embarrassment that it was something they had not thought of before.She engaged with more than 2,000 women to find out what prevented them from getting on the start line of races alongside men.Her research went far beyond elite level sport. \"Immediately hooked, Power devoted her time to training and travelling to compete in stage races around world.Shortly after the birth of her second child, Cormac, she was faced with a dilemma.Image source, Phil Hill/@the_PHBalanceImage caption, Power juggles her campaigning and ultrarunning alongside bringing up her three childrenHaving given up her entry to the iconic Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc (UTMB) race while she recovered from the birth of her first child, Donnacha, three years before, she was not prepared to do so again.Like many races, UTMB had no pregnancy deferral policy at the time.Despite not being able to run so soon postpartum, Power entered the 106-mile event with a view to starting and maybe walking the first 10km.Yet 43.5 hours after setting off she completed the challenge, that included 10,000m of climbing, inside the cut-off time, walking the whole way except for a short stretch after one of the highest points when she was worried she might get hypothermia. I worked out I should never have been on that start line,\" she said.",

        "article_text": "Famous for its adorable quokkas, Rottnest Island has become a global favourite. But beyond the selfies lies a rich, complex story of culture, conservation and community.\nOn a recent visit to Perth, I mentioned to a local that I was heading to Rottnest Island the next day. She sighed wistfully. \"I love it there,\" she said. \"You're going to love it too. It has a special kind of magic \u2013 the kind of place where you kick off your shoes the minute you arrive. Everything slows down and you can breathe a little more deeply.\"\nI already felt that Perth was a little like that \u2013 at least, life there felt slower and less frenzied than in my hometown of Melbourne on Australia's east coast \u2013 but I smiled back, not really knowing what she meant.\nHowever, she was right. Rottnest Island, a peaceful 19-sq-km isle off the coast of Western Australia, is, in fact, magical. The spell was cast as soon as our ferry left the mainland, skimming over the Indian Ocean. Humpback whales breached nearby, sending jets of sea spray into the air and flipping their tails as if in welcome. The sky was clear with the promise of a perfect day to come.\nJust 19km and 30 minutes later, I stepped off the ferry into another world. Rottnest Island has been famously car-free since 1931, and those more in the know than me immediately jumped onto bikes they'd brought with them or wandered off to hire one from Pedal and Flipper, said to be the largest bike hire place in the southern hemisphere.\nKids zoomed around in packs, dodging groups of tourists ambling through the main settlement. Some people had fishing rods under one arm; others, surfboards strapped to their bikes. Families stopped at the bakery for a flat white and vanilla slice before heading off to explore the island's 63 beaches and 20 bays, many with evocative names like Little Parakeet Bay and Cathedral Rocks that in no way came close to capturing the grandeur of the scenery in real life.\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nThere was no urban noise, no traffic and nothing to worry about. It was idyllic and glorious and everything I imagined a nostalgic care-free (and car-free) island holiday to be.\nThe isle has long been a cherished playground for generations of Western Australian families. \"Rottnest is very, very special, particularly to the people of Perth, like me,\" explained Paul Campbell, a volunteer guide I met not long after I arrived. Campbell spent his childhood holidays on Rottnest and now returns regularly to tell people about his beloved island. \"There are no multi-storey high-rise hotels here,\" he added. \"There is no private ownership. If you ever tried to put a multi-storey-anything here for wealthy people, you would be absolutely torn to shreds. We are very protective of our beautiful island.\"\nOnce a well-kept secret from the rest of the world, in recent years Rottnest has become one of Australia's most Instagrammed destinations, thanks to a certain fuzzy-faced resident: the quokka.\nIn 2013, Huffington Post dubbed the quokka \"the happiest animal in the world\", and the internet responded in glee. Quokkas \u2013 tiny marsupials found only in this small pocket of south-western Australia \u2013 seem to smile for selfies in a way that feels almost staged. Tennis star Roger Federer to actress Margot Robbie were among the first celebrities to pose with the infamous animal, helping spark a wave of global attention. Then in 2019 came Chris Hemsworth's now-iconic #QuokkaSelfie\u00a0with Matt Damon, which racked up more than four million likes. \"Rotto\", as locals call it, became the hottest ticket in town, transforming from local secret to global sensation. According to the Rottnest Island Authority, annual visitor numbers have nearly tripled in the last decade, peaking at more than 800,000 at last count.\nWhat's in a name?\nThe island was first sighted by Dutch explorers in the 17th Century and was named by one such captain, Wallem de Vlamingh, who stayed on the island for six days and mistook the quokkas for rats. He referred the island as \"'t elyandt 't rottenest\" which means \"rat's nest island\" in Dutch \u2013 although by all accounts he was also captivated by the pristine scenery and referred to it as \"paradise on Earth\" in his journal.\nRottnest, once simple and sleepy, has had to quickly grow up to meet the demands of all these domestic and international tourists. That meant creating more accommodation than the basic cabins and camping that existed, as well as better food and activity options. And what it has done is exemplary, transforming into a model of eco-conscious tourism without losing its soul.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs Campbell put it: \"When I was nine years old, the [cultural] experience that I had on Rottnest is not that much different to what you're going to experience today.\"\u00a0\nYou won't find any private cars here \u2013 just a few vehicles for rangers and staff \u2013\u00a0so most everyone gets about on two wheels or two feet (or the odd skateboard, scooter or Segway), having to occasionally dodge quokkas lounging on the road. Accommodation ranges from beachside cottages with bike racks out front to backpacker dorms to relaxed boutique hotels. While many tourists come on a day trip from Perth, it's much better to stay the night: quokkas are nocturnal and will spend most of the day sleeping under shady bushes. In addition, most day-trippers leave by 16:30, at which point the island truly comes into its own.\n\"Someone once said to me that you can feel the island exhale [when they leave],\" said Erin Gallagher from the Rottnest Island Authority. \"I just thought it was the most beautiful thing \u2013 and it's so true.\"\nI was staying at Discovery Resorts, the island's first eco resort, whose 83 glamping tents are shaded by gum trees and Aleppo pines, tucked behind Pinky Beach in the sand dunes. My tent had no aircon or TV, just a ceiling fan for airflow and the sound of the ocean through canvas walls. It was perfect in its simplicity. \"[The resort] is designed to immerse guests into the environment,\" explained Krizza Miclat, the resort's sales and event manager. \"A lot of the infrastructure is elevated on steel poles to ensure that we're not damaging the sand dunes. So, if ever we were to pick up and move, we haven't impacted it too much.\"\nIn fact, nearly everything here works in harmony with the natural environment. Renewable energy is provided by the Indian Ocean's sea breezes and the strong Western Australian sun; while drinking water is drawn from the sweeping white semi-circle of\u00a0Longreach Bay, desalinated and filtered. Marine sanctuary zones below water mean world-class snorkelling and diving, and an island nursery grows native plants from locally sourced cuttings and seeds. In 2023, a new management plan reaffirmed Rottnest's commitment to sustainability, conservation and culture.\u00a0\n\"We're always striving to improve,\" said Gallagher. \"Our target is to achieve 75% renewables. There's even an app where anyone can see how much power the island is generating in real time.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A day out with Bluey: Australia's new experience brings the Heeler family to life\n\u2022 Bindi Irwin's top outdoor adventures in Australia\n\u2022 The hike making Australia a better place \nIn the spirit of low-impact activities, I decided to take a Segway tour around the undulating landscape, rolling along the endless beaches, gliding past the cluster of salt lakes in the north-eastern corner and looking out for whales on the island's Humpback Highway. I steered past the scrub heath that covers much of the island, breathing in its signature salty-sweet smell and dodging prickle lily and feather speargrass. The island is just 11km long and 4.5km at its widest point, but its biodiversity is vast \u2013 a Class A reserve where everything from the blue-flowered Rottnest daisy to the long, black king skink I saw on the side of a trail is protected.\nBut not all scenes here are so idyllic.\nIn 1838, Rottnest was turned into an Aboriginal prison. Over the next century, more than 4,000 Indigenous men and boys were incarcerated here for \"crimes\" that they often didn't know they'd committed. Some were as young as eight years old. Many never returned home.\nPlan your trip:\nGet there: Regular ferries are operated by Sealink and Rottnest Express (leaving from Perth CBD and Fremantle) and Rottnest Fast Ferries (leaving from Hillarys Boat Harbour, north of Perth CBD).\nWhen to go: Summer (December-February)\u00a0is the most popular (and crowded) time, but September-April is still warm enough for water-based activities. If you want to celebrate quokka joeys taking their first hops, visit 21-22 September 2025 for Little Quokka's Big Birthday Weekend.\nWhere to stay: Book an eco-glamping tent at Discovery Resorts or stay at the newly opened The Lodge Wadjemup.\nEat: Frankies for pizzas and salads; Sunset snacks and drinks at Pinky's; The Lane for craydogs (a spicy crayfish-stuffed roll); Isola for more upmarket fare.\nDo: Hire a bike, snorkel and mask from Pedal and Flipper to explore the island at your own pace. Head to Garden Lake at sunset for epic quokka sightings. Take a guided Segway tour to learn about the island's history as you explore.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt's a dark legacy that the island is only beginning to address. As I wobbled my Segway back to the main settlement, we passed what looked like an ordinary field. But, my tour guide explained, it is a place of immense significance: the\u00a0Wadjemup Aboriginal Burial Ground\u00a0where 373 unmarked graves of prisoners were uncovered, with the first discoveries made during construction work in the 1970s. Shockingly, holidaymakers continued to camp on the site until the practice was finally banned in 2007.\n\"It was the largest number of Aboriginal deaths in custody in history in Australia,\" explained volunteer guide Anne Yardley, when I met her later at the island's Wadjemup Museum. \"And from the biggest number of Aboriginal nations.\"\nBut Indigenous connection to the island stretches far beyond this painful chapter. Long before European settlement, the island was part of the mainland, and archaeological evidence shows that the Noongar people lived on and used the island for tens of thousands of years. Its Indigenous name \u2013 Wadjemup \u2013 means \"place of spirits\".\n\"This was a significant place for Indigenous people,\" Campbell told me. \"Ceremonies were held here. But about 6,500 years ago, sea levels rose and this patch of land became an island. The Aboriginal people stayed on the mainland and it was left alone for thousands of years\u2026 all through Christianity, the Roman Empire, the Egyptian Empire\u2026 until Europeans arrived.\"\nToday, Wadjemup is working to tell this fuller story. The small but compelling Wadjemup Museum has been revamped; while walking trails such as the 45km\u00a0Wadjemup Bidi\u00a0\u2013 made up of five connected trails and built in part by volunteers \u2013 connects visitors to historical and cultural sites across the landscape, with interpretive signage and installations by Noongar artists. The\u00a0Wadjemup Project, an Aboriginal-led initiative, focusses on acknowledging Wadjemup's history of Aboriginal incarceration and the memorialisation of former prison sites.\nVolunteers play a huge part, too, from the Winnit Club, formed in 1931 by a group of regular campers, to the yellow-shirted Rottnest Volunteer Guides. These and other groups collectively contribute more than 40,000 hours a year to maintaining the island, and their dedication to preserving and sharing its stories speaks volumes about how deeply the island is loved.\n\"There's this balancing act between having enough people to make the place work financially, but not so many people coming here that you lose the reason to come,\" said Campbell. \"It is a very, very special place.\"\u00a0\nI certainly felt that on my visit. One moment I was riding my bike past salt lakes ringed with grey saltbush and coastal pigface, the next watching irresistibly cute quokkas hop around at sunset. I snorkelled an underwater trail through turquoise shallows, gazed onto shipwrecks just offshore and had sunset drinks looking out to incredible ocean vistas. I even tried to get my own quokka selfie, respecting the signs not to feed or touch them in any way but to keep my distance and let them come to me. I laughed as I tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to get both myself and a quokka fully in shot, and was reminded of something Gallagher had said to me about the smiling-faced marsupial: \"Why wouldn't you be happy if this is where you lived?\"\nIt was more than just a line \u2013 it was a truth that settled into the bones of the island. Rottnest may be famous now, but it hasn't lost what makes it feel like a local secret: the sense that once you arrive, you can slow down, breathe deeply and kick off your shoes for a while.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has acknowledged he does have the ability to bring back a man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, but that he will not do so.\nKilmar \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was removed from the US in March. Judges all the way up to the US Supreme Court have ruled that this was done in error, and that Trump's team should help \"facilitate\" his return.\nTrump had previously denied having the power to bring Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda back to his home in Maryland. Pressed by an interviewer from ABC News on Tuesday, he conceded he \"could\" change the situation if he wanted to. \nHowever, he argued that Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda had been rightfully deported.\nTrump also said that a government lawyer who had previously made the admission that Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda had been deported in error \"should not have said that\".\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was among more than 250 Venezuelans and Salvadorans deported under Trump to a mega-prison in El Salvador in March, as part of what the White House portrayed as a crackdown on foreign criminals. Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was then moved to a different facility. \nSalvadoran President Nayib Bukele has similarly said he will not send Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda back to the US.\nIn the ABC sit-down, broadcast on Tuesday, interviewer Terry Moran pointed out that Trump could change things with a simple phone call. \n\"I could,\" responded the US president, before going on to say: \"And if he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that.\"\nTrump insisted that the deportee was not \"innocent\", but instead a member of the notorious Salvadoran gang MS-13. Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda has denied this.\nIn a testy exchange, Trump also restated his claim that Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda had MS-13 tattooed on his knuckles. \nThis appeared to be a reference to an image of Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's hand that has been digitally labelled, and promoted by the White House, to try to explain the meaning of several symbols inked on the man's fingers.\nExperts who previously spoke to BBC Verify have cast doubt on the claim that these tattoos mean what Trump and his team allege. \nThe M, S, 1 and 3 appear to have been added to the image previously displayed by Trump - as they do not appear on other images of Mr Abrego Garcia's hands.\nChallenged by ABC over whether his administration was complying with the Supreme Court's order to facilitate Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's return, Trump pointed out that he had entered the US illegally in the first place.\nMr Abrego Garcia has acknowledged entering the US illegally from El Salvador in 2012, according to court documents. But he was granted an order in 2019 that prevented the US government from sending him back.\nTrump also referred to an allegation of physical abuse made against Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda by his wife. Howver, earlier this month, Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's wife said she had not followed a court process against her husband, and appealed for him to be brought home.\nThe interview marked 100 days of his second term in the White House, which was also celebrated by Trump in a major speech in Michigan on Tuesday night.\nSpeaking to ABC, Trump defended his broader stance towards immigration and stood by his plan for wide-ranging trade tariffs which have caused turbulence in the global financial markets.\nHe insisted his plan for taxes on imports of goods to the US would yield \"great times\" rather than hard times, while saying he had braced Americans for a \"transition period\".\nHe also stressed that he had faith in his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, after reports detailing Hegseth's use of group chats on the Signal app to discuss sensitive military operations. He stopped short, however, of saying it was absolute.\nAsked if he had 100% confidence in his official, he said: \"I don't have 100% confidence in anything.\" He went on to call it a \"stupid question\".",

We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.\nHe said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".\nThe antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.\n\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.\n\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.\nThe 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.\nIt is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.\nCurrently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.\n\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics. \n\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\" \nOn the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back. \nThe satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"\nDespite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch. \n\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.\nAirbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.\nL3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.\nThe team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.\nThese annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.\n\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney. \nAnother advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.\nIt is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.\n\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\" \nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "The return of Marvel, Final Destination and Mission: Impossible franchises are among this month's unmissable films to watch and stream.\nCobra Kai began life as a YouTube series which picked up from where the 40-year-old Karate Kid franchise left off. In short, it didn't sound like essential viewing. But the series went on to be an Emmy-nominated, critically acclaimed, six-season hit, and it put the star of the 1984 film, Ralph Macchio, back in the limelight. Now Macchio is starring in a Karate Kid sequel, Karate Kid Legends, featuring Ben Wang as the new Kid on the block, a Chinese teenager who learns to fight bullies in New York. Confusingly, Legends follows the continuity of the original Karate Kid films, as well as the Cobra Kai series, but it also brings in Jackie Chan's Mr Han, who was in the 2010 Karate Kid remake. Still, Macchio promises that all the elements in this shared universe will be in balance \u2013 and as Mr Miyagi once explained, \"Balance is key\". \"Once we were able to line that up, for the Cobra Kai story to lead into the new film \u2013 even though they're separate ecosystems \u2013 it all made sense for me,\" Macchio said in Variety. \"Then, working with Jackie was just super exciting. I started this on the big screen. How cool is it to get it back to the big screen?\"\nReleased on 28, 29 and 30 May in cinemas internationally\nDanny and Michael Philippou are the Australian twins who made Talk to Me, a terrifically creepy indie horror film which was an international hit in 2023. It was such a success, in fact, that you might have expected the Philippous to move straight onto a sequel, or even to a Hollywood blockbuster. Instead, the brothers stayed in their hometown of Adelaide and made another low-budget horror film with an original story: Bring Her Back stars Sally Hawkins as a foster mother, Laura, who is trying to contact the dead. Thematically, this supernatural chiller is closely related to Talk to Me, although it's been given extra depth by a death in the Philippou family.\u00a0\"We were doing pre-production meetings, then we started shooting, and there was no time to properly sort through those emotions,\" Danny Philippou said in Den of Geek. \"They sort of poured themselves out in the script and in conversations with Sally, so that bled into the character of Laura and scenes that were meant to be scary suddenly turned sad. I think there's a rawness in it that wasn't in Talk to Me.\"\nReleased on 29 and 30 May in cinemas internationally\nThe co-director of Deaf President Now!, Nyle DiMarco, says that his documentary tells \"the story of the greatest civil rights movement most people have never heard of\". Its setting is Gallaudet University in Washington DC, the world's first university for deaf and hard of hearing students. Gallaudet was established in 1864, but for more than a century, none of its presidents was deaf. In 1988, when the board of trustees appointed yet another hearing president over two deaf candidates, the students wouldn't stand for it. Eight days of protests followed \u2013 and four of the protesters are interviewed in the film. Co-directed by Davis Guggenheim, who made the Oscar-winning An Inconvenient Truth and Still: A Michael J Fox Movie, Deaf President Now! is \"a firebrand historical documentary that is as crowd-pleasing and informative as it is innovative and inclusive\", says Marya E Gates at RobertEbert.com.\nReleased on 16 May on Apple+ internationally\nThere were five Final Destination films from 2000 to 2011, all with the same structure. First, there would be a spectacular catastrophe; then this sequence would be revealed to be someone's premonition; then the person who had the premonition would save a handful of people from the catastrophe when it actually happened; but then those people would be claimed by Death, one by one, usually via complicated accidents. Now the gleefully grisly franchise is back from the dead, so prepare to squeal and squirm at yet more ingeniously nasty killings. But Final Destination: Bloodlines has moved on from the previous films in one respect. According to the trailer, it turns out that all of the victims in the previous five films were descended from people who were saved from one particular catastrophe, decades ago. That means that the film isn't just about a group of strangers, but a family that is trying to break an inherited curse. \"Suddenly, the five films are not just one fun, gory rollercoaster ride after another, but a series with a lot of interweaving emotional weight,\" says Shawn Van Horn in Collider. \"Those stronger relationships are going to make the characters more three-dimensional, and we'll likely be rooting for their survival rather than relishing in the bloodshed.\" Well\u2026 maybe.\nReleased on 14, 15 and 16 May in cinemas internationally\nIn 2018, Paul Feig's A Simple Favour finished with Blake Lively's glamorous killer being jailed for 20 years, and with Anna Kendrick's widowed mother finding fame as a crime-solving vlogger, so a sequel didn't seem likely. But the film prided itself on its outrageous plot twists, so maybe it's appropriate that, seven years on, Lively's character is not just free from prison, but is about to marry a wealthy Italian on the island of Capri \u2013 and she is determined that her old frenemy should be her maid of honour. A Simple Favour was a devilish comedy noir that treated viewers to deceit, betrayal, murder, and the sight of Lively sipping martinis while wearing absurdly stylish outfits. Another Simple Favour is even more lavish in its fashions, and even more head-spinning in its plotting. Kristy Puchko in Mashable calls it a \"shapeshifting creature, transforming in tone moment to moment to revel in biting humour, relish in mob drama [and] plunge into the delicious depths of mad women in the psycho-biddy subgenre\". Fans of the first film will \"cherish this divinely twisted thriller\".\u00a0\nReleased on 1 May on Prime Video internationally\nTim Robinson, a Saturday Night Live alumnus with his own sketch show, Netflix's I Think You Should Leave, has his first big-screen leading role in Friendship. And, true to form, it will make you cringe as much as laugh. Robinson plays Craig, a suburban office worker who is too awkward to have any real friends. Then he meets his neighbour, Brian (Paul Rudd), a weatherman who plays in a punk band in his spare time, which makes him fabulously cool by Craig's standards. Craig is thrilled to hang out with his Brian and his buddies, but after he ruins one social occasion too many, Brian \"breaks up\" with him, and he spirals out of control. Written and directed by Andrew DeYoung, this bromantic black comedy is \"feverishly and hilariously demented\", says Nick Schager in the Daily Beast. \"Partnered with the always ridiculous Rudd, Robinson reconfirms his standing as the reigning master of discomfort. Together, they make Friendship the funniest movie of the year.\"\nReleased on 9 May in the US\nAdmittedly, the last of Disney's live-action remakes, Snow White, was (a) dogged by controversy, and (b) not very good, but Lilo & Stitch looks a lot more promising. The film retells the story a genetically engineered, blue-furred alien called Experiment 626, or Stitch. He is so destructive that he is condemned to be exiled to an asteroid, but he escapes from the interstellar authorities and crash-lands on Earth, where he is befriended by a Hawaiian girl, Lilo. The original 2002 film, then, was one of the few Disney cartoons to have a modern-day US setting, and one of the few to mix contemporary human beings with fantastical creatures \u2013 so, for once, a remake that has both live-action and CGI characters makes total sense. Another good sign is that the film is directed by Dean Fleischer Camp, who made the Oscar-nominated charmer Marcel the Shell with Shoes On. And a third key factor is that, in the trailers, Maia Kealoha, who plays Lilo, seems to have the most adorable chemistry with an alien since Drew Barrymore was in ET The Extra Terrestrial.\nReleased on 21, 22 and 23 May in cinemas internationally\nNicolas Cage doesn't appear in many subtle dramas these days, so you may not be surprised to hear that The Surfer is \"a gloriously demented B-movie thriller\", as Xan Brooks puts it in The Observer, or that Cage cranks \"the acting dial from befuddled to vexed to outraged to volcanic\". He plays an unnamed businessman who has returned to Australia after years in California, and who wants to buy the beachfront house where he grew up. But when he tries to surf in a nearby bay, he is harassed by a gang of locals led by a shamanic thug (Julian McMahon). Cage's character won't be put off, though, and camps out in the car park above the beach, sacrificing his possessions and his sanity in the process. \"Crisply scripted by Thomas Martin and directed by Lorcan Finnegan with a pleasing, no-frills intensity,\" says Brooks, \"The Surfer [is] a low-budget, hard-hitting comic bruiser of a picture: a midlife-crisis movie dressed up as a 1970s exploitation flick [with a] wild, roiling, hallucinogenic vibe.\"\nReleased on 2 May in the US and Canada, 9 May in the UK and Ireland, and 15 May in Australia\nJane Austen may be turning 250 in December, but film and TV directors are as smitten by her novels as ever. Emma Corrin and Jack Lowden are starring in a new Netflix adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, and before that there is a French romantic comedy drama, Jane Austen Wrecked My Life, written and directed by Laura Piani. Camille Rutherford stars as Agathe, who works in a bookshop in Paris, but dreams of becoming an author. With the encouragement of her friend Felix (Pablo Pauly), she accepts the offer of a writing residency in England set up by the Austen estate. Will she finish her novel at last? Will she come to see Felix as more than a friend? Or will she fall for one of the residency's organisers (Charlie Anson), a handsome toff who happens to be the great-great-great-great-nephew of Austen\u00a0herself? \"The film is a delightful ode to Jane Austen's novels, serving up a unique blend of humour and introspection that reflects both European sensibilities and the particular quirks of Austen's world,\" says Louisa Moore in Screen Zealots.\nReleased on 16 May in Spain, 23 May in the US, and 30 May in the UK\nThe original Mission: Impossible TV series ran for just seven years, but the film series has been running for 29 \u2013 and its star, Tom Cruise, does plenty of running himself. Could the franchise be coming to a conclusion at last? The subtitle of the eighth instalment, Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning, suggests that Ethan Hunt won't be choosing to accept any more missions after this one, so this could be the last time we'll see Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Hayley Atwell crashing cars and jumping off buildings. On the other hand, Cruise is refusing to confirm whether or not Hunt will live to fight another day. \"You gotta see the movie,\" he told Empire magazine. \"It's a hard thing for me to discuss at the moment, because it really is something that you have to experience.\" The film's director, Christopher McQuarrie, is also being cagey, but he does acknowledge that the word \"Final\" is in there for a reason. \"It is, I hope, the satisfying conclusion to a 30-year story arc,\" he says. \"I'm pretty confident that people are going to feel that the title was appropriate.\"\nReleased on 21, 22 and 23 May in cinemas internationally\nIt seems as if writers and directors can't stop celebrating/ satirising the luxurious lifestyles \u2013 and enviable kitchens \u2013 of the super-rich, whether in such television series as The White Lotus, The Perfect Couple and Your Friends and Neighbors, or in such films as Glass Onion, Triangle of Sadness and Blink Twice. The sharpest of all of these depictions is Succession, Jesse Armstrong's multiple Emmy-winning series about a Murdoch-alike media dynasty. And now, two years after Succession concluded its run, Armstrong returns to the territory he has made his own. Mountainhead is a comedy drama shot in Park City, Utah, starring Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman, Cory Michael Smith and Ramy Youssef as billionaire tech bros on holiday in a ski resort during a global crisis. The film wasn't even shot until March this year, so Armstrong and his team must be editing it at lightning speed. Could that mean that Mountainhead will be the most topical fictional commentary on the 1% so far?\nReleased on 31 May on HBO and Max, and 1 June on Sky and NOW\n\"After years of misfires, disappointments, and a growing sense of superhero fatigue, the MCU looks poised for a comeback with the highly anticipated arrival of Thunderbolts,\" says Linda Marric in HeyUGuys, \"a gritty but mostly fun new adventure that just might put Marvel back on top.\" The idea behind this rough-edged spy caper is that Marvel's least powerful, least glamorous, and least fulfilled superheroes have been carrying out covert missions for a shady businesswoman (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). When she decides that they're expendable, these grumpy loners are forced to form a ragtag team consisting of Florence Pugh's Yelena, David Harbour's Red Guardian, Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier, Wyatt Russell's US Agent, and Hannah John-Kamen's Ghost. \"It is a film that makes us truly care about its characters and their well-being,\" says Marric. \"It's gritty, chaotic and sometimes uneven, but also thrilling and unexpectedly heartfelt. Best of all, it proves Marvel can still surprise us when it stops trying to please everyone and leans into the weirdness.\"\u00a0\nOut now in cinemas internationally\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "The US has signed a deal with Kyiv to share profits from the future sale of Ukraine's mineral and energy reserves, after months of tense negotiations.\nThe deal aims to provide an economic incentive for the US to continue to invest in Ukraine's defence and reconstruction - as well as to address Washington's concerns over the amount of aid it has already contributed. \nUkraine is believed to have vast reserves of critical minerals like graphite, titanium and lithium. They are highly sought after because of their use in renewable energy, military technology and infrastructure.\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it showed both sides were committed to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine. \nThe deal will also see the establishment of an investment fund to spur Ukraine's economic recovery from the war. \nAccording to the statement from the US Treasury on Wednesday afternoon, the newly created US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund recognises the \"significant financial and material support\" the US has given Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022. \nThe US treasury secretary said in a video statement that the deal would help \"unlock Ukraine's growth assets\".\nThe language of the announcement shows much more solidarity with Ukraine than is usual for the Trump administration.\nIt refers to \"Russia's full scale invasion\" and adds that \"no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine\".\nThe Kremlin has not yet responded to the agreement.\nFor Kyiv, it is seen as essential to accessing US military aid.\nUkraine's Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko - who flew to Washington to ink the deal on Wednesday - said in a post on X that the new fund would \"attract global investment into our country\". \nListing the deal's provisions, she said it would involve projects in minerals, oil and gas, although the resources would remain the property of Ukraine.\nThe partnership will be equal, on a 50:50 basis, she added, and must be ratified by lawmakers in Kyiv.\nUnder the deal, the US would contribute new assistance to Kyiv, she added, including, for example, air defence systems.\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly pushed for the agreement as a prerequisite to offering any future security guarantees to Kyiv. \nCrucially, the draft of the deal indicates Ukraine will be giving Washington access to some of its natural resources in return for future US security assistance.\nBut that is significantly less than what Trump had wanted, which was to get paid back for all US military aid given since the start of the war.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has managed to eke out some concessions from Washington.\nThe deal was delayed after US authorities said Kyiv was trying to make last-minute changes. \nOn Wednesday afternoon, a US source familiar with the talks criticised Ukraine for seeking to reopen some terms that had apparently been finalised over the weekend.\nThe source said sticking points had included governance of the fund, issues with transparency, and steps to ensure that all funds would be fully traceable.\nTechnical documents were signed last week by representatives of both countries.\nThe initial agreement was due to be signed in February, but fell apart following a heated exchange at the White House when Trump accused Zelensky of \"gambling with World War Three\". \nThe breakthrough comes days after Trump and Zelensky held a face-to-face meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral, and as talks between Moscow and Washington over a possible ceasefire in Ukraine grind on.\nPhoning into the NewsNation network on Wednesday evening, Trump said he had pressed Zelensky at Vatican City to seal the deal.\n\"I was telling him that it's a very good thing if we can produce a deal that you sign it,\" he said, \"because Russia is much bigger and much stronger. Russia is just chugging forward.\"\nThe US president said the deal would recuperate the multi-billion dollar US assistance to Ukraine since the war began and \"much more in theory\".\n\"So I went to them and said, 'Look, we got to get rare earth.' They have great rare earth, meaning certain minerals, materials,\" said Trump.\n\"They have things that a lot of places don't have. It's a big asset that they have.\"\nThe agreement comes amid a US trade war with China, where 90% of the world's current rare-earth stocks are sourced.",

We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.\nHe said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".\nThe antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.\n\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.\n\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.\nThe 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.\nIt is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.\nCurrently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.\n\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics. \n\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\" \nOn the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back. \nThe satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"\nDespite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch. \n\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.\nAirbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.\nL3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.\nThe team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.\nThese annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.\n\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney. \nAnother advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.\nIt is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.\n\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\" \nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "The trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, one of the most successful rappers and music moguls in the US, starts in New York on 5 May with jury selection. \nThe charges against him include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted, he could face life in prison.\nThe rapper also faces dozens of lawsuits from individuals who accuse him of using his power to drug, assault, rape, intimidate and silence people.\nMr Combs has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and rejected the individual lawsuits as attempts \"for a quick payday\".\nMr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - emerged into the hip-hop scene in the 1990s.\nHis early music career success included helping launch the careers of Mary J Blige and Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or the Notorious B.I.G.\nHis music label Bad Boy Records became one of the most important labels in rap and expanded to include Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112, Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez.\nMr Combs also had a prolific business career outside of music, including a deal with British drinks company Diageo to promote the French vodka brand, C\u00eeroc.\nIn 2023, he released his fifth record The Love Album: Off The Grid and earned his first solo nomination at the Grammy awards. He also was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards.\nIn a federal criminal case, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex trafficking and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution.  \nMany of the most severe allegations relate to the racketeering conspiracy charge.\nIt includes accusations of kidnapping, drugging, and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes using firearms or threats of violence.\nIn a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as \u201cfreak offs\u201d, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.\nSeparately, Mr Combs faces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault.\nTony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US have either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or will do so.\nIn December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was \"gang raped\" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack. \nMr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity.\"\nHis current legal issues began when he was sued by his ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, in late 2023.  She accused him of violently abusing and raping her. \nThat lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.\nSince then, dozens of people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all claims. \nHis controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CCTV footage leaked by CNN showed Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor in 2016.\nHe apologised for his behaviour, saying: \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"\nMr Combs has consistently denied the allegations made against him in the civil lawsuits, describing them as \"sickening\" and suggesting they were made by \"individuals looking for a quick payday\".\nIn a statement to the BBC about the federal criminal charges, his lawyer said: \"Mr Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process.\n\"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"\nDiddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss an aspect of the federal indictment in which he is accused of transportation to engage in prostitution. His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race.\nIn a hearing in New York a week before the trial, his attorneys told the court that the rapper led the \"lifestyle\" of a \"swinger\" and was not a criminal. \nThey said he thought it was \"appropriate\" to have multiple sex partners, including sex workers. \nAt the same hearing, prosecutors revealed that Mr Combs had rejected a plea deal. \nMr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, since his arrest on 16 September 2024.\nHis lawyers have argued for his release, citing the jail\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d conditions. \nCritics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, with a culture of violence. \nA New York federal judge denied the bail request, describing Mr Combs as a \u201cserious flight risk\u201d.\nProsecutors have alleged that Mr Combs has been breaking prison rules by contacting potential witnesses. \nThey accuse him of \"relentless efforts\" to \"corruptly influence witness testimony\".\nThe trial is scheduled to begin on 5 May.\nThe first days of the trial will be for jury selection, with the trial starting in earnest after the panel is selected. \nProsecutor Emily Johnson told the judge that the government will need three weeks to present its case.\nDefence lawyer Marc Agnifilo said the rapper's team will need a week for theirs.\nMr Combs' trial - scheduled to take place at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in New York City - is expected to be public.\nAll of his court proceedings thus far have been open to the media and the public, but have not been livestreamed.\nMost federal courts do not allow cameras or electronics in the courtroom.\nMr Combs faces up to life in prison if convicted on the racketeering charge.\nHe faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of sex trafficking.\nTransportation for purposes of prostitution carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.",

        "article_text": "The latest in the superhero franchise \"is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun\", with a \"charismatic\" Florence Pugh at its centre, writes Nicholas Barber.\nEver since Avengers: Endgame came out in 2019, the subtitle has felt a lot more appropriate than the studio might have liked. It's not that Marvel hasn't had any hits in the 2020s, but it is no longer releasing an unbroken chain of talked-about blockbusters, nor is it keeping audiences invested in a story that threads through all of them. That particular game has come to an end.\nThe Marvel films that have worked best since Endgame are the ones that have moved furthest away from the pattern set by the so-called \"Infinity Saga\" \u2013 the first 22 instalments in the franchise, which pivoted around a fight against uber-villain Thanos. Last year's R-rated Deadpool & Wolverine used almost no characters from the main Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU); the postmodern Spider-Man: No Way Home paid tribute to the Spider-Man films which weren't made by Marvel Studios; and the latest Marvel film, Thunderbolts*, has its own distinct identity, too. That's not to suggest that it isn't a part of the MCU. In fact, one of its clever touches is that it specifically addresses how gloomy people feel in a world where Iron Man, Thor and Captain America are no longer around. But the director, Jake Shreier, and the screenwriters, Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo, have come up with an unruly take on the superhero genre which makes it the most refreshing MCU offering in years.\nThe key is that, rather than trying to be as glossy and expansive as the Infinity Saga films, Thunderbolts* is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun. It isn't the epic tale of indestructible titans saving the Universe, let alone the multiverse; it's a comedy-tinged caper about bungling secret agents who are deemed a liability by the very company that used to employ them. It's not a new scenario: after The Bourne Identity, there were countless action films in which disavowed spies dodged their erstwhile handlers. But Thunderbolts* stands out because it has a whole group of such spies: a ragtag bunch of depressive, dysfunctional loners who must work together and can't stop grumbling about it. What's especially unusual about the film, in Marvel terms, is that its premise would be viable even if the characters weren't super-powered. And, indeed, they aren't all that super-powered compared to the aforementioned Captain America and Thor. Part of their appeal is that they can be killed by bullets and trapped in rooms with locked doors, which makes them a lot easier to relate to than Norse gods.\nThere's a lesson there that the makers of such disappointments as Eternals and The Marvels should have learnt. It's not the characters' powers that count; it's their personalities. In Thunderbolts*, those characters are Yelena (Florence Pugh), a Russian assassin who was the adoptive sister of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and is now deeply miserable about all the mindless violence in her life; her adoptive father, Red Guardian (David Harbour), a washed-up slob who is nostalgic for his days as a national hero; the bionic-armed Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who was Captain America's sidekick in World War Two, and still seems uncomfortable in the 21st Century; John Walker (Wyatt Russell), an embittered super-soldier who was supposed to be the new Captain America, but wasn't up to the job; the confused, conflicted Bob (Lewis Pullman), another flawed attempt to create a Captain America substitute; and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), who is a science experiment gone wrong \u2013 but who, unlike the other characters, isn't very well defined beyond that. In various ways, they are all connected to one of Marvel's most memorably slippery villains, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a businesswoman with all the brittle, condescending confidence that you might expect from the reliably excellent star of Seinfeld and Veep.\nDe Fontaine, it seems, has been behind several superhero-related black ops. Now that her political opponents are closing in on her, she decides to destroy all the evidence of her shady undertakings, including the people who carried them out. And so it is that Yelena and the others switch from trying to kill each other to trying to keep each other alive. They become a sort-of team, but they aren't sure whether or not to call themselves the Thunderbolts, so the asterisk in the title signifies that it's just a placeholder name until they can think of something better.\nThunderbolts*\nDirector: Jake Schreier\nCast: Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, Olga Kurylenko, Lewis Pullman, Geraldine Viswanathan, Chris Bauer, Wendell Pierce, David Harbour, Hannah John-Kamen, Julia Louis-Dreyfus\nRuntime: 2hr 16min\nOne small snag is that most of the characters' back stories are in other films, and in a TV series, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, rather than in Thunderbolts* itself. Another snag is that the gang's pursuit by De Fontaine's troops accounts for the majority of the film's running time, so there aren't many set pieces that haven't been in the trailers already. On the other hand, superhero films are rarely so tightly focused, and rarely progress so seamlessly from scene to scene, with no pausing for breath, and no sudden jumps to different ends of the Earth. Captain America: Brave New World, which came out in February, was similar to Thunderbolts* in that it revolved around Washington DC politics, and followed on from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. But that film was a messy sprawl, whereas this one is so neatly plotted that you can get the gist and enjoy the ride whether you're a Marvel nerd or not.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A combat epic that 'does what film does best'\n\u2022 Disney's Snow White has a major 'identity crisis'\n\u2022 Mickey 17 is a 'disappointment' \nThe underlying issues in Thunderbolts* are just as focused as the narrative. The characters all have to deal with the shame and trauma of their troubled pasts \u2013 and this theme is there from the opening scene to the requisite Final Battle, which is slightly rushed, but stylishly surreal enough to recall two mind-bending films written by Charlie Kaufman, Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In between, the characters' guilt is explored in some touching and surprisingly brutal sequences, as well as in some sharply-scripted, briskly-edited and skilfully-performed comic scenes.\u00a0\nAt both ends of the spectrum, Pugh delivers a performance which would win her awards if it weren't in a superhero film. She delivers her punchlines with expert timing, especially when she is bickering and bantering with Red Guardian. But she can also radiate raw emotion \u2013 and all while maintaining a decent Russian accent and cartwheeling through her acrobatic fight scenes. When it comes down to it, that's why Thunderbolts* is so much better than most of Marvel's post-Endgame films. It's not just because it's a rough-edged, big-hearted spy thriller about lovably clueless anti-heroes. It's because it has an actor as charismatic as Pugh at its centre.\u00a0\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\u00a0--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "summary": "Last year's R-rated Deadpool & Wolverine used almost no characters from the main Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU); the postmodern Spider-Man: No Way Home paid tribute to the Spider-Man films which weren't made by Marvel Studios; and the latest Marvel film, Thunderbolts*, has its own distinct identity, too. In Thunderbolts*, those characters are Yelena (Florence Pugh), a Russian assassin who was the adoptive sister of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and is now deeply miserable about all the mindless violence in her life; her adoptive father, Red Guardian (David Harbour), a washed-up slob who is nostalgic for his days as a national hero; the bionic-armed Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who was Captain America's sidekick in World War Two, and still seems uncomfortable in the 21st Century; John Walker (Wyatt Russell), an embittered super-soldier who was supposed to be the new Captain America, but wasn't up to the job; the confused, conflicted Bob (Lewis Pullman), another flawed attempt to create a Captain America substitute; and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), who is a science experiment gone wrong \u2013 but who, unlike the other characters, isn't very well defined beyond that. Thunderbolts* review: 'The greatest Marvel offering in years'22 hours agoShareSaveNicholas BarberShareSaveDisneyThe latest in the superhero franchise \"is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun\", with a \"charismatic\" Florence Pugh at its centre, writes Nicholas Barber.Ever since Avengers: Endgame came out in 2019, the subtitle has felt a lot more appropriate than the studio might have liked. What's especially unusual about the film, in Marvel terms, is that its premise would be viable even if the characters weren't super-powered. But the director, Jake Shreier, and the screenwriters, Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo, have come up with an unruly take on the superhero genre which makes it the most refreshing MCU offering in years.The key is that, rather than trying to be as glossy and expansive as the Infinity Saga films, Thunderbolts* is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun.",

        "article_text": "Mark Carney's Liberals have won Canada's federal election - riding a backlash of anti-Trump sentiment to form the next government.\nIt is a stunning political turnaround for a party who were widely considered dead and buried just a few months ago.  \nIt's not yet clear if the party - which has been in power for almost a decade - will be able to secure a majority as results continue to roll in. \nEither way, the prime minister faces major challenges, including divisions in the country laid bare by the campaign. \nHere are five takeaways from an election which saw the Conservative opposition make major gains but still lose. \nThere is no doubt the US president's tariff threats and comments undermining Canada's sovereignty played an outsized role in this election, suddenly making leadership and the country's economic survival the defining issues of the campaign.\nMark Carney used it to his advantage, running as much against Trump as he did against his main opposition rival, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre.\nCarney warned Canada was at a crisis moment, saying frequently on the campaign trail - and in his victory speech - that Trump \"wants to break us so America can own us\".\nPoilievre brought Trump up much less frequently during the campaign, focusing his message on domestic issues - the cost of living, the housing affordability crisis, and crime - and targeting the Liberals for their record on those matters.\nCarney - who has declared the old relationship with the US \"over\" - plans to start negotiations on a new economic and security relationship immediately following the election.\nKevin O'Leary, a Canadian businessman close to Trump who previously ran for the Conservative leadership, acknowledged it was a successful campaign strategy.\n\"Right now Canadians are very frustrated with America and Carney has used that to his advantage,\" he told the BBC just before polls closed. \"He was able to distract Canadians from his own mistakes... and say 'Stop looking at that. Look south of the border and I can save you'.\"\nAt the start of the year, Carney was a former central banker with no experience as a politician. By mid-March, he was being sworn in as prime minister - the first to have never held elected public office before - after a resounding win in the Liberal leadership race.\nNow, he's faced the Canadian electorate as a first time campaigner, won an Ottawa-area seat in the House of Commons and steered his party to an unlikely victory.\nCarney had long flirted with entering Canadian politics - and he seized his moment, swooping in after former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's sudden resignation in January. \nHe also took full advantage of the new political landscape, leaning into his experience helping Canada and the UK navigate previous crises at a time when Canadians were feeling anxious about their economic future.\nTrump's late-March announcement of global levies on foreign automobile imports gave Carney the chance to publicly audition to keep his job during the campaign. He was able to step away from the trail and take on the prime minister's mantle, setting up a call with the president and bringing together his ministers on the US file.\nIn a different election, this would have been a successful one for the Conservatives.\nIn 2011, the Conservatives won a majority with 39.6% of the vote. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is on track to beat that this time, with roughly 41.4% of the vote with most polls reporting, according to Elections Canada.\nThey are currently projected to have won 144 seats - that's up from 120 at dissolution, when the election was called in March.\nBut with the progressive vote coalescing around the Liberals, those numbers weren't enough this time. \nThe bitter blow was Poilievre losing his riding (parliamentary seat) in Carleton, Ontario.\nOnly months ago his party had a clear path to victory and they will now need to figure out a way forward after a series of electoral defeats.\nWhether that includes the diminished figure of Poilievre as leader is the first big question for them to face.He is the third leader they've had since the Liberals swept the 2015 election.\nThe election results have highlighted divisions in Canada that could pose a challenge for Carney. \nNotably, the Liberals are largely shut out of Alberta and Saskatchewan - oil-rich and gas-rich prairie provinces where a sense of alienation from the centre of power in Ottawa has long festered.\nEven before the election, some in those regions were warning of a national unity crisis if the Liberals won another mandate.\nCarney touched on those divisions in his victory speech, acknowledging the millions who had voted for a different outcome. \n\"I intend to govern for all Canadians,\" he said. \nMeanwhile, Poilievre's message, which relentlessly focused on cost of living issues, especially on housing affordability, resonated with many young people.\nSupport for the Conservatives outpaced Liberals by 44% to 31.2% among 18 to 34 year olds, a Nanos poll on 25 April indicated. The divide was more stark among younger men.\nSeparately, Abacus Data polling found that about 18% of 18 to 29 year olds were worried about Trump. That jumped to 45% for voters over 60, suggesting a polarisation on issues between generations. \nOn Monday night, Poilievre remarked on demographic breakthroughs Conservative had made, including with younger Canadians.  \n\"We gave voices to countless people across the country who've been left out and left behind for far too long,\" he said. \nIn this election, the smaller political parties have taken a hit as Canadians choose to park their votes with either the Liberals or the Conservatives - especially the left-wing New Democrats, or NDP. \nSome of the smaller parties have lost a significant amount of vote share - particularly the NDP who have received just 6% of votes counted across Canada so far, compared with 18% in 2021. \nJagmeet Singh, who has been NDP leader for almost eight years, lost his own riding in British Columbia and announced he will step down. \n\"Obviously I know this night is a disappointing night for New Democrats,\" he said, adding: \"We're only defeated if we stop fighting.\"\nThe Greens have also seen their vote share cut in half from 2% to 1%.\nShachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute, a non-profit public opinion research organisation, told the BBC that Trump's rhetoric was behind the shift to the Liberals.  \n\"The threats, the annexation talk, all of that has been a huge motivator for left of centre voters,\" she said.\nThe sovereigntist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois have maintained a vote share of around 7%. They are on track to win 23 seats in Quebec. \nThis is based on around 97% of polls reporting.\nCanada doesn't have a two-party system, even though it has historically voted in conservative or liberal governments in some form.\nIn the country's political system, these smaller parties still play a role in Parliament. Both the NDP and the Bloc have at some points formed Official Opposition in the House of Commons.",

Only three had \"good\" plans and policies in place for the future.\nThese are mostly unchanged from the CCC's last report in 2023.\nHealth is one of the areas that remains most poorly prepared.\nThe CCC points to the rising number of deaths linked to extreme heat and hospitals themselves being vulnerable to hot weather.\nBaroness Brown highlights the case of Guy's and St Thomas', the biggest hospital trust in London, which was hit by a failure to its data centres during the extreme heat of July 2022.\nThis meant it was unable to operate its appointments system at a time of intense demand, and it had to move to paper appointments.\n\"We lost thousands of crucial appointments for people for critical tests,\" she said.\n\"We're trying to improve the NHS. Unless we take into account that it has to be resilient to the climate, we're going backwards.\"\nFlooding is another challenging area. Plans and policies to ensure places are resilient to river and coastal flooding are found to have worsened since the CCC's previous report.\nThe ancient town of Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire is a case in point. It's been flooded repeatedly in the last four years, most recently in November 2024.\nPolly Pearce described how her charity shop flooded.\n\"It was so quick...  [like] a tsunami,\" she said.\n\"[The water] came up as high as the panelling right up on the wall... we had all our Christmas stuff ready but lost it.\"\nThe main street is studded with empty shops, many reportedly put out of business by the cost of repeated floods. \nShop owners say insurance companies either won't insure their properties or that the premiums are now so high many shop keepers say they simply can't afford it.\nAnd the Environment Agency has said it can't afford the \u00a325m-\u00a330m cost of flood protection for the town. \nThe government says it is committed to helping residents, however, and that work to improve the flood resilience of properties will begin in the summer.\nThe CCC notes progress in some other areas of climate adaptation, such as plans to identify risks to businesses and financial institutions.\nAt the heart of these discussions is the question of cost.\nBut putting off efforts to prepare the UK for the changing climate in an attempt to save cash would be \"a huge mistake\" and could increase economic damage in the long run, Baroness Brown said.\n\"We are very worried about their spending review,\" she added, in an unusually strong plea from the Committee.\n\"This is not a tomorrow problem; it's a today problem. If we don't address it today, it becomes a disaster tomorrow.\"\nA freedom of information request submitted by the BBC found there are just 18 members of staff working fully on climate adaptation at the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra).\nThat's just 0.3% of Defra's nearly 6,600 full-time-equivalent core staff.\nDefra said some of these employees also worked on climate adaptation part-time, and the figures don't include those working in other parts of government.\n\nAdditional reporting by Miho Tanaka\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

You can probably guess what he is like...\"\nA lot of people have been asking. Because a lot of people have been watching.\nIt is not just what Pollock has done in the past 12 months - winning the Under-20 World Cup, scoring two tries on his senior England debut, being nominated for the Champions Cup player of the year, preparing to line up against Leinster in Saturday's semi-final and butting into the Lions selection conversation.\nIt is the way he has done it.\nThe 20-year-old back row has swagger and self-possession, and a side order of skulduggery.\nThere has been no dutiful trade-learning and spur-earning.\nInstead, just prodigious talent, Tigger-ish energy, galloping pace and a presumption that the world is his for the taking.\nIt gets people talking. And has done for a while.\nEighteen months ago a video circulated among Bedford's players.\nThey had been told that Pollock, then only 18, was joining them in the Championship on loan.\n\"He came with a little bit of a reputation as he was very well thought of by Saints' academy,\" says Bedford's Alex Woolford.\n\"This viral clip of him did the rounds among us. He was being interviewed after an England Under-18 win over South Africa and swore three times in about 10 seconds.\n\"We knew he was going to be very enthusiastic.\"\nHe was.\n\"We were pretty poor in the first half against Ampthill,\" adds Woolford, remembering Pollock's first start.\n\"Henry tried to give us the hairdryer treatment. He was effing and blinding and telling us we were not good enough and I remember thinking 'bloody hell, what is this kid doing?'\n\"But you have to give him credit.\n\"In rugby environments it is very easy to get confidence confused with arrogance. For all the stick he gets, I don't actually think he is an arrogant person.\"\nPollock spent part of the 2023-24 season on loan at Championship side Bedford\nStill, that perception persists.\nFreeman and Woolford say Pollock is a different, calmer character off the pitch, and his Northampton team-mates assured the rest of the England camp that the incoming youngster wasn't the \"idiot\" they were expecting., external \nTheir PR work was duly undermined by Pollock gleefully ripping the ball from Ollie Chessum when tasked with holding a tackle shield in an early training drill.\n\"Probably some of the boys were quite shocked with how I was when I first joined up with England,\" Pollock told BBC's Rugby Union Weekly.\n\"But I guess over time they realised this is just him.\n\"I am quite loud, someone that just brings a different type of energy to other types of players. Whether that is good or bad energy depends who you are talking to.\"\nPollock scored two tries when he made his senior England debut off the bench against Wales in Cardiff in March\nThere are plenty of fans.\nAt Franklin's Gardens kids wear his distinctive black head tape and make cardboard signs asking for Pollock's boots.\nThey love his celebrations. A basketball-style finger-roll lob in the direction of a beaten defender against Castres and an extravagant swallow dive against Bristol were two recent efforts. \nThey love his cunning. Pollock cheekily pulling the sock of Wales prop Gareth Thomas to milk a penalty gained social media traction during the Six Nations.\nAnd they love his abrasive style as he goes nose-to-nose with the opposition, raising tempers and the stakes.\n\"I want to entertain and get the crowd as close as possible to the team,\" he told BBC Radio Northampton's Saints Show.\n\"When I was growing up there, there was a lack of a idols. There were one or two that stick in my mind - Courtney Lawes, Michael Hooper, Richie McCaw - but not many.\n\"For this game to grow and this sport to get bigger, we need more characters, more players the fans want to come and watch.\n\"If you look to the football world, fans very much have their players and the personalities they like.\"\nThis video can not be played\nPollock ruffling feathers!\nPollock is harder to warm to when you are up against him.\nWoolford, Pollock's Bedford team-mate, also faced him in the Blues' annual pre-season fixture against Saints.\n\"On the pitch he is very loud, very confrontational, very in-your-face,\" Woolford remembers.\n\"He just exhausts you, as much mentally and emotionally as physically. But he has backed it up at every level he has stepped up to.\"\nIn the teams' most recent match, one Bedford player attempted to sledge back at Pollock, suggesting he would be back with the Blues on loan by October.\nInstead, by then, Pollock was a Premiership regular.\n\"Being annoying is part of my game,\" Pollock agrees.\n\"I want to wind the opposition up; I want to get under their skin. It is something I relish.\"\nThis weekend he will be digging into Leinster in a re-run of last season's Champions Cup semi-final.\nThe Irish giants could field back-row trio Caelan Doris, Josh van der Flier and Jack Conan.\n\"It is probably one of the best back rows there is,\" says Pollock. \"I am just excited to be able to say I played against them. To share the field with them is special.\"\nBut the deference won't last past the first whistle.\n\"They are beatable,\" he adds. \"We definitely see parts of their game we can attack and go after and hopefully ruffle a few feathers.\"\nIf Pollock's streak of success extends to the Aviva Stadium and his final and toughest Lions audition, he could well make the squad cut five days later.\n\"I have heard the rumours and stuff, but as a player you can't control that,\" he says.\n\"I just have to keep playing well, and if it happens, it happens.\"\nSo far in his career, things invariably do.\nPollock played in England A's win over an Australia second string at the start of this season before being promoted into the senior side",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nVitor Pereira - I want to build something stronger with Wolves\nVitor Pereira walks up the stairs of a pub in Shropshire, sits and puts his pint down. \n\"I'm in a good mood today, the weather is good, more beer, please,\" jokes the Wolves head coach, who adds that he enjoys a pint of Stella.\nPereira is holding court at a round table upstairs in a country pub just outside Wolverhampton, five months into his reign at Molineux. \nThis is not some gimmick he has done before at other clubs. The relationship with media in other countries - Pereira has worked in Portugal, Brazil, Greece, Turkey, Saudi and China - is very different. \nBut if interviewing a Premier League manager in a pub sounds both highly unusual and also a throwback to the 1980s, the setting makes more sense given the 56-year-old's habit of celebrating wins by \"being with the people\".\n\"First the points, then the pints\" was a phrase coined by Pereira which has transferred to the stands, with the words now adorning a banner at Molineux. \nIt came as Wolves battled the drop, but a run of six straight wins, their best in the top flight for 55 years, has the club now safely mid-table in the Premier League. \nPereira has endeared himself to Wolves supporters, and the city, with his desire to understand them and the area. \nTrips to the local Wetherspoons near the train station after victories have become a fixture - with Molineux serenading him with 'We'll see you in 'Spoons' during Saturday's 3-0 win over Leicester.\n\"What do we do in Wolverhampton after a game? If I lose the game I stay home and drink my beer alone. If I win the game, I go with the supporters to celebrate,\"  Pereira tells BBC Sport.\n\"The connection with the people is stronger when we suffer together and, when you are in a situation where you are fighting for survival, you feel this connection.\n\"In the moments we are suffering, you feel we are suffering together. In the moments of celebration, you need to be with them.\n\"In Wolverhampton, where do you want me to go? I must go to a pub, because this is the culture and where people go.\n\"When I go to a pub it's not about the beer. Of course I like the beer but I go to be with the people, to feel that I'm doing something to make them happy, to make them proud.\n\"Work, home, then we go to a pub just for a beer or two beers and finish. This is our life.\"\nThis video can not be played\nDo Wolves have money to spend this summer?\nWatch The Football News Show on BBC iPlayer\nVisit all of BBC Sport's Wolves content\nThe down-to-earth philosophy comes from Pereira's upbringing.\nGrowing up on the coast in Espinho, 10 miles south of Porto, he recalls the harsh conditions he endured which have shaped him. \n\"It was a very humble village with fishermen and we grew up on the street,\" he said. \n\"Fighting together, fighting for the space. Competing and fighting. But this is what I have inside of me. This is the power.\n\"My house was 50 metres from the beach. At the time my father didn't have money so we lived in a 'basement'.\n\"The sea, in the winter, came strong, without barriers. Every winter, for three months, there was water inside. We had to rebuild the house. Every time there was water in the walls and a bad smell. I felt ashamed because my clothes smelled.\n\"You felt wet every time, that was our life.\n\"[Yet] I was a very happy teenager at the time because in this kind of community we have the confident guys together. When I look back, this power I feel inside of me came from this time.\"\nWolves have adopted Vitor Pereira's phrase after his success at Molineux \nHis playing career, Pereira readily admits, was underwhelming. He played as a midfielder for lesser-known Portuguese clubs Avanca, Oliveirense, Esmoriz, Estarreja, Fiaes and Sao Joao de Ver and retired at 28. \nYet it was enough to help put him through a sports course at the University of Porto, as he finished second in his class while completing his coaching qualifications. \n\"I had a career, it was in the third division in Portugal but I got the money to do my course, to go to the university, to buy my car, to buy my clothes,\" he said. \n\"Since I was 16 years-old, I never asked for one euro from my parents. After 16, small jobs, to get money, to go to the discos.\n\"On Saturdays, I was a lifeguard on the beach. They paid me a lot of money. I saw the sun and I saved people.\n\"I was 18 and 19 at that time - no worries. I went to the university. I did some small jobs to get some money and I started to save. I'm now 56. But my sons will spend the money, don't worry!\"\nHis three sons are all in their 20s and Pereira, who always felt being a coach was his calling, does not want - or expect - them to follow him into football. \n\"The sacrifices you have to make. I don't want this life for my sons,\" he says. \n\"They cannot have a family life in this job. It's impossible. We have a lot of moments where we suffer a lot and alone. I think we are always in a pre-depression.\n\"For me, the competition is like a drug. Passion and a drug. I cannot live without it because after one month I start to be nervous. I cannot enjoy nothing.\"\nPereira met BBC Sport and other journalists in a local pub for an on-record interview\n\"I want to recharge with their energy\" - Pereira celebrates with Wolves fans after beating Manchester United\nIt is clear Pereira misses his family, having travelled the globe since he started managing Padroense juniors in 2003. \nHe eventually became Porto assistant, to Andre Villas-Boas, and was in that role when they won the Europa League in 2011, replacing Villas-Boas when he moved to Chelsea.\nHis first game was against Pep Guardiola's Barcelona in the Super Cup, a 2-0 defeat,  but he won successive Primeira Liga titles before joining Al-Ahli and then Olympiacos, lifting the Greek Super League.\nSpells at 1860 Munich, Shanghai, Fenerbahce, Corinthians, Flamengo and Al Shabab followed before he joined Wolves, yet the intensity of management is not something which bothers him. \nHe said: \"I cannot speak about this because I don't want to cry, I have moments in my life. When I arrived in Brazil, I went to Corinthians. If you see the stadium of Corinthians and Flamengo, they have millions of supporters.\n\"When I met the press they ask me, 'Vitor, you don't feel the pressure?'. I'll tell you about the pressure. The pressure was when my father had cancer, my brother was dying, my mother was crying.\n\"When we deal with this, football is football. I don't feel any pressure, nothing. Zero. believe me.\"\nWolves go to Manchester City on Friday without pressure - after their 1-0 win at Manchester United in April that sealed survival with five games remaining.\nThere will be change in the summer after this season's brush with relegation. Matheus Cunha is expected to leave, with Manchester United interested, and the Brazil forward, who has scored 15 goals, has a \u00a362.5m release clause. \nPereira insists he cannot second-guess what will happen with Cunha, but that he will \"wish him the best\" either way. He says the 25-year-old has not directly told him he wants to leave, but is adamant he needs the power to shape the squad. \nMany will feel he has earned it. \nOnly champions Liverpool and Newcastle have won more games than Pereira's 10 in his 18 matches since he replaced Gary O'Neil in December - while Wolves have won more points than relegated trio of Ipswich, Leicester and Southampton combined in that same period.\nWolves were second bottom and five points adrift of the Foxes when he took over, they are now 23 ahead and 13th. Pereira will not need to buy another drink in Wolverhampton. \n\"Every time, I think I can do better and better and better because I just expressed half of myself,\" he adds. \n\"I have a lot to prove. If I'm in the right place to challenge me, I can do magic. Believe me.\"\n'A talent that comes along every 50 years' - 'genius' Yamal steals show\nEx-West Ham boss Lopetegui named Qatar manager",

Here are the director's favourite cocktail spots, from Capri to Burbank.\nThe Specialist\n(Credit: Ryan Silver)\nPaul Feig is the award-winning director of Bridesmaids, Last Christmas, A Simple Favor and The Heat, as well as the creator of the beloved television series Freaks and Geeks. He is the author of Cocktail Time! The Ultimate Guide to Grown-Up Fun (2022).\nPaul Feig \u2013 the perennially well-dressed director of Bridesmaids (2011) and A Simple Favor (2018) \u2013 has become almost as well-known for his love of cocktails as he is for his films.\n\"Try to find one of my movies where somebody's not drinking a martini,\" he jokes.\nThe BBC caught up with Feig as he prepared for the launch of Another Simple Favor, premiering 1 May on Amazon Prime Video. The film sees the return of Blake Lively's murderous, martini-swilling Emily and Anna Kendrick's prim Stephanie for more sensual backstabbing \u2013 this time against the opulent backdrop of Capri's Grand Hotel Quisisana.\nNot so incidentally, the Grand Hotel Quisisana is also home to one of Feig's favourite cocktail bars.\nBut for Feig, beautiful cocktails are more than a silent film character; they are the \"greatest perks\" of the adult world.\n\"I didn't like the power dynamics of being a kid,\" explains Feig. \"I've always been obsessed with the culture of cocktails; the look of cocktails, the glassware, the mixology. It is all, to me, so beautiful.\"\nFeig believes that cocktails should always be a special moment, even if partaking at home. \"You should be wearing the right thing and have the right glass,\" he says. \"So much stuff in our culture now is for kids or trying to stay young which is fine. But being an adult is awesome. It's got its hard parts. That's why you need cocktails.\"\nAnd when he's jet-setting, Feig keeps the special occasion going, seeking out the world's top cocktail bars.\n\"I do a little research,\" he says. \"I always want to find the nicest one. I have an obsession with hotel bars... but I'll do my research and ask people; find out what they recommend as far as what I'm looking for.\"\nAnd Feig is looking for something specific.\u00a0\n\"It has to be very beautiful,\" he says. \"Beautiful wood and beautiful appointments; the way they display the bottles; bartenders who are absolute professionals. I look for a good aesthetic experience with knowledgeable bartenders.\"\u00a0\nHaving an adult-style tipple, he notes, can also get you a front-row seat to a new city's culture. \"Having a drink definitely tends to loosen me up,\" he says. \"I think it connects you with the group of people that might lead you to other things that you are looking for; nice restaurants and cool places to shop. I love finding the cool places to shop. I love all that stuff.\"\nHere are Feig's favourite very beautiful, very grown-up cocktail bars around the world.\nFeig's favourite cocktail on-and-off screen is forever the martini \u2013 so he holds his bartenders to a high standard. \"Honestly, I'm very prejudiced about that,\" he admits. \"If they go 'gin or vodka?' I'm always, like, 'I said a martini, I didn't say a vodka martini.' It's so fluid now with people having vodka or gin martinis. But I'm a purist. I do hold that against a bartender occasionally.\"\nA not-so-simple occasion\n\"There's a pageantry to it, or there should be, you know,\" says Feig. \"My one rule is: never drink out of plastic. I refuse. If I go to some event and they have wine and it's in a plastic cup, I'm like, 'No, I'll just wait.' Then you're just drinking to get drunk, and that holds no appeal to me whatsoever.\"\nBut Feig never has cause to judge when he visits the historic DUKES Bar, located in London's upscale St James's neighbourhood.\n\"It's a very small bar. It looks like grandma's living room,\" he says of the cosy space outfitted with heavy club chairs; opened in 1908. \"I wouldn't be surprised to see people from Parliament walk in there. It's got that vibe. They have a dress code, which I love. And it's where Ian Fleming discovered the martini, supposedly. So, it's got a little James Bond DNA on top of it.\"\nFor Feig, what truly makes the DUKES experience is the personable and highly knowledgeable staff \u2013 led by Alessandro Palazzi, who Feig calls his \"cocktail hero\" and a \"really close friend\".\u00a0\n\"What they specialise in is martinis that don't touch ice, so they're the coldest martinis you can get,\" says Feig. \"They bring out the frozen glasses, the frozen bottle of gin. They take vermouth \u2013 which is not frozen \u2013 but they put it into the glass, swirl it around just to coat the edges, and then they dump it out on the floor, so you just have the very thin coat. Then right from the frozen bottle, they pour in the gin. So it's freezing cold; there's no excuse for [a] martini that's not ice-cold.\"\nFeig notes that because the martini never touches ice, it's undiluted: \"They limit you to two, because you'll pass out if you go beyond that.\" Feig also applauds Palazzi's \"great\" vespers and \"amazing\" Manhattans. \"You can get whatever you want, but that is the temple of the martini.\"\nWebsite: www.dukeshotel.com/dukesbar.html\nAddress: 35 St James's Pl, London SW1A 1NY\nPhone: +442074914840\nInstagram: @dukeslondon\nThe Grand Hotel Quisisana is located on the island of Capri, which Feig and his wife, Laurie, have visited \"religiously\" once a year for the past 30 years. \"Capri is my favourite place in the world,\" says Feig. \"Even when we're not staying at the Quisisana, we go there for drinks because I love the bar inside.\"\nBuilt in 1845, the Grand Hotel Quisisana sits at the start of the bougainvillea-draped, luxury-boutique-lined Via Camerelle, catching the tourist overflow from Piazza Umberto I. The hotel's marble lobby leads to opulent, Vietri-tiled guestrooms. Just past the lobby is Quisi Bar, which serves all manners of apertifs, and whose splendid street-level terrace has entertained royalty, politicians and artistic luminaries from Oscar Wilde to Jackie Kennedy.\n\"The best part is sitting out front, especially on that patio,\" says Feig. \"Everything in Capri comes past there.\u2026\u00a0 and you will people watch. It's just magical. You become a real Caprese local when you're sitting up there.\"\nWhen in Capri, Feig \u2013 who built hotel rooms on the set of Another Simple Favor to resemble those at the Quisisana \u2013\u00a0veers from his usual martinis and opts for a spritz; Aperol or limoncello. And he particularly enjoys the Italian custom of the early evening aperitivo, where bar snacks like olives, finger sandwiches and crisps are served along with the drinks.\u00a0\n\"It's, like, 'oh, here \u2013 eat!',\u201d says Feig. \"I wrote in my cocktail book, 'Should you serve food at your cocktail party?' And yes, unless you're a monster, don't serve people cocktails with no food! It's that Italian ethos.\"\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.quisisana.com/s\nAddress: Via Camerelle, 2, 80073 Capri NA\nPhone: +390818370788\nInstagram: @quisisanacapri/\nWhen not travelling the globe for work (and martinis), Feig is often in New York City where he has a residence on the Upper East Side \u2013 and firm favourite neighbourhood cocktail joints.\n\"Bemelmans [Bar] is an institution,\" he says, \"It's in the Carlyle Hotel, which is one of the most famous hotels of opulence [in] the Upper East Side in New York.\"\nBemelmans, originally opened in 1947 and beloved for its Art Deco decor, epitomises \"old\" New York for Feig. \"I love history. I love old bars,\" he says. \"The wall's been painted by [Austrian American writer Ludwig] Bemelmans. He did all the artwork for [the children\u2019s book series] Madeline. Back in the day, he painted all the walls with his cartoons, and so that gives it this real New York history.\"\nLike Feig, visitors to the bar will find themselves transported by the childlike murals on the walls \u2013 uplit against mahogany tables and rich leather tufted booths \u2013 as they enjoy elegant cocktails and live jazz.\nBut how's their martini?\n\"They make great martinis there with a side car, which I love,\" says Feig. \"There's a whole thing going on now in martini culture of bartenders coming over when you're halfway through a martini and bringing out a new cold, frozen glass and transferring what's left of your martini, which I think is so brilliant. Why don't we do that all the time?\"\nFeig is also a fan of the Bemelmans' waitstaff. \"I've befriended many because I've been going there for so many years,\" he says. \"It always was hard to get in. But then there was a period about two years ago where a lot of young influencers discovered it and then it went nuts. But I've been coming there so long I kind of go, 'Hey. It's me.'\"\n\"It's New York to me; the best of old New York,\" he adds. \"It's one of those places where you feel like you've walked into a New Yorker cartoon, basically.\"\nWebsite:\u00a0https://www.rosewoodhotels.com/en/the-carlyle-new-york/dining/bemelmans-bar\nAddress: 35 E 76th St, New York, NY 10021\nPhone: +12127441600\nInstagram: @rosewoodthecarlyle/\n\"Oh, I love The Polo Bar so much,\" says Feig fondly. \"It's new old New York.\"\nThe eponymous cocktail bar helmed by fashion designer and philanthropist Ralph Lauren is on New York City's East 55th Street just off Fifth Avenue, one of Manhattan's swankiest shopping streets. \"It's got the Ralph aesthetic,\" says Feig. \"It's all wood and mirrors and paintings everywhere, and leather. And then, if you go up the stairs in the back, there's a parlour where you can sit in front of a fireplace, and there's a bunch of tables in there to have cocktails.\"\u00a0\nAt The Polo Bar, the bar staff prepares a stirred martini.\u00a0\n\"Unless you ask them to shake it,\" notes Feig. \"I'm a personal fan of stirred martinis, because so many bartenders pride themselves on shaking a martini to death, which is the worst way to do a martini, as far as I'm concerned, because it just clouds it up with ice chips. The glassware is all Ralph Lauren glassware, so if you order an old fashioned or whiskey, it comes in a beautiful old fashioned Ralph Lauren glass with the polo horses on the front. Even the stirrers are little polo mallets. The attention to detail is so spot on, and the way that the bottles are displayed; they're uplit from beneath, so they glow.\"\u00a0\nAnd after enjoying perfectly stirred martinis, guests can retire downstairs to The Polo Bar Restaurant. \"The food is fantastic,\" says Feig. \"It's all very American food. They make an amazing hamburger, but it's served so beautifully. But the cocktail bar really is the linchpin of the whole thing. It's all very mature and very aesthetically fantastic.\"\u00a0\nWebsite: www.ralphlauren.com/global-polo-bar\nAddress: 1 E 55th St, New York, NY 10022\nPhone: +12122078562\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/poloralphlauren/\nBurbank, California, is Feig's other hometown in the United States \u2013 and it's also home to Smoke House, a restaurant and bar for which Feig's love has been well-documented.\n\"Smoke House is quintessential Americana,\" says Feig. \"I have a love of dark wood and red leather, which is what bars used to be in America for a long time. In Europe where you drink, there's windows and there's light. In America, you drink in the dark. I think it's our American puritanism.\"\nFor Feig, the Smoke House's moody interiors evoke the glamorous heyday of the Rat Pack: \"Frank Sinatra and Vegas\u2026 everybody's cool, everybody's in tuxedos and suits and gowns. The Smoke House is a time capsule of what that was.\"\nBut Feig notes that for all the bar's celebrity cache \u2013 it's located across the street from Warner Brothers, Universal and Disney Studios \u2013 he loves that the crowd is surprisingly down-to-earth. \"It's got a very populist crowd in there,\" he says. \"So it's got this great vibe of being old timey, but also very welcoming and not exclusive, which is lovely.\"\nThe bar area hosts live music the second half of the week and visitors can enjoy the restaurant's famous garlic bread and hot wings. \"I'm a buffalo wing fanatic. They've got great ones there,\" says Feig. Most importantly, they serve a \"great\" martini: \"They have really good bartenders who, if you ask for a dry martini, they know how to make a dry martini.\"\n\"It's just fun,\" adds Feig. \"It's really not pretentious but brings along the old-fashioned fun of adulthood.\"\nWebsite: www.smokehouse1946.com/\nAddress: 4420 Lakeside Dr, Burbank, CA 91505\nPhone: +18188453731\nInstagram: @smokehouse1946/\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Shahida's face crumpled with grief every time she thought about the choice in front of her: Stay for love or go back to her siblings?\nShahida Adrees, now 61, moved to India from Pakistan in 2002, when she married her maternal cousin Adrees Khan, a resident of Punjab state (marriage between cousins is practised in some communities in South Asia).\nThe couple lived a peaceful, predictable life - Khan working as a driver and Shahida looking after their home and child.\nEvery few years, Shahida, who is staying in India on a long-term visa, would obtain a travel permit and make a trip to Pakistan to meet her family.\nBut that sense of routine was shattered last week when India suspended almost all visas for Pakistani citizens as part of its response to the brutal attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 people. Pakistan, which denies any involvement, has hit back with tit-for-tat measures and also cancelled most visas for Indians.\nWhen Shahida heard the news, she knew what it meant; she could either go back to her siblings and other family members in Pakistan now, or stay and risk never seeing them again.\nShe chose to stay. Earlier this week, she cancelled her plans of going to Pakistan to see an ailing aunt. \"If I had gone, I wouldn't have been let back into India. But now that I am here, I don't know if I'll ever see my brothers and sisters again,\" she says.\nShahida's family is among hundreds in India and Pakistan who, with members on both sides of the borders, now face the risk of separation.\nDespite neighbours India and Pakistan sharing a hostile relationship, love stories and marriages between its citizens are not uncommon. That's because of the deeply intertwined cultural history of the countries which were partitioned along religious lines in 1947, forcing millions to leave their homes and migrate to the other side.\nThe border between the nations runs not just through the ground, but also through families - many Indians have relatives and their hometowns in Pakistan, and vice versa.\nSome, like Shahida's family, have tried to stay in touch with their roots through marriages with relatives across the border. In recent years, many couples have also met online, often overcoming insurmountable odds to stay together. \nMany of them apply for long-term visas that need to be renewed periodically while others apply for citizenship of the respective countries - but the process can take years.\nThis week, as the visa restrictions took effect, heart-breaking visuals of people - young and old couples, desperate sons and daughters, and elderly parents - pleading with authorities for help were splashed across television screens and on social media.\nThe BBC has contacted the Indian foreign ministry for comment. \n\"I came here with my mother. Now they are asking us to leave without her. How can I do that?\" mumbled a tearful Mohammed Ayat, 17.\nA Pakistani national, Ayat came to India last month to meet his maternal relatives. His mother is an Indian citizen who was living in Pakistan on a visa that is pending renewal.\nBut even as her children returned to Pakistan, she had to stay in India as she wasn't sure whether she would be allowed into the country.\n\"They can punish them [the militants], but what is our fault?\" Ayat told ANI news agency.\nThe exact number of people leaving both countries due to the latest tensions is not clear - but is estimated to run into hundreds. \nSitting in a bus that was taking her to the Attari-Wagah border, Parveen (who uses only one name), told reporters that she had lived in India for 41 years.\n\"I have no mother, brothers or sisters in Pakistan. I have nowhere to go there. I am completely helpless,\" she said.\nFamilies say the abruptness of the visa suspensions and the resulting chaos have left them feeling uncertain.\nThe restrictions imposed by Delhi exempt those like Shahida, who have been living in India on a long-term visa which needs to be renewed every few years. Valid for up to five years, these visas are given to women of Pakistani and Bangladeshi nationalities who are married to Indian citizens. \nUnder Indian rules, all long-term visa holders are allowed to visit their home country after obtaining a second permit, called the No Objection to Return to India (NORI) visa.\nBut in the days following the attack, there have been reports of NORI visa holders also being stopped from crossing the border into India, as officials waited for clarity.\nShahida says that in her case, Indian authorities have assured her that NORI visa-holders would be exempted from the restrictions. \nBut she is not willing to take the risk of leaving India.\nShe wondered if things would've been better if she had got an Indian citizenship.\n\"I did apply for it in 2009, but the file never moved.

        "article_text": "A new Apple TV+ series explores the life of the so-called \"King of Chefs and the Chef of Kings\" \u2013 shown as a wild enfant terrible in post-Revolutionary France who blazed a trail for future generations of cooks.\nIt's described as \"the story of the first celebrity chef\". The French language series Car\u00eame is a dramatisation of the life of Antonin Car\u00eame, who was born into poverty in pre-Revolutionary Paris around 1784. His talent would make him chef for the French diplomat Charles Talleyrand, the Emperor Napoleon, the future George IV of Britain, Tsar Alexander of Russia and the Baron de Rothschild. He also wrote celebrated cookbooks and introduced the Toque (the tall chef's hat), still in use today \u2013 giving birth to the very idea of the \"celebrity\" chef.\nIndeed, Benjamin Voisin, the actor playing Antonin Car\u00eame, believes that if the chef had been working in the 2020s, \"he'd have been the one with 100 million views on TikTok. That would be the equivalent of what he did at the time,\" he tells the BBC.\nAnd Voisin's portrayal of Car\u00eame feels modern; he plays him with a touch of the rock star as well as kitchen chef. He wears an earring, his clothes seem to owe more to the 1980s New Romantic movement than 19th-Century costume, and from his affairs with women to his lack of deference to his so-called superiors, he is what could be described (in French) as an enfant terrible. He is also confident, brash and authoritative in his kitchen \u2013 a manner that echoes 21st-Century celebrity chefs such as Gordon Ramsay.\u00a0\nThe series is inspired by a biography of Car\u00eame and his gastronomy by Ian Kelly, who also co-created the series with screenwriter Davide Serino. The historical figure of the young chef is actually described by Kelly in his book as a \"bookish innocent\" when he takes his first job, but Voisin's look in the series isn't too far from Kelly's description of Car\u00eame aged 25: \"He was handsome, his hair cut and tousled forward in the fashionably Byronic manner... he was described as slight, and a slight eater.\" Kelly also describes Car\u00eame as \"ambitious, solipsistic, even narcissistic\" as a person \u2013 although the Car\u00eame on screen risks much for those he loves.\nIndeed, perhaps inevitably, the series takes various liberties with the truth, also depicting Car\u00eame as a spy for his powerful masters, something there's no historical evidence for. The show's lead director Martin Bourboulon describes the added drama as \"the charm of fiction in the show\". The reality is that the real man didn't leave much information behind. As Kelly says in his biography, \"He [Car\u00eame] would disclose the minutiae of his professional life\u2026 and the menus, guests and ingredients that made up his working days. But about his personal life he revealed nothing.\"\nWhat is true to the era is the depiction of the aristocratic kitchens he worked in, his small army of staff, and their fevered preparations for royal banquets. He's seen in the series organising a meal for Napoleon Bonaparte, and in real life he was responsible for the Emperor's wedding cake. Car\u00eame's ability to sugar-sculpt led to extraordinary creations in the shape of classical lyres and Venetian gondolas, all carefully sketched out on paper first by the chef himself. But that wasn't all he was capable of, according to Paul Freedman, Professor of History at Yale University.\n\"He helped establish a routine for how kitchens were run,\" Freedman tells the BBC. \"He also defined dishes and the repertoire of sauces, what was considered to go with what food, what kind of garnishes would be standard, and the kind of multi-course dining that would come to be characteristic [of haute cuisine]. And as his original metier was confectionery and sugar sculpting, even having a centrepiece of sculpted food is owed to Car\u00eame.\"\u00a0\nWhile some of the real-life recipes in his cookbooks still sound mouthwatering (Kelly mentions an orange flower and pink champagne jelly), others, such as a stuffed boar's head, might seem strange to today. But Bourboulon says that, above all, he wanted to make the chef himself accessible to a modern audience.\nBourboulon, responsible for two successful film adaptations of Alexandre Dumas's historical novel The Three Musketeers, tells the BBC that he wanted to avoid \"the usual period drama style\" in this story.\n\"I really wanted to bring a bit of sexiness, rock 'n' roll attitude, and a modern twist for all the main characters, especially Car\u00eame,\" he says. \"And Benjamin Voisin is like this in real life.\"\nVoisin says their idea of the chef was that he had \"a Mick Jagger aspect to him. It's really what attracted me\".\n\"I love looking to the historical story of Car\u00eame, but this rock star element, that kind of Lenny Kravitz look he has, plus the idea the show gives about his attitude to life, is really important. Maybe that's why Martin came to me to talk about playing him. I also love the story of this young man trying to find his place in society.\"\nThe historical Car\u00eame's stellar career might well have given him a swagger; he was known as \"the King of Chefs and the Chef of Kings\". He's often credited as\u00a0a founder of French gastronomy and of\u00a0Grande Cuisine\u00a0(classic French cuisine which was at its most lavish during the 19th Century).\nHowever, according to\u00a0Paul Freedman, Professor of History at Yale University, he might not even be France's first celebrity chef. The Frenchman\u00a0Guillaume Tirel, known as \"Taillevent\", is famous for cooking for French kings during his lifetime (1310-95), and wrote a cookbook that still survives, The Viandier. Several\u00a0restaurants\u00a0still bear his name.\u00a0\nCar\u00eame's status is, he says, \"a celebrity chef of modern Europe, but still almost the last of a kind. He lived still in the time of the courts and chefs finding aristocratic patrons. He doesn't have a restaurant or interact with ordinary people, [and] his tremendous number of cookbooks aren't directed towards amateurs, but towards other chefs.\n\"So he's a transitional point to the purely modern celebrity chef, who are celebrities in the sense of media exposure, their television presence or just their ability to be a character and to run a restaurant.\"\nThe young Car\u00eame's turnaround in life was remarkable. Historian Ian Kelly describes him in his biography, Car\u00eame: The First Celebrity Chef (which inspired the series) as one of multiple children in a family from one of Paris's worst slums. By 1792, around the same time that\u00a0 the \"Reign of Terror\" would begin in the French Revolution (a period of state-sanctioned violence and executions) he had been abandoned by his parents but was taken in by a cook, and then apprenticed to a notable p\u00e2tissier, Sylvain Bailly. While still a very young man, he was hired by one of the most famous politicians of the Napoleonic era: Prince Charles Maurice Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord, known as Talleyrand.\nEven if the real Car\u00eame didn't dabble in espionage, Bourboulon points out that the chef's culinary brilliance would have been exploited as a display of power by his employers, and that food would have been as much a part of diplomacy during the early 19th Century as the modern state banquet is now.\n\"We know that Car\u00eame worked for Prince of Talleyrand and for Napoleon,\" he tells the BBC. \"It's so French to share the menu, the food, and use the quality of the food to help diplomatic relationships, and historically, they really did do this. There's an example at the end of the first episode, when Car\u00eame brings in a dessert for Napoleon and an English diplomat seated at the same table. And it's exactly how we imagine it would have been done during that time.\"\nPolitics isn't the only display of passion in the narrative either, or as Bourboulon says, \"Love is as important in the lives of French people, possibly more so\". The visuals directly link the food Car\u00eame cooks with sensuality; the camera lingers over the dishes, while red fruit drips over the title sequence. The series even starts with Car\u00eame licking cream off his love interest Henriette, played by Lyna Khoudri.\u00a0\n\"The parallel between the two types of pleasure is there in the series,\" Voisin says. \"Hands are involved in both cooking and the pleasures of the flesh, that's the connection.\"\nThe link between French food and sensuality are linked was certainly there in Car\u00eame's Paris. Ian Kelly describes how the post-Revolution capital \"had become the City of Light \u2013 and the capital of food\". The talk around the young Car\u00eame, he says, would have been \"of philosophy, fashion, food and sex: what the world has come to expect from Paris\".\nCar\u00eame's fame grew across Europe because of his celebrity clientele, but he also benefited from France's growing interest in gastronomy as culture (he was also a contemporary of gourmet Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, celebrated for writing about the art of eating) and the idea that French cuisine was superior because of the sensuality of its people, Paul Freedman says.\n\"I think it goes back to the image that France continues to have today as pleasure-loving, as sophisticated, not merely gorging themselves or getting drunk, but [possessed of] a kind of sensuality that is cultivated in the sense it's tasteful and distinguished,\" he tells the BBC.\nA French chef, he explains, would become necessary as a status symbol for many aristocrats of the 19th and 20th Century. \"One of the biggest examples in literature is PG Wodehouse writing about one of Bertie Wooster's aunts, Dahlia, living in terror that her temperamental French chef, Anatole, would quit.\"\nThe era of the celebrity restaurant chef was ushered in by Car\u00eame's growing fame, and the cookbooks he wrote, according to Professor Nathalie Cooke, the author of Tastes and Traditions: A Journey Through Menu History. Before the French Revolution, restaurants existed in limited form in Paris, but most served only soup. Their proliferation, Cooke tells the BBC, was born from \"economic disaster\".\u00a0\n\"Imagine you're an aspiring young chef and you're working in Paris in the late 18th Century, and they've beheaded Marie Antoinette, and they're getting rid of all those jobs that you've aspired to, cooking for royalty and the aristocracy,\" she says. \"That's why the restaurant culture grew: these very skilled chefs needed to make money and find an audience during economic turbulence, and in a post-royalty age. That's also why Car\u00eame wrote cookbooks: he was establishing himself in this new age of print media, but also, by addressing his work to other chefs, he was training a new breed of chef that was going to serve a larger audience instead of just royalty.\"\nA later French celebrity chef who dominated European food culture, Auguste Escoffier, (1846-1935) \u2013 who ran restaurants at the Ritz hotels in Europe, and at the Savoy Hotel and Carlton Club in London \u2013 \"is really Car\u00eame's heir,\" Cooke says.\n\"Escoffier really becomes famous when he decides to write down formal French cooking methods,\" she explains. \"He was able to achieve Car\u00eame's vision [of making recipes accessible to other chefs] in a way that Car\u00eame could not, because Car\u00eame was living in the age of the birth of restaurant culture, which was only just developing and only in Paris. Escoffier took it to London too.\" (Car\u00eame did spend time in England, serving the then Prince Regent, later George IV, but although he cooked for Tsar Alexander of Russia in Paris, he refused to move there and take a job.)\nThe emergence of TV and radio (and later internet) in the 20th Century has meant that the celebrity chef has become an international phenomenon, not just confined to those writing cookbooks or running restaurants, but open to all those with a knack for connecting with their audience. The most famous chef of the television era, Julia Child, (portrayed by Meryl Streep in the 2009 film Julie and Julia) was an American who had lived in Paris, and a devotee of French cooking. She even received the Antonin Car\u00eame Medal for excellence, although this is a US, not a French, honour.\nIn another nod to modernity, the young Car\u00eame in the series is also shown taking part in a chef's competition, normalised now by the growth of shows such as Iron Chef, MasterChef, and The Great British Bake Off (which streams internationally as The Great British Baking Show.) While the latter's \"Showstopper\" category might trace its ancestry back to Car\u00eame's own sugar sculptures of the 19th Century, the first modern professional event of this kind for chefs started in 1983, when another chef, Paul Bocuse, established the Bocuse D'Or, in Lyon, France.\nBut now that TV shows, podcasting and social media also allow skilled amateurs to become celebrities, Paul Freedman says there are characteristics of how he discerns a truly \"celebrity\" chef\u00a0\n\"My definition in books and articles that I've written is that the contemporary celebrity chef is distinguished by being regarded as a genius or an artist, [as opposed to] people who are [just] excellent at their craft. The Frenchman Paul Bocuse would be the first celebrity chef according to that definition, in the 1980s. Even before he invents dishes, he created the ethos of the chef as genius, and a version of a creative artist. So the celebrity chefs of our era are excellent at their craft, but Ferran Adri\u00e0, who was at El Bulli, or Ren\u00e9 Redzepi of Noma, or Heston Blumenthal in Britain are all [also] creative geniuses, or at least that's how they're presented.\"\u00a0\nThere is though, a direct line traceable from their creations, and their kitchens, to those of Antonin Car\u00eame \u2013 and not just because some of them might still wear a Toque. Bourboulon hopes that this new portrayal of the chef, nearly 200 years after he died, will give his legacy new attention.\u00a0\n\"Although Car\u00eame's name is quite famous in France, it could be even more famous, I think,\" he says. \"I would love people to rediscover, or just discover, what he did, how this young man brought all his talents to the tables of these powerful men like Napoleon. His life is a really exciting thing to mix together \u2013 food, love and politics.\"\u00a0\nCar\u00eame premieres globally on Apple TV+ from April 30, 2025.\n--\nIf you liked this story\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X, and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The top US health department plans to require placebo testing for all vaccines in an effort to offer \"straightforward\" public health information, but experts say such testing could limit availability and raise ethical concerns. \nIn a statement first given to the Washington Post, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said this week, \"All new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure \u2014 a radical departure from past practices\". \nThe agency did not provide details on which \"new vaccines\" would be included. \nBut officials have suggested that updated Covid-19 shots may be included, which vaccine experts say could slow down vaccine access.  \nPeter Lurie, a former official with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said \"it's hard to tell exactly what is being proposed.\"  \n\"But, broadly, if they mean that every modification to an existing vaccine would require a new placebo-controlled trial, they are treading in ethically dubious territory and likely to deny Americans life-saving vaccines at some point.\"\nHHS has not offered details on the timing of the placebo plan or specify the vaccines involved. \nAn HHS spokesperson told the BBC in a statement that health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's goal of \"radical transparency\" means being \"honest and straightforward about what we know \u2014 and what we don't know \u2014 about medical products, including vaccines\". \nThe statement said none of the childhood vaccines recommended in the US  - except the Covid shot - had undergone \"inert placebo\" testing, meaning \"we know very little about the actual risk profiles of these products\". \nBut public health experts say the statement is misleading, as childhood vaccinations, including ones for Hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, polio and the mumps, were all initially tested against a placebo. In fact, all new immunizations already go through the trials - a type of random testing where one test group receives the immunization, and the other gets a placebo, like a saline shot. \nBut newer versions of the shots may not go through the same process, because it is considered unethical to withhold a shot known to be safe from a particular group, and because the shot is only being tweaked in a minor way, vaccine experts said. \nThe coronavirus shot, for example, already has gone through rigorous safety testing, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \n\"We have a lot of information about the safety of the vaccine,\" he said. \"All we're doing this year is using a different Omicron variant that we used last year and the year before that.\" \nStill, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said this week that the agency was \"taking a look\" at updated coronavirus shots, telling the BBC's US partner CBS News that there is a \"void of data\". \nAn HHS spokesperson told the BBC that \"significant updates to existing vaccines\" may be considered \"new products\" requiring additional clinical evaluation.\n\"A four-year-old trial is also not a blank check for new vaccines each year without clinical trial data, unlike the flu shot which has been tried and tested for more than 80 years,\" the spokesperson said. \nRequiring companies to conduct placebo tests for simple upgrades of established vaccines would be costly - and the drug makers could ultimately decide to forgo making the newer, more effective versions of the vaccine altogether, said Dr Lurie.\nBefore taking office - and since assuming the role as secretary - Kennedy has spread   false claims about vaccine safety. His tenure has coincided with one of the worst measles outbreaks in a decade; two children have died and 660 people have been infected in Texas. \nThis week, he encouraged parents to \"do their own research\" about the measles vaccine - which has been considered safe and 97% effective for decades - and raised questions about whether the shot could cause seizures or neurological issues. \nFor months, he has at times endorsed the MMR shot, and at other times, called it a \"personal\" decision. Kennedy also promoted alternative treatments, which doctors say patients should not use without medical supervision. ",

It was PSG in microcosm, Rice's warning delivered in the most painful manner.\nTo emphasise PSG's domination in the first exchanges, they had 71.6% possession in the first 26 minutes - the period of the game in which they threw a bucket of ice-cold water over what had been a white-hot environment - to lay the platform for the advantage they will take back to Paris for next Wednesday's second leg.\nIn that same period, PSG had a remarkable passing accuracy of 86.5% in Arsenal's half, and the total ratio was 165 passes to 60.\nIn effect, when Arsenal finally read Rice's memo, the most important damage had been inflicted.\nArsenal pulled it around, having 55.4% possession for the rest of the game, but Rice knew what was coming and PSG were simply too good to stop early on.\nWhat Arteta and Arsenal learned from PSG clash\nWe have to do something special in Paris - Arteta\nHow Arteta, Flick and Luis Enrique are inspired by Guardiola\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta said: \"We are disappointed with the result. We put so much into the game.

It was PSG in microcosm, Rice's warning delivered in the most painful manner.To emphasise PSG's domination in the first exchanges, they had 71.6% possession in the first 26 minutes - the period of the game in which they threw a bucket of ice-cold water over what had been a white-hot environment - to lay the platform for the advantage they will take back to Paris for next Wednesday's second leg.In that same period, PSG had a remarkable passing accuracy of 86.5% in Arsenal's half, and the total ratio was 165 passes to 60.In effect, when Arsenal finally read Rice's memo, the most important damage had been inflicted.Arsenal pulled it around, having 55.4% possession for the rest of the game, but Rice knew what was coming and PSG were simply too good to stop early on.What Arteta and Arsenal learned from PSG clashPublished16 hours agoWe have to do something special in Paris - ArtetaPublished1 day agoHow Arteta, Flick and Luis Enrique are inspired by GuardiolaPublished1 day agoArsenal manager Mikel Arteta said: \"We are disappointed with the result.

I mean, I disagree with what it was that they did, but she wasn't the only person that did it.\"\nThe English pop star and actress was one of a number of high-profile critics of the Blue Origin flight, which briefly took Perry and five other women to the edge of space two weeks ago.\n\"She was possibly the most famous, and the one that divides people the most, and so there was something in me that decided to choose her as the person that should [be singled out],\" Allen continued.\n\"Well, anyway, I'm just sorry. I would have been hurt if it had been me and someone in my industry used me and my name, and I saw that, and I'm sorry.\"\nAllen's apology came after she discussed \"Katy Perry and her mates all going up to space for 12 minutes\" with co-host Miquita Oliver in a previous episode.\n\"I mean, what the... hell was all that about?\" Allen said. \"I mean, in all seriousness, what? Why? For why?\n\"It's so out of touch. Like, we're on the brink of recession. People are really... struggling to make ends meet and put food on their tables.\"\nShe added: \"And the fact that they've, like, made it like some sort of feminist thing...\"\nThe flight, on a rocket designed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's company Blue Origin, marked the first all-female mission to space since 1963.\nPerry said beforehand: \"It's an important moment for the future of commercial space travel and for humanity in general and for women all around.\"\nAlso on board were Bezos's fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez, TV presenter Gayle King, former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn.\nBut Perry bore the brunt of the ridicule after it emerged she sang Louis Armstrong's What a Wonderful World, and held up the setlist for her new tour to an in-flight camera.\nFast food chain Wendy's posted on social media, \"Can we send her back\", before adding several days later that they had \"a ton of respect for Katy Perry and her out-of-this-world-talent\".\nModel Emily Ratajkowski was among the other critics of the flight, saying she was \"disgusted\", and took aim at Bezos in a follow-up video arguing that taking \"his fianc\u00e9e and a few other famous women to space for space tourism is not progress\".\nUS actress Olivia Munn described the flight as \"gluttonous\", explaining: \"It's so much money to go to space, and there's a lot of people who can't even afford eggs. What's the point? Is it historic that you guys are going on a ride?\"\nBut King hit back, saying she was \"very disappointed and very saddened\" by the backlash. \"Have you been?\" she asked the haters. \"If you've been and you still feel that way after you come back, please let's have a conversation.\"",

        "article_text": "The latest in the superhero franchise \"is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun\", with a \"charismatic\" Florence Pugh at its centre, writes Nicholas Barber.\nEver since Avengers: Endgame came out in 2019, the subtitle has felt a lot more appropriate than the studio might have liked. It's not that Marvel hasn't had any hits in the 2020s, but it is no longer releasing an unbroken chain of talked-about blockbusters, nor is it keeping audiences invested in a story that threads through all of them. That particular game has come to an end.\nThe Marvel films that have worked best since Endgame are the ones that have moved furthest away from the pattern set by the so-called \"Infinity Saga\" \u2013 the first 22 instalments in the franchise, which pivoted around a fight against uber-villain Thanos. Last year's R-rated Deadpool & Wolverine used almost no characters from the main Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU); the postmodern Spider-Man: No Way Home paid tribute to the Spider-Man films which weren't made by Marvel Studios; and the latest Marvel film, Thunderbolts*, has its own distinct identity, too. That's not to suggest that it isn't a part of the MCU. In fact, one of its clever touches is that it specifically addresses how gloomy people feel in a world where Iron Man, Thor and Captain America are no longer around. But the director, Jake Shreier, and the screenwriters, Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo, have come up with an unruly take on the superhero genre which makes it the most refreshing MCU offering in years.\nThe key is that, rather than trying to be as glossy and expansive as the Infinity Saga films, Thunderbolts* is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun. It isn't the epic tale of indestructible titans saving the Universe, let alone the multiverse; it's a comedy-tinged caper about bungling secret agents who are deemed a liability by the very company that used to employ them. It's not a new scenario: after The Bourne Identity, there were countless action films in which disavowed spies dodged their erstwhile handlers. But Thunderbolts* stands out because it has a whole group of such spies: a ragtag bunch of depressive, dysfunctional loners who must work together and can't stop grumbling about it. What's especially unusual about the film, in Marvel terms, is that its premise would be viable even if the characters weren't super-powered. And, indeed, they aren't all that super-powered compared to the aforementioned Captain America and Thor. Part of their appeal is that they can be killed by bullets and trapped in rooms with locked doors, which makes them a lot easier to relate to than Norse gods.\nThere's a lesson there that the makers of such disappointments as Eternals and The Marvels should have learnt. It's not the characters' powers that count; it's their personalities. In Thunderbolts*, those characters are Yelena (Florence Pugh), a Russian assassin who was the adoptive sister of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and is now deeply miserable about all the mindless violence in her life; her adoptive father, Red Guardian (David Harbour), a washed-up slob who is nostalgic for his days as a national hero; the bionic-armed Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who was Captain America's sidekick in World War Two, and still seems uncomfortable in the 21st Century; John Walker (Wyatt Russell), an embittered super-soldier who was supposed to be the new Captain America, but wasn't up to the job; the confused, conflicted Bob (Lewis Pullman), another flawed attempt to create a Captain America substitute; and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), who is a science experiment gone wrong \u2013 but who, unlike the other characters, isn't very well defined beyond that. In various ways, they are all connected to one of Marvel's most memorably slippery villains, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a businesswoman with all the brittle, condescending confidence that you might expect from the reliably excellent star of Seinfeld and Veep.\nDe Fontaine, it seems, has been behind several superhero-related black ops. Now that her political opponents are closing in on her, she decides to destroy all the evidence of her shady undertakings, including the people who carried them out. And so it is that Yelena and the others switch from trying to kill each other to trying to keep each other alive. They become a sort-of team, but they aren't sure whether or not to call themselves the Thunderbolts, so the asterisk in the title signifies that it's just a placeholder name until they can think of something better.\nThunderbolts*\nDirector: Jake Schreier\nCast: Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, Olga Kurylenko, Lewis Pullman, Geraldine Viswanathan, Chris Bauer, Wendell Pierce, David Harbour, Hannah John-Kamen, Julia Louis-Dreyfus\nRuntime: 2hr 16min\nOne small snag is that most of the characters' back stories are in other films, and in a TV series, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, rather than in Thunderbolts* itself. Another snag is that the gang's pursuit by De Fontaine's troops accounts for the majority of the film's running time, so there aren't many set pieces that haven't been in the trailers already. On the other hand, superhero films are rarely so tightly focused, and rarely progress so seamlessly from scene to scene, with no pausing for breath, and no sudden jumps to different ends of the Earth. Captain America: Brave New World, which came out in February, was similar to Thunderbolts* in that it revolved around Washington DC politics, and followed on from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. But that film was a messy sprawl, whereas this one is so neatly plotted that you can get the gist and enjoy the ride whether you're a Marvel nerd or not.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A combat epic that 'does what film does best'\n\u2022 Disney's Snow White has a major 'identity crisis'\n\u2022 Mickey 17 is a 'disappointment' \nThe underlying issues in Thunderbolts* are just as focused as the narrative. The characters all have to deal with the shame and trauma of their troubled pasts \u2013 and this theme is there from the opening scene to the requisite Final Battle, which is slightly rushed, but stylishly surreal enough to recall two mind-bending films written by Charlie Kaufman, Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In between, the characters' guilt is explored in some touching and surprisingly brutal sequences, as well as in some sharply-scripted, briskly-edited and skilfully-performed comic scenes.\u00a0\nAt both ends of the spectrum, Pugh delivers a performance which would win her awards if it weren't in a superhero film. She delivers her punchlines with expert timing, especially when she is bickering and bantering with Red Guardian. But she can also radiate raw emotion \u2013 and all while maintaining a decent Russian accent and cartwheeling through her acrobatic fight scenes. When it comes down to it, that's why Thunderbolts* is so much better than most of Marvel's post-Endgame films. It's not just because it's a rough-edged, big-hearted spy thriller about lovably clueless anti-heroes. It's because it has an actor as charismatic as Pugh at its centre.\u00a0\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\u00a0--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Anti-war protests at Shannon AirportThe airport has long been the site of protests over its use by the US military.The Irish government offered the use of the airport to the United States in 2002 after the September 11 attacks, leading to it being used as a regular stopover for US troops travelling to fight in the Iraq War.Anti-war protesters and, in more recent years, pro-Palestine protesters have made the airport a regular site of demonstrations over those connections with the US.Republic of IrelandAir travel",

We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.\nHe said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".\nThe antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.\n\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.\n\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.\nThe 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.\nIt is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.\nCurrently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.\n\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics. \n\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\" \nOn the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back. \nThe satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"\nDespite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch. \n\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.\nAirbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.\nL3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.\nThe team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.\nThese annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.\n\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney. \nAnother advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.\nIt is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.\n\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\" \nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "A 29-year-old doctor from Bristol has had her eyesight saved after a \"game-changing\" test identified a mystery infection that had plagued her health for five years.\nEllie Irwin suffered persistent inflammation in her right eye that didn't go away, resulting in blurred vision. No treatment helped and at one point she even considered having her eye removed.\nIt was only after Ellie was offered a \"last resort\" analysis called metagenomics, that she was diagnosed with a rare bacterial infection which was cured with antibiotics.\n\"It's been transformative,\" Ellie told the BBC. \"I feel so fortunate.\"\nProfessor Carlos Pavesio, consultant ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, says Ellie's case is a \"breakthrough in the diagnosis of infectious diseases\". \n\"There are many patients we treat with chronic infections for years, but despite multiple tests we cannot identify the bug responsible,\" he says.\nIn 2019, while still at medical school, Ellie began suffering from inflammation in her right eye. All tests for infection came back negative and it was assumed she had an autoimmune condition.\nEllie was prescribed steroid eye drops and immunosuppressants, some of which needed to be given by intravenous infusion.\n\"It was completely dominating my life,\" Ellie says. \"I needed eye drops every single hour and it was difficult to balance that alongside starting work as a junior doctor. My vision was really variable, and I would have some bad days.\n\"I was on so much medication and going to so many appointments, yet I didn't feel I was getting any better.\"\nThe treatment and inflammation led to Ellie developing a cataract that had to be surgically removed, just after she graduated from medical school.\nEllie says she eventually reached \"breaking point\", and even began considering having her affected eye removed.\n\"Whilst losing sight in one eye is terrifying,\" she says, \"my biggest fear was that it might spread to my left eye.\"\nIt was one of Ellie's doctors at Southmead Hospital in Bristol who suggested metagenomics - a last resort test not generally available to patients and only used where standard diagnostic tools have failed to identify or rule out infection.\nMetagenomics technology uses cutting-edge genomic sequencing, which can identify all bacteria, fungi or parasites present in a sample by comparing them against a database of millions of pathogens.\nA team at Moorfields Eye Hospital arranged for a sample of fluid to be taken from inside Ellie's eye and sent to the metagenomics labs at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) - the only lab in the UK officially recognised to carry out these diagnostic tests for patients, and one of only a few in the world.\nCurrently, the standard method for detecting bacterial infections is by trying to grow a sample of it in a Petri dish.\nFor viruses, the most common diagnostic tool is a PCR test. These will be familiar to many from the pandemic, when millions sent off swabs in the post to confirm whether they had Covid.\nHowever, Dr Julianne Brown, principal clinical scientist at the GOSH metagenomics service, says PCR has some drawbacks.\n\"The trouble with PCR is that you have to think of the viruses that might be causing an infection and do a separate test for each and every one,\" she says. \"So if you've got an infection with something that's unexpected, rare or not previously known, you won't find it.\"\nDr Brown says metagenomics is \"an enormous step up - it's a complete game-changer\".\nIn Ellie's case, metagenomics diagnosed a rare strain of the bacterial infection leptospirosis found in South America.\nIt is now presumed Ellie picked up the bug swimming in the Amazon river in 2018, while on a trip to Ecuador and Colombia.\nEllie says it was an emotional moment when she was given the results of the test.\n\"I broke down - I just had to cry. I never imagined that it would come back positive and be for something that was treatable,\" she says. \n\"I was given three weeks of antibiotics and within days my vision was clearer and the inflammation subsided.\"\nA single metagenomics test costs around \u00a31,300, which is far more than standard diagnostics. However, as the technology is developed that price is likely to fall rapidly.\nVirologist Professor Judy Breuer, who has been developing metagenomics at GOSH and University College London (UCL) for more than a decade, says her team currently receives three or four samples a week from hospitals around the UK for metagenomic testing in addition to those it carries out on its own patients.\nThese are often samples from parts of the body that are normally sterile sites, where bacteria are not usually found such as the brain, central nervous system, liver and eye.\n\"In the future, we think metagenomics will become a first line test and be able to diagnose infection in any sample, probably within the same day,\" she says.\nIt's also likely to become faster, cheaper and easier to do, explains Dr Brown, meaning it will become available to more patients rather than just a small number who are severely unwell.\nResolving her eye problems has allowed Ellie to concentrate on her training as a GP and arrange her wedding. \nEllie was married in Newcastle on 29 March, the same day the city celebrated   Newcastle United's win in the Carabao Cup.\nShe says: \"We got a shout-out from Ant and Dec and went up on a scissor lift above the Newcastle United fans, which was incredible.\"\nProf Breuer says she is thrilled with how the treatment is changing lives.\n\"It is amazing to see the impact it is having for patients like Ellie.\"\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

It has already racked up more than 1.4m views on TikTok.\nDo you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\nKeable was co-signed by Beyonc\u00e9 earlier this year, who named her as an artist who inspired her. She has achieved 2m monthly streams on Spotify and is playing Glastonbury, SXSW, Colors NYC and Meltdown festivals this summer.\nSasha is a singer now but grew up in the centre of the football world - her stepdad, Nick Broad, was head of sports science at Blackburn Rovers and Chelsea, and was working with Carlo Ancelotti as performance manager at Paris St-Germain when he died in a car accident in 2013.\n\"I've seen all sides of football, not just as a fan,\" she told BBC Sport. \"When Carlo got fired by Chelsea, my stepdad was fired too. He didn't know what he was going to do, but then Carlo went to PSG and asked him to go with him.\n\"Sadly he passed away while he was in Paris but we are still close to the Ancelotti family. He and Carlo were such good friends.\n\"I look back now and my stepdad was a real pioneer in his work in sports science and nutrition. The things he introduced, like GPS tracking in training and collecting cardio data, were all new then but they are industry standard now.\n\"It's incredible to see his work live on in that way. Some of his old friends and colleagues reach out to me now when they see me doing my own thing on social media and talk about how his work was incredible. \n\"I always wonder how much further he could have pushed the use of science in football if he was still here, but I'm so pleased you can still see his legacy.\"\nNick Broad (right) celebrates with Carlo Ancelotti (centre) after Chelsea's FA Cup win in 2010, which completed a double of Premier League and FA Cup that season\nBefore becoming a singer, Sasha dreamed of being a footballer herself. Now she settles for collecting shirts instead, with a Tino Asprilla Colombia shirt from 1994 taking pride of place.\n\"I played all the time when I was a kid, from the age of about six,\" explained Sasha.\n\"It was a bit different for girls then because it was before the women's game really took off and you didn't really have a route to becoming a professional in this country. I wanted to go to the United States to play. \n\"I was quite a tomboy so I used to play with the boys all the time - I had to. We did not even have a girls team at my school until my friends and I asked to play with the boys and, after that, they formed a team for us.\n\"Fortunately it's all changed now and football is so much more accessible for girls. If you don't have the chance to try something, how do you know if you will love it?\"\nChris Sutton and Sasha Keable were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nEtihad Stadium, 20:00 BST\nThis should be a great game, because Wolves are so powerful and they will have no fear at all after winning six games in a row.\nBut Manchester City have looked much more solid in the past few weeks and they are on a bit of a roll themselves, with four successive wins in all competitions.\nPep Guardiola's side will look to control this game, the same way they did in the first half of their FA Cup semi-final win over Nottingham Forest, but I don't think they will find it easy to keep Wolves quiet.\nStill, I went against City in their last home game, against Aston Villa, and I was wrong. I am not going to make the same mistake again.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nSasha's prediction: This is a tough game for City but I still think they will win. 2-1\nVilla Park, 12:30 BST\nIt would be easy to say the wheels have come off at Aston Villa, wouldn't it? \nIn the past couple of weeks, they have gone out of the Champions League and FA Cup, and losing their last Premier League game has left them playing catch-up in the top-five race.\nI don't think Unai Emery's side will crumble from here, though, even if Marcus Rashford's season-ending injury is a big blow.\nVilla need to win this, and they also need a big performance from Ollie Watkins. If he starts banging the goals in again then that would be a huge boost for their run-in.\nFulham are a nightmare to predict, as I've mentioned in previous weeks, and they are certainly capable of getting something here.\nI don't think Villa can keep a clean sheet - which probably means they will stop Fulham scoring - but I have a feeling things will click for them in front of goal.\nAlso, they are at home too so, if they need them, their fans can help to get them over the line.\nSutton's prediction: 3-1\nSasha's prediction: I want to back Fulham here, for south-west London. 0-3\nGoodison Park, 15:00 BST\nI am covering this game for BBC Radio 5 Live and I am really looking forward to going to Goodison Park again.\nEverything points towards a home win, despite Everton losing their previous two games. \nIpswich are definitely down now and, while they won't throw in the towel, they might be a little less spirited now they know they are relegated.\nTheir confidence has been sapped over the course of the season and, after watching them recently, I can't back them to get anything here. \nThey were flimsy against Arsenal, then well beaten by Newcastle, and it would be a shock if they scored at all, let alone break my record for the fastest goal scored by an away player at Goodison.\nEverton have stuttered in the past couple of weeks but I don't think that is a bad thing for David Moyes. \nHe has over-achieved since taking charge in January, when the reality is that he has got the same group of players as his predecessor, Sean Dyche, and there needs to be a lot of work done on improving that squad in the summer.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nSasha's prediction: I am not sure if Ipswich will put up as much of a fight now they are relegated. 1-0\nKing Power Stadium, 15:00 BST\nLeicester have been rotten but, somehow, Southampton have been even worse.\nIt's sad to see Jamie Vardy leaving the Foxes at the end of the season, but maybe this might be the send-off he deserves. I am going with him to score the winner.\nThese two teams actually served up a thriller at St Mary's Stadium back in October, when Vardy got one of Leicester's goals as they fought back from 2-0 down to win 3-2.\nI am expecting the same outcome here, just with a lot less excitement. The readers will go for a draw, I am sure of it, but I am pretty confident about Leicester taking this one.\nSutton's prediction: 1-0\nSasha's prediction: It's mad how bad both these teams have been. I don't think either of them will get a goal, let alone the win. 0-0\nEmirates Stadium, 17:30 BST\nWe know how dangerous Bournemouth are, because they beat Arsenal in October, and if Mikel Arteta rests players then this game becomes even harder for the Gunners.\nIt's a tricky situation for Arteta, because he will want to head to Paris St-Germain for the second leg of their Champions League semi-final with a bit of momentum, but he has got to balance that with the risk of injury to his key players.\nBournemouth's form has improved of late, and the circumstances mean they definitely have a decent chance of doing the double over Arsenal this season.\nThis all boils down to what the Arsenal team is, so it is difficult to make a call without knowing that, but they are at home and even if they are not at full strength then I can still see them getting a draw.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nSasha's prediction: It's a strange situation for Arsenal but I am still backing us to win. 2-0\nGtech Community Stadium, 14:00 BST\nWe know Manchester United are going to make changes here, because seeing out the second leg of their Europa League semi-final with Athletic Bilbao is their priority.\nRuben Amorim's side nicked a point at the very end of their game at Bournemouth last weekend, which sparked mass celebrations, but I really don't see them doing the same against Brentford - they won't be getting the bunting out this time.\nThe Bees are such a dangerous team when they come forward and they will keep on attacking United. Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa should get plenty of chances and I can see them getting a goal or two between them.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nSasha's prediction: I just have a feeling United will nick this. 0-1\nAmex Stadium, 14:00 BST\nBrighton got back to winning ways last weekend thanks to Carlos Baleba's brilliant late strike against West Ham.\nThe Seagulls beat Newcastle at St James' Park earlier in the season too, but that was before Eddie Howe's side hit their stride, and it is a big ask for Brighton to repeat that result.\nNewcastle were just relentless in their win over Ipswich and another three points here would be massive in their bid for a top-five finish - I don't think they will get them, but we will see a few goals.\nSutton's prediction: 2-2\nSasha's prediction: Newcastle will take this one. 0-2\nLondon Stadium, 14:00 BST\nThis is 17th versus 16th in the Premier League which tells you how bad both teams have been this season.\nEveryone knows Tottenham's focus will be on their Europa League semi-final second leg with Bodo/Glimt so I think West Ham boss Graham Potter needs a result here more than Ange Postecoglou.\nPotter's results have been poor since he took over from Julen Lopetegui in January and the Hammers fans have not had the upturn they wanted in the way their team play either.\nSpurs can still be dangerous even when they are out of form but Ange is not going to pick his strongest team. That gives West Ham a better chance of getting the win they badly need, but I don't see them doing it in style.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nSasha's prediction: I don't want to say Tottenham will win, but I think they will. 1-2\nStamford Bridge, 16:30 BST\nI would usually be asking which Chelsea side will turn up, but that applies to Liverpool too this week.\nArne Slot's side could have been out all week celebrating their title win and we don't know how that will affect them.\nYou often play at your best when you have been on the lash in a scenario like theirs. For example, some of my best games for Celtic came after nights out where we had won something and were allowed to have a couple of beers, but I don't know what to expect here.\nChelsea have nicked a couple of results recently, to stay in the race for the top five, but their performances have not been too convincing and their fans still don't seem to have taken to Enzo Maresca's playing style.\nThis is not the test for them that it would be if Liverpool were trying to close out the title but I don't think Slot is the type to let anyone take their foot off the gas. He will put out a strong team and even if they play with more freedom, I still think Liverpool will leave with the points.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2\nSasha's prediction: I still have a connection with Chelsea because of my stepdad and I have got to back them here. 3-0\nSelhurst Park, 20:00 BST\nCrystal Palace will be on a high after booking their place in the FA Cup final, so this is another very tricky game for Nottingham Forest, who slipped up at home against Brentford on Thursday.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side will have to be stubborn and resolute to get anything at Selhurst Park. They have shown that kind of character plenty of times already this season but they really need it now.\nLooking at the race for the top five you feel like every team involved needs to win every game, but of course that is not going to happen, and I can see my boyhood team Forest dropping more points here. I just hope it doesn't prove crucial for them.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nSasha's prediction: It's got to be Palace here. I am loyal to the London teams! 3-0\nChris got five correct results with one exact score from the nine Premier League games he predicted in week 34, giving him a total of 80 points.\nHe beat his guest, golf hero Lee Westwood, who got four correct results with no exact scores, leaving him on 40 points and tied with the BBC readers, who also got five correct results with one exact score.\nWestwood and the BBC readers were wrong about both FA Cup semi-finals, while Chris correctly picked City to beat Forest and wrongly thought Aston Villa would beat Crystal Palace. Those ties do not count towards the weekly totals.\nThe other game from week 34, Manchester City's 2-1 win over Aston Villa, took place on 22 April and does not count towards the weekly result either.\nSherelle, the guest in week 33, made the prediction instead of Westwood and picked up 40 points for the guests' overall total (but not her own individual tally) with an exact score. Chris and the BBC readers both went for a 2-1 Villa win.",

After warning that the US wanted Canada's land and resources, Carney declared: \"President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.\"\nUntil Trump's return to power, Pierre Poilievre's Conservative Party had held what looked like high and insurmountable ground in voter preference polls amidst general dissatisfaction with the state of the Canadian economy and almost a decade of Liberal government under then leader Justin Trudeau.\nThe past year has been devastating for incumbent governments around the world, with parties all along the political spectrum losing ground or outright control \u2013 with the US, UK, Japan, Germany, France and India among the most prominent examples.\nThis Canadian general election broke that trend, as the Liberals forced Trudeau to resign and picked a political outsider, former Bank of England chief Carney, as their leader.\nHe ran hard against what the party continuously characterised as the real threat Trump posed not just to their economy but also to Canada's very sovereignty.\nNo one should expect those Liberals to say thank you to the American leader, however \u2013 or for Trump to soften his rhetoric, even though last month he said he preferred a Liberal prime minister. (He would go on to say that he really didn't care who won.)\nInstead, more of the same is the likely result \u2013 more pointed quips about Canada joining the US, more threats of a trade war and more willingness to cast longstanding ties and agreements with America's northern neighbour into doubt.\nThe irony, however, is that Trump's derisive focus on Canada may have denied him a northern neighbour run by, if not a kindred spirit, at least a politician more in line with his populist conservative priorities than Liberal Carney. \nWhile Poilievre, a veteran politician, will never be mistaken for the American businessman-turned-president, they have some similarities \u2013 a goal of shrinking government, lowering taxes and trimming social services, a desire to promote fossil fuel production, and a distaste for what they both deride as \"woke\" leftist culture.\nA Conservative victory in this election would have been viewed by many \u2013 in America and throughout the world \u2013 as a new sign that the Trump win last year was more than just a singular American event. It would have represented what many in Trump's orbit like to believe is a global movement toward their brand of culturally conservative, anti-elite, anti-immigration, and pro-working-class politics.\n\nAlthough Trump doesn't appear to have the same distaste for Carney that he clearly held for Trudeau, his political and policy interests and those of Canada now appear destined to continue to diverge. \nAlready there are indications that Canada is looking more toward Europe as a reliable partner, rather than Trump's America \u2013 a move that is sure to irk the American leader.\nCarney has pledged to quickly begin new trade negotiations with Trump in an attempt to stave off US tariffs on Canadian auto exports set to kick in on 3 May.\nThe Canadian economy, which heavily depends on exports to the US, is at considerable risk if a full trade war erupts, and Carney \u2013 an economist by training and a veteran central banker - has promised voters that he will do everything in his power to keep Canada from tumbling into a recession.\nMeanwhile, Trump belly-flopped into Canadian politics one more time on Monday, while voters were casting their ballots, again calling the US-Canadian border \"artificially drawn\" and saying the nation would be better off as a \"cherished\" American state.\nCarney ascended to political power quite suddenly, at a time when his country is facing a generational challenge from its superpower neighbour. Many world leaders are still working out how to deal with Donald Trump in his second term, but few will face this kind of test.",

Already there are indications that Canada is looking more toward Europe as a reliable partner, rather than Trump's America \u2013 a move that is sure to irk the American leader.Carney has pledged to quickly begin new trade negotiations with Trump in an attempt to stave off US tariffs on Canadian auto exports set to kick in on 3 May.The Canadian economy, which heavily depends on exports to the US, is at considerable risk if a full trade war erupts, and Carney \u2013 an economist by training and a veteran central banker - has promised voters that he will do everything in his power to keep Canada from tumbling into a recession.Meanwhile, Trump belly-flopped into Canadian politics one more time on Monday, while voters were casting their ballots, again calling the US-Canadian border \"artificially drawn\" and saying the nation would be better off as a \"cherished\" American state.Carney ascended to political power quite suddenly, at a time when his country is facing a generational challenge from its superpower neighbour. )Instead, more of the same is the likely result \u2013 more pointed quips about Canada joining the US, more threats of a trade war and more willingness to cast longstanding ties and agreements with America's northern neighbour into doubt.The irony, however, is that Trump's derisive focus on Canada may have denied him a northern neighbour run by, if not a kindred spirit, at least a politician more in line with his populist conservative priorities than Liberal Carney.",

Slot has led Liverpool to a 20th league title.\nBut, while the Dutchman has been the mastermind behind Liverpool's campaign this season, his success - as he highlighted following his team's confirmation as champions on Sunday - is also due to the squad and culture created by Klopp.\nThe Reds only added one player to their ranks for this campaign in Federico Chiesa and, despite him only playing a bit-part role, they have equalled the title tally of arch-rivals Manchester United.\nBBC Sport - through a documentary on BBC iPlayer about Liverpool's journey to winning the Champions League in 2018-2019 - charts how Klopp ended up with the Reds and how he created the foundations for Slot to build on.\nWhen Liverpool were looking for a manager to replace Brendan Rodgers, the \"two main candidates\" - according to former Reds director of research Ian Graham - were Klopp and Carlo Ancelotti, who were both out of work at the time.\nAncelotti was a \"great coach\" but Liverpool didn't have the \"sort of squad\" with \"proven superstars\" that he was used to managing.\nKlopp, on the other hand, had guided a youthful Borussia Dortmund side to the Bundesliga title in 2011 and 2012 and was seen as a better fit.\n\"Our strategy was to recruit young players, have them reach peak age together to give us this success one or two years down the line,\" said Graham.\nKlopp was appointed as Reds boss with the club 10th in the Premier League in October 2015, and he set about instilling a philosophy and principles at the Anfield club which Slot has benefitted from.\n\"We always wanted to create stories which we can tell our grandkids,\" said Peter Krawietz, who had been with Klopp at Mainz and Dortmund before following him to Liverpool and becoming his assistant.\n\"There's only one way. Do it as a team. Do it with your mates.\n\"Use that to make sure we are feeling like friends, like brothers, like a family. Know about the support you need from all the teams around, from the analysts, from the doctor, from the physiotherapists, from the nutritionists.\n\"We can do it only together. As long as you are alone, or you leave others alone, then you don't have a chance.\n\"Keep believing, follow your dream, don't quit. Then one day you will get the bonus. So the idea was always for us to invest everything without expecting a guarantee for success.\"\nHow to Win the Champions League\nLiverpool\nSuccess in the form of silverware had proved elusive.\nLiverpool had achieved an impressive 97 points in 2018-2019 and, even though that would have won them the league title in most other seasons, they were pipped to the top-flight crown by a point by Manchester City.\nThe Reds had also been beaten in the League Cup final and Europa League final in 2016, as well as the 2018 Champions League final.\nHowever, the work Klopp had done with his players was eventually rewarded when he won the first trophy of his Liverpool reign with a 2-0 victory against Tottenham in the 2019 Champions League final.\nThe club's journey to that trophy embodied the tactics, emotion and thrilling football that was Klopp's hallmark, and one which Slot has refined rather than revolutionised.\n\"The idea is to press the opponent, don't allow them to get into the game,\" said Krawietz. \"They do on the pitch what we allow them to do, being dominant already without having the ball, and then - the moment we win the ball - the first idea is, win it high on the pitch and attack the goal.\n\"We had to adapt over time. It was constantly learning without changing our basic ideas until the end.\"\nHe added: \"We, as the managing staff, were convinced about our way.\n\"We had to convince the players as well and then, the next step is to convince the people around, turning doubters into believers.\"\nKrawietz admitted Klopp's gameplan could be \"wild\" but \"was part of the plan\", and there was no better evidence of it in action than their 2019 Champions League semi-final against Lionel Messi's Barcelona.\nThe Reds looked down and out after losing the first leg 3-0 at the Nou Camp, before what turned out to be one of the most memorable comebacks in Champions League history.\n\"Right after the first game, there was a very decisive moment in the dressing room because Jurgen stood up and said, 'hey, gentlemen, this game is not over yet. We have half-time. Yes, we are 3-0 down, but we are Liverpool and we play next week in our stadium',\" said Krawietz.\n\"For us, football is always playing football as well with your heart. \n\"All the strategy, all the tactics, all the instructions you give to them but, giving the team the possibility to feel the game and the energy of a stadium, the support of each other and bringing the crowd into the game as well in home games, which is possible at Anfield, we knew it and this is what we tried to develop.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'It's like a father hugging the son' - Alisson and Robertson on Klopp's hugs\nLiverpool's in-house data department had given them a 3.5% chance of overcoming Barcelona before the second leg but, as the injured Mohamed Salah's T-shirt read before the match, Klopp's Liverpool 'never give up'.\nDivock Origi pulled one goal back early on for Liverpool and two from Georginio Wijnaldum, who was \"angry like crazy\" at not having started, levelled the tie at 3-3 before 'that' corner.\nWith Barcelona still getting organised for a Liverpool corner, Trent Alexander-Arnold pretended to walk away from the ball before quickly turning and sending in a low ball which Origi swept in to cause scenes of bedlam as Liverpool won 4-0.\n\"I didn't know at the time but our video analysts pay a lot of attention to set-pieces,\" said Graham.\n\"They noticed that this was a recurring theme - when Barcelona concede a corner they are more concerned with arguing amongst themselves than they are defending the corner - and so Divock and Trent had been briefed.\n\"Credit to the video analysts and Trent and Divock for spotting the opportunity and converting it as well.\"\nLiverpool went on to beat Spurs and win Europe's top competition for a sixth time.\n\"It's not hard to play for Jurgen. He's a motivator. He gets you to run through a brick wall for him effectively. The good thing is that he'll do the exact same for you,\" said Liverpool left-back Andy Robertson.\n\"I just think he was probably quite a loving person. He was always just going about the training ground giving hugs.\n\"He wanted everyone to feel a part of it at that time. Going into the training ground was a good place to go. You could see everyone was highly motivated.\"\nKlopp might have gone but his players have proved this season that the atmosphere  he created at Liverpool remains, along with the 'all-for-one-one-for-all' attitude he embedded in his players.\nLiverpool keeper Alisson added: \"Jurgen was always clinical in the words he used before matches.

They are highly sought after because of their use in renewable energy, military technology and infrastructure.\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it showed both sides were committed to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine. \nThe deal will also see the establishment of an investment fund to spur Ukraine's economic recovery from the war. \nAccording to the statement from the US Treasury on Wednesday afternoon, the newly created US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund recognises the \"significant financial and material support\" the US has given Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022. \nThe US treasury secretary said in a video statement that the deal would help \"unlock Ukraine's growth assets\".\nThe language of the announcement shows much more solidarity with Ukraine than is usual for the Trump administration.\nIt refers to \"Russia's full scale invasion\" and adds that \"no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine\".\nThe Kremlin has not yet responded to the agreement.\nFor Kyiv, it is seen as essential to accessing US military aid.\nUkraine's Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko - who flew to Washington to ink the deal on Wednesday - said in a post on X that the new fund would \"attract global investment into our country\". \nListing the deal's provisions, she said it would involve projects in minerals, oil and gas, although the resources would remain the property of Ukraine.\nThe partnership will be equal, on a 50:50 basis, she added, and must be ratified by lawmakers in Kyiv.\nUnder the deal, the US would contribute new assistance to Kyiv, she added, including, for example, air defence systems.\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly pushed for the agreement as a prerequisite to offering any future security guarantees to Kyiv. \nCrucially, the draft of the deal indicates Ukraine will be giving Washington access to some of its natural resources in return for future US security assistance.\nBut that is significantly less than what Trump had wanted, which was to get paid back for all US military aid given since the start of the war.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has managed to eke out some concessions from Washington.\nThe deal was delayed after US authorities said Kyiv was trying to make last-minute changes. \nOn Wednesday afternoon, a US source familiar with the talks criticised Ukraine for seeking to reopen some terms that had apparently been finalised over the weekend.\nThe source said sticking points had included governance of the fund, issues with transparency, and steps to ensure that all funds would be fully traceable.\nTechnical documents were signed last week by representatives of both countries.\nThe initial agreement was due to be signed in February, but fell apart following a heated exchange at the White House when Trump accused Zelensky of \"gambling with World War Three\". \nThe breakthrough comes days after Trump and Zelensky held a face-to-face meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral, and as talks between Moscow and Washington over a possible ceasefire in Ukraine grind on.\nPhoning into the NewsNation network on Wednesday evening, Trump said he had pressed Zelensky at Vatican City to seal the deal.\n\"I was telling him that it's a very good thing if we can produce a deal that you sign it,\" he said, \"because Russia is much bigger and much stronger. Russia is just chugging forward.\"\nThe US president said the deal would recuperate the multi-billion dollar US assistance to Ukraine since the war began and \"much more in theory\".\n\"So I went to them and said, 'Look, we got to get rare earth.' They have great rare earth, meaning certain minerals, materials,\" said Trump.\n\"They have things that a lot of places don't have. It's a big asset that they have.\"\nThe agreement comes amid a US trade war with China, where 90% of the world's current rare-earth stocks are sourced.",

According to the statement from the US Treasury on Wednesday afternoon, the newly created US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund recognises the \"significant financial and material support\" the US has given Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022.",

        "article_text": "Nat Sciver-Brunt has represented England 259 times across formats\nEngland have appointed all-rounder Nat Sciver-Brunt as their new captain.\nSciver-Brunt, 32, replaces Heather Knight who spent nine years in the role.\nShe becomes just the fourth permanent England women's captain since 2000.\nKnight was sacked in March as a result of a review into the humiliating 16-0 Ashes defeat earlier in the year.\nHead coach Jon Lewis was also removed from his position and has been replaced by legendary former captain Charlotte Edwards.\n\"I'm really proud to take on the role of captain and it's an honour to have been asked by Charlotte, someone I've always looked up to,\" said Sciver-Brunt.\n\"Ever since I made my England debut back in 2013, all I have wanted to do is help the team in every way that I can. I will try my best to lead this team to success, while empowering them to be the best version of themselves.\n\"We have a really talented group, and we have a group that's united. It's a team I believe in and a team that can have a lot of success together.\"\nSciver-Brunt was the most likely candidate to take over, having been Knight's vice-captain, and is one of England's most experienced all-format cricketers.\nDuring the Ashes, she had stated her desire to fulfil the role when Knight's future remained uncertain, and has previously led England in 11 T20s and once in one-day internationals, with nine of those being wins.\nBut Sciver-Brunt's appointment also felt inevitable considering England's lack of other leadership options, having failed to implement a proper succession plan despite the considerable length of Knight's tenure.\nSpinners Charlie Dean, 24, and Sophie Ecclestone, 25, were other potential candidates but are lacking in captaincy experience.\nEngland's home summer consists of white-ball series against West Indies and India, starting in May, while Sciver-Brunt's first major assignment will be the 50-over World Cup, which takes place in India in September.\nEngland to be 'accountable' for fitness - Edwards\nWhat next for England after Lewis' sacking?\nWhile Sciver-Brunt's record when stepping in as captain is positive, two of the three defeats have come in highly pressurised situations, again highlighting England's lack of structure without Knight. \nEngland failed to win a medal at the Commonwealth Games in 2022 when Knight missed the tournament with a hip injury, and the team's fielding imploded against West Indies during the T20 World Cup in 2024, where they went out at the group stage.\nBut Sciver-Brunt could benefit from the opportunity to lead in her own style rather than simply stepping into Knight's shoes for a brief time, while the partnership with Edwards is likely to be a significant boost. \nThe pair have worked together for Mumbai Indians in the Women's Premier League, where they won the title for the second time last month. \nSciver-Brunt played a starring role as the tournament's leading run-scorer with 523 runs in 10 innings at an average of 65.37, and also took 12 wickets. \nBut there will be concerns around her workload when taking on the captaincy, as England's most important batter and one of their most experienced bowlers.\nSciver-Brunt also recently welcomed her first child, a boy named Theodore, with her wife and former England seamer Katherine. \nAnalysis by Chief cricket reporter Stephan Shemilt\nFor all the talk of Charlie Dean, Sophie Ecclestone, or even an outsider like Grace Scrivens taking on the England captaincy, it would have been a shock had anyone other than Nat Sciver-Brunt been given the job.\nThe all-rounder was the previous vice-captain, England's best player and said she wanted the job. When added to her existing relationship with head coach Charlotte Edwards, who herself said she wanted a three-format regular in charge, there was only one candidate.\nThere will be concerns about adding extra responsibility to such a vital player, but there were similar worries when Ben Stokes was made men's captain, and that has proved a masterstroke.\nPerhaps a greater worry is how well leadership will sit with Sciver-Brunt, who took a break from cricket in 2022 to focus on her mental health after standing in as captain for the Commonwealth Games.\nThis is where Edwards will come in. It seems likely that the new coach will do a lot of heavy lifting in terms of leadership, tactics and team culture, while Sciver-Brunt will set the example on the field. Their personalities should complement each other nicely.\nIf the appointment of Sciver-Brunt held little mystery, then the squad for the series against West Indies next month should provide more intrigue, especially with England due to appoint a national selector for the first time.\nEdwards, so knowledgeable when it comes to the domestic game here and abroad, will have her own ideas, while those close to the England team have privately spoken about the need for personnel change.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "The Premier League's bottom two meet at King Power Stadium on Saturday, so will Leicester or Southampton manage to pick up a rare victory?\n\"Saints still need a point to beat Robbie Savage's useless Derby side, and avoid a share of the 'worst Premier League team ever' trophy,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\"But it says it all about how bad both teams have been this season that I still find it hard to back Leicester, even against them. \n\"The Foxes have not even scored at home in the league since 8 December, but if they can't score there against Southampton then they might as well close the whole club down.\"\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against a variety of guests.\nFor week 35, he takes on British-Colombian singer-songwriter Sasha Keable, who supports Arsenal.\nSasha's new single, Act Right, is out now. It has already racked up more than 1.4m views on TikTok.\nDo you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\nKeable was co-signed by Beyonc\u00e9 earlier this year, who named her as an artist who inspired her. She has achieved 2m monthly streams on Spotify and is playing Glastonbury, SXSW, Colors NYC and Meltdown festivals this summer.\nSasha is a singer now but grew up in the centre of the football world - her stepdad, Nick Broad, was head of sports science at Blackburn Rovers and Chelsea, and was working with Carlo Ancelotti as performance manager at Paris St-Germain when he died in a car accident in 2013.\n\"I've seen all sides of football, not just as a fan,\" she told BBC Sport. \"When Carlo got fired by Chelsea, my stepdad was fired too. He didn't know what he was going to do, but then Carlo went to PSG and asked him to go with him.\n\"Sadly he passed away while he was in Paris but we are still close to the Ancelotti family. He and Carlo were such good friends.\n\"I look back now and my stepdad was a real pioneer in his work in sports science and nutrition. The things he introduced, like GPS tracking in training and collecting cardio data, were all new then but they are industry standard now.\n\"It's incredible to see his work live on in that way. Some of his old friends and colleagues reach out to me now when they see me doing my own thing on social media and talk about how his work was incredible. \n\"I always wonder how much further he could have pushed the use of science in football if he was still here, but I'm so pleased you can still see his legacy.\"\nNick Broad (right) celebrates with Carlo Ancelotti (centre) after Chelsea's FA Cup win in 2010, which completed a double of Premier League and FA Cup that season\nBefore becoming a singer, Sasha dreamed of being a footballer herself. Now she settles for collecting shirts instead, with a Tino Asprilla Colombia shirt from 1994 taking pride of place.\n\"I played all the time when I was a kid, from the age of about six,\" explained Sasha.\n\"It was a bit different for girls then because it was before the women's game really took off and you didn't really have a route to becoming a professional in this country. I wanted to go to the United States to play. \n\"I was quite a tomboy so I used to play with the boys all the time - I had to. We did not even have a girls team at my school until my friends and I asked to play with the boys and, after that, they formed a team for us.\n\"Fortunately it's all changed now and football is so much more accessible for girls. If you don't have the chance to try something, how do you know if you will love it?\"\nChris Sutton and Sasha Keable were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nEtihad Stadium, 20:00 BST\nThis should be a great game, because Wolves are so powerful and they will have no fear at all after winning six games in a row.\nBut Manchester City have looked much more solid in the past few weeks and they are on a bit of a roll themselves, with four successive wins in all competitions.\nPep Guardiola's side will look to control this game, the same way they did in the first half of their FA Cup semi-final win over Nottingham Forest, but I don't think they will find it easy to keep Wolves quiet.\nStill, I went against City in their last home game, against Aston Villa, and I was wrong. I am not going to make the same mistake again.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nSasha's prediction: This is a tough game for City but I still think they will win. 2-1\nVilla Park, 12:30 BST\nIt would be easy to say the wheels have come off at Aston Villa, wouldn't it? \nIn the past couple of weeks, they have gone out of the Champions League and FA Cup, and losing their last Premier League game has left them playing catch-up in the top-five race.\nI don't think Unai Emery's side will crumble from here, though, even if Marcus Rashford's season-ending injury is a big blow.\nVilla need to win this, and they also need a big performance from Ollie Watkins. If he starts banging the goals in again then that would be a huge boost for their run-in.\nFulham are a nightmare to predict, as I've mentioned in previous weeks, and they are certainly capable of getting something here.\nI don't think Villa can keep a clean sheet - which probably means they will stop Fulham scoring - but I have a feeling things will click for them in front of goal.\nAlso, they are at home too so, if they need them, their fans can help to get them over the line.\nSutton's prediction: 3-1\nSasha's prediction: I want to back Fulham here, for south-west London. 0-3\nGoodison Park, 15:00 BST\nI am covering this game for BBC Radio 5 Live and I am really looking forward to going to Goodison Park again.\nEverything points towards a home win, despite Everton losing their previous two games. \nIpswich are definitely down now and, while they won't throw in the towel, they might be a little less spirited now they know they are relegated.\nTheir confidence has been sapped over the course of the season and, after watching them recently, I can't back them to get anything here. \nThey were flimsy against Arsenal, then well beaten by Newcastle, and it would be a shock if they scored at all, let alone break my record for the fastest goal scored by an away player at Goodison.\nEverton have stuttered in the past couple of weeks but I don't think that is a bad thing for David Moyes. \nHe has over-achieved since taking charge in January, when the reality is that he has got the same group of players as his predecessor, Sean Dyche, and there needs to be a lot of work done on improving that squad in the summer.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nSasha's prediction: I am not sure if Ipswich will put up as much of a fight now they are relegated. 1-0\nKing Power Stadium, 15:00 BST\nLeicester have been rotten but, somehow, Southampton have been even worse.\nIt's sad to see Jamie Vardy leaving the Foxes at the end of the season, but maybe this might be the send-off he deserves. I am going with him to score the winner.\nThese two teams actually served up a thriller at St Mary's Stadium back in October, when Vardy got one of Leicester's goals as they fought back from 2-0 down to win 3-2.\nI am expecting the same outcome here, just with a lot less excitement. The readers will go for a draw, I am sure of it, but I am pretty confident about Leicester taking this one.\nSutton's prediction: 1-0\nSasha's prediction: It's mad how bad both these teams have been. I don't think either of them will get a goal, let alone the win. 0-0\nEmirates Stadium, 17:30 BST\nWe know how dangerous Bournemouth are, because they beat Arsenal in October, and if Mikel Arteta rests players then this game becomes even harder for the Gunners.\nIt's a tricky situation for Arteta, because he will want to head to Paris St-Germain for the second leg of their Champions League semi-final with a bit of momentum, but he has got to balance that with the risk of injury to his key players.\nBournemouth's form has improved of late, and the circumstances mean they definitely have a decent chance of doing the double over Arsenal this season.\nThis all boils down to what the Arsenal team is, so it is difficult to make a call without knowing that, but they are at home and even if they are not at full strength then I can still see them getting a draw.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nSasha's prediction: It's a strange situation for Arsenal but I am still backing us to win. 2-0\nGtech Community Stadium, 14:00 BST\nWe know Manchester United are going to make changes here, because seeing out the second leg of their Europa League semi-final with Athletic Bilbao is their priority.\nRuben Amorim's side nicked a point at the very end of their game at Bournemouth last weekend, which sparked mass celebrations, but I really don't see them doing the same against Brentford - they won't be getting the bunting out this time.\nThe Bees are such a dangerous team when they come forward and they will keep on attacking United. Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa should get plenty of chances and I can see them getting a goal or two between them.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nSasha's prediction: I just have a feeling United will nick this. 0-1\nAmex Stadium, 14:00 BST\nBrighton got back to winning ways last weekend thanks to Carlos Baleba's brilliant late strike against West Ham.\nThe Seagulls beat Newcastle at St James' Park earlier in the season too, but that was before Eddie Howe's side hit their stride, and it is a big ask for Brighton to repeat that result.\nNewcastle were just relentless in their win over Ipswich and another three points here would be massive in their bid for a top-five finish - I don't think they will get them, but we will see a few goals.\nSutton's prediction: 2-2\nSasha's prediction: Newcastle will take this one. 0-2\nLondon Stadium, 14:00 BST\nThis is 17th versus 16th in the Premier League which tells you how bad both teams have been this season.\nEveryone knows Tottenham's focus will be on their Europa League semi-final second leg with Bodo/Glimt so I think West Ham boss Graham Potter needs a result here more than Ange Postecoglou.\nPotter's results have been poor since he took over from Julen Lopetegui in January and the Hammers fans have not had the upturn they wanted in the way their team play either.\nSpurs can still be dangerous even when they are out of form but Ange is not going to pick his strongest team. That gives West Ham a better chance of getting the win they badly need, but I don't see them doing it in style.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nSasha's prediction: I don't want to say Tottenham will win, but I think they will. 1-2\nStamford Bridge, 16:30 BST\nI would usually be asking which Chelsea side will turn up, but that applies to Liverpool too this week.\nArne Slot's side could have been out all week celebrating their title win and we don't know how that will affect them.\nYou often play at your best when you have been on the lash in a scenario like theirs. For example, some of my best games for Celtic came after nights out where we had won something and were allowed to have a couple of beers, but I don't know what to expect here.\nChelsea have nicked a couple of results recently, to stay in the race for the top five, but their performances have not been too convincing and their fans still don't seem to have taken to Enzo Maresca's playing style.\nThis is not the test for them that it would be if Liverpool were trying to close out the title but I don't think Slot is the type to let anyone take their foot off the gas. He will put out a strong team and even if they play with more freedom, I still think Liverpool will leave with the points.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2\nSasha's prediction: I still have a connection with Chelsea because of my stepdad and I have got to back them here. 3-0\nSelhurst Park, 20:00 BST\nCrystal Palace will be on a high after booking their place in the FA Cup final, so this is another very tricky game for Nottingham Forest, who slipped up at home against Brentford on Thursday.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side will have to be stubborn and resolute to get anything at Selhurst Park. They have shown that kind of character plenty of times already this season but they really need it now.\nLooking at the race for the top five you feel like every team involved needs to win every game, but of course that is not going to happen, and I can see my boyhood team Forest dropping more points here. I just hope it doesn't prove crucial for them.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nSasha's prediction: It's got to be Palace here. I am loyal to the London teams! 3-0\nChris got five correct results with one exact score from the nine Premier League games he predicted in week 34, giving him a total of 80 points.\nHe beat his guest, golf hero Lee Westwood, who got four correct results with no exact scores, leaving him on 40 points and tied with the BBC readers, who also got five correct results with one exact score.\nWestwood and the BBC readers were wrong about both FA Cup semi-finals, while Chris correctly picked City to beat Forest and wrongly thought Aston Villa would beat Crystal Palace. Those ties do not count towards the weekly totals.\nThe other game from week 34, Manchester City's 2-1 win over Aston Villa, took place on 22 April and does not count towards the weekly result either.\nSherelle, the guest in week 33, made the prediction instead of Westwood and picked up 40 points for the guests' overall total (but not her own individual tally) with an exact score. Chris and the BBC readers both went for a 2-1 Villa win.",

        "article_text": "With days left to the election, Australian opposition candidates have been wooing a crucial group that turned its back on the conservative Liberal-National coalition in the last election: Chinese Australian voters.\nAnd they are trying to reach them on platforms that their party once talked of banning over national security concerns: Chinese social media apps like WeChat and RedNote.\nNearly six in 10 Chinese Australians use WeChat at least once a day, according to a poll by Lowy Institute in 2022.\nGrange Chung, who is contesting the New South Wales' seat of Reid, held by the left-leaning Labor party with a 3.2% margin, said in a video on WeChat that he chose to start his career in the navy \"to give back to the country that embraced my family when we arrived with very little\".\n\"Australia gave us a home... Let me finish what I started,\" he said in a video montage that included scenes of him putting up campaign posters and interacting with the electorate.\nDespite making up just 5.5% of Australia's population, Chinese Australians were said to be a crucial to the Labor party's win in 2022, which broke nearly a decade of rule by the Liberal-National coalition. \nChinese Australians have traditionally leaned conservative, but in several seats with  large Chinese Australian populations, the Liberals saw swings away three times larger than in other seats.\nSome analysts say the community turned its back on the Coalition because they felt its government did not handle racist attacks well during the pandemic, while others point to the then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison's anti-China rhetoric.\nAnd now, with their chances of winning narrowing, according to polls, Liberal candidates have been stepping up their battle for votes in marginal seats, many of which have large populations of Chinese Australians. \nIn order to be in with a chance of winning Reid, Grange Chung knows he needs to win over the suburb of Burwood, an area often billed as Sydney's second Chinatown, with Mandarin and Cantonese dominating conversations and the signboards for shops and restaurants.\nA former commercial pilot, Chung started posting on WeChat in February and has in recent months shared his interviews with Asian business owners, Lunar New Year greetings, and his promises to the community, where about one in five voters are ethnically Chinese. One post saw him quoting Sun Tzu's philosophy.\nHe is far from the only Liberal candidate to target the platform, with University of Melbourne researcher Fan Yang finding more than 220 authorised Liberal ads had been placed on WeChat since January, compared to about 35 for Labor.\nHenry Luo, secretary of the Reid Business Community, says he has observed more \"extensive targeting\" of Chinese Australian voters in this campaign, including candidates displaying ad banners on popular WeChat accounts and collaborating with well-known Chinese celebrities or influencers.\n\"I think it is an effective platform to reach the Chinese-speaking community. We discuss and debate plenty of political issues on WeChat,\" says Mr Luo, who moved to Australia for work in 2008.\nEven non-ethnic Chinese politicians have established a presence on the platforms, sharing videos of themselves enjoying Chinese cuisine and festivals.\nLiberal MP Keith Wolohan's channel has clips of him celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival with his kids and enjoying spicy Hunan food with his father. Wolohan is defending his marginal seat in Menzies, Victoria.\nBut visibility on Chinese apps is not guaranteed to translate to votes, says Qiuping Pan, a lecturer in Chinese Studies at the University of Melbourne.\nThe Chinese Australian electorate have become more \"politically mature\", she says, adding that many may instead consider voting for independent candidates, whom some believe can better advocate for local communities because they do not tow party lines.\n\"Based on the last election, they know that their votes are important and have an impact. When they are portrayed negatively, they know they can fight back,\" she says.\nSome are frustrated that the community is being \"seen merely for votes\".\n\"When Chinese Australians want to be politically involved at a deeper level, we are sometimes cast as suspicious characters,\" says Sydney resident Erin Chew.\nShe points to how Liberal senator Jane Hume recently accused Asian volunteers for independent MP Monique Ryan of being \"Chinese spies\".\n\"This sort of narrative has been normalised by politicians and the media, which is why Australia's political environment is so problematic,\" she says.\nThese are precisely the concerns that candidates want to address on their social media channels.\nIn the New South Wales' seat of Bennelong, where nearly one in three people have Chinese ancestry, Liberal contender Scott Yung has his WeChat posts overlayed with Mandarin subtitles and audio translation. \nIt is likely to help him reach more voters: English proficiency is low - at about 25% to 26% - among Australians who primarily speak Mandarin or Cantonese at home, according to government data.\nIn 2022, Labor snatched the Liberal stronghold seat for only the second time in more than 70 years. It now holds Bennelong by a razor-thin margin.\nA recent clip shows Yung, who runs an education business, stressing what he calls the \"so, so important\" relationship between China and Australia: \"It's important for Australia, it's important for Australian businesses.\"\nHow the country manages its ties with China has an everyday impact on the lives of Chinese Australians, says Osmond Chiu, a research fellow at the Victoria-based Per Capita think tank.\n\"[The community's] concerns will include increased racism, the effect on those who do business with China and what it means for people with family in China,\" he says.\nFor some voters, the Liberals' campaign blitz on social media does not sync with its anti-migrant rhetoric. \"[Coalition leader] Peter Dutton has talked about slashing migration and international student numbers. We're feeling quite anxious about it,\" says Alex Wang, who works at a restaurant in Reid.",

        "article_text": "The government has made very little progress in preparing the UK for the growing threats posed by rising temperatures since coming to power, its climate watchdog has warned.\nIn a highly critical report, the independent Climate Change Committee says progress is \"either too slow, has stalled, or is heading in the wrong direction\".\nFrom hospitals and care homes to food and water supplies, this could leave the UK vulnerable to serious economic and health impacts in the decades ahead, the CCC warns.\nIn response, the government pointed to its investment in flood defences, but acknowledged more work was needed. \nFloods Minister Emma Hardy told BBC News that preparing for the changing climate was \"something we're really committed to\".\n\"We are putting \u00a32.65bn into upgrading, maintaining and building new flood defences.\n\"But we absolutely know, of course, there's more that needs to be done.\"\nFuelled by climate change, the UK's weather extremes are intensifying, from the 40C heat of July 2022 to England's wettest 18 months on record between October 2022 to March 2024.\nSuch events are only likely to become more severe and happen more often, as the planet continues to get hotter due to humanity's emissions of planet-warming gases.\nBetter preparation can limit the damage by making the country more resilient, but the CCC says this is not happening at anywhere near the required pace.\n\"We are seeing climate impact happening faster and more intensely and increasing [but] government just doesn't yet seem to be taking it seriously,\" Baroness Brown, chair of the Adaptation Committee at the CCC, told BBC News.\n\"The manifesto said it was going to address this issue of resilience and yet, so far, it's done nothing,\" she added.\n\"We've heard some warm words\u2026 but nothing has come out yet.\"\nNone of the 46 areas assessed were found to be making \"good\" progress in adapting to climate change. Only three had \"good\" plans and policies in place for the future.\nThese are mostly unchanged from the CCC's last report in 2023.\nHealth is one of the areas that remains most poorly prepared.\nThe CCC points to the rising number of deaths linked to extreme heat and hospitals themselves being vulnerable to hot weather.\nBaroness Brown highlights the case of Guy's and St Thomas', the biggest hospital trust in London, which was hit by a failure to its data centres during the extreme heat of July 2022.\nThis meant it was unable to operate its appointments system at a time of intense demand, and it had to move to paper appointments.\n\"We lost thousands of crucial appointments for people for critical tests,\" she said.\n\"We're trying to improve the NHS. Unless we take into account that it has to be resilient to the climate, we're going backwards.\"\nFlooding is another challenging area. Plans and policies to ensure places are resilient to river and coastal flooding are found to have worsened since the CCC's previous report.\nThe ancient town of Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire is a case in point. It's been flooded repeatedly in the last four years, most recently in November 2024.\nPolly Pearce described how her charity shop flooded.\n\"It was so quick...  [like] a tsunami,\" she said.\n\"[The water] came up as high as the panelling right up on the wall... we had all our Christmas stuff ready but lost it.\"\nThe main street is studded with empty shops, many reportedly put out of business by the cost of repeated floods. \nShop owners say insurance companies either won't insure their properties or that the premiums are now so high many shop keepers say they simply can't afford it.\nAnd the Environment Agency has said it can't afford the \u00a325m-\u00a330m cost of flood protection for the town. \nThe government says it is committed to helping residents, however, and that work to improve the flood resilience of properties will begin in the summer.\nThe CCC notes progress in some other areas of climate adaptation, such as plans to identify risks to businesses and financial institutions.\nAt the heart of these discussions is the question of cost.\nBut putting off efforts to prepare the UK for the changing climate in an attempt to save cash would be \"a huge mistake\" and could increase economic damage in the long run, Baroness Brown said.\n\"We are very worried about their spending review,\" she added, in an unusually strong plea from the Committee.\n\"This is not a tomorrow problem; it's a today problem. If we don't address it today, it becomes a disaster tomorrow.\"\nA freedom of information request submitted by the BBC found there are just 18 members of staff working fully on climate adaptation at the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra).\nThat's just 0.3% of Defra's nearly 6,600 full-time-equivalent core staff.\nDefra said some of these employees also worked on climate adaptation part-time, and the figures don't include those working in other parts of government.\n\nAdditional reporting by Miho Tanaka\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

The government says it is committed to helping residents, however, and that work to improve the flood resilience of properties will begin in the summer.The CCC notes progress in some other areas of climate adaptation, such as plans to identify risks to businesses and financial institutions. \"We are seeing climate impact happening faster and more intensely and increasing [but] government just doesn't yet seem to be taking it seriously,\" Baroness Brown, chair of the Adaptation Committee at the CCC, told BBC News. \"A freedom of information request submitted by the BBC found there are just 18 members of staff working fully on climate adaptation at the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra).That's just 0.3% of Defra's nearly 6,600 full-time-equivalent core staff.Defra said some of these employees also worked on climate adaptation part-time, and the figures don't include those working in other parts of government.Additional reporting by Miho TanakaArea burned by UK wildfires in 2025 already at annual recordOne in four properties at flood risk by 2050 - reportUK getting more hot and more wet days \u2013 Met OfficeSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nVitor Pereira - I want to build something stronger with Wolves\nVitor Pereira walks up the stairs of a pub in Shropshire, sits and puts his pint down. \n\"I'm in a good mood today, the weather is good, more beer, please,\" jokes the Wolves head coach, who adds that he enjoys a pint of Stella.\nPereira is holding court at a round table upstairs in a country pub just outside Wolverhampton, five months into his reign at Molineux. \nThis is not some gimmick he has done before at other clubs. The relationship with media in other countries - Pereira has worked in Portugal, Brazil, Greece, Turkey, Saudi and China - is very different. \nBut if interviewing a Premier League manager in a pub sounds both highly unusual and also a throwback to the 1980s, the setting makes more sense given the 56-year-old's habit of celebrating wins by \"being with the people\".\n\"First the points, then the pints\" was a phrase coined by Pereira which has transferred to the stands, with the words now adorning a banner at Molineux. \nIt came as Wolves battled the drop, but a run of six straight wins, their best in the top flight for 55 years, has the club now safely mid-table in the Premier League. \nPereira has endeared himself to Wolves supporters, and the city, with his desire to understand them and the area. \nTrips to the local Wetherspoons near the train station after victories have become a fixture - with Molineux serenading him with 'We'll see you in 'Spoons' during Saturday's 3-0 win over Leicester.\n\"What do we do in Wolverhampton after a game? If I lose the game I stay home and drink my beer alone. If I win the game, I go with the supporters to celebrate,\"  Pereira tells BBC Sport.\n\"The connection with the people is stronger when we suffer together and, when you are in a situation where you are fighting for survival, you feel this connection.\n\"In the moments we are suffering, you feel we are suffering together. In the moments of celebration, you need to be with them.\n\"In Wolverhampton, where do you want me to go? I must go to a pub, because this is the culture and where people go.\n\"When I go to a pub it's not about the beer. Of course I like the beer but I go to be with the people, to feel that I'm doing something to make them happy, to make them proud.\n\"Work, home, then we go to a pub just for a beer or two beers and finish. This is our life.\"\nWolves have adopted Vitor Pereira's phrase after his success at Molineux \nThe down-to-earth philosophy comes from Pereira's upbringing.\nGrowing up on the coast in Espinho, 10 miles south of Porto, he recalls the harsh conditions he endured which have shaped him. \n\"It was a very humble village with fishermen and we grew up on the street,\" he said. \n\"Fighting together, fighting for the space. Competing and fighting. But this is what I have inside of me. This is the power.\n\"My house was 50 metres from the beach. At the time my father didn't have money so we lived in a 'basement'.\n\"The sea, in the winter, came strong, without barriers. Every winter, for three months, there was water inside. We had to rebuild the house. Every time there was water in the walls and a bad smell. I felt ashamed because my clothes smelled.\n\"You felt wet every time, that was our life.\n\"[Yet] I was a very happy teenager at the time because in this kind of community we have the confident guys together. When I look back, this power I feel inside of me came from this time.\"\nVisit all of BBC Sport's Wolves content\nHis playing career, Pereira readily admits, was underwhelming. He played as a midfielder for lesser-known Portuguese clubs Avanca, Oliveirense, Esmoriz, Estarreja, Fiaes and Sao Joao de Ver and retired at 28. \nYet it was enough to help put him through a sports course at the University of Porto, as he finished second in his class while completing his coaching qualifications. \n\"I had a career, it was in the third division in Portugal but I got the money to do my course, to go to the university, to buy my car, to buy my clothes,\" he said. \n\"Since I was 16 years-old, I never asked for one euro from my parents. After 16, small jobs, to get money, to go to the discos.\n\"On Saturdays, I was a lifeguard on the beach. They paid me a lot of money. I saw the sun and I saved people.\n\"I was 18 and 19 at that time - no worries. I went to the university. I did some small jobs to get some money and I started to save. I'm now 56. But my sons will spend the money, don't worry!\"\nHis three sons are all in their 20s and Pereira, who always felt being a coach was his calling, does not want - or expect - them to follow him into football. \n\"The sacrifices you have to make. I don't want this life for my sons,\" he says. \n\"They cannot have a family life in this job. It's impossible. We have a lot of moments where we suffer a lot and alone. I think we are always in a pre-depression.\n\"For me, the competition is like a drug. Passion and a drug. I cannot live without it because after one month I start to be nervous. I cannot enjoy nothing.\"\nPereira met BBC Sport and other journalists in a local pub for an on-record interview\n\"I want to recharge with their energy\" - Pereira celebrates with Wolves fans after beating Manchester United\nIt is clear Pereira misses his family, having travelled the globe since he started managing Padroense juniors in 2003. \nHe eventually became Porto assistant, to Andre Villas-Boas, and was in that role when they won the Europa League in 2011, replacing Villas-Boas when he moved to Chelsea.\nHis first game was against Pep Guardiola's Barcelona in the Super Cup, a 2-0 defeat,  but he won successive Primeira Liga titles before joining Al-Ahli and then Olympiacos, lifting the Greek Super League.\nSpells at 1860 Munich, Shanghai, Fenerbahce, Corinthians, Flamengo and Al Shabab followed before he joined Wolves, yet the intensity of management is not something which bothers him. \nHe said: \"I cannot speak about this because I don't want to cry, I have moments in my life. When I arrived in Brazil, I went to Corinthians. If you see the stadium of Corinthians and Flamengo, they have millions of supporters.\n\"When I met the press they ask me, 'Vitor, you don't feel the pressure?'. I'll tell you about the pressure. The pressure was when my father had cancer, my brother was dying, my mother was crying.\n\"When we deal with this, football is football. I don't feel any pressure, nothing. Zero. believe me.\"\nWolves go to Manchester City on Friday without pressure - after their 1-0 win at Manchester United in April that sealed survival with five games remaining.\nThere will be change in the summer after this season's brush with relegation. Matheus Cunha is expected to leave, with Manchester United interested, and the Brazil forward, who has scored 15 goals, has a \u00a362.5m release clause. \nPereira insists he cannot second-guess what will happen with Cunha, but that he will \"wish him the best\" either way. He says the 25-year-old has not directly told him he wants to leave, but is adamant he needs the power to shape the squad. \nMany will feel he has earned it. \nOnly champions Liverpool and Newcastle have won more games than Pereira's 10 in his 18 matches since he replaced Gary O'Neil in December - while Wolves have won more points than relegated trio of Ipswich, Leicester and Southampton combined in that same period.\nWolves were second bottom and five points adrift of the Foxes when he took over, they are now 23 ahead and 13th. Pereira will not need to buy another drink in Wolverhampton. \n\"Every time, I think I can do better and better and better because I just expressed half of myself,\" he adds. \n\"I have a lot to prove. If I'm in the right place to challenge me, I can do magic. Believe me.\"\n'A talent that comes along every 50 years' - 'genius' Yamal steals show\nEx-West Ham boss Lopetegui named Qatar manager",

He is likely to be joined in the squad by Matthew Potts (10 caps), Josh Tongue (two) and uncapped Essex man Sam Cook.\nA combination in the XI of Atkinson, Tongue and Cook would have 13 caps between them. Not since Zimbabwe's last Test in this country 22 years ago has England's pace attack looked so callow at home, when Steve Harmison, James Anderson and Richard Johnson had a combined seven caps.\nIndeed, England have played only one home Test without any of Woakes, Anderson or Stuart Broad in the past 18 years.\nAlthough Zimbabwe are improving \u2013 they have just earned a creditable 1-1 series draw in Bangladesh \u2013 England will be overwhelming favourites to win the four-day Test when it begins on 22 May.\nFollowing that, the five-match series at home to India and the Ashes away in Australia this winter will shape the leadership legacies of Stokes, coach Brendon McCullum and director of cricket Rob Key.\n'Times have changed, one clip can earn an England call-up'\nWe've said naive things, but we do care - Wood\nWoakes has not played yet this season because of an ankle problem, while Wood is out until July following knee surgery.\nBrydon Carse remains sidelined with a foot problem and Olly Stone will not play before the back end of the summer after his own knee operation. Ollie Robinson, who has won 20 Test caps, has not played for England in more than a year and lost his central contract in October.\nAll-rounder Stokes, with 210 Test wickets, has more scalps than any other active England bowler, though his bowling is likely to be restricted. An injury sustained in the third Test against New Zealand in December was the second time in five months the talismanic captain had hurt his left hamstring.\nStokes will look to build his bowling in the run-up to the India series, when England will hope to have Woakes and Carse available. Jofra Archer could play his first red-ball game in four years for England Lions against India A in June. Speaking on Wednesday, Wood did not rule out a return for the conclusion of the India series.\nFor now, Atkinson will lead the attack following his stunning debut year in Test cricket while Potts played in England's last Test in New Zealand.\nTongue has not played for England for two years because of injuries but has enjoyed a superb start to the season with Nottinghamshire.\nCook, 27, has been the outstanding bowler in domestic cricket for some time, grabbing 318 first-class wickets at an average under 20.\nHe is not blessed with high pace and has had to wait for his chance, yet an indication an England call-up was on the horizon came when it was requested he be rested from Essex's Championship match against Worcestershire last month.\nIf England feel they want further pace cover in the squad, it could come from 20-year-old left-armer Josh Hull, who made his Test debut last summer, or Hampshire's exciting prospect Sonny Baker. Baker has played only three first-class matches but was given an England development contract in February.\nOther areas of selection look more straightforward. Jamie Smith will return behind the stumps after missing the tour of New Zealand on paternity leave, while there is no suggestion Shoaib Bashir's place as the number one spinner is under threat.\nAny decisions over the top five will be delayed by Jacob Bethell's stint at the Indian Premier League.

You can probably guess what he is like...\"\nA lot of people have been asking. Because a lot of people have been watching.\nIt is not just what Pollock has done in the past 12 months - winning the Under-20 World Cup, scoring two tries on his senior England debut, being nominated for the Champions Cup player of the year, preparing to line up against Leinster in Saturday's semi-final and butting into the Lions selection conversation.\nIt is the way he has done it.\nThe 20-year-old back row has swagger and self-possession, and a side order of skulduggery.\nThere has been no dutiful trade-learning and spur-earning.\nInstead, just prodigious talent, Tigger-ish energy, galloping pace and a presumption that the world is his for the taking.\nIt gets people talking. And has done for a while.\nEighteen months ago a video circulated among Bedford's players.\nThey had been told that Pollock, then only 18, was joining them in the Championship on loan.\n\"He came with a little bit of a reputation as he was very well thought of by Saints' academy,\" says Bedford's Alex Woolford.\n\"This viral clip of him did the rounds among us. He was being interviewed after an England Under-18 win over South Africa and swore three times in about 10 seconds.\n\"We knew he was going to be very enthusiastic.\"\nHe was.\n\"We were pretty poor in the first half against Ampthill,\" adds Woolford, remembering Pollock's first start.\n\"Henry tried to give us the hairdryer treatment.

It is something I relish.\"\nThis weekend he will be digging into Leinster in a re-run of last season's Champions Cup semi-final.\nThe Irish giants could field back-row trio Caelan Doris, Josh van der Flier and Jack Conan.\n\"It is probably one of the best back rows there is,\" says Pollock. \"I am just excited to be able to say I played against them. To share the field with them is special.\"\nBut the deference won't last past the first whistle.\n\"They are beatable,\" he adds. \"We definitely see parts of their game we can attack and go after and hopefully ruffle a few feathers.\"\nIf Pollock's streak of success extends to the Aviva Stadium and his final and toughest Lions audition, he could well make the squad cut five days later.\n\"I have heard the rumours and stuff, but as a player you can't control that,\" he says.\n\"I just have to keep playing well, and if it happens, it happens.\"\nSo far in his career, things invariably do.\nPollock played in England A's win over an Australia second string at the start of this season before being promoted into the senior side",

        "article_text": "The trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, one of the most successful rappers and music moguls in the US, starts in New York on 5 May with jury selection. \nThe charges against him include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted, he could face life in prison.\nThe rapper also faces dozens of lawsuits from individuals who accuse him of using his power to drug, assault, rape, intimidate and silence people.\nMr Combs has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and rejected the individual lawsuits as attempts \"for a quick payday\".\nMr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - emerged into the hip-hop scene in the 1990s.\nHis early music career success included helping launch the careers of Mary J Blige and Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or the Notorious B.I.G.\nHis music label Bad Boy Records became one of the most important labels in rap and expanded to include Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112, Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez.\nMr Combs also had a prolific business career outside of music, including a deal with British drinks company Diageo to promote the French vodka brand, C\u00eeroc.\nIn 2023, he released his fifth record The Love Album: Off The Grid and earned his first solo nomination at the Grammy awards. He also was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards.\nIn a federal criminal case, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex trafficking and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution.  \nMany of the most severe allegations relate to the racketeering conspiracy charge.\nIt includes accusations of kidnapping, drugging, and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes using firearms or threats of violence.\nIn a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as \u201cfreak offs\u201d, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.\nSeparately, Mr Combs faces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault.\nTony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US have either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or will do so.\nIn December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was \"gang raped\" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack. \nMr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity.\"\nHis current legal issues began when he was sued by his ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, in late 2023.  She accused him of violently abusing and raping her. \nThat lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.\nSince then, dozens of people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all claims. \nHis controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CCTV footage leaked by CNN showed Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor in 2016.\nHe apologised for his behaviour, saying: \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"\nMr Combs has consistently denied the allegations made against him in the civil lawsuits, describing them as \"sickening\" and suggesting they were made by \"individuals looking for a quick payday\".\nIn a statement to the BBC about the federal criminal charges, his lawyer said: \"Mr Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process.\n\"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"\nDiddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss an aspect of the federal indictment in which he is accused of transportation to engage in prostitution. His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race.\nIn a hearing in New York a week before the trial, his attorneys told the court that the rapper led the \"lifestyle\" of a \"swinger\" and was not a criminal. \nThey said he thought it was \"appropriate\" to have multiple sex partners, including sex workers. \nAt the same hearing, prosecutors revealed that Mr Combs had rejected a plea deal. \nMr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, since his arrest on 16 September 2024.\nHis lawyers have argued for his release, citing the jail\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d conditions. \nCritics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, with a culture of violence. \nA New York federal judge denied the bail request, describing Mr Combs as a \u201cserious flight risk\u201d.\nProsecutors have alleged that Mr Combs has been breaking prison rules by contacting potential witnesses. \nThey accuse him of \"relentless efforts\" to \"corruptly influence witness testimony\".\nThe trial is scheduled to begin on 5 May.\nThe first days of the trial will be for jury selection, with the trial starting in earnest after the panel is selected. \nProsecutor Emily Johnson told the judge that the government will need three weeks to present its case.\nDefence lawyer Marc Agnifilo said the rapper's team will need a week for theirs.\nMr Combs' trial - scheduled to take place at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in New York City - is expected to be public.\nAll of his court proceedings thus far have been open to the media and the public, but have not been livestreamed.\nMost federal courts do not allow cameras or electronics in the courtroom.\nMr Combs faces up to life in prison if convicted on the racketeering charge.\nHe faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of sex trafficking.\nTransportation for purposes of prostitution carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.",

        "article_text": "Cristina Horez, an influencer from the Northern city of Iasi \nRomanians are returning to the polls this weekend, following the unprecedented cancellation of presidential elections last December which fuelled protests and nationwide turmoil.\nFar-right candidate Calin Georgescu's shock victory in the first round of elections was annulled amid accusations of Russian interference, suspicious TikTok accounts and secret payments to online influencers. Moscow denied interfering in the election.\nGeorgescu is now banned from running, and was detained, facing a criminal investigation including attempting to overthrow constitutional order. He has denied the charges and accused the authorities of \"inventing evidence to justify stealing the election\".\nThe leader of Romania's far-right AUR party, George Simion, has been polling as the frontrunner in the first round of the election re-run on Sunday.\nHe is followed in the polls by Crin Antonescu of the National Liberal Party and independent candidate Nicu\u0219or Dan.\nAt the centre of this unprecedented political crisis are TikTok influencers accused by the Romanian authorities of participating in social media campaigns which artificially boosted Georgescu's online presence. The BBC has spoken to some of them.\nProtesters took to the streets in March, after it was announced Georgescu couldn't run in the May elections. \nPro-Russian independent candidate Calin Georgescu's victory in the first round of elections came as a surprise.\nGeorgescu was relatively unknown in the months before the election, polling at between 3-5%. \nHe declared a zero campaign budget, had no campaign office and didn't engage in traditional campaigning. \nInstead, he focused on TikTok videos including some showing him riding horses in traditional Romanian outfits, and practising judo. He went viral on TikTok weeks before the election and soared in the polls, ultimately winning almost 23% of the vote.\nAn independent think tank, Expert Forum, published a report saying Georgescu's explosive rise on TikTok was \"created suddenly and artificially - consistent with the way he exploded in the polls\".\nAuthorities say TikTok's algorithm was exploited in the November vote in three different ways: over 100  influencers for hire who posted paid content indirectly promoting Georgescu, thousands of inauthentic accounts whose comments boosted Georgescu on the platform, and finally a \"King of TikTok\" who supposedly paid thousands of dollars to facilitate the campaign.\nThe authorities said that one of these campaigns was \"identical\" to an operation \"run by the Russian Federation in Ukraine\".\nSeparately, declassified intelligence documents also stated that Russia carried out \"cyberattacks, leaks, and sabotage\" in Romania.\nBut authorities still haven't provided any concrete evidence of Russian interference in the election, frustrating many Romanians. \nThe Foreign Intelligence Services and Romanian Police declined to comment on ongoing investigations.\nCalin Georgescu has been barred from running in May's re-run of the election\nShortly before the election, a campaign using the hashtag \"stability and integrity\" flooded Romanian TikTok. Influencers uploaded videos describing what they were looking for in a future president: \"stability\", \"progress\", \"a patriot\". \nThey did not name a specific candidate.\nThey had been paid to upload videos with these messages through a marketing platform called FameUp, which allows brands to hire influencers at scale to promote products. But the influencers say they didn't know who paid for it. \nFameUp declined to comment to the BBC.\nCristina, an influencer from the city of Iasi, says that when she took the job she felt \"there was nothing shady about it\". She says \"in the back of [her] mind\" she thought one of the 14 candidates likely paid for it and she \"just thought it was a smart approach. That's not doing any political propaganda. It's just encouraging people to go out and vote\".\nSome influencers did not mark the posts as paid content. This goes against TikTok rules, where paid political advertising is banned.\nWhile the adverts didn't mention Georgescu's name, influencers we spoke to described a \"wave of comments\" supporting him that appeared under the videos. Romeo Rusu, a micro-influencer from the city of Constanta with 25,000 followers, said: \"Right after I posted the video, within a few seconds, I started receiving dozens of comments. In the end, I received around 300 comments, all backing the independent candidate Calin Georgescu\u2026 I was absolutely surprised.\"\nThe comments came into focus after TikTok stated in a report it had removed a network of over 27,000 inauthentic accounts that \"used fictitious personas to post comments related to the Romanian elections\".\nIt is still not clear who created these bot accounts.\nExperts say that flooding unrelated videos with pro-Georgescu comments was a tactic to game TikTok's algorithm and get his name trending, which would in turn push his content into more users' feeds.\nA TikTok spokesperson told the BBC that, during the presidential campaign, the company \"blocked millions of fake engagement attempts, removed hundreds of thousands of spam accounts, prevented impersonation of political candidates, and disrupted three covert influence networks with limited reach\".\n\"We continue to work closely with local and EU authorities and partner with local organisations to elevate reliable election information,\" they said.\nThe uncertainty around the campaign lasted into the new year, until a surprising twist in January. \nThe Romanian Tax Authority revealed that the #stabilityandintegrity campaign was paid for by the centre-right National Liberal Party (PNL), who were backing their own candidate in the elections. \nIn response, the PNL told Romanian journalists at news outlet Snoop that their campaign was hijacked to support Georgescu.\nRomeo couldn't understand why he'd been named in declassified documents\nThen, in March, TikTok influencer Bogdan Peschir was arrested for \"corrupting voters through electronic means of communication\". Peschir was known across Romania as the \"King of TikTok\", famous for awarding influencers with TikTok gifts, online tokens worth real money.\nThe prosecution is reported to have claimed that Peschir paid over $900,000 to over 250 influencers \"to induce them to vote for \"a certain candidate\" in the presidential elections\" via TikTok gifts. \nHis lawyers are reported to have said \"none of the donations made by Peschir on TikTok were for electoral purposes\".\nWe spoke to Lucian Elgi, a musician and influencer who admitted being paid thousands of dollars by Peschir via TikTok gifts. \nHe says he believes these payments were made in support of his work as a musician. Elgi denied that he promoted Georgescu. The BBC could not confirm this, as his videos on TikTok \u2013 along with those by others who were paid by Peschir's TikTok handle \u2013 have been removed.\nElgi says his content wasn't about the election, but about manele music, a genre of pop-folk music with roots in the Roma community.  Several high-profile manele musicians have been accused of taking payments from Peschir to campaign for Georgescu.\nElgi said this content was flooded in pro-Georgescu comments. \"It was madness,\" he says. \"Every single post, comments like: Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President!\"\nMuch is unknown about the election's annulment. Investigations are ongoing at the European Commission and Romania's highest courts. While Romanians are concerned about the alleged foreign interference, many are outraged that there is still no publicly available evidence undeniably proving Russian interference in the election.\nIt's painstaking and complex work untangling an influence operation and its effects. Razvan Lutac, the Editor of Romanian news outlet Snoop, fears it could take a very long time to get clarity.\n\"We have these small pieces now, like a puzzle,\" he says, \"I think that maybe in a year or two years we will have a complete image of why they cancelled the elections.\"\nAdditional reporting by Georgiana Tudor and Oana Marocico.",

        "article_text": "One week after a devastating militant attack near the mountain resort of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, the town wears a look of quiet desolation, although tourists have begun trickling back in small numbers.\nThe main high street, abandoned by visitors last week - with shops shuttered and hotels completely emptied out - is seeing fleeting signs of life again.\nLast Tuesday, militants opened fire on people, mostly tourists, who were visiting Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5 km) from Pahalgam, often described as the \"Switzerland of India\".\nThe attack was one of the deadliest in recent years, devastating the lives of many families and sparking widespread anger in India.\nIn the days since, tensions between India and Pakistan, which both claim Kashmir in full but administer it only in part, have significantly risen, with each side announcing retaliatory measures against the other.\nThere is now growing speculation about whether there will be a military response from Delhi. The government in Kashmir has closed down over half the tourist destinations in the valley, as authorities review the security situation and carry out search operations. \nWhile violence has often broken out in the region, with militants targeting security forces and civilians since an insurgency broke out in 1989, the brazen killing of tourists has been rare and has shocked local businesses and tourists alike.\nTourism is a mainstay of the economy in places like Pahalgam and there's now fear that many livelihoods might be irrevocably hit.\nAt a \"selfie point\" outside town, overlooking lush meadows and a rushing river, Akshay Solanki, a tourist from Mumbai, said there was \"panic\" among his group of travellers on the day of the attack. But they had decided to continue with their journey because flights back home had become unaffordable.\nOther tourists said constant reassurances from the locals and security forces had given them a sense of comfort. A driver who had brought visitors from the capital, Srinagar, told BBC Hindi that he was pleading with those visiting not to \"distance\" themselves from Kashmir.\nAfter a washout three days, shawl-seller Rafi Ahmed said he'd managed to sell just a few pieces and feared for his livelihood in the long run if tourists stopped coming.\nAmong those exhorting tourists to come to Pahalgam was Bollywood actor Atul Kulkarni, who visited the town days after the attack. He told BBC Hindi, if the message from the militants was \"don't come here, we should respond by coming in even larger numbers\".\n\"Don't cancel bookings, cancel your other plans and come here,\" Kulkarni said.\nBut uncertainty and apprehension loom large in Pahalgam and it could take several years before a sense of normalcy is restored, local business owners and residents told the BBC.\nIndian authorities have launched combing operations in the region, detaining hundreds of people and destroying homes belonging to alleged militants.\nIndia and Pakistan have also reportedly exchanged small arms fire across the border.\nThe escalation in tensions is keeping tourists and business owners on tenterhooks.\nIndian authorities have often claimed Kashmir witnessed a period of relative peace after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked its autonomous status in 2019. Ahead of India's general elections in 2024, Modi hailed the \"freedom\" that had come to the region, saying Kashmir was touching new heights of development because it was breathing freely.\nTop leaders pointed to high tourism numbers - some 23 million last year and millions more in the years before - as proof of a big boom after years of unquiet. But last week's attacks have, yet again, shattered any idea of lasting peace in the restive valley.\n\"This [attack] is a blot on us\u2026How we wipe it off is a long-term concern,\" Rafi Ahmed Meer, a politician from Pahalgam told BBC Hindi, urging tourists to remember that it was local Kashmiris who rushed to help after the attacks, even picking up bodies.\nThe cancellation rate for trips planned from cities like Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru are very high, Abhishek Sansare, a Mumbai-based tour operator told the BBC. A group of prominent tour operators said in a press conference that some 80-90% of all bookings had been cancelled.\n\"After the attack, there's a sense that a war is looming. So tourists are confused about what to do,\" said Sansare. \"Some of those who've already made advance bookings are going ahead with their plans. I'm also going there on the 2nd of next month.\"\nThe attack on tourists is also likely to weigh on Kashmir in other ways. The inauguration of the world's highest single-arch rail bridge, set to connect the Kashmir valley with the rest of India was slated to happen this month after several delays.\nThe timeline for the opening of this showpiece project now \"looks uncertain\", a source told the BBC.\nThe region was just beginning to attract fledgling business investments, but those too could dry up if hostilities go up.\n\"People who were investing in logistics and other sectors will now think twice because of the security environment. Until they regain some confidence, I don't foresee investments coming to Kashmir immediately,\" said Ubair Shah, who owns one of Kashmir's largest cold storage facilities for fruits in Pulwama district in south Kashmir.\nAs the region continues to boil over, local leaders have expressed deep anguish to the families who lost their loved ones.\nIn an impassioned speech in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly on Monday, the state's chief minister and tourism minister Omar Abdullah paid tributes to the victims by reading out names of all the 26 people.\nHe said people from every part of the country had come under attack, and while they'd come to Kashmir at his invitation he could not ensure their safe return.\n\"I had no words to apologise to them. What could I say to the children who saw their father drenched in blood? To the widow of the navy officer who was married barely a few days ago?\n\"Some people told me they'd come to Kashmir for the first time, but will have to pay for their holiday life long,\" he said, adding that the attack had \"hollowed out\" Kashmir.",

        "article_text": "In Western Sydney, an audience of Stetson-wearing Australians are sitting in their fold-up camping chairs, swigging beers and eating a spiralled fried potato on a skewer known as a 'chip on a stick'.\nPeople here are enjoying bull rides, barrel racing and bucking broncos. It feels like a slice of Americana in New South Wales perhaps - but that would miss the point that here, rodeo has become very much an outback Australian tradition in its own right.\nIn recent months, politics here in Australia could be compared to watching a rodeo. Between conflict in Europe, the Middle East and more recently US President Donald Trump and his threat of global trade wars, every day has brought with it a sharp jolt that changes the dynamics of the campaign trail. Politicians, like these cowboys, have been thrown off course despite their best efforts.\n\"Tariffs are great,\" exclaims rodeo fan Guy Algozzino, who's dressed in a cowboy hat, a waistcoat and a Western-style bolo tie with an engraved image of a cowboy riding a bull. \"We should have had tariff protection many years ago - it looks bad now [but] America's fantastic \u2026 Trump's the best thing America ever had.''\nOther spectators are more nuanced.\n\"It's going nuts,\" admits Jared Harris, when asked about world politics. \"I'm just sitting back and watching. It's a bit like a show. It's quite interesting to watch, it's entertaining. It probably affects me more than I realise, but I just choose to ignore it.\"\nAustralia didn't worry too much about President Trump's second coming when he won power back in November. The country had already witnessed a Trump presidency \u2013 and weathered it. Australia felt far removed from the shores of America.\nBut Trump's second term is panning out very differently. Tariffs - imposed on ally and adversary alike - have travelled the whole world. \nTrump doesn't care about making enemies. But Australia does. People here pride themselves on 'mateship' \u2013 a value that embodies friendship and loyalty \u2013 and that extends to politics too.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said as much when Trump initially announced tariffs without exemptions. This was not \"the act of a friend,\" said Albanese, while he also committed to not responding in kind.\nAll of this comes as the country heads to a federal election on 3 May. Candidates would rather focus on domestic issues they can control: cost-of-living, housing and healthcare. Instead, they are forced to grapple with a question that goes right to the heart of Australia's role in the world: how to deal with a US president as unpredictable as Trump?\nIn the final few days of campaigning before up to 18 million Australians go to the polls, the Labor Party's Albanese, who entered power three years ago after promising to invest in social services and tackle climate change, went on a speedy tour of six states. That effort appears to be paying off, with the latest YouGov poll putting Labor on 54 per cent of the two-party vote, versus 47 per cent for the opposition Coalition (an alliance of the Liberals and Nationals). This is a modest turnaround from the beginning of the year, when Labor was consistently lagging the Coalition in polls.\n\"It's not the campaign either party thought they would be having,\" says Amy Remeikis, chief political analyst at the Australia Institute think tank. \"The looming figure of Trump is overshadowing the domestic campaign but also forcing Australia's leaders to do something they haven't had to do in a long time - examine Australia's links to the US.\"\nThe US-Australia relationship has perhaps been taken for granted in these parts. Australia likes the fact the US has long been a dominant military force in the Pacific. Australia relies on its funding and benefits from being part of alliances like Aukus - the far-reaching defence pact between Australia, the UK and the US, designed to counter China \u2013 and the Anglo-intelligence alliance Five Eyes.\nThe rise of China has made Australia even more conscious about having the US on its side. Beijing has expanded its military presence in the Pacific, launching various military exercises in recent years - including one live-fire drill in February that saw Chinese naval vessels just 340 nautical miles from the New South Wales coast. Australia recently announced efforts to expand its navy and now hosts four US military bases - decisions fuelled in part by the rise of China.\nIt's all placed extra value on Canberra's alliance with Washington DC - one that Trump may be throwing into doubt.\nBack in February, Trump held a meeting with the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. He was asked whether they would be discussing Aukus.\n\"What does that mean?\" Trump asked the reporter. After being given an explanation of Aukus, he continued. \"We'll be discussing that \u2026 we've had a very good relationship with Australia.\"\nAustralia collectively held its breath, then let it out in a big sigh of relief.\nA blip maybe - but an indication perhaps of how little Trump thinks about Australia right now. However, Australia, like much of the world, is thinking about the US.\n\"We don't have anywhere else to turn,\" says David Andrews, senior policy advisor at the National Security College, which is part of the Australian National University in Canberra. \"We are physically isolated from everyone. As long as we've had European settlement here, we've always been concerned about the distance [and] isolation, which is why we've always maintained such a strong relationship with first Britain and then the US as the dominant maritime power.\"\nWhile only 5% of Australia's exports go to the US (China is by far Australia's biggest trading partner), the US still dominates the conversation here.\n\"This isn't a time to end alliances,\" says Justin Bassi, director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank. \"That would be cutting off our nose to spite our face.\"\nAnd, perhaps counter to the majority view here, Bassi thinks that Australia should support Trump's moves.\n\"We should continue to make it clear that any measures the US takes against Australia are unjustified but we should welcome and support American measures to counter Beijing's malign actions - or for that matter Russia,\" he says. \"Not to keep Trump happy but because it is in Australia's interests to constrain the adversary that is undermining our strategic interests.\"\nA poll published by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper last month found that 60% of Australians felt Trump's victory was bad for Australia. That was up from last November when it was just 40%.\nAnd a Lowy Institute poll published two weeks later showed almost two in three Australians held 'not very much' or no trust 'at all' in the US to act responsibly.\nBig questions on transnational alliances are not part of normal campaigning. But when Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton faced each other in their first televised debate, the first question asked by the audience was one on Trump.\nDutton has long stressed that he would be the politician best suited to dealing with the US President. He often cites his experience as a cabinet minister during tariff negotiations in Trump's first term. But that strategy doesn't always serve him well.\n\"He went into the election telling people he and Trump were similar enough that they would get on better, that he was the sort of personality Trump liked,\" says Remeikis. \"He's not repeating that now because people don't want someone to get on with Trump - they want someone who will stand up to him.\"\nDutton has had to do some back-pedalling on comments he made earlier in the year. Back in February, after Trump said he had plans to eject Palestinians from Gaza, Dutton called the US president \"a deal-maker \u2026 a big thinker.\"\nAnd he has come in for some criticism amid accusations of copying the US president. He's talked about cutting public sector jobs, for example. And his Liberal party appointed Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as shadow minister for government efficiency, not too dissimilar to the Doge. But when Senator Price recently started talking about wanting to 'Make Australia Great Again' on the campaign trail, Dutton avoided questions over the comments.\nAlbanese of course has to tread a careful line too. In a world that's being turned upside down, he's trying to reassure people he's a safe pair of hands; that those alliances remain.\nThat may turn out to be in his favour.\nIndeed, some analysts say that Trump's conduct may be helping Albanese, with voters rushing to support the incumbent during a time of perceived crisis. Just a few months ago, Labor's re-election was thought unlikely as it consistently polled behind the Coalition. But the final YouGov polling model of the election, published a few days ago, predicted that Labor will win 84 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives - an increased majority.\nFor Professor Gordon Flake, CEO at Perth USAsia Centre, a think tank, it paints a stark parallel with this week's election result in Canada - in which the Liberal Party won re-election by riding a backlash of anti-Trump sentiment.\n\"What we have seen in Canada has been a dramatic shift back towards the incumbent government and that is a rallying around the flag based on attacks on that country,\" he says. \n\"The attacks on Australia haven't been as severe so it's not the same degree, but at the same time you're also seeing a rallying around the current Labor government. Six months ago you thought their re-election would be unlikely; today on the cusp of the election here in Australia, it seems more likely than not - and one of the important factors in that has been developments in Washington DC. \"\nBut whoever wins, they will have a big job on their hands to navigate Australia's future with its allies.\n\"We have to make do with the hand we've been dealt,\" says Andrews. \"I expect that we are going to have to be much more ruthlessly self-interested and that's not comfortable because our foreign policy has generally been based around cooperation, collaboration and multilateralism \u2013 so that shared sense of threat that middle powers have of working together to maximise their output.\"\nBack at the rodeo, the sun's gone down, the cheerleaders are out and the audience gets ready to watch bucking broncos \u2013 the riders shortly afterwards holding on to their steer for as long as possible before being violently thrown to the ground. \nFlying above the arena are the flags of Canada and the US, alongside Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. There may not be much of a team spirit among allies right now - but voters here will be keen to see how their next leader rides out the storm.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

The state matches are a four-day format and we will need you to take more singles.' He replied: 'Sir, if I can hit a ball for six, why would I take a single off it?' That's when I realised he was ready for the next level.\"\nThat six-hitting lit up the most glamourous of cricketing stages on Monday when the teenager became the youngest player to score a century in men's T20 cricket.\nBatting for Rajasthan Royals against Gujarat Titans, he took down some of the world's best bowlers in a scintillating 38-ball innings that included 11 sixes and seven fours.\nExperienced international bowlers Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Washington Sundar and Rashid Khan were treated with the same disdain as those unlucky 12-year-olds who netted with Suryavanshi a couple of years earlier.\n14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi stuns the IPL\n'Remember the name' - cricket world reacts to Suryavanshi century\nVaibhav's entry to the IPL has been dramatic. He started his career with a six off the first ball he faced and went on to score a hundred in just his third appearance.\nBorn in Samastipur, a small district in India's Bihar, he quickly showed promise. Vaibhav's father, Sanjeev Suryavanshi, himself a club-level cricketer, saw a spark in his son. But there were no proper academies around the district, so he started his training at home from the age of five.\nSanjeev, who used to run a small shop, began to realise his son needed a proper coach. So when Vaibhav turned eight, his father decided to take him to Patna city, a three-hour journey away.\n\"Many people would tell him: 'What are you doing?' But he was the first person to believe in Vaibhav's abilities,\" said Robin Singh, a coach from Bihar.\n\"To ensure his son trained well and got to use the best facilities, his father had to sell a plot of land. His mother had to make a lot of sacrifices too. She would wake up at three in the morning to prepare breakfast for him and would even send food for the coaches.\"\nVaibhav impressed his new coaches in no time.\n\"When I started working with him, I found him quite different from others. You would give him a demo of a technique or a shot, and he would pick it up in no time,\" Ojha said.\n\"Most of the players adopt things easily in practice, but when it comes to playing matches, they fail. But the unique feature about Vaibhav was that he would execute things perfectly even during high-pressure matches.\"\nVaibhav was always ahead of his age group. From his strokeplay to game awareness, he would stand out.\n\"Within 10 days of playing alongside the kids of his age, we realised we were wasting his time. So, we started making him practise with senior players,\" Singh recalled.\nVaibhav would practise daily from 7.30am to 4pm, facing 450 balls each day. By the time he was 12, his coaches were confident enough to let him pursue cricket professionally.\nHe played for the Bihar under-19s team and amassed consistent runs, prompting selectors to name him in the India Under-19s team. Aged just 13, he smashed a 58-ball hundred in a youth Test against Australia.\nHe was soon drafted into Bihar's squad for the Ranji Trophy (India's premier first-class tournament) before becoming the youngest player to get a contract at the IPL auction as Rajasthan signed him for \u00a3103,789 (1.1 crore rupees) in December 2024.\n\"Vaibhav's role model is Brian Lara, so his game is aggressive, and he plays the ball on merit without any fear at all,\" Ojha added.\n\"We expected him to get an IPL contract, and our joy doubled the moment Rajasthan Royals got him because they have [India legend] Rahul Dravid on their coaching staff.\"\nSingh added: \"When he became the youngest to debut in first-class cricket, I told him: 'Anyone can become the youngest. I'll be happy when you become the youngest centurion.' So yesterday he called me up after scoring the century and said: 'Sir, youngest centurion.' And I couldn't be prouder.\"\nAlmost half of the runs Suryavanshi has scored in the IPL (46%) have come through the mid-wicket and long-on region. He is particularly savage against pace bowling, scoring more than 100 runs at a strike-rate of 243 in this season's IPL against the quicker men\nSuryavanshi has already been nicknamed Boss Baby in cricketing circles by those who see comparisons with Chris Gayle, aka The Universe Boss.\nWest Indian Gayle still holds the record for the fastest IPL century, having taken just 30 balls in 2013, but nobody else has scored one quicker in the competition, while he easily beat the record of 18 years and 118 days for the fastest T20 century which was previously held by Maharashtra's Vijay Zol.\nSachin Tendulkar - the greatest run-scorer of all time - made his India debut aged just 16, and Suryavanshi's former coach believe he will soon follow The Little Master into the national team.\n\"A guy from a small village in Bihar has made it to the IPL. The whole world is talking about him. So, he knows how to open doors. Don't be surprised if he makes it to international level soon,\" Singh said.\nBefore then, Suryavanshi, who has been gifted almost \u00a39,000 by his state government following his IPL century, has his sights set on title-chasing Mumbai Indians on Thursday, where he comes face-to-face with Jasprit Bumrah, the world's best bowler.\nListen to live commentary on Rajasthan Royals v Mumbai Indians on Thursday, live on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app\nSuryavanshi's century has made the front pages of the newspapers in India \n1 of 3\nIPL auction: Vaibhav Suryavanshi and Rishabh Pant make history\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "\"We don't care about sales to the United States,\" says Hu Tianqiang as one of his toy fighter jets flies past our heads.\nIt's hard to hear him above the buzzing toy planes and miniature drones, an almost rhythmic backdrop to the cacophony of toys that surround him, all clamouring for the attention of buyers.\nHu's stall, Zhongxiang Toys, sits inside the world's biggest wholesale market in the small Chinese city of Yiwu.\nIt's a huge showroom of more than 75,000 shops where buyers come seeking just about everything, from twinkling Christmas lights and kitchenware to umbrellas and massage guns. It can take most of the day just to get around one department given each of them has an airport hangar's worth of goods on show.\nYiwu is in the province of Zhejiang, along China's eastern coast. The manufacturing and export hub, home to more than 30 ports, accounted for 17% of all Chinese sales to the US last year.\nThat puts Yiwu, and this region, at the frontline of the US-China trade war.\nMr Hu, too, is on the frontline. He sits among rows of snazzy toy jets, squeaking dogs, fluffy stuffed animals, barbies and motorcycle-riding spidermen \u2013 a sliver of the $34bn (\u00a325bn) worth of toys China exported in 2024.\nAbout $10bn of it went to the US. But now, these Chinese exports to America face up to 245% tariffs. And US President Donald Trump has made it clear that he blames Beijing in particular for cornering too much of the global market.\nBut things have changed here since Trump's first trade war against China, which kicked off in 2018. It taught Yiwu a lesson, summed up by Mr Hu: \"Other countries have money too!\"\nThat defiance has become a familiar theme in the world's second-biggest economy, which is bracing itself for another turbulent Trump presidency.\nBeijing, which has been repeatedly telling the world that the US was bullying countries into trade negotiations, has not backed down yet from the trade war.\nThe propaganda online has ratcheted up, applauding Chinese innovation and diplomacy in contrast to the uncertainty unleashed by Trump. On the country's highly controlled social media, there are plenty of posts echoing the leadership's promise that China will keep fighting.\nAnd in factories and markets, businessmen and exporters now say they have other alternatives, beyond Trump's America. Mr Hu, for instance, says around 20%-30% of his business came from US buyers. But not anymore.\n\"We don't care about that 20-30%,\" Mr Hu says. \"We now sell mostly to South America and the Middle East. We are not lacking money, we are rich.\"\nWhen we ask about Trump, his colleague Chen Lang jumps in, rolling his eyes: \"He's cracking international jokes like no other. One day, one joke. Adding tariffs for him is like cracking a joke.\"\nNearby, one of the thousands of buyers that flock to this market every day is negotiating a price to buy more than 100 robots that turn into cars in a series of beeps and buzzes. After tapping various numbers into a calculator, the final price is written in chalk on the floor.\nThe buyer, we are told, is from Dubai. The BBC met many others from across Africa and South America.\nLin Xiupeng says he has noticed the shift away from American buyers in his last 10 years in the toy business.\n\"A few days ago, the shop next to us had an order from a US client. It's worth more than one million yuan. But because of tariffs, the shop owner decided to cancel it,\" he says, offering us cups of tea.\n\"They must need China,\" he says, adding that the country supplies most of America's toys.\n\"I think there are a lot of businesses in the US protesting these days.\"\nMr Lin is correct. Some toy shop owners in the US have written to the White House describing the tariffs as \"disastrous\" for their business.\n\"The tariffs are taking a hatchet to small businesses across America,\" Jonathan Cathey, who owns a toy company in Los Angeles, told the BBC over the phone.\nHe invested his last $500 in his company, Loyal Subjects, in 2009, which he ran from his two-bedroom bungalow in West Hollywood. He says it's now a multi-million-dollar business, but the tariffs could derail his plans.\n\"The entire toy industry could go under. We are looking at the total implosion of the supply chain. It's going to get really ugly,\" he warns.\nHe says swapping suppliers is a huge task: \"You need a lot of resources on the ground to produce a toy and many of these Chinese businesses have spent 40 years perfecting their craft.\"\nChina has been a big part of Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, with his administration going head-to-head with Beijing.\n\"He seems to be launching a crusade against the whole world,\" says former Senior Colonel Zhou Bo, who served in the People's Liberation Army. \"But of course he's trying to bash China the hardest.\"\nTrump accused China of operating the Panama Canal, which is run by a Hong Kong-based firm, and vowed to take it back. He has been on the hunt for ways to mine rare earth minerals, which China effectively has a monopoly over, making this a key part of any deal with Ukraine. His threats to take Greenland are also likely aimed at curbing China's ambitions in the Arctic. \nAnd, of course, he initiated another trade war, which takes special aim at China's neighbours, such as Vietnam and Cambodia, that have been crucial to its evolving supply chain.\nIn the last week, he suggested the levies on Chinese goods could be halved and spoke of \"a fair deal with China\" that his administration was \"actively\" negotiating.\nBut China's Commerce Ministry rebuffed this as \"groundless with no factual basis\". The headlines in state media haven't spared him either:  \"Trump is probably the worst president in American history,\" read one on state TV.\nIt seems the US president is waiting for his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to pick up the phone.\n\"We in China say \u2013 we have to let the bullet fly for a moment,\" Col Zhou says. \"That means in the fog of war, we do not know what will come next. I believe this kind of tit-for-tat would last for maybe one or two months \u2013 hopefully not more than three months.\"\nIt cannot go on, he adds, because that would not be good.\nIt's certainly not good for China. Trump's tariffs are not even the biggest challenge facing the country, which is also grappling with domestic economic pain, from low consumption to a housing crisis that has dented people's savings and confidence in the future.\nThe terrible timing aside, the tariffs are biting Chinese businesses.\nGoldman Sachs has forecast that China's economy will grow by 4.5% this year, short of the government's target: 5%.\nThe BBC reported from the trading hub of Guangzhou in mid-April that US-China trade was grinding to a halt, with exports to American households piling up on factory floors. That is borne out by this month's economic data, which show that activity in factories has sharply slowed.\nWhen the BBC rang suppliers to see if shipments to the US had resumed, what emerged was a messy picture. One supplier said he had half-a-million pieces of clothing waiting to ship to Walmart, and a few others echoed his uncertainty. But two exporters we spoke to said some shipments from US retailers had indeed restarted.\nThe range and complexity of the trade between the two economies, which includes cargo cranes, umbrellas and everything in between, means that it's often down to different businesses and supply chains as to how they deal with the tariffs.\nWhatever the business, there is no doubt the American consumer will feel the absence, or potentially higher prices, of Chinese goods.\nThe US still relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing to meet its own domestic demand \u2013 think phones, computers, semiconductors, furniture, clothes and, of course, toys. Electronics and machinery alone account for more than 50% of US imports.\nWalmart and Target reportedly told Mr Trump in a meeting last week that shoppers are likely to see empty shelves and higher prices from next month. They also warned that supply shocks could carry on until Christmas.\nSome 90% of all Christmas decorations hung around American homes come from Yiwu in China, where sellers, surrounded by signs wishing the world \"Feliz Navidad\" told us they're now trying to focus on sales to South America.\nAnd that effort is very evident in Yiwu.\nIn the early morning, before the shutters even open, the cavernous lobby of the wholesale market echoes with voices reciting key phrases.\n\"Shukran,\" says the teacher in Arabic. The students repeat it several times to perfect the pronunciation before learning that it means \"thank you\". \"Aafwan\" comes the reply, or \"you're welcome\".\nThese are free lessons offered by a local government association. Most of the students are women, dressed in their best to also impress their customers.\n\"These women are the backbone of trade across China,\" says one stall holder, who is originally from Iran and is giving private lessons to an eager student.\n\"They're doing these lessons to stay ahead of one another, to stay in competition.\"\nMost of the traders can already speak a few words of English. Now they say they need to greet their new buyers in Spanish and Arabic \u2013 a small but crucial sign of China's shifting trade relationships.\nOscar, a Colombian who would only give us his first name, was wandering the halls of the market with bags filled with fluffy bunnies and bears.\nHe says the US-China trade war offers \"many opportunities\" for traders from other parts of the world.\n\"Doing business with China is very important,\" he insists. \"[Doing business with] the US these days, less so.\"",

Luna Droubi, one of his lawyers, argued that the arrest was \"in direct retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians and because of his identity as a Palestinian\".\nVermont District Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered the release of Mohsen Mahdawi from prison on bail on Wednesday, pending the court's ruling on the habeas petition challenging his detention, according to a statement by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which is part of his legal representation.\nThe judge denied a request from government lawyers to delay his release by seven days. \nIn the statement, Ms Droubi said the claims against him are \"baseless\" and a \"disgrace to the US Constitution\". She said she was \"relieved\" that Mr Mahdawi had been released, and vowed to \"keep fighting until Mohsen is free for good\". \nMr Mahdawi thanked supporters outside the courtroom, saying, \"We are pro-peace and anti-war\". \n\"To my people in Palestine: I feel your pain, I see your suffering; and I see freedom and it is very very soon.\"\nOne day before his arrest, Mr Mahdawi had told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that he believed the citizenship interview could be a setup.\n\"It's the first feeling of like, I've been waiting for this for more than a year,\" Mr Mahdawi said. \"And the other feeling is like, wait a minute.

We should push a bit more in that second half, but we controlled the game and that is good.\"\nAmorim, however, is looking no further than the next game.\n\"Of course we are have an advantage,\" he said. \"We have our fans, but again this could change.\n\"Anything can happen in one game.\"",

        "article_text": "Famous for its adorable quokkas, Rottnest Island has become a global favourite. But beyond the selfies lies a rich, complex story of culture, conservation and community.\nOn a recent visit to Perth, I mentioned to a local that I was heading to Rottnest Island the next day. She sighed wistfully. \"I love it there,\" she said. \"You're going to love it too. It has a special kind of magic \u2013 the kind of place where you kick off your shoes the minute you arrive. Everything slows down and you can breathe a little more deeply.\"\nI already felt that Perth was a little like that \u2013 at least, life there felt slower and less frenzied than in my hometown of Melbourne on Australia's east coast \u2013 but I smiled back, not really knowing what she meant.\nHowever, she was right. Rottnest Island, a peaceful 19-sq-km isle off the coast of Western Australia, is, in fact, magical. The spell was cast as soon as our ferry left the mainland, skimming over the Indian Ocean. Humpback whales breached nearby, sending jets of sea spray into the air and flipping their tails as if in welcome. The sky was clear with the promise of a perfect day to come.\nJust 19km and 30 minutes later, I stepped off the ferry into another world. Rottnest Island has been famously car-free since 1931, and those more in the know than me immediately jumped onto bikes they'd brought with them or wandered off to hire one from Pedal and Flipper, said to be the largest bike hire place in the southern hemisphere.\nKids zoomed around in packs, dodging groups of tourists ambling through the main settlement. Some people had fishing rods under one arm; others, surfboards strapped to their bikes. Families stopped at the bakery for a flat white and vanilla slice before heading off to explore the island's 63 beaches and 20 bays, many with evocative names like Little Parakeet Bay and Cathedral Rocks that in no way came close to capturing the grandeur of the scenery in real life.\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nThere was no urban noise, no traffic and nothing to worry about. It was idyllic and glorious and everything I imagined a nostalgic care-free (and car-free) island holiday to be.\nThe isle has long been a cherished playground for generations of Western Australian families. \"Rottnest is very, very special, particularly to the people of Perth, like me,\" explained Paul Campbell, a volunteer guide I met not long after I arrived. Campbell spent his childhood holidays on Rottnest and now returns regularly to tell people about his beloved island. \"There are no multi-storey high-rise hotels here,\" he added. \"There is no private ownership. If you ever tried to put a multi-storey-anything here for wealthy people, you would be absolutely torn to shreds. We are very protective of our beautiful island.\"\nOnce a well-kept secret from the rest of the world, in recent years Rottnest has become one of Australia's most Instagrammed destinations, thanks to a certain fuzzy-faced resident: the quokka.\nIn 2013, Huffington Post dubbed the quokka \"the happiest animal in the world\", and the internet responded in glee. Quokkas \u2013 tiny marsupials found only in this small pocket of south-western Australia \u2013 seem to smile for selfies in a way that feels almost staged. Tennis star Roger Federer to actress Margot Robbie were among the first celebrities to pose with the infamous animal, helping spark a wave of global attention. Then in 2019 came Chris Hemsworth's now-iconic #QuokkaSelfie\u00a0with Matt Damon, which racked up more than four million likes. \"Rotto\", as locals call it, became the hottest ticket in town, transforming from local secret to global sensation. According to the Rottnest Island Authority, annual visitor numbers have nearly tripled in the last decade, peaking at more than 800,000 at last count.\nWhat's in a name?\nThe island was first sighted by Dutch explorers in the 17th Century and was named by one such captain, Wallem de Vlamingh, who stayed on the island for six days and mistook the quokkas for rats. He referred the island as \"'t elyandt 't rottenest\" which means \"rat's nest island\" in Dutch \u2013 although by all accounts he was also captivated by the pristine scenery and referred to it as \"paradise on Earth\" in his journal.\nRottnest, once simple and sleepy, has had to quickly grow up to meet the demands of all these domestic and international tourists. That meant creating more accommodation than the basic cabins and camping that existed, as well as better food and activity options. And what it has done is exemplary, transforming into a model of eco-conscious tourism without losing its soul.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs Campbell put it: \"When I was nine years old, the [cultural] experience that I had on Rottnest is not that much different to what you're going to experience today.\"\u00a0\nYou won't find any private cars here \u2013 just a few vehicles for rangers and staff \u2013\u00a0so most everyone gets about on two wheels or two feet (or the odd skateboard, scooter or Segway), having to occasionally dodge quokkas lounging on the road. Accommodation ranges from beachside cottages with bike racks out front to backpacker dorms to relaxed boutique hotels. While many tourists come on a day trip from Perth, it's much better to stay the night: quokkas are nocturnal and will spend most of the day sleeping under shady bushes. In addition, most day-trippers leave by 16:30, at which point the island truly comes into its own.\n\"Someone once said to me that you can feel the island exhale [when they leave],\" said Erin Gallagher from the Rottnest Island Authority. \"I just thought it was the most beautiful thing \u2013 and it's so true.\"\nI was staying at Discovery Resorts, the island's first eco resort, whose 83 glamping tents are shaded by gum trees and Aleppo pines, tucked behind Pinky Beach in the sand dunes. My tent had no aircon or TV, just a ceiling fan for airflow and the sound of the ocean through canvas walls. It was perfect in its simplicity. \"[The resort] is designed to immerse guests into the environment,\" explained Krizza Miclat, the resort's sales and event manager. \"A lot of the infrastructure is elevated on steel poles to ensure that we're not damaging the sand dunes. So, if ever we were to pick up and move, we haven't impacted it too much.\"\nIn fact, nearly everything here works in harmony with the natural environment. Renewable energy is provided by the Indian Ocean's sea breezes and the strong Western Australian sun; while drinking water is drawn from the sweeping white semi-circle of\u00a0Longreach Bay, desalinated and filtered. Marine sanctuary zones below water mean world-class snorkelling and diving, and an island nursery grows native plants from locally sourced cuttings and seeds. In 2023, a new management plan reaffirmed Rottnest's commitment to sustainability, conservation and culture.\u00a0\n\"We're always striving to improve,\" said Gallagher. \"Our target is to achieve 75% renewables. There's even an app where anyone can see how much power the island is generating in real time.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A day out with Bluey: Australia's new experience brings the Heeler family to life\n\u2022 Bindi Irwin's top outdoor adventures in Australia\n\u2022 The hike making Australia a better place \nIn the spirit of low-impact activities, I decided to take a Segway tour around the undulating landscape, rolling along the endless beaches, gliding past the cluster of salt lakes in the north-eastern corner and looking out for whales on the island's Humpback Highway. I steered past the scrub heath that covers much of the island, breathing in its signature salty-sweet smell and dodging prickle lily and feather speargrass. The island is just 11km long and 4.5km at its widest point, but its biodiversity is vast \u2013 a Class A reserve where everything from the blue-flowered Rottnest daisy to the long, black king skink I saw on the side of a trail is protected.\nBut not all scenes here are so idyllic.\nIn 1838, Rottnest was turned into an Aboriginal prison. Over the next century, more than 4,000 Indigenous men and boys were incarcerated here for \"crimes\" that they often didn't know they'd committed. Some were as young as eight years old. Many never returned home.\nPlan your trip:\nGet there: Regular ferries are operated by Sealink and Rottnest Express (leaving from Perth CBD and Fremantle) and Rottnest Fast Ferries (leaving from Hillarys Boat Harbour, north of Perth CBD).\nWhen to go: Summer (December-February)\u00a0is the most popular (and crowded) time, but September-April is still warm enough for water-based activities. If you want to celebrate quokka joeys taking their first hops, visit 21-22 September 2025 for Little Quokka's Big Birthday Weekend.\nWhere to stay: Book an eco-glamping tent at Discovery Resorts or stay at the newly opened The Lodge Wadjemup.\nEat: Frankies for pizzas and salads; Sunset snacks and drinks at Pinky's; The Lane for craydogs (a spicy crayfish-stuffed roll); Isola for more upmarket fare.\nDo: Hire a bike, snorkel and mask from Pedal and Flipper to explore the island at your own pace. Head to Garden Lake at sunset for epic quokka sightings. Take a guided Segway tour to learn about the island's history as you explore.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt's a dark legacy that the island is only beginning to address. As I wobbled my Segway back to the main settlement, we passed what looked like an ordinary field. But, my tour guide explained, it is a place of immense significance: the\u00a0Wadjemup Aboriginal Burial Ground\u00a0where 373 unmarked graves of prisoners were uncovered, with the first discoveries made during construction work in the 1970s. Shockingly, holidaymakers continued to camp on the site until the practice was finally banned in 2007.\n\"It was the largest number of Aboriginal deaths in custody in history in Australia,\" explained volunteer guide Anne Yardley, when I met her later at the island's Wadjemup Museum. \"And from the biggest number of Aboriginal nations.\"\nBut Indigenous connection to the island stretches far beyond this painful chapter. Long before European settlement, the island was part of the mainland, and archaeological evidence shows that the Noongar people lived on and used the island for tens of thousands of years. Its Indigenous name \u2013 Wadjemup \u2013 means \"place of spirits\".\n\"This was a significant place for Indigenous people,\" Campbell told me. \"Ceremonies were held here. But about 6,500 years ago, sea levels rose and this patch of land became an island. The Aboriginal people stayed on the mainland and it was left alone for thousands of years\u2026 all through Christianity, the Roman Empire, the Egyptian Empire\u2026 until Europeans arrived.\"\nToday, Wadjemup is working to tell this fuller story. The small but compelling Wadjemup Museum has been revamped; while walking trails such as the 45km\u00a0Wadjemup Bidi\u00a0\u2013 made up of five connected trails and built in part by volunteers \u2013 connects visitors to historical and cultural sites across the landscape, with interpretive signage and installations by Noongar artists. The\u00a0Wadjemup Project, an Aboriginal-led initiative, focusses on acknowledging Wadjemup's history of Aboriginal incarceration and the memorialisation of former prison sites.\nVolunteers play a huge part, too, from the Winnit Club, formed in 1931 by a group of regular campers, to the yellow-shirted Rottnest Volunteer Guides. These and other groups collectively contribute more than 40,000 hours a year to maintaining the island, and their dedication to preserving and sharing its stories speaks volumes about how deeply the island is loved.\n\"There's this balancing act between having enough people to make the place work financially, but not so many people coming here that you lose the reason to come,\" said Campbell. \"It is a very, very special place.\"\u00a0\nI certainly felt that on my visit. One moment I was riding my bike past salt lakes ringed with grey saltbush and coastal pigface, the next watching irresistibly cute quokkas hop around at sunset. I snorkelled an underwater trail through turquoise shallows, gazed onto shipwrecks just offshore and had sunset drinks looking out to incredible ocean vistas. I even tried to get my own quokka selfie, respecting the signs not to feed or touch them in any way but to keep my distance and let them come to me. I laughed as I tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to get both myself and a quokka fully in shot, and was reminded of something Gallagher had said to me about the smiling-faced marsupial: \"Why wouldn't you be happy if this is where you lived?\"\nIt was more than just a line \u2013 it was a truth that settled into the bones of the island. Rottnest may be famous now, but it hasn't lost what makes it feel like a local secret: the sense that once you arrive, you can slow down, breathe deeply and kick off your shoes for a while.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "On a searing afternoon in Vietnam, Tung Linh declared she \"basically knows nothing\" about the bloody, decades-long war that pitted her country's Communist-run North against the United States-backed South.\n\"My grandparents fought in the war and because of that today we can look at the sky and see an airplane and we don't feel scared, like they did,\" says the 20-year-old college student.\nStuck to her right cheek was a little yellow star on a red rectangle - the Vietnamese flag. Like her, Ho Chi Minh City, where she lived, was gearing up to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, when the Communists triumphed.\nToday's Vietnam is a remarkably different country than the one American troops withdrew from in defeat \u2013 it's enterprising, it's growing fast and it's getting richer.\nIts authoritarian Communist leadership has embraced capitalism. They aspire to follow in China's footsteps, and have ploughed money and effort into becoming a reliable manufacturing hub, even an alternative to China. \nBut that is a risky ambition during US President Donald Trump's trade war \u2013 it's partly why he is threatening a 46% levy against the South East Asian nation. That could shatter the country's economic potential.\nVietnam was a French colony, a Chinese vassal and for 20 years, the proxy battlefield in America's bloody struggle to stop China spreading communism across South East Asia.\nBut it cannot escape its geography. Nestled beneath China's wide rump, it is once again on the frontline in a new American battle \u2013which hopes to stem Beijing's rise as an economic superpower.\nVietnam is a young country in a hurry. The median age is 33, considerably younger than Thailand or China (40), and far younger than Japan (50).\n\"I want to do a job that will bring more success to Vietnam,\" said Linh in fluent English. She is studying economics and marketing. \"And yes, success for me too,\" she admits, with a smile, when prodded.\nIt's a dream that suits her bustling city \u2013 now a sprawling metropolis of 10 million people, Ho Chi Minh City has the same choking traffic, glass-clad skyscrapers, five-star hotels, restaurants and seedy massage parlours as any Asian mega city.\nYou would be hard put to find traces of the socialist ideology that led to the city's capture in 1975, when it was the capital of South Vietnam. The victors renamed it city Ho Chi Minh, after the revolutionary father of North Vietnam. But to locals, it is still Saigon. \nAnd when it fell on this day 50 years ago, South Vietnam ceased to exist as North Vietnamese tanks smashed through the tall iron gates of the presidential compound and raised the red flag with a yellow star over the presidential palace.\nAmerica's ally, the southern regime, was vanquished. Its last president had fled the previous day. More than two decades of bitter conflict was over. \nThe victory had come at an enormous cost. An estimated three million dead and millions more injured. Between 1968 and 1975, a greater tonnage of bombs was dropped on this slender piece of land than in all theatres in World War Two.\nBut few here want to talk about the war even as they celebrate the anniversary of their \"reunification\".\nLinh and her friends screamed in delight as a truck carrying soldiers drove past. The shy idols waved back \u2013 they were on their way to the barracks after rehearsals for the anniversary parade.\n\"I am excited because this is the day when we reunited, when we became one country again,\" Linh said.\nHer answer sounded a little rehearsed, not least because of the government-appointed minder who accompanied the BBC throughout. But her enthusiasm for her future \u2013 and her country's - is not uncommon.\nA little further down the road, 18-year-old Minh, who did not want to share her last name, told us she was studying to be a lawyer so she could \"become successful\".  With a laugh, she added: \"And rich!\"\nWhen we asked about how young people feel about Americans, the minder winced visibly and tried to stop her answering.\n\"We're not angry,\" she says. \"We don't hate them. That was the past. Now we want to trade with America. You know globalisation? We want to learn from America.\"\nVietnam's new leaders appear to have the same ambition. In January the country's new Communist party chief, To Lam, embarked on a program to slash bureaucracy that could impress Elon Musk, who has been overseeing the Trump administration's controversial cost-cutting team.\nThe country's 63 provinces and municipalities are being reduced to 34, and government ministries and agencies cut from 30 to 17. This year, 100,000 government employees are being laid off, according to official estimates.\nThe ambition is huge. So far only one country in South East Asia, Singapore, has managed to escape the \"middle-income trap\", where economic growth slows before countries become rich. Vietnam, whose economy is growing at a steady 5%, intends to be the second. It has flung its doors wide open to investment \u2013 and is welcoming back those it once drove from its shores.\nAfter the 1975 victory around two million southern Vietnamese fled the country. Many were ethnic Chinese. They packed on to flimsy boats and set out across the South China Sea. They became known as \"the boat people\". Today their descendants make up a diaspora of nearly six million stretching from the United States and Canada to France, Germany, Japan and Taiwan.\n\"Since 2017, I have promoted many Taiwanese companies to invest in Vietnam, and I myself am an advisor to several large electronics companies that I brought here,\" said Lisa Wu, who was born in Saigon but spent three decades in Taiwan. Now she is back.\n\"The most attractive thing is that the Vietnamese government is very supportive. The electronics industry is expanding out of China and a lot will choose Vietnam.\"\nIt's no coincidence this shift began around 2018, when Trump declared his first trade war against China.\nTwo young businesswomen from southern China, who did not want to share their names, tell us they have spent the last two years setting up a shoe factory here: \"Now it's ready to go.\"\nThey plan to export to the US. They are concerned about the possibility of higher tariffs for Vietnam - it currently faces a 10% levy, like most of the world \u2013 but \"it's a lot better here than China\", they say with a laugh. Chinese imports to the US face a range of tariffs that go up to 245% for some goods.\nStill, Vietnam is feeling the impact, Ms Wu said. \"I had several factories preparing to begin operations here this May. But because of the policy change, all have stopped and everyone is waiting.\"\nVietnam is again being asked to choose \u2013 America or China. But it's not a choice it can or will make because it needs both.\nLess than two weeks ago, they rolled out the red carpet to welcome Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the capital Hanoi. Warm words were spoken of fraternal friendship and support. But relations with their big neighbour are trickier than they may appear. For years, Vietnam has walked a tightrope between Washington and Beijing \u2013 the latter's expansive ambitions can be a threat to neighbours, especially growing economies that are keen to woo US businesses.\nAs Vietnam insists on \"looking forward\", it appears to have almost forgotten the men and women who fought in the jungles and through the hell of American bombs.\nBut even they say there must be no return to the past. \"I used to have a scar here,\" says Le Thanh Gian, pointing to his right hand, where a bullet had once lodged.\n\"There are still some pieces of shrapnel in my body that couldn't be removed. There were battles where it seemed like we would all be killed. But some of us survived while others fell.\"\nBut he says he bears no anger anymore.\n\"We must have peace. We have already made a lot of progress. People's lives are more prosperous and fulfilled. Now we must work together with the Americans for the future.\"",

We all want to work together and make the sport better.\n\"We have faced a bit of an uphill challenge in that communication over time.\n\"We don't hold a power seat at the table and that needs to change, in my opinion.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has taken action to ease the impact of new tariffs on the car making industry, which had sparked warnings about higher prices and the potential for significant hits to sales and production. \nThe change will allow companies with US factories to reduce the amount they pay in import taxes on foreign parts, using a formula tied to how many cars they sell and the price.\nThe provision is intended to provide relief to businesses for two years as they rework their supply chains, the White House said.\nOfficials also moved to shield car firms from facing mounting tariffs on the same items.\nThey said businesses that have to pay tariffs on cars and parts would not be charged other duties the administration has imposed on steel, aluminium and goods from Canada and Mexico.\nThe changes came as Trump visited Michigan on Tuesday for a rally to mark his first 100 days in office.\nThe state is home to the so-called Detroit Three carmakers - Ford, General Motors (GM) and Stellantis - and a network of more than 1,000 major suppliers to the industry.\nThose firms and the wider industry have been plunged into uncertainty since Trump announced new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts in March, saying he wanted to expand domestic car manufacturing - an industry the White House sees as key to national security. \nTrump's tariff announcement drove a spike in sales, as consumers rushed to get ahead of the tariffs. But it has also left businesses scrambling to respond. \nAhead of the latest announcement, General Motors and other carmakers said they welcomed the plans to soften the impact of the measures. \n\"We're grateful to President Trump for his support of the US automotive industry and the millions of Americans who depend on us,\" GM chief executive Mary Barra said in an emailed statement.\n\"We appreciate the productive conversations with the President and his Administration and look forward to continuing to work together.\"\nGeneral Motors, which reported its quarterly performance to investors on Tuesday, also said on Tuesday that it needed to rework its forecast for the year and pulled its prior guidance. \nIn an unusual move, it also postponed the call with analysts that had been set to discuss the results. \nTariffs on foreign-made cars - which accounted for nearly half of US sales last year - went into effect last month.\nThe duties on parts were expected to come into force on 3 May. \nUnder the modified plan, carmakers will be able to claim an \"offset\" for what they pay in tariffs on car parts, worth up to 3.75% of the suggested retail price of all the cars they assemble in the US. \nThat share would fall to 2.5% in the second year.\nThe White House said the rules were designed so that a car with 85% of its parts made in the US - or in Canada or Mexico under the terms of an existing free trade deal - would not face any tariffs, a threshold that rises to 90% in the second year. \nThe adjustment is a recognition of the global nature of the industry's current supply networks, where even cars that promote themselves as American-made often source a significant share of their parts from abroad.\nIn remarks to reporters ahead of the signing, Trump downplayed the easing, saying they applied to a \"very, very small part of the car\" and while noting he did not want to penalise companies with factories in the US.\n\"We just wanted to help them during this little transition, short-term,\" he said.  \nLast week, a coalition of US motor industry groups called on the president to not impose the measures on parts. \nA letter to his administration from groups representing companies including GM, Toyota and Volkswagen said the levies would \"lead to higher auto prices for consumers, lower sales at dealerships and will make servicing and repairing vehicles both more expensive\".\nFord said it appreciated Trump's decision, which it said would \"help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers\".\n\"We will continue to work closely with the administration in support of the president's vision for a healthy and growing auto industry in America,\" a statement added.\nThe car maker said policies that encouraged exports and ensured affordable supply chains to promote more domestic growth were \"essential\".\n\"It will be important for the major vehicle importers to match Ford's commitment to building in America,\" the company said, adding that if they did, the US would see a \"windfall of new assembly and supplier factories and hundreds of thousands of new jobs\".\nStellantis chairman John Elkann echoed the sentiments of his rival carmakers in response to the tariff reliefs. \n\"We look forward to our continued collaboration with the US administration to strengthen a competitive American auto industry and stimulate exports,\" he added.",

It has been used by Trump to deport Venezuelans to El Salvador on the basis they were members of the Tren de Aragua gang and \"conducting irregular warfare\".\nThe judge said the act only applied when the US was facing an \"armed organised attack\", which it is not.

Already one of the best players in the world - and before he even turns 18.\nA picture that says it all - Getty photographer Michael Regan captured this image of Yamal\n\n\"I don't think I have seen a 45 minutes like that from one individual before in my life. It is unbelievable,\" said TNT Sports pundit Ally McCoist as the players walked off the pitch at half-time.\nInter Milan boss Simone Inzaghi gave Yamal the highest of praise afterwards.\n\"Lamine is the kind of talent that comes along every 50 years, and to see him up close really impressed me,\" he said.\n\"He caused us huge problems because we were supposed to double up on him and it wasn't enough.\"\nBarca boss Hansi Flick said: \"He's special, he's a genius. In the big matches, he shows up.\n\"If it only comes every 50 years like Simone said, I'm glad it's for Barcelona.\"\nBBC pundit Stephen Warnock called him \"a future Ballon d'Or winner\".\nOne of the games of the season has everyone excited about the second leg at the San Siro in Milan next week, a change of pace from Paris St-Germain's hard-fought 1-0 win at Arsenal the day before. \n'A very, very special player' - Yamal, 16, makes Euros history\n'A talent that comes along every 50 years' - 'genius' Yamal steals show\nThis video can not be played\nLamine Yamal - The Boy King\nThere was a bit of drama before the game when Yamal appeared to hurt his groin and went down the tunnel during the warm-up, with speculation that he might not play.\nHe did start but had barely had an impact before Inter led 2-0 via two fantastic goals - Marcus Thuram's 30-second backheel flick from a Dumfries cross, and Dutchman Dumfries' flying close-range volley.\nBut then Yamal - who was being double marked - came to life, beating a few Inter players before whipping the ball in off the far post with astonishing ease and confidence.\nMoments later, he beat more defenders on the byeline and slammed in a shot which Inter keeper Yann Sommer tipped on to the bar.\nFerran Torres then capped off a fine team move to get Barca level before the break.\nDumfries, though, got his second with a header to put the Italian side back in front.\nBut moments later Barca were level again as Yamal cleverly dummied a pass and Raphinha lashed a shot in from 25 yards which hit the bar and went in off the back of Sommer for an own goal.\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan thought he had made it 4-3 to Inter but his goal was ruled out for a marginal offside.\nYet Yamal almost had the final say, one more memorable moment, when his cross-shot hit the angle of post and bar.\nThis video can not be played\nWarnock on Yamal's 'outrageous' performance against Inter\nIt is tough to even fathom how much Yamal has achieved at his age.\nThis was his 100th Barcelona appearance, and a 22nd goal to go with four in 19 games for Spain.\nYamal has 27 assists too, including two in Saturday's Copa del Rey final extra-time win over Real Madrid.\nMessi and Ronaldo did not make their international debuts until they were 18, while Yamal won Euro 2024 the day after his 17th birthday.\nMessi scored one goal and had no assists before he was 18, with Ronaldo bagging five and four assists.\nYamal is Barcelona's youngest La Liga player (aged 15) and the youngest to score and assist in La Liga for any team.\nHe also holds records for being the youngest Champions League starter, youngest player to score in a knockout game, a quarter-final and now a semi-final.\nYamal is Spain's youngest player and goalscorer and the youngest player and goalscorer in a European Championship.\n'Superstar' Yamal makes more history with Euros triumph\nThis video can not be played\nYamal is a genius, he is special - Flick\nVery few players have had the impact in football by Yamal's age. He will turn 18 in July.\nHe appears to be the closest thing we have seen to Barcelona and Argentina great Messi, now at Inter Miami and arguably the greatest footballer in history.\nThe pair both came through the Barca academy, La Masia, and both play on the right wing.\n\"I don't compare myself to him, because I don't compare myself to anyone - and much less with Messi,\" Yamal told reporters in the build-up to the game, while also describing the Argentine as \"the best player in history\".\nBut Messi was just very, very promising at the age of 17, rather than already regarded as one of the world's best.\nYamal added: \"I don't think the comparison makes sense, with Messi even less - I'm going to enjoy myself, and be myself.\" \nBut he has an unusual bit of history with Messi, who he was photographed with as a baby.\nA photo emerged, external from a charity calendar photoshoot taken at Barcelona's Nou Camp in 2007.\nIn it, a 20-year-old Messi held baby Yamal and helped him have a bath. Yes really.\nThe shoot came about after Unicef did a raffle in the town of Mataro where Lamine's family lived.\n\"We walked down to the city centre and you could tell there is a superstar in this town now in Lamine Yamal,\" said ex-England defender Rio Ferdinand on TNT Sports.\n\"There was a void when Messi left, this kid is doing stuff at 17 we have never seen before.

His goal was outrageous.\n\"It's ridiculous watching Yamal. You know, effectively, what he always wants to do \u2013 he wants to come inside on his left foot. So you over-compensate and he has got the ability to drag it with his left foot on to his right foot, and he can actually put a decent ball in with his right foot too.\n\"He is just a phenomenal talent and I love watching him.\"\nAnd Ferdinand wrote on social media: \"As a pure football talent I'm going as far as to say I think Lamine Yamal is on another level to any player playing the game in the top five leagues in world football.

        "article_text": "In January a migrant boat was rescued off the north African coast after 14 harrowing days lost at sea. Some 50 people died on the voyage, many of whom were lied to by people smugglers promising safe and legal routes to Europe. BBC Verify has tracked one of the traffickers responsible - documenting his activities across three continents.\nPunjabi rap music plays over a video showing three men at a beachside restaurant in Mauritania's capital Nouakchott. One after the other, they smile at the camera before casually turning to talk and laugh together.\nThe three are clearly friends. Two of them, Sufian Ali and Atif Shahzad, are cousins from rural Pakistan.\nBut it's the third man in particular who dominates the conversation. He's Fadi Gujjar, a people smuggler.\nThe video - posted to Gujjar's TikTok account - is one of more than 450 clips analysed by BBC Verify that reveal clues about his activities and his close relationship to the other men.\nWithin a month of this video being posted online, Ali and Shahzad were dead - beaten to death on the boat journey sold to them by Gujjar, who promised a safe route into Europe.\nMeanwhile, Gujjar found himself on the run, wanted by Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for his role in the tragedy.\nWhen BBC Verify contacted him on a phone number obtained from survivors, Gujjar said repeatedly in a series of voice notes his name had been \"misused\" by survivors in connection with the disaster and that he was leaving it all in the hands of Allah.\nFadi Gujjar is from Jaurah in Pakistan's Punjab region. In his 30s, his real name is Khawar Hassan - though he also goes by Bishi Gujjar.\nPakistani smugglers the BBC has previously reported on have tended to boastfully advertise illegal routes to Europe online.\nBut Gujjar is careful. His online presence is limited to highly edited videos of his travels and almost all clients BBC Verify identified are local to Jaurah. Advertisements for his services seem to spread by word of mouth.\nHis current location on Facebook is set to Istanbul, Turkey - an oasis for smugglers looking to make a quick buck. Videos posted to TikTok place him in the city since July 2022, showing the smuggler outside the iconic Hagia Sophia and a Pakistani supermarket.\nOne other location stands out: Mauritania on West Africa's Atlantic coast - the nerve-centre of his operation and the place from which the migrant boat started its perilous journey.\nSince 2023, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) says Mauritania has become a hub for people smuggling - spurred on by a crackdown on other routes.\nThe route is deadly. IOM data shows that 170 people - including 14 children - have died or gone missing on it this year.\nMany Pakistanis seeking economic opportunities in Europe are willing to take the risk. Life there is glorified online by migrants already living on the continent. Smugglers like Gujjar, whose lucrative business is fuelled by people's aspirations, take advantage of this.\nThese migrants are taking a gamble, using their families' savings or selling up to make the journey. The survivors we spoke to, on average, say they paid Gujjar $13,000 (\u00a310,000).\nThere are no direct flights from Pakistan to Mauritania, so some of the migrants transited through Ethiopia or the Middle East. From there, almost all of them went on to Senegal, before crossing into Mauritania, either by road or a short boat journey along the Senegal River.\nGujjar's travel history - obtained by BBC Verify through a source - showed the smuggler followed a similar route, entering Dakar airport in Senegal on two occasions in 2024.\nMultiple videos also place him in the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott from October 2024 - though the date of upload could differ to when they were filmed.\nFurther clips, posted to TikTok by Ali and Shahzad place Gujjar in Mauritania as early as August 2024. The trio are seen on the rooftops of Nouakchott's sand-coloured buildings and in restaurants around the city - a luxury other migrants couldn't afford.\nVideos from their accounts reveal the men were close, hailing from the same village. Their uncle, Ahsan Shahzad Chaudhry, confirmed to BBC Verify that his nephew Sufian Ali was friends with Gujjar.\nOne survivor named Uzair Bhat said Gujjar falsely promised him safe and legal routes to Europe. He sent BBC Verify proof of funds transferred to a bank account under Gujjar's real name, Khawar Hassan.\nBut when Uzair arrived in Mauritania, the smuggler backtracked.\n\"He said going by air will not work from here. I'll send you by a big ship,\" Uzair recalled. \"Please cooperate, your visa [to Europe] won't come through.\" \nEventually Uzair relented.\nAs well as Ali, Shahzad and Uzair, BBC Verify identified two other migrants who bought journeys from Gujjar.\nOnce they arrived in Nouakchott they say they were placed in \"safe houses\" - a term used for buildings tucked away in obscure alleys where migrants are held illegally by smugglers.\nOne person who used a different agent said he also stayed in safe houses run by Gujjar.\nBBC Verify confirmed the location of one to an area near the port of Nouakchott, which survivors say Gujjar occasionally visited.\nSurvivors BBC Verify spoke to say they set off from Nouakchott in a small fishing boat in the early hours on 2 January. Most of those onboard bought passage from smugglers in their hometowns in Pakistan.\nBut the three day trip turned into a deadly two-week journey adrift at sea. \nUzair said that from the day they left port the migrants \"were constantly scooping water out of the boat\". Another man, Bilalwal Iqbal, recalled that passengers soon began \"drinking sea water and after drinking it, people became delirious\".\nAccording to the survivors, the crew onboard - West Africans employed by the smugglers - starved the Pakistani migrants of food and water, and beat them daily.\n\"I tried to take one of their bottles of water so they hit me on the head with a rope and the impact just made me fall back,\" Iqbal told BBC Verify. \"Then they pummelled my thumbs with a hammer. I still have those wounds.\"\nSufian Ali and Atif Shahzad died after being beaten to death by the crew, their uncle said. He was informed of the circumstances surrounding their deaths by survivors.\nOthers died of starvation, dehydration and hypothermia.\nThose still alive, including the crew, had given up until they saw a much larger fishing vessel come into view. Uzair Bhat jumped into the ocean and swam towards it for help.\nThe coastguard instructed the vessel to take the migrant boat to Dakhla port - 60 miles away. According to the IOM, 15 dead bodies were found onboard while 35 people remain missing at sea and presumed dead.\nPakistani authorities have named Gujjar as one of ten smugglers involved in the tragedy. Some have been arrested, but not Gujjar.\nBBC Verify geolocated his most recent TikTok posts to Baku, Azerbaijan - though we cannot say for certain if he is still there.\nSince news of the rescue broke, his mother and one of his brothers have been detained in Pakistan, accused of collecting money on Gujjar's behalf from people buying routes to Europe.\nBBC Verify has also seen six police reports filed in Punjab by the families of those on the boat journey. They allege Gujjar collected $75,000 (\u00a356,000) for his role in the January disaster.

America's trade deficit with Canada - expected to be $45bn in 2024 - was mostly driven by US energy demands.\nCanada and US relations have been strained in recent months, driven by Trump's talk of a \"51st state\" and referring to previous Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as \"governor\" - the title for leaders of individual American states.\nThe US president has also sparked a global trade war in which Canada was one of the first countries targeted with tariffs.\nTrump has partially imposed a blanket 25% tariff on various Canadian goods, along with 25% import taxes on all aluminium and steel imports, but has exempted products covered by a US, Canada and Mexico trade deal known as USMCA.\nCanada has retaliated with some C$60bn ($42bn; \u00a332bn) worth of tariffs on US goods.\nCarney said talks with Trump would be \"on our terms, not on their terms\".\n\"There is a partnership to be had, an economic and security partnership,\" he said.\n\"It's going to be a very different one than we've had in the past.\"\nCarney has touted his experience handling global economic crises as a way to deal with Trump on tariffs.\nBefore becoming PM in early March, Carney had never held political office. \nHe is a banker by trade, leading the Bank of Canada during the 2008 global financial crisis before becoming the first non-British person to take on the top job at the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020.\nThe PM said Canada was the \"biggest client for more than 40 states\" in the US.\n\"Remember that we supply them [the US] with vital energy. Remember that we supply their farmers with basically all their fertiliser,\" Carney told the BBC.\n\"We deserve respect. We expect respect and I'm sure we'll get it in due course again, and then we can have these discussions.\"\nCanada and the US, along with Mexico, have deeply integrated economies, with billions of pounds worth of manufactured goods crossing the borders on a daily basis, for example, car parts.\nThe introduction of tariffs, which are taxes levied on goods as they enter a country and paid for by the importer, threatens decades of collaborations between the nations.\nTrump has argued tariffs will encourage more Americans to buy domestically-made goods, which will ultimately boost US manufacturing and jobs. \nWhile America's main opponent in the global trade conflict is China, the introduction of Trump's blanket, so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the likes of the UK and other European countries has led to allies seeking fresh agreements in response to barriers to trading with the world's largest economy.\nCarney, who endorsed UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves during the British general election, said \"one would think\" that Canada and the UK could sign a stalled free trade agreement as part of diversifying trade, but highlighted about 95% of trade between the countries is effectively tariff-free already.\n\"We could expand the level of integration between our countries, like-minded countries. You think about defence partnerships, and those conversations have just just begun, so there's a lot that we can do,\" he added.\nIn a statement congratulating Carney, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"I know we will continue to work closely on defence, security, trade and investment.\"\nCarney said the G7 summit hosted by Canada in June would be \"very important\" in deciding the future path of the global trade war, adding it would \"put to the test\" whether the group of the world's seven most advanced economies - which includes the US - was still the most \"like-minded of like-minded countries\".\nThe summit will occur just before the 90-day pause on some of Trump's higher tariffs is set to expire.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nChampions League highlights: Barcelona 3-3 Inter Milan\nEvery once in a while, a match comes along that will live in the memory long past the final whistle.\nA treat, a feast of football. That is what Barcelona and Inter Milan served up in an enthralling 3-3 draw in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final.\n\"It was an amazing battle to watch, almost like a boxing match where opposing styles make the fight,\" said former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock.\n\"Barca and Inter were set up very differently, and it made for one heck of a game.\"\nFormer Rangers striker Ally McCoist said on TNT Sport: \"Tonight was just special, special to be here to watch those two teams.\n\"We have been treated to some unbelievable football this evening.\"\nSensational goals, high drama and incredible individual performances - it had everything. Here's how an engrossing evening of football unfolded.\nMuch of the talk in the build-up to this match was around Barcelona.\nTheir dangerous high line, their ability to score an abundance of goals with a prolific front three, the prospect of another golden generation of players nurtured from their prestigious La Masia academy.\nAfter 30 seconds of the first leg at the Montjuic Olympic Stadium, that all changed.\nMarcus Thuram's clever backheel finish was the fastest goal to be scored in a Champions League semi-final and left the home crowd stunned.\nBut against a side capable of scoring lots of goals, Inter knew one would not be enough and the second came on 21 minutes when Denzel Dumfries fired in a remarkable overhead kick to once again silence the home crowd.\nThat was not in the script for a Barcelona side trying to reach the Champions League final for the first time in 10 years.\n\"I think everyone thought that once Inter went 2-0 up, that would be it \u2013 they would shut up shop, and we wouldn't see much other than another outstanding defensive display by them,\" said Warnock.\nInter had conceded just five goals in this season's Champions League and with Barcelona's high-line tactics exposing their own defensive weaknesses, the Serie A side were able to take advantage.\nFor a few minutes, at least.\nTrailing by two after 21 minutes, Barcelona needed an immediate spark.\nEnter Lamine Yamal.\nThe teenager, making his 100th club appearance, took just three minutes to step up for his team and conjure a moment of magic to get them back in it.\nJinking into the penalty box and leaving Henrikh Mkhitaryan in his wake, Yamal struck a majestic left-footed finish that ricocheted off the post and into the net to launch the comeback.\n'Get the ball to Yamal' became a clear tactic for Barcelona and watching him take control of the game, pinging balls into the area and constantly making himself available in forward positions, it was easy to forget he is still just 17 years old.\nThe equaliser came on 38 minutes, when Ferran Torres stabbed in from close range after Raphinha nodded on Pedri's diagonal cross.\nParity restored just in time for the break, the anticipation was heavy after what had been a mesmerising opening 45 minutes.\nFormer Liverpool player Steve McManaman, part of the TNT punditry team, said: \"It had everything. It showed how frail Barcelona are defensively, but going forward they are electric.\"\n'A talent that comes along every 50 years' - 'genius' Yamal steals show\nThis video can not be played\nYamal pulls one back against Inter\nWith fans and neutrals alike on the edge of their seats from this gripping encounter, expectations were high for an equally entertaining second half.\nAfter three stunning goals worthy of putting any team in the Champions League final, there was almost an air of disappointment when Inter's goal to restore their advantage came from a simple corner routine.\nDumfries rose highest to meet Hakan Calhanoglu's corner at the back post, highlighting Barca's defensive struggles.\n\"Inter are not the most dynamic team, and they don't have much raw pace but there was still a way for them to hurt Barca, on the break or with set-pieces,\" said Warnock.\n\"They are the oldest squad in the Champions League so there is a lot of experience there and they showed that tonight with the way they were clever enough to keep opening Barca up.\"\nAt 30 years and 56 days, Inter named the seventh oldest starting XI for a Champions League semi-final game and they used all of that experience to keep cool heads in a high-drama scenario.\n\"When you play at home like we did, the sensation is that we should have managed to earn a better result,\" Barcelona forward Raphinha told Movistar Plus.\n\"We can't concede that many goals, especially at home. Sure, you have to give praise to our opponents who are strong and played well tonight but we are Barca and it's our duty to win at home, that's how it is.\"\nSmarting from three consecutive defeats in the past seven days, where they have dropped to second in Serie A and gone out of the Coppa Italia to city rivals AC Milan, Inter were determined not to let the lead slip away again.\n\"Barca were set up to attack and take the game to Inter but their high-line left them vulnerable at the back,\" said Warnock.\n\"They are not going to change that way of playing - they haven't changed all season and they have done well doing it, so why would they?\"\nConceding three goals at home and facing the prospect of travelling to the San Siro with a one-goal deficit, sometimes all you need is someone to take a chance.\nThat is what Raphinha did when he picked up the ball 25 yards out and hammered the ball into the back of the net, via a touch off the bar and goalkeeper Yann Sommer's back.\nInter had held the lead for all of 114 seconds before Raphinha's equaliser drew Barcelona level for the second time in the game.\nYamal might have been the star of the show on Wednesday but it is Raphinha who has dominated the headlines for Barca throughout this campaign and, although the goal has not been credited to the Brazilian, his performances throughout have proved pivotal to their success.\n\"I really appreciate what we did today,\" said Barcelona boss Hansi Flick.\n\"We played a great game, and of course, the goals we conceded weren't pretty. You have to talk about them, analyse them, but the way we played, our style, our way of playing...it was fantastic.\"\nMkhitaryan thought he had found a fourth goal when he poked home in the 75th minute only for the video assistant referee to rule it out for an agonisingly tight offside.\nBut even without that, the game was the joint-highest score draw in a Champions League semi-final game alongside a 3-3 draw between Dynamo Kyiv and Bayern Munich in the first leg in 1998-99.\nIt sets up a mouth-watering second leg in Milan next week and, while Barca may be disappointed to have conceded three goals at home, the visitors will take confidence that they were able to match them on an exhilarating night of football.\n\"After three defeats in a row we saw the real Inter tonight,\" said Inter goalscorer Dumfries. \n\"We played with heart and I'm proud. Obviously we wanted to win but I think it was a good performance and it's still all to play for.

He is likely to be joined in the squad by Matthew Potts (10 caps), Josh Tongue (two) and uncapped Essex man Sam Cook.\nA combination in the XI of Atkinson, Tongue and Cook would have 13 caps between them. Not since Zimbabwe's last Test in this country 22 years ago has England's pace attack looked so callow at home, when Steve Harmison, James Anderson and Richard Johnson had a combined seven caps.\nIndeed, England have played only one home Test without any of Woakes, Anderson or Stuart Broad in the past 18 years.\nAlthough Zimbabwe are improving \u2013 they have just earned a creditable 1-1 series draw in Bangladesh \u2013 England will be overwhelming favourites to win the four-day Test when it begins on 22 May.\nFollowing that, the five-match series at home to India and the Ashes away in Australia this winter will shape the leadership legacies of Stokes, coach Brendon McCullum and director of cricket Rob Key.\n'Times have changed, one clip can earn an England call-up'\nWe've said naive things, but we do care - Wood\nWoakes has not played yet this season because of an ankle problem, while Wood is out until July following knee surgery.\nBrydon Carse remains sidelined with a foot problem and Olly Stone will not play before the back end of the summer after his own knee operation.

Baker has played only three first-class matches but was given an England development contract in February.\nOther areas of selection look more straightforward. Jamie Smith will return behind the stumps after missing the tour of New Zealand on paternity leave, while there is no suggestion Shoaib Bashir's place as the number one spinner is under threat.\nAny decisions over the top five will be delayed by Jacob Bethell's stint at the Indian Premier League.

The state matches are a four-day format and we will need you to take more singles.' He replied: 'Sir, if I can hit a ball for six, why would I take a single off it?' That's when I realised he was ready for the next level.\"\nThat six-hitting lit up the most glamourous of cricketing stages on Monday when the teenager became the youngest player to score a century in men's T20 cricket.\nBatting for Rajasthan Royals against Gujarat Titans, he took down some of the world's best bowlers in a scintillating 38-ball innings that included 11 sixes and seven fours.\nExperienced international bowlers Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Washington Sundar and Rashid Khan were treated with the same disdain as those unlucky 12-year-olds who netted with Suryavanshi a couple of years earlier.\n14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi stuns the IPL\n'Remember the name' - cricket world reacts to Suryavanshi century\nVaibhav's entry to the IPL has been dramatic. He started his career with a six off the first ball he faced and went on to score a hundred in just his third appearance.\nBorn in Samastipur, a small district in India's Bihar, he quickly showed promise. Vaibhav's father, Sanjeev Suryavanshi, himself a club-level cricketer, saw a spark in his son. But there were no proper academies around the district, so he started his training at home from the age of five.\nSanjeev, who used to run a small shop, began to realise his son needed a proper coach. So when Vaibhav turned eight, his father decided to take him to Patna city, a three-hour journey away.\n\"Many people would tell him: 'What are you doing?' But he was the first person to believe in Vaibhav's abilities,\" said Robin Singh, a coach from Bihar.\n\"To ensure his son trained well and got to use the best facilities, his father had to sell a plot of land. His mother had to make a lot of sacrifices too. She would wake up at three in the morning to prepare breakfast for him and would even send food for the coaches.\"\nVaibhav impressed his new coaches in no time.\n\"When I started working with him, I found him quite different from others. You would give him a demo of a technique or a shot, and he would pick it up in no time,\" Ojha said.\n\"Most of the players adopt things easily in practice, but when it comes to playing matches, they fail. But the unique feature about Vaibhav was that he would execute things perfectly even during high-pressure matches.\"\nVaibhav was always ahead of his age group. From his strokeplay to game awareness, he would stand out.\n\"Within 10 days of playing alongside the kids of his age, we realised we were wasting his time. So, we started making him practise with senior players,\" Singh recalled.\nVaibhav would practise daily from 7.30am to 4pm, facing 450 balls each day. By the time he was 12, his coaches were confident enough to let him pursue cricket professionally.\nHe played for the Bihar under-19s team and amassed consistent runs, prompting selectors to name him in the India Under-19s team. Aged just 13, he smashed a 58-ball hundred in a youth Test against Australia.\nHe was soon drafted into Bihar's squad for the Ranji Trophy (India's premier first-class tournament) before becoming the youngest player to get a contract at the IPL auction as Rajasthan signed him for \u00a3103,789 (1.1 crore rupees) in December 2024.\n\"Vaibhav's role model is Brian Lara, so his game is aggressive, and he plays the ball on merit without any fear at all,\" Ojha added.\n\"We expected him to get an IPL contract, and our joy doubled the moment Rajasthan Royals got him because they have [India legend] Rahul Dravid on their coaching staff.\"\nSingh added: \"When he became the youngest to debut in first-class cricket, I told him: 'Anyone can become the youngest. I'll be happy when you become the youngest centurion.' So yesterday he called me up after scoring the century and said: 'Sir, youngest centurion.' And I couldn't be prouder.\"\nAlmost half of the runs Suryavanshi has scored in the IPL (46%) have come through the mid-wicket and long-on region. He is particularly savage against pace bowling, scoring more than 100 runs at a strike-rate of 243 in this season's IPL against the quicker men\nSuryavanshi has already been nicknamed Boss Baby in cricketing circles by those who see comparisons with Chris Gayle, aka The Universe Boss.\nWest Indian Gayle still holds the record for the fastest IPL century, having taken just 30 balls in 2013, while Suryavanshi easily beat the record of 18 years and 118 days for the youngest player to score a T20 century which was previously held by Maharashtra's Vijay Zol.\nSachin Tendulkar - the greatest run-scorer of all time - made his India debut aged just 16, and Suryavanshi's former coach believe he will soon follow The Little Master into the national team.\n\"A guy from a small village in Bihar has made it to the IPL. The whole world is talking about him. So, he knows how to open doors. Don't be surprised if he makes it to international level soon,\" Singh said.\nBefore then, Suryavanshi, who has been gifted almost \u00a39,000 by his state government following his IPL century, has his sights set on title-chasing Mumbai Indians on Thursday, where he comes face-to-face with Jasprit Bumrah, the world's best bowler.\nListen to live commentary on Rajasthan Royals v Mumbai Indians on Thursday, live on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app\nSuryavanshi's century has made the front pages of the newspapers in India \n1 of 3\nIPL auction: Vaibhav Suryavanshi and Rishabh Pant make history\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "One week after a devastating militant attack near the mountain resort of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, the town wears a look of quiet desolation, although tourists have begun trickling back in small numbers.\nThe main high street, abandoned by visitors last week - with shops shuttered and hotels completely emptied out - is seeing fleeting signs of life again.\nLast Tuesday, militants opened fire on people, mostly tourists, who were visiting Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5 km) from Pahalgam, often described as the \"Switzerland of India\".\nThe attack was one of the deadliest in recent years, devastating the lives of many families and sparking widespread anger in India.\nIn the days since, tensions between India and Pakistan, which both claim Kashmir in full but administer it only in part, have significantly risen, with each side announcing retaliatory measures against the other.\nThere is now growing speculation about whether there will be a military response from Delhi. The government in Kashmir has closed down over half the tourist destinations in the valley, as authorities review the security situation and carry out search operations. \nWhile violence has often broken out in the region, with militants targeting security forces and civilians since an insurgency broke out in 1989, the brazen killing of tourists has been rare and has shocked local businesses and tourists alike.\nTourism is a mainstay of the economy in places like Pahalgam and there's now fear that many livelihoods might be irrevocably hit.\nAt a \"selfie point\" outside town, overlooking lush meadows and a rushing river, Akshay Solanki, a tourist from Mumbai, said there was \"panic\" among his group of travellers on the day of the attack. But they had decided to continue with their journey because flights back home had become unaffordable.\nOther tourists said constant reassurances from the locals and security forces had given them a sense of comfort. A driver who had brought visitors from the capital, Srinagar, told BBC Hindi that he was pleading with those visiting not to \"distance\" themselves from Kashmir.\nAfter a washout three days, shawl-seller Rafi Ahmed said he'd managed to sell just a few pieces and feared for his livelihood in the long run if tourists stopped coming.\nAmong those exhorting tourists to come to Pahalgam was Bollywood actor Atul Kulkarni, who visited the town days after the attack. He told BBC Hindi, if the message from the militants was \"don't come here, we should respond by coming in even larger numbers\".\n\"Don't cancel bookings, cancel your other plans and come here,\" Kulkarni said.\nBut uncertainty and apprehension loom large in Pahalgam and it could take several years before a sense of normalcy is restored, local business owners and residents told the BBC.\nIndian authorities have launched combing operations in the region, detaining hundreds of people and destroying homes belonging to alleged militants.\nIndia and Pakistan have also reportedly exchanged small arms fire across the border.\nThe escalation in tensions is keeping tourists and business owners on tenterhooks.\nIndian authorities have often claimed Kashmir witnessed a period of relative peace after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked its autonomous status in 2019. Ahead of India's general elections in 2024, Modi hailed the \"freedom\" that had come to the region, saying Kashmir was touching new heights of development because it was breathing freely.\nTop leaders pointed to high tourism numbers - some 23 million last year and millions more in the years before - as proof of a big boom after years of unquiet. But last week's attacks have, yet again, shattered any idea of lasting peace in the restive valley.\n\"This [attack] is a blot on us\u2026How we wipe it off is a long-term concern,\" Rafi Ahmed Meer, a politician from Pahalgam told BBC Hindi, urging tourists to remember that it was local Kashmiris who rushed to help after the attacks, even picking up bodies.\nThe cancellation rate for trips planned from cities like Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru are very high, Abhishek Sansare, a Mumbai-based tour operator told the BBC. A group of prominent tour operators said in a press conference that some 80-90% of all bookings had been cancelled.\n\"After the attack, there's a sense that a war is looming. So tourists are confused about what to do,\" said Sansare. \"Some of those who've already made advance bookings are going ahead with their plans. I'm also going there on the 2nd of next month.\"\nThe attack on tourists is also likely to weigh on Kashmir in other ways. The inauguration of the world's highest single-arch rail bridge, set to connect the Kashmir valley with the rest of India was slated to happen this month after several delays.\nThe timeline for the opening of this showpiece project now \"looks uncertain\", a source told the BBC.\nThe region was just beginning to attract fledgling business investments, but those too could dry up if hostilities go up.\n\"People who were investing in logistics and other sectors will now think twice because of the security environment. Until they regain some confidence, I don't foresee investments coming to Kashmir immediately,\" said Ubair Shah, who owns one of Kashmir's largest cold storage facilities for fruits in Pulwama district in south Kashmir.\nAs the region continues to boil over, local leaders have expressed deep anguish to the families who lost their loved ones.\nIn an impassioned speech in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly on Monday, the state's chief minister and tourism minister Omar Abdullah paid tributes to the victims by reading out names of all the 26 people.\nHe said people from every part of the country had come under attack, and while they'd come to Kashmir at his invitation he could not ensure their safe return.\n\"I had no words to apologise to them. What could I say to the children who saw their father drenched in blood? To the widow of the navy officer who was married barely a few days ago?\n\"Some people told me they'd come to Kashmir for the first time, but will have to pay for their holiday life long,\" he said, adding that the attack had \"hollowed out\" Kashmir.",

Should never have been allowed in the first place. Now every sport must follow suit.\"\nCampaign group Women's Rights Network said: \"We are pleased that the FA has finally seen the light. But it shouldn't have been such a hard fight to get here.\"\nAsked what Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer thought of transgender women being banned from women's sport, his spokesman said the government had \"been clear that biology matters when it comes to women's sport and that everyone should be compliant with the law\".\nHe said the government would \"continue to work to make sure that women and girls across the country can enjoy sports and we will continue to support bodies to protect the  integrity, safety and fairness of the game\".\nHe said it was the responsibility of sporting bodies to set their own rules.\nNatalie Washington, campaign lead for Football vs Transphobia, said transgender women are now likely to give up football.\n\"The people I know that are talking about this are saying, 'Well, that's it for football for me',\" she said.\n\"Most people clearly don't feel that they can go and play in the men's game for reasons of safety, for reasons of comfort.\"\nPride Sports, which runs the Football vs Transphobia campaign, said there is no \"football-specific peer-reviewed research or evidence that shows the existing policies constitute a safety risk\".\nLord David Triesman, former chairman of the FA, said there should be \"consequences for the most senior FA officers\" who took the decision to previously allow transgender women in women's football.\n\"The FA has finally seen sense. It would have been the utmost foolishness to disregard the Supreme Court,\" he said.\nAnti-discrimination group Kick it Out said: \"Now is the time to show solidarity with the trans community and remind ourselves that football brings people together and is often a space for belonging, connection, and joy.\n\"The recent Supreme Court ruling and the FA's decision to change its policy will have far-reaching consequences, not only for the people we support but for our friends, families, team-mates and wider communities.\n\"Transphobic abuse - on the pitch, in the stands and online - is real and rising.\"\nThe FA is the first major governing sporting body to amend its transgender eligibility criteria following the Supreme Court ruling.\nThe Ultimate Pool Group (UPG) - the professional body for eight-ball pool - banned transgender women from its female category last month.\nOther governing bodies, including the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), are reassessing their transgender eligibility criteria.\nAthletics, cycling and aquatics have implemented outright bans on transgender women taking part in women's events.\nIn 2022 British Triathlon became the first British sporting body to establish an open category in which transgender athletes can compete.\nThis year the ECB banned transgender women from elite domestic cricket.\nThe ruling meant any player that had gone through male puberty would not be able to feature in the top two tiers of the women's game, but that transgender women were still eligible for the third tier and below.\nHowever, the ECB is expected to follow the FA ruling by banning transgender women from all levels of the women's game.\nEngland Netball's new guidelines, which will apply from 1 September, recognise three distinct gender participation categories: female, male and mixed.\nThe female category would be \"exclusively for players born female, irrespective of their gender identity\", while mixed netball will \"serve as the sport's inclusive category, allowing players to complete under the gender with which they identify\". \nBBC sports editor Dan Roan\nThe FA is now talking to the 28 transgender women who are registered in England which this change in policy will affect in a bid to look at ways in which they can stay involved in the sport.\nIn recent years, governing bodies of other sports, like rugby and hockey, had introduced tougher gender policies, adding to the pressure on football to follow suit.\nSenior officials insist they have not taken an ideological position on what they see as a complicated issue, and that their task has always been to provide as many opportunities to play to as many people as possible.\nBut the fact they have had to perform a U-turn on a transgender eligibility policy they updated only three weeks ago will come under scrutiny.\nThe FA rejects suggestions that it caved in to pressure, claiming it had no choice to amend its approach yet again because its lawyers concluded that the subsequent Supreme Court ruling last month left it vulnerable to potential legal claims from some biologically female players.\nBut the fact they have done so will be welcomed by those who felt their previous stance was an unsatisfactory attempt at compromise between competing rights and freedoms - one that the critics felt lacked a clear direction, creating unclear and impractical guidelines and potentially compromising female players' fairness and safety as a result.\nSupporters of the trans community will be dismayed by what they see as an unnecessary, exclusionary and discriminatory policy that risks further marginalising a small number of people from the sport they love.\nWhat does the 'definition of a woman' ruling mean for sport?\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

It looks like Fifa career mode.\"\nAnother claimed: \"I think this may be the most commonly agreed worst tifo of all time given the circumstances.\"\nWhile a third said: \"Arsenal turned down the fans' tifo design request to produce this monstrosity. Champions League semi-final and this was the best they could come up with? So disappointed.\"\nAccording to former England striker Wayne Rooney, working as a TV pundit, the atmosphere at the Emirates on Tuesday was in contrast to the Real Madrid game.\nBefore that match, supporters in each block of the stadium held up red and white cards above their heads.\n\"For Arsenal, I was a bit disappointed with how they played, disappointed with the fans as well,\" Rooney told Amazon Prime.\n\"I thought tonight they were a bit subdued, almost like an anti-climax that they beat Real Madrid and were going to walk into the final and win the competition.\"\nThis video can not be played\nArteta reacts to defeat against PSG in Champions League semi-final\nWhy Arsenal can still reach Champions League final\nArsenal fan writer Laura Kirk: \"One of the fan groups Ashburton Army had raised some money for a tifo which was ultimately rejected by the club, I imagine because the designs were not in keeping with the club's brand but the club haven't actually said anything. \n\"In comparison with what we see elsewhere in Europe, like the one Real Madrid had against us last week, it just felt like a massively missed opportunity to do something amazing.\"\nOli Price-Bates from The Fresh Arsenal Podcast: \"The tifo from the club was certainly a bit underwhelming. The occasion deserved more from the club to help with the atmosphere and fan engagement. \n\"Certainly if Arsenal get to this stage again, they need to be better prepared and involve the fans in the process, not just in tifos but the wider experience and build-up for the match. \n\"Hopefully we won't wait so long for another semi-final and the club will be better prepared to make more impact.\"\nBroadcaster and Arsenal fan Harry Symeou: \"I think the fans were hoping to see something with a bit more of a wow factor. Given there was lots of talk online with regards to some more elaborate, striking designs - you can understand why some felt underwhelmed.\n\"Tifos on the continent tend to be more creative and really can set the scene ahead of a huge occasion. Fan groups, in particular those known as 'ultras' normally have a big input - leading to a higher rate of fan satisfaction.

        "article_text": "A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild.\nAnimals born and raised in zoos are rarely considered for release because they either don't have the survival skills or have become too used to human interaction.\nBut a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme led to the unusual request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo.\nIt has been moved to Germany's Black Forest where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge.\nThis week the BBC watched on as, with the help of some judicious prodding with a broom, the Newquay lynx was loaded onto a truck headed for southwestern Germany.\nTwo days later we were in Germany as it was cajoled into a 1,200-sq-metre enclosure. John Meek from Newquay Zoo was also on hand to see the lynx gingerly stroll out into its new home.\n\"I'm a big boy but I had a few tears in my eyes,\" he said. \" Nowadays, zoos are not here to keep animals in cages. They're there for conservation. And this is it, conservation in action.\"\nThousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe.  \nThough not officially classed as a \"big cat\" Eurasian lynx can weigh up to 30 kilos and hunt deer for food. \nOnce native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction. \n\"Basically I'm Tinder for the zoo-born lynx,\" says Dina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park with a smile when I speak to her on Zoom.\nIt was her who sent out the SOS for the Newquay lynx. \nThe lynx-breeding coordinator for the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), she matches females and males from across the continent as well as finding new homes for their offspring. \n\"Our nature is very fragmented, due to railways and streets and cities. And this means we created a lot of barriers for the lynx, which leads to inbreeding,\" Dina says.\nTo combat that Dina finds captive young lynx that can be introduced into the wild to increase numbers and improve the genetic mix. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind. \nBut last year, much to Dina's frustration, there was a particularly high number of male lynxes born. And a successful rewilding programme needs females much more  than males.\nSo Dina reached out to Newquay Zoo to ask them if their one year old female might be available.\n\"Of course we said yes straight away, that's something that we'd love to do,\" says John Meek, the curator of plants and animals at Newquay Zoo. \nOver the next few months the lynx will be monitored to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. Catching and killing prey is not expected to be a problem.\n\"If you know your cats, you know that even a cat that has lived in a room its whole life, once it gets out is able to kill a bird or a mouse,\" Eva Klebelsberg who runs the lynx reintroduction programme for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg told us.\nWe're standing over the carcass of a Roe Deer in the Black Forest just outside Karlsruhe. There is a small population of lynxes already living in the forest and this is one of their kills.\nThere are puncture marks on its throat \u2013 a sure sign.\n\"Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,\" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas.\nThe key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans. Having spent its entire life looking through bars at visitors and being fed by keepers it will need to show that it is not going to seek out more human interaction.\n\"Central Europe is very crowded and we don't have many places where there is enough space for larger animals.\" says Dr Marco Roller from Karlsruhe zoo, who manages the enclosure. \n\"We don't want human animal conflicts. So for us it's important we don't have aggressive animals or curious animals which may walk through cities or close to human settlements.\"\nThe final decision on the Newquay lynx's fate will be taken later in the summer after several months of close monitoring. \n",

Dina Gebhardt/Bern Animal ParkDina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park runs the breeding programme for lynx,  match-making males and females from across Europe. \"Basically I'm Tinder for the zoo-born lynx,\" says Dina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park with a smile when I speak to her on Zoom.It was her who sent out the SOS for the Newquay lynx. \"Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,\" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas.The key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans. John Meek from Newquay Zoo was also on hand to see the lynx gingerly stroll out into its new home.",

An outage caused by a faulty software or server update, or even user error, can often be resolved in a matter of hours.\nBut trying to find and stop malware sweeping through systems and causing havoc on the scale of those operated by a large nationwide retailer like M&S, is not a quick job says Professor Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert from Surrey University.\n\"Everything from knowing what has been sold, hence what needs replenishing, to taking card payments is very dependent on complex systems\u2026 it will take significant time and expertise to analyse and ensure they have expelled the hacker,\" he said.\nLisa Forte, partner at cyber security firm Red Goat, agrees.\n\"They are handling the disruption in a mature way but to expect any company to get anything back online in a week is never going to happen,\" she says.\n \"I don't know one organisation that could do it.\"\nA lot is also riding on the nature of the threat. The longer a cyber incident goes on, the more likely it is to be ransomware, say multiple cybersecurity experts.\n\"I would suggest there is a high level of confidence this is a ransomware style event,\" says Dan Card, cyber expert at BCS, the chartered institute for IT.\n\"I describe these as like a digital bomb has gone off. So recovering from them is often both technically and logistically challenging\u2026 the victim organisation is likely going to be working around the clock to respond and recover.\"\nRansomware is a particularly nasty strain of malware, in which the owner of a computer or network of computers is locked out, their data scrambled, and the attackers demand a fee, usually in cryptocurrency, to restore it.\nOfficial advice is not to pay. You are, after all, putting your trust in criminals to be true to their word. \nBut it is often impossible to restore compromised services without the hackers' key \u2013 meaning the only way around it is to either use back-ups or install new systems and start again.\nM&S will not comment, and no attacker has yet gone public with any demands \u2013 although this doesn't always happen, it is often a way for cyber criminals to pile more pressure onto their victims.\nDragonForce, the cyber criminal gang we were told on Tuesday was likely to be behind the attack, allow other hackers to use their malicious software for attacks providing they get a cut.\nAs to who those hackers might be: fingers are pointing at a rather fluid network of individuals called Scattered Spider (it also has other aliases).\nIt was behind the attack on the MGM Las Vegas hotels in 2023.\nThe website Bleeping Computer cites \"multiple sources\" suggesting they are responsible and says some of them are teenagers.\nRik Ferguson, special advisor to Europol's European Cyber Crime Centre, says the sources of speculation about the group's involvement seem credible but adds that he has seen no conclusive evidence so far.\nI asked him whether M&S customers should be concerned about their personal information: the firm itself currently says no action is required.\n\"Only M&S are able to tell us whether customers should be worried about their personal data,\" he said.\n\"In the absence of certainty, it would certainly be advisable for M&S customers, particularly those who may have reused their M&S account credentials on other web services, to begin changing those passwords elsewhere.\"",

        "article_text": "A charity has called for the government to commit to a date when plastic will be banned in wet wipes, to help prevent the effect they are having on the River Thames. \nThames21 says wet wipes are not only creating artificial islands, harming wildlife and impacting water quality; they are reshaping the waterway itself. \nThe charity said although plans were announced last year to ban the sale of plastic wet wipes, progress had halted following the general election. \nA spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: \"Plastic wet wipes clog up our sewers, pollute our waterways and harm our treasured wildlife. That is why the government will ban them.\"\nLiz Gyekye from Thames21 said: \"Wet wipes are a massive problem, it's devastating.\n\"The principal challenge is that people flush the wet wipes down the toilets, then you get sewage overflows after heavy rain that chuck them into the river.\n\"They then destroy wildlife because it ingests these microplastics when they break down.\"\nMs Gyekye said the charity wanted the government to act \"urgently\". \n\"We had the previous Conservative government last year commit to banning plastic in wet wipes, and now we're calling on this government to implement this ban,\" she said. \nAsked why the public were still flushing wet wipes despite the obvious damage being caused, Ms Gyekye said: \"I think the issue is over labels - some labels say they are 'flushable' - but there is no marine biodegradable standard out there - so they should all just go in the bin.\"\nShe added: \"Consumers need to do their part and dispose of their waste correctly, flushing down only the 3 Ps (pee, poo, and paper).\"\nThe director of sustainability at the Port of London Authority (PLA), Grace Rawnsley, said the new Thames super sewer \"should help\" cope with flushed wet wipes, but said the ban on plastic in wet wipes was \"key\" to achieving a cleaner river. \nVolunteer Janice Bruce-Brande said that although the wet wipe island she was surveying was \"soul destroying\", she had noticed a possible improvement since the introduction of the super sewer. \nBut she said it was still \"so disheartening\" to see the wet wipe problem. \nIn response to Thames21's calls, a Defra spokesperson told the BBC: \"Plastic wet wipes clog up our sewers, pollute our waterways and harm our treasured wildlife.\n\"That is why the government will ban them.\n\"This is part of our wider plan to clean up our rivers.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nWSL highlights: Manchester United 0-1 Chelsea\nWhen it comes to the Women's Super League, Chelsea are playing against themselves as much as any other side.\nA 1-0 victory at Manchester United on Wednesday night secured the Blues' sixth successive WSL crown, and their first under new manager Sonia Bompastor.\nSuch regularity may have played a part in the rather muted celebrations at full-time - handshakes and hugs, rather than tears of joy.\nThere is also the Champions League, the holy grail for which Chelsea still search. \nThis title was secured three days after the Blues' attempts to win a first European title were ended, for the third successive season, by Barcelona - and, 8-2 on aggregate, more comprehensively than ever.\nSo how do Chelsea ensure this title win stands out among the six, and that this season - which could end in a domestic treble of WSL, League Cup and FA Cup - is somehow not categorised as a disappointment?\n\"We wanted to be unbeaten,\" Chelsea defender Lucy Bronze told Sky Sports, after scoring the winner at Leigh Sports Village.\n\"The fortunate thing for us this season is that we have stayed unbeaten so we knew there were still two things to play for. We knew before the game Arsenal had got beat and we knew what we needed, but we wanted to win, we wanted to be unbeaten all season.\n\"Although we have won the league tonight we have two games left and we want to win those too. We want to be unbeaten for the whole season.\"\nThe numbers behind Chelsea's latest WSL title\nOnly in three previous completed seasons has the WSL been won by an unbeaten side - Arsenal in 2012, Manchester City in 2016 and Chelsea themselves in 2018.\nBut it has never been done over the current format of a 22-game season. If Chelsea avoid defeat against Tottenham next Sunday then at home to Liverpool on 10 May, they will have broken new ground.\nBompastor will have to deal with the repercussions of such a disappointing Champions League exit - but registering perhaps the most comprehensive WSL title of all time will go some way to making up for it.\nIndeed, if Chelsea win their final two games, they will set a new WSL points record - beating their own tally of 58 in 2022-23. Victory in their remaining fixtures will make the Blues the first side to record 60 points in a campaign.\nSonia Bompastor has added the WSL title to the three French leagues she won with Lyon\n\"I always look for perfection and the ideal,\" Bompastor told her post-match media conference at Leigh Sports Village.\n\"I told my players out of position and defensively I want to keep a clean sheet. I want to fight for each other. We spoke about how we managed the depth and how we needed to be compact, win the duels and win the second balls. It is all these details. \n\"I am never satisfied. Even when we win I am already focused on the treble and the other finals.\"\nBompastor has become the first manager to lead a side to the WSL title in their maiden season since Laura Harvey took Arsenal to the top of the inaugural league in 2011.\nShe admitted she had worried about the pressure when she made her much-vaunted move from Lyon to London, and filling the shoes of predecessor Emma Hayes, who she praised fulsomely after beating Man Utd.\nThis video can not be played\nBompastor - proud of WSL title winners Chelsea\n\"When you come to Chelsea everyone expects you to win the league,\" she said. \"It was the same in Lyon but here the competition is higher. To be able to achieve it for six years in a row for Chelsea and in my first season, it is not easy. \n\"I heard some noise about the fact it is too easy for Chelsea but it is not! When you are able to be unbeaten, to beat Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United twice, I don't know how people can think that. It is unbelievable.\n\"Don't think it's easy. It's never easy. It's a great achievement and a lot of work every day. I don't let my players breathe.\n\"I want to thank Emma [Hayes]. I am sure she is really happy tonight with our title. She left the club in a great place to build on the legacy.\"\nChelsea have not always blown sides away this campaign - they have scored fewer goals than second-placed Arsenal, while no player has netted double figures in the league.\nWednesday night encapsulated their league campaign. United had more shots, a higher xG, and a very solid shout for a penalty before half-time when Millie Bright appeared to trip Grace Clinton. Chelsea keeper Hannah Hampton made five saves and was named player of the match.\nBut they find a way to win, and win, and win. And crucially, not lose.\n\"Coming to this club I always wanted to achieve trophies,\" Hampton told the BBC. \"The fact that I can say that in the two seasons I have been here we have won the title both times it is surreal. It never gets old. As many times as we win it, it'll never get old.\"\nChelsea's season now has three games to run - the two league fixtures, then the FA Cup final against Manchester United, again, on 18 May.\nTo end it unbeaten domestically would be a remarkable achievement.\n\"It's what dreams are made of for Sonia Bompastor,\" former England defender Izzy Christiansen told Sky Sports. \"Her staff, the new players and the existing players that have done this before. They know what it feels like. They don't care where they do it or how they do it as long as they do it.\"\nHead here to get involved\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "Sandy Baltimore has played at left-back for Chelsea this season\nChelsea's dominance on English women's football continues as they wrapped up a sixth successive Women's Super League title on Wednesday.\nWith some of the best players in the world on their books, Chelsea showed they remain a class above the rest in manager Sonia Bompastor's first season in charge.\nSuperstar players have taken centre stage in their title win - but who has gone under the radar in another memorable WSL campaign?\nHere are five unsung heroes of Chelsea's title win.\nThe WSL invincibles? Chelsea eye records after sealing another title\nSummer signing Sandy Baltimore arrived in London from Paris St-Germain with bags of experience in the French league and in Europe. \nBut few could have predicted just how impressive the 25-year-old's debut season at Chelsea would be.\nHaving played as a forward at PSG, Bompastor raised eyebrows when she played Baltimore as a left wing-back. \nThat didn't faze Baltimore though, who went on to make 14 appearances, starting 13 and contributing to four goals in her last four games in the WSL.\nShe told BBC Sport in January: \"I have more responsibility defensively. I love football so that's fine, I will play anywhere. \n\"I am known for my attacking. I love to break forward, to dribble and to make runs towards their goal. But I am enjoying it because it's football.\"\nBaltimore's impressive form and consistency kept England left-back Niamh Charles out of the team. \n\"She can defend well, but can also help the team move forward to create opportunities in the box. It's really nice to have a player like her,\" said Bompastor. \n\"I know different players are competing for that left-back position, but for me, she's really performing and helping the team.\n\"She is having success and it's not just in the last few weeks, it was almost from the beginning of the season.\"\nChelsea broke the world record transfer fee to sign USA centre-back Naomi Girma in January.\nBut that only seemed to provide motivation for Nathalie Bjorn, who must have known her position in the team was under threat. \nAlongside captain Millie Bright, Bjorn has provided stability to Chelsea's defence, with only Manchester United conceding fewer goals throughout the campaign.\nAsked if she had gone under the radar this season, Bright said: \"Yeah, definitely. She's been incredible for us and is a vital part of the changing room. \n\"She keeps everyone together and sometimes that goes unnoticed a little bit as well. She has had a fantastic season and is so easy to play alongside. \n\"She just gives everyone confidence. She is such a team player and as long as the team performs and wins, that is all she cares about.\"\nChelsea signed Wieke Kaptein from FC Twente in 2023 and she returned there on loan for the 2023-24 season \nOne of Chelsea's brightest youngsters is Wieke Kaptein, who signed from FC Twente in 2023 and returned there for a season on loan. \nThe 19-year-old has been a surprise standout under Bompastor, often praised for her work off the ball and how she reads the game. \nShe has been trusted in the big matches and given responsibility, starting in key games against Manchester United, Manchester City and Barcelona. \nSpeaking in October, Bompastor said: \"I am so happy to have her in my squad. She has a lot of energy as a person and as a player.\n\"She is someone who always wants to have some advice from the staff and the coaches. She's listening to us.\n\"Even if she is young, she already has a lot of experience as a player.\"\nOne of the biggest changes to the Chelsea side under Bompastor is a consistent number one. \nGoalkeeper Hannah Hampton has stepped up to the task, performing when it matters and picking up the Player of the Match award in their title-winning match against Manchester United. \nBompastor has encouraged her side to play out from the back and adopt a less direct approach, and Hampton's distribution has proven to be vital in that. \n\"Hampton is probably the best keeper with the ball at her feet. Technically she starts off a lot of Chelsea's attacking play,\" said former England striker Natasha Dowie on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nEx-Scotland defender Jen Beattie added: \"She's been huge. You have all the history of Chelsea winning, but it's Hannah Hampton's first season of success. \n\"She has stepped up massively. She has kept them in a lot of games. It's a big jersey to fill but she has been awesome for this team.\"\nAn ever-present of Chelsea's success, Scotland midfielder Erin Cuthbert does not always get the spotlight but she remains a crucial member of the squad. \nThe 26-year-old has been involved in all six of Chelsea's successive title wins and has made almost 150 appearances for the club.\nShe has a habit of popping up in the big moments - scoring in their Women's FA Cup semi-final victory over Liverpool and providing the stoppage-time winner that sealed a 2-1 result at Manchester City in March. \nHer experience and leadership has been evident again this season and she was soaking up their success after Wednesday's latest title win. \nWhat makes her stand out?\n\"It's her mentality. Last season, when they lost at Liverpool and they thought they had thrown the league title away, I remember seeing Cuthbert on the pitch crying,\" said Dowie. \n\"You saw how much it meant to her to win this title, even though they had already won it for four years in a row. She is a mentality monster, a key player.\"\nHow Chelsea extended dynasty with latest WSL title\nChelsea secure sixth successive WSL title at Man Utd\nHead here to get involved\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

ESA-CNES-ARIANESPACEArtwork: The 1.2-tonne Biomass satellite will deploy an umbrella-like reflector antennaThe satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US. \"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.The 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.It is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.Currently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London. \"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus. \"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said.",

        "article_text": "A commercial expedition is planning to take clients up the tallest mountain in the world in record time with the help of xenon gas. But some in the climbing and medical world worry whether the strategy is an unnecessary gamble.\nWhen Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary\u00a0made their first successful ascent of Mount Everest in 1953, it took more than two months of effort to reach the summit. In order to adjust to the extreme thin air at high altitude, the team spent several weeks acclimatising, working their way slowly upwards. After reaching Base Camp, they spent seven weeks making brief forays up and down the mountain to set ropes, lay ladders and establish ever higher camps before their assault on the summit. In short, they laid siege to the mountain.\nToday, the miles of fixed ropes put along the route by teams of Sherpas and the slick logistics perfected by commercial guiding companies allow hundreds of climbers to summit Everest every year. But the time it takes for most to climb Mount Everest hasn't changed dramatically since that first ascent.\nMany expeditions still recommend allowing around two months to reach the top with extensive acclimatisation, although this depends on a range of factors including the weather, traffic on the mountain and the fitness of the climber. It can take up to a week to trek to Base Camp, but once there most people need, on average, around 40 days to reach the summit. But some companies even offer fast-track expeditions that claim to get clients there in as little as two weeks.\nThis season, however, one guiding company has promised to slash the time even further by taking its clients to the top of the world in just one week, starting from an airport in London. They will fly to Kathmandu in Nepal, take a helicopter to Everest base camp and climb the mountain in only a few days. This way, they will skip the usual painstaking three weeks of acclimatisation in the mountains \u2013 all for around \u20ac150,000 (\u00a3127,000/$170,000) per person. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe offer, which raised more than a few eyebrows in the climbing community, came from Austrian guide Lukas Furtenbach, who will rely on an unexpected new strategy \u2013 inhaling xenon, a noble gas that is sometimes used as an anaesthetic.\nThe logic behind the idea is relatively simple. Around 10 years ago, it became apparent that xenon has one interesting side effect \u2013 it increases production of a protein called erythropoietin. Known for short as EPO, erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that our kidneys produce as reaction to insufficient oxygen levels. EPO fights hypoxia \u2013 a condition that occurs when the body can't get enough oxygen \u2013 by increasing the number of red blood cells and the crucial protein they carry, haemoglobin, which transports oxygen around the body. At high altitudes, this process will naturally happen after multiple rounds of going up and down the mountain \u2013 acclimatisation in other words \u2013 to slowly adapt the body to lower oxygen levels.\nBut xenon, it is claimed, could potentially offer a shortcut. By inhaling carefully controlled doses of the gas shortly before the expedition, it may be possible to accelerate the effects of acclimatisation. Furtenbach says he successfully tested xenon himself on previous expeditions. There is, however, little published scientific evidence showing the strategy works. One recent systematic review of the scientific research, for example, found no conclusive evidence that inhaling xenon had a positive effect on the action of EPO in the human body.\n\"Increase in erythropoietin does nothing on its own,\" says Andrew Peacock, an honorary professor specialising in altitude medicine at the University of Glasgow in the UK. \"The question in this case is, does it really stimulate production of red blood cells in such a short period?\"\nFor Furtenbach, the main goal of this strategy is to allow climbers to summit faster and so reduce the risk of being caught in bad weather, avalanches or getting sick.\n\"The less time you spend on the mountain, the safer the expedition becomes,\" he says.\u00a0\nMore like this:\u00a0\n\u2022 How tall will Mount Everest get before it stops growing\n\u2022 Death in the clouds: The problem with Everest's bodies\n\u2022 Scientists in Antarctica began developing their own accent\nFurtenbach has a reputation for pushing the limits of what is possible on Everest. He has specialised in offering \"flash\" three-week expeditions, where mountaineers pre-acclimatise at home before making their trip. In the Everest climbing season of 2025, he is planning to use the xenon approach to help four British clients reach the summit in early May.\nMany in the mountaineering community, however, have reacted to his plans with a mix of scepticism and condemnation.\nThe medical commission at the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA) \u2013 the umbrella group for mountaineering organisations around the world \u2013 issued a cautionary statement after Furtenbach revealed his plans. It warned of the absence of clinical research or scientific proof about the safety and efficiency of using xenon at high altitudes. A previous assessment by the same body also warned that drugs designed to induce EPO could potentially increase the risk of blood clots capable of triggering strokes or pulmonary embolisms.\nSome climbers have also\u00a0pointed\u00a0out that substances that artificially increase the amount of EPO in the blood \u2013 including xenon \u2013 are\u00a0banned\u00a0by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) in competitive sport.\n\"Why would we use substances in mountaineering that are banned in all other sports,\" says Adrian Ballinger, an American climber and owner of rival guiding company Alpenglow Expeditions. His own company guided climber Roxanne Vogel to the summit of Everest in just 14 days in 2019, where she used an \"altitude chamber\" at the gym and work to help her pre-acclimatise before the expedition.\nBut in the world of commercial guided mountaineering, where anti-doping rules don't apply, clients are largely unconcerned about the style of ascent. Some in the climbing community are simply curious to see how this will unfold.\n\"It would be great if this is true, and we could use xenon in the future to make the work of Sherpas safer,\" says Dawa Steven Sherpa, owner of Nepal-based guiding company Asia Trekking.\nAfter all, it won't be the first time humans have enlisted the help of drugs to survive on the tallest mountains \u2013 one of the harshest environments on Earth.\nAs climbers ascend to high altitude, they experience a drop in atmospheric pressure that reduces the amount of oxygen they inhale. This is because the number of air molecules in the atmosphere falls the higher you get. At 5,500m (18,045ft) \u2013 slightly above the Everest base camp \u2013 there is roughly only half as much oxygen available for us to breathe compared with at sea level. On the summit at 8,850m (29,035ft), this drops to one-third of the usual oxygen. The weather on any given day can also have an effect, leading to dramatic swings in atmospheric pressure to such an extent that it would be equivalent to climbing an additional 700m (2,297ft), according to one study.\nAll of this means that climbers are able to get less oxygen into their blood stream and into their bodies. Researchers who have studied blood oxygen levels of climbers on Everest have recorded some of the lowest levels ever seen in humans.\nIf exposed suddenly to these conditions, people can become severely hypoxic, a state that is normally only seen in critically ill patients being treated in hospitals or during serious incidents while under anaesthetic. From altitudes as low as 4,500m (14,764ft) \u2013 brain function starts to become impaired in ways that affect decision-making and problem-solving tasks.\nThe human body, however, is able to adapt to hypobaric hypoxia (hypoxia caused by low air pressure) and reacts with a range of different responses, explains Martin Burtscher, a long-time researcher in the field of high-altitude medicine and professor at University of Innsbruck in Austria. We start to hyperventilate and consequently exhale more carbon dioxide, which helps counteract oxygen desaturation. Kidney and bladder function also change to increase the concentration of blood cells, while an increase in heart rate drives more oxygen around the body, says Burtscher.\nErythropoiesis, a process that increases red blood cell production in response to the presence of EPO, is one of the most important adaptations. After weeks of acclimatisation, erythropoiesis increases total blood volume and oxygen transportation capacity.\nSometimes, however, these adaptive responses can fail.\n\"If hypoxia becomes too severe, acute mountain sickness or life-threatening pulmonary or brain oedema develop,\" says Burtscher.\nIn those cases, capillaries of the lung and the brain lose their ability to retain fluids, which leaks out between the cells into brain or lung tissue, explains Andrew Peacock. The consequence is loss of brain or lung function, both potentially fatal.\nIt is why most climbers on the world's highest mountains use supplementary oxygen, delivered from canisters through breathing apparatus, with a constant flow of the gas coming from high-pressure cylinders that mountaineers carry in their backpacks.\n\"It makes a huge difference,\" says Peacock. \"You are basically mimicking a lower altitude. It makes you less breathless, and it improves the function of the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver and muscles.\" \u00a0\u00a0\nBoth Hillary and Norgay used supplementary oxygen in 1953 and that approach continues today. Of 7,269 people known to have reached the summit of Mount Everest, only 230 have done it without the aid of supplemental oxygen.\nThere are some in the mountaineering community, however, who believe supplemental oxygen could also be considered as doping. It is a highly charged debate, balancing climber safety against ideals of a more \"pure\" style of mountaineering. The Piolet d'Or, the most prestigious annual award in mountaineering, tends to celebrate ascents achieved without supplemental oxygen, for example.\nEager to mitigate the effects of altitude further, some mountaineers and doctors have been willing to experiment with other remedies too, from existing prescription drugs to sketchy stimulants.\nIn 1953, the legendary Austrian alpinist Hermann Buhl achieved one the greatest feats in the history of mountaineering, summiting alone on the 8,126m (26,660ft) Himalayan peak Nanga Parbat. It remains the only time anyone has managed a \"solo\" first ascent of an 8,000m (26,247ft) peak. Buhl's feat is considered even more impressive as he did it without supplemental oxygen. During the gruesome descent, he was famously forced to spend the night at 7,900m (25,919ft), standing on a narrow ledge while leaning against a rock. At that time, Buhl was already known as a hard-core, pioneering alpinist. Still, it was unthinkable that somebody could survive this ordeal.\nAs he later described in his autobiography, he did, however, have a little help in his backpack in form of pervitin, methamphetamine pills that had been widely used by Nazi troops during World War Two.\nAnother stimulant, amphetamine, is often rumoured to be occasionally used by climbers on high-altitude mountain slopes. One study from 1993 analysed urine samples taken from 253 male mountaineers after a successful ascent to different mountains. Amphetamines traces were found in 7.1% of samples from those climbing above 3,300m (10,827ft).\nBy far the most popular prescription drug among mountaineers is acetazolamide, better known as Diamox. This carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, used in the treatment of many conditions, from glaucoma to epilepsy, also happens to be quite useful at high altitudes.\n\"It accelerates acclimatisation and improves sleep,\" says Burtscher.\nDexamethasone, a powerful corticosteroid, is still considered as the number one life-saving medicine for cerebral oedema and acute mountain sickness since it buys some time for the sick person to descend. Some research has indicated that dexamethasone could also be useful as a prophylactic treatment to stave off acute mountain sickness, although medical experts warn that it can result in potentially serious side effects and do not recommend it for this use.\nThere were hopes that sildenafil, commonly known as Viagra, could also help to protect against high-altitude pulmonary oedema, but trials did not shown it to be effective.\nThe search for other drugs that can help give climbers a boost in performance and acclimatisation at high altitude never stopped. A team of doctors in Willemstad, Cura\u00e7ao, for example, recently published details about a test of a drug normally used to treat anaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Two climbers took the drug, which stimulates EPO production, as they ascended Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.\nBut even with all this help, Everest is a treacherous place and there is no guarantee of survival. Although there is little research on how long someone can remain at very high altitudes, experts agree that even with acclimatisation, the body will eventually start to deteriorate. Extremes of cold and wind exposure, the strain placed on the lungs and heart, deterioration of the tissues and organs, dehydration and weight loss all make spending any prolonged visit to the so called \"Death Zone\" \u2013 generally considered to be above 8,000m (26,247ft) \u2013 increasingly dangerous.\nSo, cutting down the time spent on the mountain is always beneficial.\nThis is where xenon could make a real difference, at least according to Michael Fries, head of the department of anaesthesiology at St Vincenz Krankenhaus Limburg in Germany, who came up with the idea and suggested it to Furtenbach. \u00a0\nXenon has been used in a wide range of products, from car headlights to ion propulsion engines and ballistic missiles. It could also serve as an anaesthetic, which is something Fries spent years researching while working at University Hospital Aachen in Germany.\n\"It is an almost ideal anaesthetic since it has a very rapid effect, quickly leaves the body and doesn't interact with other drugs,\" says Fries.\nUsing xenon for anaesthesia, however, proved to be challenging for multiple reasons. This extremely expensive gas must make up 70% of the anaesthetic mixture and it requires special equipment for administration.\nThen, in 2014, Fries and his colleagues heard claims that some Russian athletes had used xenon at the 2014 Winter Olympics to improve performance, so the group from University Hospital Aachen did their own study on 24 healthy volunteers. The results confirmed that a single inhalation of 30% xenon for 45 minutes significantly increased EPO level eight hours after exposure. According to Fries, the main effect of EPO production should be strongest within the first few days and last up to 14 days.\nCurious if this advantage could be used in the hypoxia-inducing world of high-altitude mountaineering, Fries contacted Furtenbach.\nPreviously, Furtenbach had managed to shorten the Everest expedition time to two weeks by using so-called hypoxic pre-acclimatisation. However, sleeping at home for eight weeks in tents with a lower percentage of oxygen or repeatedly breathing reduced amounts of air through a mask was never a strategy that found much favour among his clients.\nKeen to try the xenon idea, Furtenbach did a test run on Aconcagua, 6,961m (22,838ft) high mountain in Argentina. He received a low dose of xenon shortly before the expedition in 2020.\n\"I reached the summit within a week, without any prior acclimatisation. I felt strong and fast,\" says Furtenbach.\nHe claims his red blood cell count went up by 10% while measurements of his blood oxygen saturation on the summit showed it was 89%.\nIf true, academics say, this would be remarkable. \u00a0At sea level, normal blood oxygen saturation is between 96-100%. Measurements taken from nine climbers during an expedition to Everest in 1993 showed that blood oxygen saturation of climbers fell below 90% at around 4,700m (15,420ft), while at 8,000m (26,247ft) climbers had only 70% saturation without supplementary oxygen. Even with supplementary oxygen, this increased only to 80%. Measurements taken during a research expedition to Everest in 2007 showed an even starker reduction in blood oxygen saturation in four climbers at an altitude of 8,400m (27,559ft), measuring some of the lowest levels ever recorded in humans who are not already close to death.\n\"I'm quite sceptical,\" says Mike Grocott, professor of anaesthesia and critical care at University of Southampton who led the research team during the 2007 expedition and has summited Everest himself. \"Xenon has a number of biological mechanisms, including boosting EPO, but the effect on red blood cells and oxygen transport is questionable.\"\nIn 2022, Furtenbach and two fellow guides did another xenon test \u2013 this time on Everest. The results, he says, were the same as on Aconcagua, except this time the group prepared at home with hypoxic pre-acclimatisation, where their bodies were slowly introduced to lower levels of oxygen by sleeping in a hypoxic tent at home.\n\"In each of these cases, we could see the effects on the endurance and the physical abilities,\" says Fries, who was involved in analysing the data gathered during the tests. \"They all had high oxygen saturations without the long acclimatisation periods and increase in haemoglobin levels.\"\nBut he acknowledges there is still a lack of peer-reviewed scientific research on this and says he hopes to publish findings in the future.\nFries also refutes concerns that xenon, when administered in small doses, could reduce decision-making ability on the mountain. The UIAA medical committee, for example, warned that using an anaesthetic gas in an unmonitored setting could affect brain function, stating \"even slight sedation is detrimental in the potentially dangerous setting of high-altitude mountaineering\". Fries says that in small doses, xenon only results in a short period of dizziness immediately after administration. \u00a0\nThree medical experts the BBC contacted for this story \u2013 all veterans of high-altitude research \u2013 are not entirely convinced about the strategy as a way to summit the highest mountain on Earth. They argue there is insufficient scientific proof that xenon actually does enhance performance at high altitude.\nBurtschner and Grocott both point to a study which confirmed that xenon did increase EPO concentration, but failed to \"stimulate increases in plasma volume or erythropoiesis, leaving cardiorespiratory fitness and athletic performance unchanged\".\nXenon, Grocott says, would need to have an \"extraordinary\" effect to enable someone to climb to the summit in just one week. \"That would have to be a very dramatic change. And I haven't seen any data suggesting that's true.\"\nIn the meantime, Furtenbach is proceeding with the plan to send four clients up Everest with the help of xenon gas. All four are in good physical shape, he says. They will climb with guides and bottled oxygen. Once new fixed ropes are in place, all the team will need is seven days of good weather.\u00a0\nThe rest of the world, meanwhile, will be watching.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "A commercial expedition is planning to take clients up the tallest mountain in the world in record time with the help of xenon gas. But some in the climbing and medical world worry whether the strategy is an unnecessary gamble.\nWhen Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary\u00a0made their first successful ascent of Mount Everest in 1953, it took more than two months of effort to reach the summit. In order to adjust to the extreme thin air at high altitude, the team spent several weeks acclimatising, working their way slowly upwards. After reaching Base Camp, they spent seven weeks making brief forays up and down the mountain to set ropes, lay ladders and establish ever higher camps before their assault on the summit. In short, they laid siege to the mountain.\nToday, the miles of fixed ropes put along the route by teams of Sherpas and the slick logistics perfected by commercial guiding companies allow hundreds of climbers to summit Everest every year. But the time it takes for most to climb Mount Everest hasn't changed dramatically since that first ascent.\nMany expeditions still recommend allowing around two months to reach the top with extensive acclimatisation, although this depends on a range of factors including the weather, traffic on the mountain and the fitness of the climber. It can take up to a week to trek to Base Camp, but once there most people need, on average, around 40 days to reach the summit. But some companies even offer fast-track expeditions that claim to get clients there in as little as two weeks.\nThis season, however, one guiding company has promised to slash the time even further by taking its clients to the top of the world in just one week, starting from an airport in London. They will fly to Kathmandu in Nepal, take a helicopter to Everest base camp and climb the mountain in only a few days. This way, they will skip the usual painstaking three weeks of acclimatisation in the mountains \u2013 all for around \u20ac150,000 (\u00a3127,000/$170,000) per person. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe offer, which raised more than a few eyebrows in the climbing community, came from Austrian guide Lukas Furtenbach, who will rely on an unexpected new strategy \u2013 inhaling xenon, a noble gas that is sometimes used as an anaesthetic.\nThe logic behind the idea is relatively simple. Around 10 years ago, it became apparent that xenon has one interesting side effect \u2013 it increases production of a protein called erythropoietin. Known for short as EPO, erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that our kidneys produce as reaction to insufficient oxygen levels. EPO fights hypoxia \u2013 a condition that occurs when the body can't get enough oxygen \u2013 by increasing the number of red blood cells and the crucial protein they carry, haemoglobin, which transports oxygen around the body. At high altitudes, this process will naturally happen after multiple rounds of going up and down the mountain \u2013 acclimatisation in other words \u2013 to slowly adapt the body to lower oxygen levels.\nBut xenon, it is claimed, could potentially offer a shortcut. By inhaling carefully controlled doses of the gas shortly before the expedition, it may be possible to accelerate the effects of acclimatisation. Furtenbach says he successfully tested xenon himself on previous expeditions. There is, however, little published scientific evidence showing the strategy works. One recent systematic review of the scientific research, for example, found no conclusive evidence that inhaling xenon had a positive effect on the action of EPO in the human body.\n\"Increase in erythropoietin does nothing on its own,\" says Andrew Peacock, an honorary professor specialising in altitude medicine at the University of Glasgow in the UK. \"The question in this case is, does it really stimulate production of red blood cells in such a short period?\"\nFor Furtenbach, the main goal of this strategy is to allow climbers to summit faster and so reduce the risk of being caught in bad weather, avalanches or getting sick.\n\"The less time you spend on the mountain, the safer the expedition becomes,\" he says.\u00a0\nMore like this:\u00a0\n\u2022 How tall will Mount Everest get before it stops growing\n\u2022 Death in the clouds: The problem with Everest's bodies\n\u2022 Scientists in Antarctica began developing their own accent\nFurtenbach has a reputation for pushing the limits of what is possible on Everest. He has specialised in offering \"flash\" three-week expeditions, where mountaineers pre-acclimatise at home before making their trip. In the Everest climbing season of 2025, he is planning to use the xenon approach to help four British clients reach the summit in early May.\nMany in the mountaineering community, however, have reacted to his plans with a mix of scepticism and condemnation.\nThe medical commission at the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA) \u2013 the umbrella group for mountaineering organisations around the world \u2013 issued a cautionary statement after Furtenbach revealed his plans. It warned of the absence of clinical research or scientific proof about the safety and efficiency of using xenon at high altitudes. A previous assessment by the same body also warned that drugs designed to induce EPO could potentially increase the risk of blood clots capable of triggering strokes or pulmonary embolisms.\nSome climbers have also\u00a0pointed\u00a0out that substances that artificially increase the amount of EPO in the blood \u2013 including xenon \u2013 are\u00a0banned\u00a0by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) in competitive sport.\n\"Why would we use substances in mountaineering that are banned in all other sports,\" says Adrian Ballinger, an American climber and owner of rival guiding company Alpenglow Expeditions. His own company guided climber Roxanne Vogel to the summit of Everest in just 14 days in 2019, where she used an \"altitude chamber\" at the gym and work to help her pre-acclimatise before the expedition.\nBut in the world of commercial guided mountaineering, where anti-doping rules don't apply, clients are largely unconcerned about the style of ascent. Some in the climbing community are simply curious to see how this will unfold.\n\"It would be great if this is true, and we could use xenon in the future to make the work of Sherpas safer,\" says Dawa Steven Sherpa, owner of Nepal-based guiding company Asia Trekking.\nAfter all, it won't be the first time humans have enlisted the help of drugs to survive on the tallest mountains \u2013 one of the harshest environments on Earth.\nAs climbers ascend to high altitude, they experience a drop in atmospheric pressure that reduces the amount of oxygen they inhale. This is because the number of air molecules in the atmosphere falls the higher you get. At 5,500m (18,045ft) \u2013 slightly above the Everest base camp \u2013 there is roughly only half as much oxygen available for us to breathe compared with at sea level. On the summit at 8,850m (29,035ft), this drops to one-third of the usual oxygen. The weather on any given day can also have an effect, leading to dramatic swings in atmospheric pressure to such an extent that it would be equivalent to climbing an additional 700m (2,297ft), according to one study.\nAll of this means that climbers are able to get less oxygen into their blood stream and into their bodies. Researchers who have studied blood oxygen levels of climbers on Everest have recorded some of the lowest levels ever seen in humans.\nIf exposed suddenly to these conditions, people can become severely hypoxic, a state that is normally only seen in critically ill patients being treated in hospitals or during serious incidents while under anaesthetic. From altitudes as low as 4,500m (14,764ft) \u2013 brain function starts to become impaired in ways that affect decision-making and problem-solving tasks.\nThe human body, however, is able to adapt to hypobaric hypoxia (hypoxia caused by low air pressure) and reacts with a range of different responses, explains Martin Burtscher, a long-time researcher in the field of high-altitude medicine and professor at University of Innsbruck in Austria. We start to hyperventilate and consequently exhale more carbon dioxide, which helps counteract oxygen desaturation. Kidney and bladder function also change to increase the concentration of blood cells, while an increase in heart rate drives more oxygen around the body, says Burtscher.\nErythropoiesis, a process that increases red blood cell production in response to the presence of EPO, is one of the most important adaptations. After weeks of acclimatisation, erythropoiesis increases total blood volume and oxygen transportation capacity.\nSometimes, however, these adaptive responses can fail.\n\"If hypoxia becomes too severe, acute mountain sickness or life-threatening pulmonary or brain oedema develop,\" says Burtscher.\nIn those cases, capillaries of the lung and the brain lose their ability to retain fluids, which leaks out between the cells into brain or lung tissue, explains Andrew Peacock. The consequence is loss of brain or lung function, both potentially fatal.\nIt is why most climbers on the world's highest mountains use supplementary oxygen, delivered from canisters through breathing apparatus, with a constant flow of the gas coming from high-pressure cylinders that mountaineers carry in their backpacks.\n\"It makes a huge difference,\" says Peacock. \"You are basically mimicking a lower altitude. It makes you less breathless, and it improves the function of the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver and muscles.\" \u00a0\u00a0\nBoth Hillary and Norgay used supplementary oxygen in 1953 and that approach continues today. Of 7,269 people known to have reached the summit of Mount Everest, only 230 have done it without the aid of supplemental oxygen.\nThere are some in the mountaineering community, however, who believe supplemental oxygen could also be considered as doping. It is a highly charged debate, balancing climber safety against ideals of a more \"pure\" style of mountaineering. The Piolet d'Or, the most prestigious annual award in mountaineering, tends to celebrate ascents achieved without supplemental oxygen, for example.\nEager to mitigate the effects of altitude further, some mountaineers and doctors have been willing to experiment with other remedies too, from existing prescription drugs to sketchy stimulants.\nIn 1953, the legendary Austrian alpinist Hermann Buhl achieved one the greatest feats in the history of mountaineering, summiting alone on the 8,126m (26,660ft) Himalayan peak Nanga Parbat. It remains the only time anyone has managed a \"solo\" first ascent of an 8,000m (26,247ft) peak. Buhl's feat is considered even more impressive as he did it without supplemental oxygen. During the gruesome descent, he was famously forced to spend the night at 7,900m (25,919ft), standing on a narrow ledge while leaning against a rock. At that time, Buhl was already known as a hard-core, pioneering alpinist. Still, it was unthinkable that somebody could survive this ordeal.\nAs he later described in his autobiography, he did, however, have a little help in his backpack in form of pervitin, methamphetamine pills that had been widely used by Nazi troops during World War Two.\nAnother stimulant, amphetamine, is often rumoured to be occasionally used by climbers on high-altitude mountain slopes. One study from 1993 analysed urine samples taken from 253 male mountaineers after a successful ascent to different mountains. Amphetamines traces were found in 7.1% of samples from those climbing above 3,300m (10,827ft).\nBy far the most popular prescription drug among mountaineers is acetazolamide, better known as Diamox. This carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, used in the treatment of many conditions, from glaucoma to epilepsy, also happens to be quite useful at high altitudes.\n\"It accelerates acclimatisation and improves sleep,\" says Burtscher.\nDexamethasone, a powerful corticosteroid, is still considered as the number one life-saving medicine for cerebral oedema and acute mountain sickness since it buys some time for the sick person to descend. Some research has indicated that dexamethasone could also be useful as a prophylactic treatment to stave off acute mountain sickness, although medical experts warn that it can result in potentially serious side effects and do not recommend it for this use.\nThere were hopes that sildenafil, commonly known as Viagra, could also help to protect against high-altitude pulmonary oedema, but trials did not shown it to be effective.\nThe search for other drugs that can help give climbers a boost in performance and acclimatisation at high altitude never stopped. A team of doctors in Willemstad, Cura\u00e7ao, for example, recently published details about a test of a drug normally used to treat anaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Two climbers took the drug, which stimulates EPO production, as they ascended Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.\nBut even with all this help, Everest is a treacherous place and there is no guarantee of survival. Although there is little research on how long someone can remain at very high altitudes, experts agree that even with acclimatisation, the body will eventually start to deteriorate. Extremes of cold and wind exposure, the strain placed on the lungs and heart, deterioration of the tissues and organs, dehydration and weight loss all make spending any prolonged visit to the so called \"Death Zone\" \u2013 generally considered to be above 8,000m (26,247ft) \u2013 increasingly dangerous.\nSo, cutting down the time spent on the mountain is always beneficial.\nThis is where xenon could make a real difference, at least according to Michael Fries, head of the department of anaesthesiology at St Vincenz Krankenhaus Limburg in Germany, who came up with the idea and suggested it to Furtenbach. \u00a0\nXenon has been used in a wide range of products, from car headlights to ion propulsion engines and ballistic missiles. It could also serve as an anaesthetic, which is something Fries spent years researching while working at University Hospital Aachen in Germany.\n\"It is an almost ideal anaesthetic since it has a very rapid effect, quickly leaves the body and doesn't interact with other drugs,\" says Fries.\nUsing xenon for anaesthesia, however, proved to be challenging for multiple reasons. This extremely expensive gas must make up 70% of the anaesthetic mixture and it requires special equipment for administration.\nThen, in 2014, Fries and his colleagues heard claims that some Russian athletes had used xenon at the 2014 Winter Olympics to improve performance, so the group from University Hospital Aachen did their own study on 24 healthy volunteers. The results confirmed that a single inhalation of 30% xenon for 45 minutes significantly increased EPO level eight hours after exposure. According to Fries, the main effect of EPO production should be strongest within the first few days and last up to 14 days.\nCurious if this advantage could be used in the hypoxia-inducing world of high-altitude mountaineering, Fries contacted Furtenbach.\nPreviously, Furtenbach had managed to shorten the Everest expedition time to two weeks by using so-called hypoxic pre-acclimatisation. However, sleeping at home for eight weeks in tents with a lower percentage of oxygen or repeatedly breathing reduced amounts of air through a mask was never a strategy that found much favour among his clients.\nKeen to try the xenon idea, Furtenbach did a test run on Aconcagua, 6,961m (22,838ft) high mountain in Argentina. He received a low dose of xenon shortly before the expedition in 2020.\n\"I reached the summit within a week, without any prior acclimatisation. I felt strong and fast,\" says Furtenbach.\nHe claims his red blood cell count went up by 10% while measurements of his blood oxygen saturation on the summit showed it was 89%.\nIf true, academics say, this would be remarkable. \u00a0At sea level, normal blood oxygen saturation is between 96-100%. Measurements taken from nine climbers during an expedition to Everest in 1993 showed that blood oxygen saturation of climbers fell below 90% at around 4,700m (15,420ft), while at 8,000m (26,247ft) climbers had only 70% saturation without supplementary oxygen. Even with supplementary oxygen, this increased only to 80%. Measurements taken during a research expedition to Everest in 2007 showed an even starker reduction in blood oxygen saturation in four climbers at an altitude of 8,400m (27,559ft), measuring some of the lowest levels ever recorded in humans who are not already close to death.\n\"I'm quite sceptical,\" says Mike Grocott, professor of anaesthesia and critical care at University of Southampton who led the research team during the 2007 expedition and has summited Everest himself. \"Xenon has a number of biological mechanisms, including boosting EPO, but the effect on red blood cells and oxygen transport is questionable.\"\nIn 2022, Furtenbach and two fellow guides did another xenon test \u2013 this time on Everest. The results, he says, were the same as on Aconcagua, except this time the group prepared at home with hypoxic pre-acclimatisation, where their bodies were slowly introduced to lower levels of oxygen by sleeping in a hypoxic tent at home.\n\"In each of these cases, we could see the effects on the endurance and the physical abilities,\" says Fries, who was involved in analysing the data gathered during the tests. \"They all had high oxygen saturations without the long acclimatisation periods and increase in haemoglobin levels.\"\nBut he acknowledges there is still a lack of peer-reviewed scientific research on this and says he hopes to publish findings in the future.\nFries also refutes concerns that xenon, when administered in small doses, could reduce decision-making ability on the mountain. The UIAA medical committee, for example, warned that using an anaesthetic gas in an unmonitored setting could affect brain function, stating \"even slight sedation is detrimental in the potentially dangerous setting of high-altitude mountaineering\". Fries says that in small doses, xenon only results in a short period of dizziness immediately after administration. \u00a0\nThree medical experts the BBC contacted for this story \u2013 all veterans of high-altitude research \u2013 are not entirely convinced about the strategy as a way to summit the highest mountain on Earth. They argue there is insufficient scientific proof that xenon actually does enhance performance at high altitude.\nBurtschner and Grocott both point to a study which confirmed that xenon did increase EPO concentration, but failed to \"stimulate increases in plasma volume or erythropoiesis, leaving cardiorespiratory fitness and athletic performance unchanged\".\nXenon, Grocott says, would need to have an \"extraordinary\" effect to enable someone to climb to the summit in just one week. \"That would have to be a very dramatic change. And I haven't seen any data suggesting that's true.\"\nIn the meantime, Furtenbach is proceeding with the plan to send four clients up Everest with the help of xenon gas. All four are in good physical shape, he says. They will climb with guides and bottled oxygen. Once new fixed ropes are in place, all the team will need is seven days of good weather.\u00a0\nThe rest of the world, meanwhile, will be watching.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "summary": "\"It would be great if this is true, and we could use xenon in the future to make the work of Sherpas safer,\" says Dawa Steven Sherpa, owner of Nepal-based guiding company Asia Trekking.After all, it won't be the first time humans have enlisted the help of drugs to survive on the tallest mountains \u2013 one of the harshest environments on Earth.Researchers who have studied blood oxygen levels of climbers on Everest have recorded some of the lowest levels ever seen in humansAs climbers ascend to high altitude, they experience a drop in atmospheric pressure that reduces the amount of oxygen they inhale. At high altitudes, this process will naturally happen after multiple rounds of going up and down the mountain \u2013 acclimatisation in other words \u2013 to slowly adapt the body to lower oxygen levels.Getty ImagesMost climbers undergo extensive acclimatisation at high altitude to help their bodies adapt to the low levels of oxygen (Credit: Getty Images)But xenon, it is claimed, could potentially offer a shortcut. According to Fries, the main effect of EPO production should be strongest within the first few days and last up to 14 days.Curious if this advantage could be used in the hypoxia-inducing world of high-altitude mountaineering, Fries contacted Furtenbach.Previously, Furtenbach had managed to shorten the Everest expedition time to two weeks by using so-called hypoxic pre-acclimatisation. A previous assessment by the same body also warned that drugs designed to induce EPO could potentially increase the risk of blood clots capable of triggering strokes or pulmonary embolisms.Furtenbach AdventuresLukas Furtenbach hope that giving climbers small doses of xenon gas before their ascent will reducing the amount of time they spend on the mountain (Credit: Furtenbach Adventures)Some climbers have also\u00a0pointed\u00a0out that substances that artificially increase the amount of EPO in the blood \u2013 including xenon \u2013 are\u00a0banned\u00a0by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) in competitive sport. Measurements taken from nine climbers during an expedition to Everest in 1993 showed that blood oxygen saturation of climbers fell below 90% at around 4,700m (15,420ft), while at 8,000m (26,247ft) climbers had only 70% saturation without supplementary oxygen.",

It comes as Trump marks 100 days in office, with opinion polls indicating public discontent over his economic stewardship.\nSpeaking on Wednesday afternoon at a White House event attended by business leaders, Trump blamed his Democratic predecessor, President Joe Biden, for the disappointing gross domestic product data.\n\"This is Biden's economy because we took over on January 20th,\" Trump said. \"I think you have to give us a little bit of time to get moving.\"\nIt comes in the aftermath of the Republican president's import taxes, which have disrupted global trade and markets.  \nTrump's finger pointing at Biden drew scorn from Democrats.\nCongressman Hakeem Jeffries, minority leader of the US House of Representatives, said: \"This is not Joe Biden's economy, Donald, it is your economy.\n\"It is the Trump economy, it is a failed economy and the American people know it.\"\nAt Wednesday's White House event, Trump touted planned investments in technology, healthcare and infrastructure.\nHe introduced CEOs of major companies, including Hyundai's Jose Munoz, Toyota's Ted Ogawa, and Johnson & Johnson's Joaquin Duato.\nTrump also urged Congress to pass his tax bill, which includes trillions of dollars in tax and spending cuts, but faces opposition from Democrats and some Republicans.\nAt a television appearance earlier in the day with cabinet members, Trump played down fears of shortages of items such as toys, as trade between the US and China falls sharply.\n\"Well, maybe the children will have to have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know?\" he said. \"And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.\"\nTrump has enacted 10% levies on imports to the US from nearly all countries, after announcing a 90-day pause on higher tariffs. The amount paid by these countries could change after the period expires in July. \nAnother 25% tariff has been imposed on Mexico and Canada. The levies on China, however, have led to an all-out trade war with the world's second largest economy.\nTrump imposed import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods coming into the US and China hit back with a 125% tax on American products.\nHis administration said when the new tariffs were added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Listen to Katy read this article\nIn Western Sydney, an audience of Stetson-wearing Australians are sitting in their fold-up camping chairs, swigging beers and eating a spiralled fried potato on a skewer known as a 'chip on a stick'.\nPeople here are enjoying bull rides, barrel racing and bucking broncos. It feels like a slice of Americana in New South Wales perhaps - but that would miss the point that here, rodeo has become very much an outback Australian tradition in its own right.\nIn recent months, politics here in Australia could be compared to watching a rodeo. Between conflict in Europe, the Middle East and more recently US President Donald Trump and his threat of global trade wars, every day has brought with it a sharp jolt that changes the dynamics of the campaign trail. Politicians, like these cowboys, have been thrown off course despite their best efforts.\n\"Tariffs are great,\" exclaims rodeo fan Guy Algozzino, who's dressed in a cowboy hat, a waistcoat and a Western-style bolo tie with an engraved image of a cowboy riding a bull. \"We should have had tariff protection many years ago - it looks bad now [but] America's fantastic \u2026 Trump's the best thing America ever had.''\nOther spectators are more nuanced.\n\"It's going nuts,\" admits Jared Harris, when asked about world politics. \"I'm just sitting back and watching. It's a bit like a show. It's quite interesting to watch, it's entertaining. It probably affects me more than I realise, but I just choose to ignore it.\"\nAustralia didn't worry too much about President Trump's second coming when he won power back in November. The country had already witnessed a Trump presidency \u2013 and weathered it. Australia felt far removed from the shores of America.\nBut Trump's second term is panning out very differently. Tariffs - imposed on ally and adversary alike - have travelled the whole world. \nTrump doesn't care about making enemies. But Australia does. People here pride themselves on 'mateship' \u2013 a value that embodies friendship and loyalty \u2013 and that extends to politics too.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said as much when Trump initially announced tariffs without exemptions. This was not \"the act of a friend,\" said Albanese, while he also committed to not responding in kind.\nAll of this comes as the country heads to a federal election on 3 May. Candidates would rather focus on domestic issues they can control: cost-of-living, housing and healthcare. Instead, they are forced to grapple with a question that goes right to the heart of Australia's role in the world: how to deal with a US president as unpredictable as Trump?\nIn the final few days of campaigning before up to 18 million Australians go to the polls, the Labor Party's Albanese, who entered power three years ago after promising to invest in social services and tackle climate change, went on a speedy tour of six states. That effort appears to be paying off, with the latest YouGov poll putting Labor on 54 per cent of the two-party vote, versus 47 per cent for the opposition Coalition (an alliance of the Liberals and Nationals). This is a modest turnaround from the beginning of the year, when Labor was consistently lagging the Coalition in polls.\n\"It's not the campaign either party thought they would be having,\" says Amy Remeikis, chief political analyst at the Australia Institute think tank. \"The looming figure of Trump is overshadowing the domestic campaign but also forcing Australia's leaders to do something they haven't had to do in a long time - examine Australia's links to the US.\"\nThe US-Australia relationship has perhaps been taken for granted in these parts. Australia likes the fact the US has long been a dominant military force in the Pacific. Australia relies on its funding and benefits from being part of alliances like Aukus - the far-reaching defence pact between Australia, the UK and the US, designed to counter China \u2013 and the Anglo-intelligence alliance Five Eyes.\nThe rise of China has made Australia even more conscious about having the US on its side. Beijing has expanded its military presence in the Pacific, launching various military exercises in recent years - including one live-fire drill in February that saw Chinese naval vessels just 340 nautical miles from the New South Wales coast. Australia recently announced efforts to expand its navy and now hosts four US military bases - decisions fuelled in part by the rise of China.\nIt's all placed extra value on Canberra's alliance with Washington DC - one that Trump may be throwing into doubt.\nBack in February, Trump held a meeting with the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. He was asked whether they would be discussing Aukus.\n\"What does that mean?\" Trump asked the reporter. After being given an explanation of Aukus, he continued. \"We'll be discussing that \u2026 we've had a very good relationship with Australia.\"\nAustralia collectively held its breath, then let it out in a big sigh of relief.\nA blip maybe - but an indication perhaps of how little Trump thinks about Australia right now. However, Australia, like much of the world, is thinking about the US.\n\"We don't have anywhere else to turn,\" says David Andrews, senior policy advisor at the National Security College, which is part of the Australian National University in Canberra. \"We are physically isolated from everyone. As long as we've had European settlement here, we've always been concerned about the distance [and] isolation, which is why we've always maintained such a strong relationship with first Britain and then the US as the dominant maritime power.\"\nWhile only 5% of Australia's exports go to the US (China is by far Australia's biggest trading partner), the US still dominates the conversation here.\n\"This isn't a time to end alliances,\" says Justin Bassi, director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank. \"That would be cutting off our nose to spite our face.\"\nAnd, perhaps counter to the majority view here, Bassi thinks that Australia should support Trump's moves.\n\"We should continue to make it clear that any measures the US takes against Australia are unjustified but we should welcome and support American measures to counter Beijing's malign actions - or for that matter Russia,\" he says. \"Not to keep Trump happy but because it is in Australia's interests to constrain the adversary that is undermining our strategic interests.\"\nA poll published by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper last month found that 60% of Australians felt Trump's victory was bad for Australia. That was up from last November when it was just 40%.\nAnd a Lowy Institute poll published two weeks later showed almost two in three Australians held 'not very much' or no trust 'at all' in the US to act responsibly.\nBig questions on transnational alliances are not part of normal campaigning. But when Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton faced each other in their first televised debate, the first question asked by the audience was one on Trump.\nDutton has long stressed that he would be the politician best suited to dealing with the US President. He often cites his experience as a cabinet minister during tariff negotiations in Trump's first term. But that strategy doesn't always serve him well.\n\"He went into the election telling people he and Trump were similar enough that they would get on better, that he was the sort of personality Trump liked,\" says Remeikis. \"He's not repeating that now because people don't want someone to get on with Trump - they want someone who will stand up to him.\"\nDutton has had to do some back-pedalling on comments he made earlier in the year. Back in February, after Trump said he had plans to eject Palestinians from Gaza, Dutton called the US president \"a deal-maker \u2026 a big thinker.\"\nAnd he has come in for some criticism amid accusations of copying the US president. He's talked about cutting public sector jobs, for example. And his Liberal party appointed Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as shadow minister for government efficiency, not too dissimilar to the Doge. But when Senator Price recently started talking about wanting to 'Make Australia Great Again' on the campaign trail, Dutton avoided questions over the comments.\nAlbanese of course has to tread a careful line too. In a world that's being turned upside down, he's trying to reassure people he's a safe pair of hands; that those alliances remain.\nThat may turn out to be in his favour.\nIndeed, some analysts say that Trump's conduct may be helping Albanese, with voters rushing to support the incumbent during a time of perceived crisis. Just a few months ago, Labor's re-election was thought unlikely as it consistently polled behind the Coalition. But the final YouGov polling model of the election, published a few days ago, predicted that Labor will win 84 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives - an increased majority.\nFor Professor Gordon Flake, CEO at Perth USAsia Centre, a think tank, it paints a stark parallel with this week's election result in Canada - in which the Liberal Party won re-election by riding a backlash of anti-Trump sentiment.\n\"What we have seen in Canada has been a dramatic shift back towards the incumbent government and that is a rallying around the flag based on attacks on that country,\" he says. \n\"The attacks on Australia haven't been as severe so it's not the same degree, but at the same time you're also seeing a rallying around the current Labor government. Six months ago you thought their re-election would be unlikely; today on the cusp of the election here in Australia, it seems more likely than not - and one of the important factors in that has been developments in Washington DC. \"\nBut whoever wins, they will have a big job on their hands to navigate Australia's future with its allies.\n\"We have to make do with the hand we've been dealt,\" says Andrews. \"I expect that we are going to have to be much more ruthlessly self-interested and that's not comfortable because our foreign policy has generally been based around cooperation, collaboration and multilateralism \u2013 so that shared sense of threat that middle powers have of working together to maximise their output.\"\nBack at the rodeo, the sun's gone down, the cheerleaders are out and the audience gets ready to watch bucking broncos \u2013 the riders shortly afterwards holding on to their steer for as long as possible before being violently thrown to the ground. \nFlying above the arena are the flags of Canada and the US, alongside Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. There may not be much of a team spirit among allies right now - but voters here will be keen to see how their next leader rides out the storm.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "As Mark Carney settles into the role of Canada's prime minister, he will not only have to take on US President Donald Trump, but also wider divisions within his own country.\nAmong those is a generational divide, with young voters who are concerned about housing unaffordability, crime and the cost of living coalescing around the Conservatives. \nIt's a reversal from 2015, when youth voted in record numbers, helping sweep Carney's predecessor Justin Trudeau to power. \nBut this election, \"baby boomers\" - those over the age of 60 - \"were an essential component to the Liberal success\", pollster David Coletto of Abacus Data told the BBC.\nMeanwhile, younger Canadians, particularly young men, rallied behind the Conservatives.\nOne of them is Connor from Toronto. The 28-year-old told the BBC that he was drawn to the party because of its focus on housing and the cost of living. \n\"We're getting stuck in a system right now that doesn't seem to be working,\" he said. \"It worked for our parents, but not for us.\"\nHe added that he has grown \"tired of the same Liberal policies for the last 10 years\".\nAhead of the election, support for the Conservatives outpaced the Liberals by 44% to 31.2% among 18 to 34 year olds, a Nanos poll on 25 April indicated. \nThe issues that resonated with Canadians depended on age, too. Carney campaigned heavily on standing up to Trump, while affordability and a broken \"Canadian promise\" were central to Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre's message. \nAbacus Data polling indicated about 18% of 18 to 29 year olds were worried about Trump. That jumped to 45% for voters over 60, suggesting a diversion on key issues between generations.\nA big challenge for Carney and the Liberals will be how they can win back the confidence of  those younger voters, Mr Coletto said, who \"feel really let down and frustrated\".\nIn Monday's election, the Liberals managed to gain more than a dozen seats in a historic comeback election. \nBut the rival Conservatives also made significant gains - enough to block the Liberals from forming a decisive majority government.\nThe Liberals won 169 seats, three shy of a majority, and captured 43% of the popular vote. The Conservatives won 144 seats - 25 more than the previous 2021 election - and 41% of the popular vote.\nSmaller parties, namely the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP), suffered significant losses as voters migrated to the two larger parties.\nCarney's platform did feature proposals on how to tackle affordability, including a pledge to build 500,000 homes annually and a small income tax cut for some Canadians.\nLaura Stephenson, chair of the political science department at Western University, noted the two platforms were not too different on cost of living issues.\n\"It is a question of differences in degree, rather than completely different approaches,\" Prof Stephenson said.\nIn his victory speech, Carney preached a message of unity as he acknowledged the millions of Canadians who cast ballots for other parties.\n\"My message to every Canadian is this: no matter where you live, no matter what language you speak, no matter how you voted, I will always do my best to represent everyone who calls Canada home,\" he said.\nCarney will also face a restive western Canada, where there is a festering sense of alienation from the power centre in Ottawa. \nThose tensions were on display quickly after the election. In a post congratulating Carney, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said Poilievre's vision \"inspired millions\", while the Liberals had \"demonized and demeaned\" her oil-rich province.\nShe called on Carney to \"reset the relationship between Ottawa and Alberta with meaningful action rather than hollow rhetoric\".\nWithout a majority, Carney will also have to work with other party leaders to get legislation passed. The Liberals could try to convince members of the NDP - and even the Conservatives - to cross the aisle, which could turn their strong minority to a majority.\nForming an effective government, as well binding regional and demographic fractures in Canada, is now one of the many items on Carney's to-do list. \nAdditional reporting by Jessica Murphy and Ali Abbas Ahmadi in Toronto.",

        "article_text": "From Tina Fey's new relationship comedy to an action drama from the creator of Lost, and the return of Sarah Jessica Parker and co in the third season of the Sex and the City sequel.\nTine Fey stars in and co-created this comedy about three couples, long-time friends with enough disposable income to vacation together four times a year through different seasons. As in the 1981 film it is based on, everyone is rattled when one pair heads for divorce. Fey and Will Forte play one of the couples. Colman Domingo and Marco Calvani are another, a same-sex twist that is the most obvious update from '81. And Steve Carell plays a man who is leaving his wife (Kerri Kenney-Silver) for a younger woman (Erika Henningsen), a timeless part of the plot. Fey has called the show \"a love letter to long-term relationships, both platonic and romantic\", adding, \"I hope audiences feel like they are inside a big sweater with us, and also having a dinner party with us.\" So if you like dinner parties in chunky sweaters, this is the show for you.\nThe Four Seasons premieres 1 May on Netflix internationally\nStar Natasha Lyonne and creator Rian Johnson (Knives Out) have brought their popular homage to the classic Peter Falk series Columbo, and 1970s television in general, back for a second season. Lyonne stars as Charlie Cale, who has an incredible knack for running across murders, scoping out who's telling the truth and who's lying, and solving the case by the end of the episode. Now on the run from a different crime boss than in the first season, Charlie is still on the road, travelling to a different place in every episode, each featuring a slew of guest stars. This time they include Cynthia Erivo, Awkwafina, Giancarlo Esposito, Kumail Nanjiani, John Mulaney, Katie Holmes and about two dozen others, as Charlie stumbles across trouble at a funeral home, a baseball game and an alligator farm. Running through it all are Lyonne's trademark sardonic delivery and the series's fast-paced retro feel.\u00a0\nPoker Face premieres 8 May on Peacock in the US and Sky Max and NOW in the UK\nJudy Blume's 1975 YA novel about first love is reimagined with an update in this series set in Los Angeles in 2018, with a cast largely composed of black actors. High school students Keisha (Lovie Simone), a track star, and Justin (Michael Cooper Jr), a basketball player, are childhood friends who lost touch. When they meet again at a party and fall in love, they face all the intense feelings and decisions that brings. Over the years, Blume's novel has been banned in several US states for the direct way its characters confront the question of when to have their first sexual experience (Blume's honesty is exactly what many fans like about her) and the issue needed a new lens for the 21st Century. But the series' showrunner, Mara Brock Akil, has also leant into the timeless theme of romance, and the Los Angeles setting feeds into it. \"What better metaphor for this love story than what LA represents,\" she has said. \"You're looking for a place to follow your dreams, and love is a part of that.\"\nForever premieres 8 May on Netflix internationally\nRetro television is having a moment with Poker Face and this action drama set in 1972 in the Southwest US. JJ Abrams is an executive producer and, along with LaToya Morgan, wrote the first two episodes of the series, which stars Josh Holloway, still best known as Sawyer from Abrams's Lost, as a swaggering driver for a crime syndicate. Rachel Hilson plays the first black female FBI agent, who chases him down, with Keith David as the syndicate's boss. In addition to the cat-and-mouse crime story and possibly wavering loyalties, Duster has knife fights, cars flipping over and dust all around. Abrams told The Hollywood Reporter that the series came about because \"I had this image of a phone booth in the middle of the desert and a car driving up, and a guy getting on the phone to find out where he was meant to go next\".\u00a0 That turned into a show that he calls \"a crazy story\" with humour, absurdity and lots of plot turns.\nDuster premieres 15 May on Max in the US\nTelevision is full of sci-fi series, but this one has a comic twist and Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, as a robot who manages to hack his own system and go rogue. \"I am a security unit,\" he announces in his cheery voiceover. \"I was built to protect and obey humans. And humans are idiots.\" Chris and Paul Weitz (About a Boy) created the show, based on Martha Wells' series of books, The Murderbot Diaries, and have given it a Blade Runner-meets-Black Mirror style. Although the title robot calls himself Murderbot, he doesn't really want to kill anyone. He prefers sitting around bingeing his favourite show, The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon, a series-within-the-series with John Cho and Jack McBrayer playing the leads. When he lands on a new planet, his social awkwardness creates a very human problem, which makes him, Skarsg\u00e5rd told Empire magazine, \"more relatable than most characters I've ever played\". Of course, he has played Tarzan and a vampire, so relatable is a relative thing.\nMurderbot premieres 16 May on Apple TV+ internationally\nNicole Kidman and her collection of improbable wigs \u2013 see The Undoing or The Perfect Couple \u2013 are now television mainstays. In season two of this series based on a Liane Moriarty novel, she returns as psychedelic-dispensing wellness guru Masha Dmitrichenko, still Russian-accented but now with a pin-straight bob instead of a waist-length mop of waves. She has also relocated her week-long retreat from sunny California to the snowy Austrian Alps, where another crop of troubled, privileged characters turn up \u2013 like The White Lotus but with a cult-like, possibly charlatan therapist. As Kidman told Vanity Fair about Masha, \"She morphs. She adapts.\" New characters are played by another starry cast, including Henry Golding, Christine Baranski, Mark Strong, Lena Olin and Murray Bartlett. Let the wig-games begin. Vulture has even ranked them.\nNine Perfect Strangers premieres 21 May on Hulu in the US and 22 May on Amazon Prime Video in the UK\nJulianne Moore and Meghann Fahy star in this dark comedy about power, class and control, set over one weekend on a wealthy resort island. Moore plays Michaela, a philanthropist and animal activist who is also iron-fisted in her control of island society. Her personal assistant, Simone (Milly Alcock, who played the younger Rhaenyra Targaryen in House of the Dragons), is so in thrall to her that Simone's sister, Devon, (Fahy) comes to the island to stage an intervention. Kevin Bacon plays Michaela's billionaire husband, with Glenn Howerton and Bill Camp among the supporting cast. The series was created by Molly Smith Metzler, who also created the hit Netflix series Maid. She based Sirens on her 2011 play Elemeno Pea, and has said that the show has \"a Greek mythology vibe\", presumably because Michaela sends out such a siren's call to Simone. But details are scarce, so for all we know this siren, as in mythology, could turn out to be half bird. Fully human or not, Moore is always worth watching.\nSirens premieres 22 May on Netflix internationally\nMatthew Goode stars in this crime thriller, the latest show from Scott Frank, the creator of terrific series including The Queen's Gambit and Monsieur Spade. The hero, Carl Morck (Goode), is an abrasive detective in Edinburgh whose partner has been paralyzed on the job, sending him into a tailspin and landing him a low-profile role as head of a new cold-case unit called Department Q. Headquartered in a basement, his unit of misfits is meant to be no more than a publicity move for the police \u2013 but as in Slow Horses, the band of outcasts is smarter than their prized colleagues. Frank based the show on a series of Danish novels and changed the setting to Edinburgh, where it was shot. Meanwhile, Morck has been made into an Englishman, a fish out of water whose ex-wife is Scottish, which accounts for his very bad attitude toward all Scots. The top-flight cast includes Kelly Macdonald and Shirley Henderson.\nDept Q premieres 29 May on Netflix internationally\nAn unlikely family tangle is beneath the plot of this thriller with Jessica Biel and Elizabeth Banks as estranged sisters who have very different lives. Biel plays Chloe, a polished media executive who lives in upscale comfort with her lawyer husband (Corey Stoll) and teenage son. Banks plays Nicky, a recovering addict who is struggling financially. When someone in the family is murdered, the death and their old sibling rivalry converge, as the sisters come together to find the truth of what happened. Lorraine Toussaint, Matthew Modine and Gloria Reuben are also in the cast. Olivia Milch, who co-created the show with Regina Corrado (based on a 2019 novel by Alafair Burke) told Glamour that the question of which sister is better \"changes moment to moment\", which sounds just right for a thriller.\nThe Better Sister premieres 29 May on Prime Video internationally\nAs she ambles into her next chapter in life, nearly 30 years after Sex and the City premiered, Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) still has great shoes, as seen in the trailer for the third season of this sequel series. The new season puts her where the last one ended, in a new apartment and trying a long-distance relationship with Aiden (John Corbett). But Carrie is now writing a novel, instead of the personal column she used to write. As always, Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) have their own issues. Sarita Choudhury and Nicole Ari Parker return as recently-acquired core friends Seema and Lisa, while Rosie O'Donnell and Patti LuPone appear as brand new characters. The show has inspired long-loyal, opinionated fans, who will want to know whether or not two old favourites are missing: Che Diaz (Sarah Ramirez), Miranda's former partner who was a love-them or hate-them character, and Kim Cattrall, whose phoned-in cameo as Samantha last season \u2013 really, she was shown in a car on the phone for a minute \u2013 was a fizzle.\nAnd Just Like That\u2026 premieres 29 May on Max in the US and Sky Max and NOW in the UK\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

We have had a poor season, especially in the league. We've been very good in Europe, but the league season has been unacceptable.\n\"He's my manager, he's my gaffer and I respect him an awful amount.

Maybe once or twice if you are lucky.\n\"We need to use that. We are in the final four in a massive competition in Europe and use that to have a great tie on Thursday and in Bodo as well.\n\"We've got a real special opportunity. There's obviously been a lot of talk about form and being a poor season, but we have the opportunity to do something very special. \n\"We've earned it and we deserve to be here.

It doesn't matter where you come from. I come from the other side of the world where football is the fourth sport, so I don't underestimate anyone.\n\"You say they are a small club and we are big club, it doesn't matter. We are two clubs in the semi-final of a European competition and they have earned the right to be there.\n\"They have done very well to get there and we are going to treat them with the respect they deserve. At the same time, make sure we go in there and give it our best performance.\"\nThe 59-year-old also says Tottenham's success in Europe is being \"diminished\" by some people amid the backdrop of their league form.\nHe added: \"I am really strong at the moment on the parallel worlds we are trying to traverse and I have sensed, which is not surprising because this is the way this club is perceived, people are almost trying to diminish it in some respects.\n\"I have seen some people saying it is the equivalent of Manchester United winning the FA Cup, no. Not on any planet is it equivalent. That is suggesting that maybe we are not worthy of Champions League.\n\"Things are there that are designed to diminish what is ahead of us, which is an unbelievable opportunity. Irrespective of how this season has gone, we have generations of fans who want this more than anything else - to share this with the people that they love, a special moment supporting their football club.\n\"We could be flying in the league, but it wouldn't make this opportunity any different. The opportunity is the same and I have made that clear to the players.\"",

We've been very good in Europe, but the league season has been unacceptable. \"Spurs will be without captain Son Heung-min, who is unavailable with a foot injury, against Bodo/Glimt but Maddison says the club are going to \"relish the challenge\" of reaching a first European final since they were beaten by Liverpool in the 2019 Champions League showpiece. \"The 59-year-old also says Tottenham's success in Europe is being \"diminished\" by some people amid the backdrop of their league form.He added: \"I am really strong at the moment on the parallel worlds we are trying to traverse and I have sensed, which is not surprising because this is the way this club is perceived, people are almost trying to diminish it in some respects.",

It's likely we'll know how many seats each party has won in the coming hours. \nFederal election officials are required to count ballots by hand in front of witnesses. Ballots are tallied only after polls close in each location where the votes were cast. \nThese projections are based on initial results from Elections Canada, which runs the country's federal elections.\nOfficials double-check vote totals after the election. \nLiberal leader Mark Carney does not need to be sworn in again. Instead, he will continue doing his job, as do his Cabinet ministers.\nShould Carney decide to reshuffle his Cabinet, there will be a ceremony with the governor general, but until then, the ministers stay in their posts. \nCarney may indeed choose to shuffle his Cabinet after bringing in a leaner team when he became prime minister last month.\nWhen Parliament opens after an election, expect the swearing-in of members and the election of the Speaker. \nOne of his priorities is to navigate the relationship with US President Donald Trump.\nWhen the pair spoke in late March, Carney and Trump agreed they would begin  negotiations about a new economic and security relationship right after the election.\nWhen Parliament returns, it's possible we see the Liberals quickly introduce legislation focused on securing Canada's economy in the face of US tariff headwinds.\nThat could include a promised tax cut for middle-class Canadians, and moving ahead with a \"one project, one review\" process to speed up approval for key energy and mining proposals. \nThe Liberals have said they want to make Canada a \"clean and conventional energy\" superpower. \nThey have also committed to putting C$5bn into a trade diversification fund. \nThe Liberals may fall short of the 172 required for a majority in the House of Commons. \nThe most likely scenario if this happens is that they form a minority government with Carney as prime minister, where they strike deals with the other parties to survive no-confidence votes and pass legislation in Parliament.\nThe Conservatives are on track to once again form the Official Opposition. \nConservative leader Pierre Poilievre is on track to make significant inroads with the party's vote share, securing roughly 41% of the vote, according to Election Canada.\nThat would be the highest the party has in decades. \nThey are currently projected to have won 144 seats - that's up from 120 at dissolution, when the election was called.\nBut there are some bitter pills to swallow - Poilievre himself is projected to have lost his seat in Ontario.\nAnd with voters switching from NDP to the Liberals, those expanded Conservative numbers weren't enough to win. \nThis will be a tough loss for them, being in such a strong position only a few months ago when they had a clear path to victory.\nThey will now need to figure out a way forward after a series of electoral defeats.\nAnd it is hard to see Poilievre staying on at the helm, which would mean a fourth leader since the Liberals swept the 2015 election.",

        "article_text": "When Alberto Salagan was deported from the US in January it was the first time he'd stepped foot in Mexico since he was a baby.\nBorn in the coastal resort of Acapulco, his parents took him to the US when he was just six months old.\nGrowing up in California, he was seduced by the false glamour of gang life.\nAfter his arrest in San Diego for gang activity, Alberto was sent back to Mexico just as President Trump was taking office, and found himself homeless and alone in the country of his birth.\n\"It was a shock. It still is,\" he admits. \"When I got here to Mexico, I really felt lost. No family, no food, no clothes, no nothing.\"\n\nAlberto says he'd almost forgotten how to speak and read Spanish. \"Good thing I didn't lose it completely because it's helped me [to be bilingual],\" he reflects.\nIn fact, his language skills saved the 30-year-old from becoming destitute. Through a deportee support organisation, he heard that a local company \u2013 EZ Call Center \u2013 was looking for English-speakers.\nThe work, as telephone sales agents, isn't well paid, but employees can earn commissions, and the regular pay cheque gave Alberto the stability he craved.\n\"I had to do something to get back on my feet. Thanks to the call centre, now I have,\" he tells me during a break between calls.\nAlmost every agent at EZ Call Center is a deportee, including the company's owner, Daniel Ruiz.\nHe was also born in Mexico and grew up in the US before being deported for low-level drug crime in his early 20s. Daniel says he can relate to his employees' initial sense of disorientation in Mexico.\n\"We are all dealing with culture shock,\" he says over a steady hum of telephone calls.\n\"We all have our life over there, went to school over there, were brought up on American culture, have family over there. We're from here but we're from over there too.\"\nIn their booths, the agents work through long lists of US phone numbers, some making promotional calls or sales, others calling about debt collection and refinancing.\nAll the agents speak fluent English, and the clients at the other end of the line are none the wiser that they're talking to people in Mexico rather than the US.\nDaniel says that agents like Alberto \u2013 who fell into gangs and crime at a vulnerable age in the US, but are willing to turn over a new leaf in Mexico \u2013 are among his most trusted employees.\n\"They almost never have another mark on their criminal record, and they possess the right discipline to hold down their jobs,\" he explains.\nDaniel Ruiz's own experiences after deportation have informed his business decisions.\nAs well as the telesales company, he also co-founded a humanitarian organisation \u2013 called the Borderline Crisis Center \u2013 which provides deportees with food, shelter and support on their arrival back in Mexico.\nAfter his inauguration, President Trump said he would carry out what he calls \"the largest deportation in American history\".\nHe has spoken of the removal of millions of undocumented people from US soil, and in the early days of his presidency Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents made workplace raids from Chicago to California.\nMexican humanitarian organisations, including the Borderline Crisis Center, braced themselves for a huge influx of returnees.\nSo far, though, one hasn't materialised. There are no major bottlenecks of migrants at the border, and the migrant shelters in Tijuana are not currently overflowing. \nThe latest figures from the Mexican government actually show that the number of deportations from the US to Mexico were lower during the first three months of Trump's second administration than they were for the same period last year. \nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that Mexico received almost 39,000 deportees in February to April, of which 33,000 were Mexican. This compares with 52,000 for the same three months in 2024.\nHowever, the fall was in part due to a reduction in the number of people trying to get into the US in the first place. Migrant \"encounters\" on the US southern border by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents has dropped to their lowest level in years.\nThe threat of mass deportation combined with other factors \u2013 from military deployments at the border, to the high-profile deportations of migrants to El Salvador \u2013 may have acted as an effective deterrent.\nThe Trump Administration is also pushing the idea of self-deportation hard to undocumented immigrants through blunt warnings.\nStill, there are people being sent back to Tijuana on a near daily basis. Many face hostility as they try to resettle in the dusty and dangerous border city.\nThe few companies which offer deportees gainful employment have become even more important to avoid a slide into criminality.\nBeyond a smaller venture like EZ Call Center, a larger company called the American Survey Company or ASC also relies on a deportee workforce. \nWith its sister company, Voxcentrix, ASC has some 550 call centre stations in Tijuana, where agents make calls on everything from election polling to customer satisfaction surveys.\n\"What happened in the US stays in the US,\" laughs Nora Diaz, ASC's chief happiness officer. \"We don't really do background checks on that.\"\nNora says her job is focussed on the employees' wellbeing, to help them reintegrate.\n\"We understand everyone has a past, and we don't judge based on that. We don't ask about it during our interview process. We just need people who speak good English and good Spanish and are willing to commit to a job,\" she explains.\nThe \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy at ASC was invaluable to Luis Luna's new start.\nHe grew up in Orange Country in California having been taken to the US when he was just a few months old.\n\"Unfortunately, as a kid, I made some bad choices: joined a gang, ran around with the wrong crowd. Cost me a lot, cost me a life sentence. I was a lifer in California state prison,\" Luis explains.\nWhile in prison in California, he enrolled for every educational programme available and worked hard on his rehabilitation. On release, he was also sent back to Mexico in January, just as Trump was gearing up for his inaugural speech.\nNow 50-years-old and covered in gang-related tattoos, Luis knew he wouldn't get many more second chances in life.\n\"I got no family over here. My family is ASC, the people I met in my employment, they're my family and my friends.\"\nFor Luis, the outwardly dull telephony work has provided the anchor he needs to stay out of crime, something he says ex-gang members he knows in the US struggle with.\n\"From the first day I didn't feel any judgement at all. I felt they just opened their arms and took me in. I think I'd be in the streets right now if it wasn't for ASC,\" he adds.\nWhile the Trump Administration's mass deportation programme isn't yet at a level many in Mexico expected, some believe it could pick up pace over the coming months.\nIf so, deportees with gang pasts like Alberto and Luis will need some help to start again, irrespective of their crimes.\nIn Tijuana, many of them will find it at the end of a telephone line.",

        "article_text": "Listen to Laura read this article\n\nIf you say the name Donald Trump in the halls of wholesale markets and trade fairs in China, you'll hear a faint chuckle.\nThe US president and his 145% tariffs have not instilled fear in many Chinese traders.\nInstead, they have inspired an army of online Chinese nationalists to create mocking memes in a series of viral videos and reels \u2013 some of which include an AI-generated President Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and tech mogul Elon Musk toiling on footwear and iPhone assembly lines.\nChina is not behaving like a nation facing the prospect of economic pain and President Xi Jinping has made it clear that Beijing will not back down.\n\"For more than 70 years, China has always relied on self-reliance and hard work for development\u2026 it has never relied on anyone's gifts and is unafraid of any unreasonable suppression,\" he said this month.\nHis confidence may come in part because China is far less dependent than it was 10 years ago on exports to the US. But the truth is Trump's brinkmanship and tariff hikes are pushing on pressure points that already exist within China's own struggling economy. With a housing crisis, increasing job insecurity and an ageing population, Chinese people are simply not spending as much as their government would like.\nXi came to power in 2012 with a dream of a rejuvenated China. That is now being severely tested \u2013 and not just by US tariffs. Now, the question is whether or not Trump's tariffs will dampen Xi's economic dreams, or can he turn the obstacles that exist into opportunities?\nWith a population of 1.4 billion, China has, in theory, a huge domestic market. But there's a problem. They don't appear willing to spend money while the country's economic outlook is uncertain.\nThis has not been prompted by the trade war \u2013 but by the collapse of the housing market. Many Chinese families invested their life savings in their homes, only to watch prices plummet in the last five years.\nHousing developers continued to build even as the property market crumbled. It's thought that China's entire population would not fill all the empty apartments across the country.\nThe former deputy head of China's statistics bureau, He Keng, admitted two years ago that the most \"extreme estimate\" is that there are now enough vacant homes for 3 billion people.\nTravel round Chinese provinces and you see they are littered with empty projects \u2013 lines of towering concrete shells that have been labelled \"ghost cities\". Others have been fitted out, the gardens have been landscaped, curtains frame the windows, and they appear filled with the promise of a new home. But only at night, when you see no lights, can you tell that the apartments are empty. There just aren't enough buyers to match this level of construction.\nThe government acted five years ago to restrict the amount of money developers could borrow. But the damage to house prices and, in turn, consumer confidence in China, has been done and analysts have projected a 2.5% decline in home prices this year, according to a Reuters poll in February.\nAnd it's not just house prices that worry middle-class Chinese families.\nThey are concerned about whether the government can offer them a pension \u2013 over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. According to a 2019 estimate by the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government pension fund could run out of money by 2035.\nThere are also fears about whether their sons, daughters and grandchildren can get a job as millions of college graduates are struggling to find work. More than one in five people between the ages of 16 and 24 in urban areas are jobless in China, according to official data published in August 2023. The government has not released youth unemployment figures since then.\nThe problem is that China cannot simply flip a switch and move from selling goods to the US to selling them to local buyers.\n\"Given the downward pressure on the economy, it is unlikely domestic spending can be significantly expanded in the short term,\" says Prof Nie Huihua at Renmin University.\n\"Replacing exports with internal demand will take time.\"\nAccording to Prof Zhao Minghao, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, \"China does not have high expectations for talks with the Trump administration\u2026 The real battleground is in the adjustment of China's domestic policies, such as boosting domestic demand.\"\nTo revive a slowing economy, the government has announced billions in childcare subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave. It has also introduced a $41bn programme offering discounts on items such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) to encourage more people to spend. But Prof Zhang Jun, the Dean of Economics at Fudan University, believes this is not \"sustainable\".\n\"We need a long-term mechanism,\" he says. \"We need to start increasing residents' disposable income.\"\nThis is urgent for Xi. The dream of prosperity he sold when he took power 13 years ago has not become reality.\nXi is also aware that China has a disheartened younger generation worried about their future. That could spell bigger trouble for the Communist Party: protests or unrest.\nA report by Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor claims that protests driven by financial grievances saw a steep increase in the last few months.\nAll protests are quickly subdued and censored on social media, so it is unlikely to pose a real threat to Xi for now.\n\"Only when the country does well and the nation does well can every person do well,\" Xi said in 2012.\nThis promise was made when China's economic rise looked unstoppable. It now looks uncertain.\nWhere the country has made huge strides over the past decade is in areas such as consumer electronics, batteries, EVs and artificial intelligence as part of a pivot to advanced manufacturing.\nIt has rivalled US tech dominance with the chatbot DeepSeek and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest EV maker.\nYet Trump's tariffs threaten to throw a spanner in the works.\nThe restrictions on the sale of key chips to China, including the most recent move tightening exports from US chip giant Nvidia, for instance, are aimed at curbing Xi's ambitions for tech supremacy.\nDespite that, Xi knows that Chinese manufacturers are at a decades-long advantage, so that US manufacturers are struggling to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.\nPresident Xi is also trying to use this crisis as a catalyst for further change and to find more new markets for China.\n\"In the short term, some Chinese exporters will be greatly impacted,\" says Prof Zhang. \"But Chinese companies will take the initiative to adjust the destination of exports to overcome difficulties. Exporters are waiting and looking for new customers.\"\nDonald Trump's first term in office was China's cue to look elsewhere for buyers. It has expanded its ties across South East Asia, Latin America and Africa \u2013 and a Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative shored up ties with the so-called Global South.\nChina is reaping the rewards from that diversification. More than 145 countries do more trade with China than they do with the US, according to the Lowy Institute.\nIn 2001, only 30 countries chose Beijing as their lead trade partner over Washington.\nAs Trump targets both friend and foe, some believe Xi can further upend the current US-led world order and portray his country as a stable, alternative global trade partner and leader.\nThe Chinese leader chose South East Asia for his first trip abroad after the tariff announcement, sensing his neighbours would be getting jittery about Trump's tariffs.\nAround a quarter of Chinese exports are now manufactured or shipped through a second country including Vietnam and Cambodia.\nRecent US actions may also present a chance for Xi to positively shape China's role in the world.\n\"Trump's coercive tariff policy is an opportunity for Chinese diplomacy,\" says Prof Zhang.\nChina will have to tread carefully. Some countries will be nervous that products being manufactured for the US could end up flooding into their markets.\nTrump's tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers.\nAccording to Prof Huihua, \"about 20% of China's exports go to the US - if these exports were to flood any regional market or country, it could lead to dumping and vicious competition, thereby triggering new trade frictions\".\nThere are barriers to Xi presenting himself as the arbiter of free trade in the world.\nChina has subjected other nations to trade restrictions in recent years.\nIn 2020, after the Australian government called for a global inquiry into the origins and early handling of the Covid pandemic, which Beijing argued was a political manoeuvre against them, China placed tariffs on Australian wine and barley and imposed biosecurity measures on some beef and timber and bans on coal, cotton and lobster.

        "article_text": "The estranged husband of a woman who served a poisonous mushroom lunch to her family says it was \"very rare\" for her to hold social gatherings at home.\nSimon Patterson was invited to the fatal meal prepared by Erin Patterson - but decided not to attend the day before.\nMr Patterson is the first witness in the trial of Ms Patterson - who is charged with the murder of three relatives and the attempted murder of another, with the case centring on a beef wellington lunch at her house in July 2023.\nMs Patterson, 50,  has pleaded not guilty and her defence team says she \"panicked\" after unintentionally serving poison to family members she loved.\nThree people died in hospital in the days after the meal, including Ms Patterson's former in-laws, Don Patterson, 70, and Gail Patterson, 70, as well as Gail's sister, Heather Wilkinson, 66. Local pastor Ian Wilkinson survived after weeks of treatment in hospital.\nThe jury has been shown text messages exchanged between Simon and Erin Patterson the day before the deadly mushroom lunch.\nMr Patterson said in court Thursday he felt \"too uncomfortable\" about attending the lunch.\nErin Patterson responded: \"That's really disappointing. I've spent many hours this week preparing lunch for tomorrow... It's important to me that you're all there tomorrow and that I can have the conversations that I need to have.\"\nThe prosecution alleges Ms Patterson invited the group to lunch \"on the pretence she'd been diagnosed with cancer\".\nThe court in Morwell, regional Victoria, heard that between the couple's marriage in 2007 and separation in 2015, there were a number of periods of separation and reconciliation - including Erin Patterson leaving her husband and their baby son in the middle of a road trip across Australia in 2009.\nMr Patterson had to drive from Townsville to Perth - a distance of about 5,000 km (3,100 miles) - alone with the child, he told the court.\nThe couple met in 2002, while both working at Monash City Council, where Mr Patterson was a civil engineer.\nAsked about his wife, Mr Patterson said: \"Erin is very intelligent.\n\"Some of the things that attracted me to her in the first place is definitely her intelligence. She's quite witty and can be quite funny.\"\nAsked about how his wife got on with his parents, Don and Gail Patterson, Mr Patterson said: \"She especially got on with dad. They shared a love of knowledge and learning in the world.\"\nWith his voice faltering, Mr Patterson added: \"I think she loved his gentle nature.\"\nHe said Ms Patterson held a university degree in business and accounting, and was also qualified as an air traffic controller having worked at Melbourne's Tullemarine airport.\nMr Patterson is due in court again on Friday to take more questions from prosecutors.\nMr Patterson painted a picture of a relationship peppered with periods of separation - the first within the first two years of marriage - at one point becoming emotional and asking for tissues.\nAfter the final separation there was a lot of communication by text message he said, including \"banter\" and talk about politics, he said.\nBut there was a change in the relationship in 2022 when Ms Patterson was \"upset\" when her husband listed himself as separated on his tax return.\nThe \"chatty nature\" of their relationship \"pretty much stopped\" after this, Mr Patterson said - with communication now only about the \"practical management\" of their family life.\nWearing a navy suit, white shirt and purple tie, he told the court that Ms Patterson received a \"substantial inheritance\" from her grandmother which Mr Patterson estimated at A$2m ($1.3m; \u00a3964,000) - though it was not paid in a lump sum and was \"dribbled out\" by the executors of the estate.\nThe jury has heard that there is no dispute that the lunch of beef wellington, mashed potatoes and green beans contained death cap mushrooms and caused the guests' illnesses.\nWhether Ms Patterson intended to kill or cause very serious injury is the main issue in the case, the judge has told the jury.\n\nThe court heard the couple had married in 2007 and had two children together - though separated permanently in 2015 .\nThey had remained \"amicable\" including sharing family holidays, though there was a falling out over child support payments in 2022, the jury was told.\nDuring the prosecution's opening statement on Wednesday, lead barrister Nanette Rogers said the jury would hear evidence that Ms Patterson had travelled to a location, near her home in Leongatha, where death cap mushroom sightings had been logged on a naturalist website.\nAnd in the days after the lunch, she took a number of steps to \"conceal\" what she had done, the prosecution alleged.\nThere'd be evidence that she lied to investigators about the source of the mushrooms in the dish - saying some had come from an Asian grocery in Melbourne and she had never foraged wild ones. And she made a trip to a local dump to dispose of a food dehydrator prosecutors say she used to prepare the toxic meal.\nMs Patterson's barrister has said she did not deliberately serve poisoned food to her guests.\n\"The defence case is that she panicked because she was overwhelmed by the fact that these four people had become so ill because of the food she had served them.\"\nThe court heard how Mr Patterson spoke to his father the morning after the lunch and discovered both his parents had been up since midnight with vomiting and diahorrea and that they had called an ambulance.\nAnd after trying to call his aunt and uncle, Heather and Ian Wilkinson, he went to their home when they did not answer.\n\"Ian answered the door. He looked grey and spooked,\" Mr Patterson recalled. \"Yeah, he was struggling.\n\"I said 'How are you?' He said 'Not good'.\"\nMr Patterson then saw Heather Wilkinson sitting on the couch, he told the court.\n\"She looked pretty crook. She had a container as a spew bucket, \" he said.\nAfter Mr Wilkinson left the room, Heather spoke to him, he confirmed, under questioning from prosecutor Dr Rogers.\n\"We didn't have much conversation, but she was puzzled and she said 'I noticed Erin served herself her food on a coloured plate which was different to the rest'.\"\n\"I acknowledged I'd heard her, but did not progress it as a conversation,\" he added.\nBecause he had been told an ambulance would have taken an hour to arrive, Mr Patterson drove the couple to hospital in the Wilkinsons' car when Heather Wilkinson raised the subject once more.\n\"She mentioned the coloured plate again, She asked me 'Is Erin short of crockery? Is that why she would have this different coloured plate that she served herself with?\" Mr Patterson said.\n\"I can't remember the exact phrase but it was something like that.\nAnd what did you reply, the prosecutor asked?\n\"I said yes, Erin doesn't have that many plates and that may be the reason.\"\nMr Patterson became emotional again, describing going to see his parents at Korumburra hospital where they were in the same room but separate beds.\n\"Dad was substantially worse than mum. He was really struggling,\" he said fighting back tears..\n\"He was lying on his side. He was hunched quite noticeably, with a really discoloured face, struggling to speak.\n\"Speaking was an effort, taking the energy to speak was an effort and his voice was strained in a way that he wasn't right inside. He was in pain.\"\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. Sign up here.",

But he was injured in the next game against Brighton\nThe Everton forward has spoken about how relentless injury issues impacted his mental health - and at the end of the 2021-22 season said that talking 'saved his life'.\nHe says that past setbacks have built \"wisdom and character\", and that recently becoming a father has changed his perspective.\n\"I have had my moments with injuries and tough experiences with that. I'm older, I'm more mature, I'm a dad now and that has grounded me in ways I never knew possible,\" Calvert-Lewin says.\nThe striker is also known for his interest in fashion and has appeared on magazine covers and taken part in photoshoots for GQ Magazine - although the new father reveals that those days could be behind him.\n\"I'm a family man now and I have a young daughter, so my life has changed a lot.\" Calvert-Lewin says. \"It's given me different perspectives.\n\"My focus is on being the best player I can possibly be and be the best dad I can possibly be.\n\"I think on the fashion side of things, it's like anything, you grow and evolve, and it was appealing to me back then to showcase that.\n\"Everyone has hobbies and other interests besides things they do on a day-to-day basis.\n\"I also don't have time to think about what to put on in the morning when my daughter needs to get ready!\"\nEverton supporters will be keen to know if the striker is going to be a part of their squad for next season.\nCalvert-Lewin is one of a few players at Everton whose future is under discussion and BBC Sport has reported an offer is on the table. When asked about his situation, he says in his mind things are simple.\n\"I'm an Everton player and my focus will always be on doing my best for Everton and I have a lot of respect for Everton football club,\" he says.\n\"It's given me everything I have today.\n\"My main focus is making sure I am in the best condition, it is like going through a mini pre-season to get fit for these last four games.\n\"With the new manager coming in the club is moving in the right direction, there's a new stadium and there's a lot to be positive about.\n\"Who wouldn't want to be part of that?\n\"There was a lot of uncertainty for a long time a little bit higher up and arguably the last three seasons have been the most difficult in Everton's Premier League history and I have been there leading the line through that.\n\"For me it's built a lot of experience, and I have a lot of fond memories.

It looks like Fifa career mode.\"\nAnother claimed: \"I think this may be the most commonly agreed worst tifo of all time given the circumstances.\"\nWhile a third said: \"Arsenal turned down the fans' tifo design request to produce this monstrosity. Champions League semi-final and this was the best they could come up with? So disappointed.\"\nAccording to former England striker Wayne Rooney, working as a TV pundit, the atmosphere at the Emirates on Tuesday was in contrast to the Real Madrid game.\nBefore that match, supporters in each block of the stadium held up red and white cards above their heads.\n\"For Arsenal, I was a bit disappointed with how they played, disappointed with the fans as well,\" Rooney told Amazon Prime.\n\"I thought tonight they were a bit subdued, almost like an anti-climax that they beat Real Madrid and were going to walk into the final and win the competition.\"\nThis video can not be played\nArteta reacts to defeat against PSG in Champions League semi-final\nWhy Arsenal can still reach Champions League final\nArsenal fan writer Laura Kirk: \"One of the fan groups Ashburton Army had raised some money for a tifo which was ultimately rejected by the club, I imagine because the designs were not in keeping with the club's brand but the club haven't actually said anything. \n\"In comparison with what we see elsewhere in Europe, like the one Real Madrid had against us last week, it just felt like a massively missed opportunity to do something amazing.\"\nOli Price-Bates from The Fresh Arsenal Podcast: \"The tifo from the club was certainly a bit underwhelming. The occasion deserved more from the club to help with the atmosphere and fan engagement. \n\"Certainly if Arsenal get to this stage again, they need to be better prepared and involve the fans in the process, not just in tifos but the wider experience and build-up for the match. \n\"Hopefully we won't wait so long for another semi-final and the club will be better prepared to make more impact.\"\nBroadcaster and Arsenal fan Harry Symeou: \"I think the fans were hoping to see something with a bit more of a wow factor. Given there was lots of talk online with regards to some more elaborate, striking designs - you can understand why some felt underwhelmed.\n\"Tifos on the continent tend to be more creative and really can set the scene ahead of a huge occasion. Fan groups, in particular those known as 'ultras' normally have a big input - leading to a higher rate of fan satisfaction. But this is something we don't do well enough in English football generally.

        "article_text": "Sir Tony Blair has called for a major rethink of net zero policies, arguing that limiting energy consumption and fossil fuel production is \"doomed to fail\".\nIn a new report, the former Labour prime minister says voters \"feel they're being asked to make financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle when they know the impact on global emissions is minimal\".\nHe does not call for Labour to halt its push to decarbonise the UK economy - but says all governments need to rethink their approach, as it is not working.\nThe Tories - who have joined Reform UK in opposing net zero emissions by 2050 - urged Labour to end the \"mad dash\" to this goal - but Downing Street said it would not be changing course.\nIn its report The Climate Paradox: Why We Need to Reset Action on Climate Change, the Tony Blair Institute argues that global institutions such as COP and the UN have failed to make sufficient progress in halting climate change.\nAt the same time, it argues, the public have lost faith in climate policies because the promised green jobs and economic growth have failed to materialise, thanks in part to global instability and the Covid pandemic.\nWriting in the foreword, Sir Tony says: \"Though most people will accept that climate change is a reality caused by human activity, they're turning away from the politics of the issue because they believe the proposed solutions are not founded on good policy.\"\nHe says \"any strategy based on either 'phasing out' fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail\".\nHe also warns against the \"alarmist\" tone of the debate on climate change, which he  says is \"riven with irrationality\".\nThe report calls for the rapid deployment of carbon capture and storage technology, greater use of AI to make energy grids efficient and investment in small scale nuclear reactors.\nIt also argues for a greater focus on climate change adaptation measures such as flood defences and a new international push to persuade China and India to cut emissions. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight, the author of the report dismissed claims that the foundation was rejecting net zero targets, saying it \"is a paper that is about increased climate ambition\".\nLindy Fursman, director of climate and energy policy at the Tony Blair Institute, said:  \"We are certainly not rejecting net zero targets. The paper is really clear that we need to keep these because of the certainty they provide for businesses.\"\nMs Fursman said the report was \"pointing out that while many economies are doing well, we need to do more, particularly in the global picture because global emissions continue to rise\".\nDowning Street said it would not be changing course on net zero - and rejected Sir Tony's suggestions that the public was no longer prepared to make sacrifices to meet green goals.\n\"We will reach net zero in a way that treads lightly on people's lives, not telling them how to live or behave,\" said the prime minister's official spokesman.\n\"Net zero is the economic opportunity of the 21st century, one that has the potential to reignite our industrial heartlands, create good jobs for the future and lower bills in the long term.\"\nThe government claims its net zero strategy is already delivering results, with \u00a343bn of private investment since last July and that its climate policies \"now support around 600,000 jobs across the UK\".\nLabour sources are also pushing back against claims Sir Keir Starmer is going cold on the net zero agenda, pointing to a speech he made last week in which he said the clean energy mission was \"in the DNA of my government\".\nReacting in the Commons to Sir Tony's comments in the report, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said he agreed \"with a lot of what it says\" particularly on carbon capture and storage and AI \"which the government are doing\".\nBut Labour's opponents were quick to seize on the former prime minister's words.\nWriting on social media, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: \"Even Tony Blair now says the push for Net Zero has become 'irrational' and 'hysterical'. We are winning the argument!\"\nConservative acting shadow energy secretary, Andrew Bowie said the government needed to \"urgently  change course\".\n\"It seems even Tony Blair has come to the realisation that Keir Starmer and the Labour Party's mad dash to net zero by 2050 is simply not feasible, or sustainable,\" he added.\nGreen Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said: \"Blair is wrong, both morally and pragmatically. The British public understands the need for decisive climate action and expects politicians to lead in delivering this action.\"\nSir Tony's intervention has also been met with dismay by Labour-supporting environmental groups. \nOne campaigner told the BBC: \"This is an oddly public and oddly-timed intervention that would usually be made by someone struggling for access. \n\"The Labour government are getting on with many of the policies outlined in the report because they know this is popular with people, especially the voting coalition they need to maintain for the next election. \n\"But adopting the anti-net-zero framing of [Tory leader Kemi] Badenoch and Reform is out of step with where the public are on this issue and will not help Labour.\"\nA Liberal Democrats spokesperson said: \"There is no doubt that the last Conservative government set us back by failing to invest in cheap, clean energy and home insulation. \n\"But that makes it all the more important that we act with urgency now, to bring down energy bills and emissions, free ourselves from reliance on Putin's gas, and restore the UK's role as a world-leader in the clean technology of the future and the jobs that go with it.\"\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has taken action to ease the impact of new tariffs on the car making industry, which had sparked warnings about higher prices and the potential for significant hits to sales and production. \nThe change will allow companies with US factories to reduce the amount they pay in import taxes on foreign parts, using a formula tied to how many cars they sell and the price.\nThe provision is intended to provide relief to businesses for two years as they rework their supply chains, the White House said.\nOfficials also moved to shield car firms from facing mounting tariffs on the same items.\nThey said businesses that have to pay tariffs on cars and parts would not be charged other duties the administration has imposed on steel, aluminium and goods from Canada and Mexico.\nThe changes came as Trump visited Michigan on Tuesday for a rally to mark his first 100 days in office.\nThe state is home to the so-called Detroit Three carmakers - Ford, General Motors (GM) and Stellantis - and a network of more than 1,000 major suppliers to the industry.\nThose firms and the wider industry have been plunged into uncertainty since Trump announced new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts in March, saying he wanted to expand domestic car manufacturing - an industry the White House sees as key to national security. \nTrump's tariff announcement drove a spike in sales, as consumers rushed to get ahead of the tariffs. But it has also left businesses scrambling to respond. \nAhead of the latest announcement, General Motors and other carmakers said they welcomed the plans to soften the impact of the measures. \n\"We're grateful to President Trump for his support of the US automotive industry and the millions of Americans who depend on us,\" GM chief executive Mary Barra said in an emailed statement.\n\"We appreciate the productive conversations with the President and his Administration and look forward to continuing to work together.\"\nGeneral Motors, which reported its quarterly performance to investors on Tuesday, also said on Tuesday that it needed to rework its forecast for the year and pulled its prior guidance. \nIn an unusual move, it also postponed the call with analysts that had been set to discuss the results. \nTariffs on foreign-made cars - which accounted for nearly half of US sales last year - went into effect last month.\nThe duties on parts were expected to come into force on 3 May. \nUnder the modified plan, carmakers will be able to claim an \"offset\" for what they pay in tariffs on car parts, worth up to 3.75% of the suggested retail price of all the cars they assemble in the US. \nThat share would fall to 2.5% in the second year.\nThe White House said the rules were designed so that a car with 85% of its parts made in the US - or in Canada or Mexico under the terms of an existing free trade deal - would not face any tariffs, a threshold that rises to 90% in the second year. \nThe adjustment is a recognition of the global nature of the industry's current supply networks, where even cars that promote themselves as American-made often source a significant share of their parts from abroad.\nIn remarks to reporters ahead of the signing, Trump downplayed the easing, saying they applied to a \"very, very small part of the car\" and while noting he did not want to penalise companies with factories in the US.\n\"We just wanted to help them during this little transition, short-term,\" he said.  \nLast week, a coalition of US motor industry groups called on the president to not impose the measures on parts. \nA letter to his administration from groups representing companies including GM, Toyota and Volkswagen said the levies would \"lead to higher auto prices for consumers, lower sales at dealerships and will make servicing and repairing vehicles both more expensive\".\nFord said it appreciated Trump's decision, which it said would \"help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers\".\n\"We will continue to work closely with the administration in support of the president's vision for a healthy and growing auto industry in America,\" a statement added.\nThe car maker said policies that encouraged exports and ensured affordable supply chains to promote more domestic growth were \"essential\".\n\"It will be important for the major vehicle importers to match Ford's commitment to building in America,\" the company said, adding that if they did, the US would see a \"windfall of new assembly and supplier factories and hundreds of thousands of new jobs\".\nStellantis chairman John Elkann echoed the sentiments of his rival carmakers in response to the tariff reliefs. \n\"We look forward to our continued collaboration with the US administration to strengthen a competitive American auto industry and stimulate exports,\" he added.",

By doubling the rate of building, Carney hopes to have a supply of 500,000 new homes a year.\nThe Liberals want to create a standalone federal entity that would act as a developer for affordable housing. They plan to use this body to supply tens of billions of Canadian dollars in debt-financing for prefabricated home builders.\nLike people in other countries, Canadians have been grappling with higher prices for everyday goods while wages have failed to keep up - an issue over which Carney's party was criticised while under the stewardship of his predecessor Justin Trudeau. \nThe Liberals have proposed a slight tax cut for those in the lowest  bracket, who are due to see their rate reduce from 15% to 14%.\nCarney's party has also vowed to scrap sales taxes on homes under C$1m ($720,000; \u00a3540,000) for first-time buyers.\nIt also wants to make dental care available to lower-income Canadians by extending a national insurance programme to 4.5 million people aged 18 to 64. The plan currently covers children, the elderly and some disabled Canadians.\nThe Liberals have vowed to maintain the push on reducing emissions - as part of the fight against climate change - while ensuring Canadian companies are still competitive.\nCarney has promised to build a national \"east to west\" electricity grid to reduce energy dependence on the US.\nOne of his first moves as PM, before the election, was to repeal Trudeau's unpopular carbon pricing programme, which was designed to give financial incentives for people and firms to turn away from fossil fuels.\nBut Carney maintained a similar tax on large carbon emitters.\nIn his victory speech, he said: \"It's time to build Canada into an energy superpower in both clean and conventional energy.\"\nCarney has vowed to raise defence spending to 2% of Canada's GDP, which is the target for all countries in the Nato military alliance. Last year, it spent less than 1.4%.\nTrump has been critical of countries not meeting the 2% benchmark, and says Canada relies too much militarily on the US.\nAnd Trump's pursuit of Canada as a \"51st state\" of the US has focused minds north of the border on their own security independence.\nThe Liberals say they will spend C$18bn on defence over the next four years, which will go to purchasing new equipment like submarines and heavy icebreakers that can be used in Canada's north.\nCarney has pledged to find new ways to trade in light of the impediments placed on cross-border commerce by Trump's tariffs regime. \nIn his speech on Tuesday, Carney vowed new \"trade and energy corridors working in partnership with the provinces, territories, and Indigenous peoples\".\nAmong his plans are an \"all-in-Canada\" network for vehicle parts, under which more manufacturing will happen domestically - meaning less reliance on imports from the US.\nThe Liberals also want to invest C$5bn in national ports, railways, roads and other infrastructure that would help the country further diversify its trading partners.",

        "article_text": "The latest in the superhero franchise \"is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun\", with a \"charismatic\" Florence Pugh at its centre, writes Nicholas Barber.\nEver since Avengers: Endgame came out in 2019, the subtitle has felt a lot more appropriate than the studio might have liked. It's not that Marvel hasn't had any hits in the 2020s, but it is no longer releasing an unbroken chain of talked-about blockbusters, nor is it keeping audiences invested in a story that threads through all of them. That particular game has come to an end.\nThe Marvel films that have worked best since Endgame are the ones that have moved furthest away from the pattern set by the so-called \"Infinity Saga\" \u2013 the first 22 instalments in the franchise, which pivoted around a fight against uber-villain Thanos. Last year's R-rated Deadpool & Wolverine used almost no characters from the main Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU); the postmodern Spider-Man: No Way Home paid tribute to the Spider-Man films which weren't made by Marvel Studios; and the latest Marvel film, Thunderbolts*, has its own distinct identity, too. That's not to suggest that it isn't a part of the MCU. In fact, one of its clever touches is that it specifically addresses how gloomy people feel in a world where Iron Man, Thor and Captain America are no longer around. But the director, Jake Shreier, and the screenwriters, Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo, have come up with an unruly take on the superhero genre which makes it the most refreshing MCU offering in years.\nThe key is that, rather than trying to be as glossy and expansive as the Infinity Saga films, Thunderbolts* is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun. It isn't the epic tale of indestructible titans saving the Universe, let alone the multiverse; it's a comedy-tinged caper about bungling secret agents who are deemed a liability by the very company that used to employ them. It's not a new scenario: after The Bourne Identity, there were countless action films in which disavowed spies dodged their erstwhile handlers. But Thunderbolts* stands out because it has a whole group of such spies: a ragtag bunch of depressive, dysfunctional loners who must work together and can't stop grumbling about it. What's especially unusual about the film, in Marvel terms, is that its premise would be viable even if the characters weren't super-powered. And, indeed, they aren't all that super-powered compared to the aforementioned Captain America and Thor. Part of their appeal is that they can be killed by bullets and trapped in rooms with locked doors, which makes them a lot easier to relate to than Norse gods.\nThere's a lesson there that the makers of such disappointments as Eternals and The Marvels should have learnt. It's not the characters' powers that count; it's their personalities. In Thunderbolts*, those characters are Yelena (Florence Pugh), a Russian assassin who was the adoptive sister of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and is now deeply miserable about all the mindless violence in her life; her adoptive father, Red Guardian (David Harbour), a washed-up slob who is nostalgic for his days as a national hero; the bionic-armed Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who was Captain America's sidekick in World War Two, and still seems uncomfortable in the 21st Century; John Walker (Wyatt Russell), an embittered super-soldier who was supposed to be the new Captain America, but wasn't up to the job; the confused, conflicted Bob (Lewis Pullman), another flawed attempt to create a Captain America substitute; and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), who is a science experiment gone wrong \u2013 but who, unlike the other characters, isn't very well defined beyond that. In various ways, they are all connected to one of Marvel's most memorably slippery villains, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a businesswoman with all the brittle, condescending confidence that you might expect from the reliably excellent star of Seinfeld and Veep.\nDe Fontaine, it seems, has been behind several superhero-related black ops. Now that her political opponents are closing in on her, she decides to destroy all the evidence of her shady undertakings, including the people who carried them out. And so it is that Yelena and the others switch from trying to kill each other to trying to keep each other alive. They become a sort-of team, but they aren't sure whether or not to call themselves the Thunderbolts, so the asterisk in the title signifies that it's just a placeholder name until they can think of something better.\nThunderbolts*\nDirector: Jake Schreier\nCast: Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, Olga Kurylenko, Lewis Pullman, Geraldine Viswanathan, Chris Bauer, Wendell Pierce, David Harbour, Hannah John-Kamen, Julia Louis-Dreyfus\nRuntime: 2hr 16min\nOne small snag is that most of the characters' back stories are in other films, and in a TV series, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, rather than in Thunderbolts* itself. Another snag is that the gang's pursuit by De Fontaine's troops accounts for the majority of the film's running time, so there aren't many set pieces that haven't been in the trailers already. On the other hand, superhero films are rarely so tightly focused, and rarely progress so seamlessly from scene to scene, with no pausing for breath, and no sudden jumps to different ends of the Earth. Captain America: Brave New World, which came out in February, was similar to Thunderbolts* in that it revolved around Washington DC politics, and followed on from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. But that film was a messy sprawl, whereas this one is so neatly plotted that you can get the gist and enjoy the ride whether you're a Marvel nerd or not.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A combat epic that 'does what film does best'\n\u2022 Disney's Snow White has a major 'identity crisis'\n\u2022 Mickey 17 is a 'disappointment' \nThe underlying issues in Thunderbolts* are just as focused as the narrative. The characters all have to deal with the shame and trauma of their troubled pasts \u2013 and this theme is there from the opening scene to the requisite Final Battle, which is slightly rushed, but stylishly surreal enough to recall two mind-bending films written by Charlie Kaufman, Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In between, the characters' guilt is explored in some touching and surprisingly brutal sequences, as well as in some sharply-scripted, briskly-edited and skilfully-performed comic scenes.\u00a0\nAt both ends of the spectrum, Pugh delivers a performance which would win her awards if it weren't in a superhero film. She delivers her punchlines with expert timing, especially when she is bickering and bantering with Red Guardian. But she can also radiate raw emotion \u2013 and all while maintaining a decent Russian accent and cartwheeling through her acrobatic fight scenes. When it comes down to it, that's why Thunderbolts* is so much better than most of Marvel's post-Endgame films. It's not just because it's a rough-edged, big-hearted spy thriller about lovably clueless anti-heroes. It's because it has an actor as charismatic as Pugh at its centre.\u00a0\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\u00a0--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has removed Mike Waltz from his post as national security adviser, and will nominate him as ambassador to the United Nations.\nIn a post on social media, Trump thanked Waltz for his work and said he would be temporarily replaced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who will continue as America's top diplomat. \nWaltz had faced criticism for mistakenly adding a journalist to a chat group where sensitive military plans were discussed - a political embarrassment likely to feature during confirmation hearings for the UN post. \nThe former Florida congressman is the first senior member of the administration to leave the White House in Trump's second term.\n\"From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. \n\"I know he will do the same in his new role.\"\nWaltz posted a short statement on X, alongside a screenshot of the announcement by the president.\n\"I'm deeply honoured to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation,\" he wrote.\nAccording to the BBC's US partner CBS News, Trump decided to nominate Waltz as UN ambassador just hours before the announcement on Thursday.\nMultiple sources told the network he was ousted because of the Signal situation and a perception in the White House that he did not properly vet National Security Council staff, among other reasons.\nBut the sources said Trump respects Waltz so he was given a soft landing and a high-profile new post.\nHowever, the BBC spoke to several US officials - who wished to remain anonymous - and they suggested the Trump administration believed Waltz might struggle to be confirmed by the Senate, allowing the president to get rid of him completely without having to fire him. \nWaltz has been under scrutiny since he acknowledged in March mistakenly adding the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic magazine, Jeffrey Goldberg, to a group chat on Signal with top US security officials.\nConfidential plans for a military strike on Yemen's Houthis were discussed on the message chain, whose members included Waltz, Rubio and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. \nThere was uncertainty on Thursday over the fate of Waltz's deputy, Alex Wong, a seasoned foreign policy hand from Trump's first term who was also on the Signal chat. \nWong was asked about the leak during an interview with the BBC's Newsnight programme on Wednesday. He said the administration had been \"very successful\" in taking on Yemen's Houthis and \"the president led on that\".\nIn March, lawmakers questioned some of the other Signal chat participants at hearings, including the director of national intelligence and the director of the CIA.\nThe UN ambassador position remains unfilled. Trump withdrew the nomination of his first pick, New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, amid Republican concerns about preserving their slender majority in the House of Representatives. \nMinnesota Governor and former Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz made light of the national security adviser's exit on Thursday.\nHe posted on X: \"Mike Waltz has left the chat.\"\nWaltz has continued to use Signal, according to an image captured by a Reuters photographer at a White House cabinet meeting on Wednesday.\nThe zoomed-in picture showed Waltz checking his phone and a chat ongoing with a contact saved under the name of JD Vance, who is US vice-president.\nThe message from the Vance contact read in part: \"I have confirmation from my counterpart it's turned off. He is going to be here.\"\nIn an interview with Fox News aired on Thursday evening, Vance rejected any suggestion that Waltz had been fired, saying he was actually being promoted.\n\"I like Mike,\" said Vance. \"I think he's a great guy. He's got the trust of both me and the president.\n\"But we also thought that he'd make a better UN ambassador as we get beyond this stage.\"\nTrump's announcement, meanwhile, of the latest role for Rubio appeared to catch state department officials off guard.\nRubio will now be the first official to serve both as secretary of state and national security adviser since Henry Kissinger half a century ago. \nRubio is also acting head of both the gutted United States Agency for International Development and the National Archives.\nSome reports suggest Steve Witkoff, a real estate developer and personal friend of Trump who is currently a US Special Envoy to the Middle East, could ultimately replace Waltz.\nAnother name being touted as a potential candidate by some in Washington is also one of Trump's special envoys, Ric Grenell, who has a longer diplomatic track record.\nTrump went through four national security advisers in his first term. The first, Michael Flynn, served for just three weeks. \nAnother, John Bolton, later wrote an unflattering book about Trump. \nBolton told the BBC on Thursday that Waltz's removal was reminiscent of the \"chaos\" from Trump's first term.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nWSL highlights: Manchester United 0-1 Chelsea\nWhen it comes to the Women's Super League, Chelsea are playing against themselves as much as any other side.\nA 1-0 victory at Manchester United on Wednesday night secured the Blues' sixth successive WSL crown, and their first under new manager Sonia Bompastor.\nSuch regularity may have played a part in the rather muted celebrations at full-time - handshakes and hugs, rather than tears of joy.\nThere is also the Champions League, the holy grail for which Chelsea still search. \nThis title was secured three days after the Blues' attempts to win a first European title were ended, for the third successive season, by Barcelona - and, 8-2 on aggregate, more comprehensively than ever.\nSo how do Chelsea ensure this title win stands out among the six, and that this season - which could end in a domestic treble of WSL, League Cup and FA Cup - is somehow not categorised as a disappointment?\n\"We wanted to be unbeaten,\" Chelsea defender Lucy Bronze told Sky Sports, after scoring the winner at Leigh Sports Village.\n\"The fortunate thing for us this season is that we have stayed unbeaten so we knew there were still two things to play for. We knew before the game Arsenal had got beat and we knew what we needed, but we wanted to win, we wanted to be unbeaten all season.\n\"Although we have won the league tonight we have two games left and we want to win those too. We want to be unbeaten for the whole season.\"\nThe numbers behind Chelsea's latest WSL title\nOnly in three previous completed seasons has the WSL been won by an unbeaten side - Arsenal in 2012, Manchester City in 2016 and Chelsea themselves in 2018.\nBut it has never been done over the current format of a 22-game season. If Chelsea avoid defeat against Tottenham next Sunday then at home to Liverpool on 10 May, they will have broken new ground.\nBompastor will have to deal with the repercussions of such a disappointing Champions League exit - but registering perhaps the most comprehensive WSL title of all time will go some way to making up for it.\nIndeed, if Chelsea win their final two games, they will set a new WSL points record - beating their own tally of 58 in 2022-23. Victory in their remaining fixtures will make the Blues the first side to record 60 points in a campaign.\nSonia Bompastor has added the WSL title to the three French leagues she won with Lyon\n\"I always look for perfection and the ideal,\" Bompastor told her post-match media conference at Leigh Sports Village.\n\"I told my players out of position and defensively I want to keep a clean sheet. I want to fight for each other. We spoke about how we managed the depth and how we needed to be compact, win the duels and win the second balls. It is all these details. \n\"I am never satisfied. Even when we win I am already focused on the treble and the other finals.\"\nBompastor has become the first manager to lead a side to the WSL title in their maiden season since Laura Harvey took Arsenal to the top of the inaugural league in 2011.\nShe admitted she had worried about the pressure when she made her much-vaunted move from Lyon to London, and filling the shoes of predecessor Emma Hayes, who she praised fulsomely after beating Man Utd.\nThis video can not be played\nBompastor - proud of WSL title winners Chelsea\n\"When you come to Chelsea everyone expects you to win the league,\" she said. \"It was the same in Lyon but here the competition is higher. To be able to achieve it for six years in a row for Chelsea and in my first season, it is not easy. \n\"I heard some noise about the fact it is too easy for Chelsea but it is not! When you are able to be unbeaten, to beat Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United twice, I don't know how people can think that. It is unbelievable.\n\"Don't think it's easy. It's never easy. It's a great achievement and a lot of work every day. I don't let my players breathe.\n\"I want to thank Emma [Hayes]. I am sure she is really happy tonight with our title. She left the club in a great place to build on the legacy.\"\nChelsea have not always blown sides away this campaign - they have scored fewer goals than second-placed Arsenal, while no player has netted double figures in the league.\nWednesday night encapsulated their league campaign. United had more shots, a higher xG, and a very solid shout for a penalty before half-time when Millie Bright appeared to trip Grace Clinton. Chelsea keeper Hannah Hampton made five saves and was named player of the match.\nBut they find a way to win, and win, and win. And crucially, not lose.\n\"Coming to this club I always wanted to achieve trophies,\" Hampton told the BBC. \"The fact that I can say that in the two seasons I have been here we have won the title both times it is surreal. It never gets old. As many times as we win it, it'll never get old.\"\nChelsea's season now has three games to run - the two league fixtures, then the FA Cup final against Manchester United, again, on 18 May.\nTo end it unbeaten domestically would be a remarkable achievement.\n\"It's what dreams are made of for Sonia Bompastor,\" former England defender Izzy Christiansen told Sky Sports. \"Her staff, the new players and the existing players that have done this before. They know what it feels like. They don't care where they do it or how they do it as long as they do it.\"\nHead here to get involved\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",
