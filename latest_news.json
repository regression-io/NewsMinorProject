Maybe we ran out of luck because the margins were so small.\n\"We played the perfect game, except for scoring a goal.

While there remain outside chances of salvaging a title from the wreckage, the emotional swing is surely huge. \nIreland have not lost consecutive games since 2021 and Doris was quick to try and turn the page to Italy in Rome next week.\nHe said: \"Regardless of how the table is shaping up we still want to get our best performance out there and finish on a high for the [retiring] lads and as a team on a whole.\"\nYet, for a team that has made no bones about the desire for a signature achievement, when including the failure to make it beyond the quarter-finals of the World Cup in 2023, there is an undeniable feeling that three have now slipped from their grasp in the space of just 17 months.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump called a meeting of his cabinet secretaries on Thursday to discuss Elon Musk and his efforts to slash government spending and personnel numbers.\nIt turned heated, according to media reports.\nMusk accused Secretary of State Marco Rubio of failing to cut enough staff at the state department, reports the New York Times.\nThe tech mogul told Rubio he was \"good on TV\", according to the newspaper, pointedly skipping any praise of his work as America's top diplomat.\nThe billionaire also clashed with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy over whether Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) task force had tried to lay off air traffic controllers who were already in short supply in the Federal Aviation Administration, according to the New York Times.\nDuffy's department has been under scrutiny after two US airline crashes since Trump took office in January. \nAfter listening to the back-and-forth, the Republican president reportedly intervened to make clear he still supported Doge, but from now on cabinet secretaries would be in charge and the Musk team would only advise. \nA state department spokeswoman told the newspaper Rubio felt the cabinet meeting was an \"open and productive discussion\". The White House has not responded to BBC requests for further comment.\nSpeaking in the Oval Office after the meeting, Trump said cabinet members should decide who to cut, but if they didn't, Musk would do the job.\n\"I had a meeting, and I said I want the cabinet members to go first\", Trump said. \"And if they can cut it's better, if they don't cut, then Elon will do the cutting.\"\nThe hastily planned gathering could provide evidence that the president has decided to curtail the sweeping power the SpaceX and Tesla boss and his Doge cost-cutting initiative have commanded in the early weeks of his administration.\nTrump first commented on the substance of Thursday's meeting, which was disclosed only in after-the-fact media reports, through a post that evening on his social media site, Truth Social.\nHe said that he had instructed his secretaries to work with Doge on \"cost-cutting measures\".\n\"As the secretaries learn about, and understand, the people working for the various departments, they can be very precise as to who will remain, and who will go,\" he wrote, adding that they should use a \"scalpel\" not a \"hatchet\".\nJust a few weeks ago, Musk wielded a shiny chainsaw at a conservative conference \u2013 a visible symbol of aggressive attempts to slash government spending that have angered Democrats and concerned some officials in the Trump administration.\nMusk's team had sent multiple emails from an official government account to millions of federal workers, encouraging them to accept months of advance pay in exchange for their resignations.\nFederal workers were instructed to provide accounts of their weekly accomplishments or risk firing \u2013 a request some agencies instructed their employees to ignore.\nDoge also ordered the dismissal of many newly hired government employees who, because of their \"probationary\" status, did not have full civil service protections. \nSome government agencies have since rescinded these orders because employees deemed essential, such as those who oversee nuclear weapon security, had been affected.\nDuring an Oval Office event on Friday, Trump responded to questions about the cabinet meeting \u2013 and reports of its heated exchanges. He insisted there was \"no clash\". He praised both Rubio and Musk and said the two got along \"great\".\nTrump's Thursday Truth Social post, however, appears to give department heads more authority to push back against Musk. \nIt also may be an attempt to insulate the Trump administration from lawsuits that allege Musk is wielding too much power for someone who, unlike cabinet secretaries, is not subject to Senate review and confirmation.\nSeveral federal judges overseeing these cases have already expressed concern about Musk's authority \u2013 concerns that may be further fuelled by Trump's comments during his address to Congress on Tuesday that the billionaire was, in fact, the man in charge of Doge.\nMusk and Trump have formed a formidable partnership so far \u2013 as the richest man in the world and the most powerful politician in America. Washington has been rife with speculation for months about whether that partnership could ultimately fracture.\nThose predictions, however, have usually been followed by renewed signs of comity between the two men. \nOn Friday night, Musk was seen boarding Air Force One with the president for a flight to Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida for the weekend.\nThe cabinet room dust-up may be the first crack in the foundation \u2013 but there is plenty of evidence that Trump still supports Musk's broader efforts and goals, even if he might prefer he use a scalpel in the days ahead, not a chainsaw.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

No other team comes close to that total.\nItaly, the next most kick-happy, have done so 100 times. Scotland are down at just 71.\nWhile there is a logic and pedigree to the tactic,, external the Allianz Stadium crowd are not enamoured.\nSeveral times against Scotland and France, they grumbled as Alex Mitchell or Fin Smith lined up a skywards hoof.\nYet, when both games came to the boil, the atmosphere was bubbling.\nA pair of one-point, cliff-hanger victories kept 80-odd thousand in their seats and off their feet and England in the title hunt.\nIt has become England's way.\nIncredibly their last 15 matches against Six Nations or Rugby Championship opposition have all been decided by a single-digit margin. The average winning margin across those games is a skinny 3.5 points.\nAgainst Italy, they could do without the drama.  A few more spectators making an early cut for the train station may, on this occasion, be welcome.\nEngland's focus on territorial and contestable kicks mirrors the gameplan that propelled Leicester to the Premiership title under Steve Borthwick\nVictory in comfort and a bonus point in some style should be the aim.\nAgainst an opponent they have beaten in all 31 of their previous meetings, England are strong enough to take the possibility of an upset out of the visitors' hands.\nAn awkward bounce, a refereeing call, a moment of Azzurri genius - the hosts should have amassed enough points to insulate themselves against all such eventualities by the business end of the match.\nThe outcome certain, the bonus point secure; boring, but in a better way.\nEngland have benched their most exciting player in pursuit of this goal.\nMarcus Smith's name registers the highest decibels when England's team is announced before kick-off.

Scotland are down at just 71.While there is a logic and pedigree to the tactic,, external the Allianz Stadium crowd are not enamoured.Several times against Scotland and France, they grumbled as Alex Mitchell or Fin Smith lined up a skywards hoof.Yet, when both games came to the boil, the atmosphere was bubbling.A pair of one-point, cliff-hanger victories kept 80-odd thousand in their seats and off their feet and England in the title hunt.It has become England's way.Incredibly their last 15 matches against Six Nations or Rugby Championship opposition have all been decided by a single-digit margin.

        "article_text": "Electric Jeeps and carbon credits are unlikely to make up for gas-guzzling private flights and building mini towns in the remote savannah. So, what should travellers be looking for?\nFourteen Jeeps idle near the dozing lion cubs, burning fuel. The smell of petrol hangs in the morning air as a couple of guides illegally park off-road in Botswana's Chobe National Park, crushing the vegetation so their guests can get a better view. One by one the vehicles pull away towards other animals or to their lodges where their passengers will have lunch \u2013 likely flown and driven in from South Africa \u2013 before boarding a tiny bush plane themselves.\nGas-guzzling private flights and building mini towns in the remote savannah might seem at odds with one of the industry's most notable movements: green travel. Yet responsible safaris play an important role in conservation by expanding protected areas, investing in environmental research and creating economic support for local communities. Now, as the pressure of climate change rises, an increasing numbers of travellers are seeking out environmentally and socially ethical safaris that minimise their carbon footprint. According to one report by B Corp-certified travel advisor Go2Africa, interest in sustainable safaris has grown by more than 1000% over the last four years.\nIn response, many of the continent's largest and most popular safari operators tout carbon-neutral (and even carbon-positive) trips, swapping out traditional Jeeps with electric vehicles, installing fields of solar panels and purchasing carbon credits to make up for their guests' air travel. With them, it's promised, travellers can enjoy a guilt- and carbon footprint-free vacation.\nBut some sustainability experts suggest that these efforts might be a savvy attempt to tap into society's rising climate anxiety, which is at an all-time high according to a recent survey by the World Economic Forum. At best, safari operators simply know what will grab the attention of eco-conscious travellers.\n\"It's called green-crowding,\" says Judy Kepher-Gona, executive director of Sustainable Travel and Tourism Africa, a consulting company that helps destinations and businesses achieve their sustainability goals. \"Marketers in the tourism industry are smart. If you talk about carbon neutrality, people hear you more than when you talk about sustainability generally. It's easier to understand and, for lack of a better word, sexier \u2013 so they crowd around that term.\"\nThe African elephant in the room: is there such a thing as a true carbon-neutral safari?\n\"I suppose that in a spreadsheet it might be possible,\" says Lisa Scriven, general manager of Fair Trade Tourism and Africa Coordinator of Green Destinations.\nData manipulation, loopholes and even differing opinions of what defines a \"carbon-neutral\" camp make it difficult to know how strict safari operators are being when they tout the label. For example, Scriven says that some lodges claim to be carbon neutral yet decline to calculate their Scope 3 emissions, which include everything they don't produce. In remote Africa, where every supply, guest, employee and bottle of imported Champagne must travel long distances to reach a private concession in the middle of the Serengeti or Okavango Delta, this cost can quickly skyrocket.\nThoughtful Travel\nWant to travel better? Thoughtful Travel is a series on the ways people behave while away, from ethics to etiquette and more.\nBoth Kepher-Gona and Scriven also warn against blindly buying into the promise of carbon offsetting, which most carbon-neutral operators include automatically as a levy or offer for a fee to guests. To be effective, reputable carbon-offset programmes should be linked directly to the destination you're visiting and invest in climate justice. When in doubt about the legitimacy of a camp's initiative, Scriven suggests checking with a third-party such as Credible Carbon. In the worst-case scenario, a well-meaning lodge may not purchase their carbon credits wisely; unfortunately, the market has become rife with scams.\nEven when a safari comes close to carbon neutrality, sustainability experts agree that achieving net-zero carbon emissions alone is not enough to ensure a long-term, eco-friendly future. In fact, it can distract from bigger, more relevant issues.\n\"I think when a business says they're carbon neutral, there's immediate awe,\" says Scriven \"It's not greenwashing because maybe they are carbon neutral. But it can be very misleading in terms of the potential burden they're placing on the destination.\"\nGrant Cumings, managing director of Chiawa Safaris in Zambia, agrees. \"Just because a company is climate positive, that does not mean it's taking good care of the wildlife, habitat, local people or the economy of Zambia. All these are just as important \u2013 in my view, more important.\"\nThere's good news, however. More responsible safari brands than ever before are reducing their carbon emissions while simultaneously developing multifaceted standards that extend throughout their business. Segera, the founding member of The Long Run \u2013 a network of nature-based tourism businesses that includes some of Africa's top purpose-driven safaris such as Singita Kruger National Park and Tswalu \u2013 defines its commitment through the 4Cs framework: conservation, community, culture and commerce.\nOriginally a cattle ranch, the property has transformed into East Africa's largest private conservancy\u00a0reforestation project and a thriving wildlife sanctuary, with plans to reintroduce critically endangered rhinos in 2025. Located in Laikipia, Kenya, a region known for historic land injustices since the colonial British government pushed the Maasai out in the early 20th Century, Segera prioritises its relationship with neighbouring villages.\n\"Carbon neutrality is one part of sustainability, but we focus a lot more on the community,\" says Joy Juma, programme manager of the ZEITZ Foundation that spearheads Segera's sustainable initiatives. \"We empower them to be part of the value chain by providing employment opportunities, bursaries, education and medical care.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0How will air pollution change where and when we travel?\n\u2022\u00a0Could the airship be the answer to sustainable air travel?\n\u2022\u00a0Is it time to change how we buy travel souvenirs?\nIn addition to community work, conservation is a key standard. Protecting animals from poachers, using environmentally responsible building materials and reducing waste are a starting point, but forward-thinking brands are taking the initiative a step further with transformative biodiversity and environmental management projects. In South Africa, &Beyond Phinda are working on a pangolin reintroduction programme while workers are creating a critical buffer zone for mountain gorillas at Rwanda's Singita lodge.\n\nWith so many layered aspects of sustainability to consider, it's understandable that the average traveller might become easily overwhelmed and feel tempted to fall back on a single metric, such as carbon neutrality. To avoid greenwashing, experts suggest choosing a property that's received a recognised, well-regarded sustainability certification \u2013 legitimate organisations do independent, on-site audits at least every three years. Dr Andrea Ferry, group sustainability coordinator at Singita, also suggests checking a lodge's website for clear data about their spending on conservation and community projects. Partnering with nonprofits is another good sign.\n\"Lodges that have a high sustainability maturity level are likely to have a separate fund or trust that performs the conservation and community work,\" she says.\nGuests must also be bold enough to ask the right questions prior to booking in order to hold operators accountable, says Kepher-Gona. \"Ask them: what are your sustainability principles? Have the claims that you make been verified by a third party? How do you measure your targets? Where is your last report? What have you done for the local community in the last 30 years?\" A legitimately sustainable property should be proud of their answers. According to Ferry, some lodges are excited to invite guests to view their recycling facilities, rainwater harvesting, solar power system and more.\nAbove all, camps must prioritise accountability and transparency while acknowledging room for improvement and growth. For example, Segera hopes to reduce fuel use and switch to electric vehicles for game viewing, while Singita is working towards a system to calculate full Scope 3 carbon emissions and better manage water consumption.\n\"Sustainability is multifaceted and it is rare to find perfect solutions,\" says Ferry. \"The more holistically one can think, the better the solution.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Major oil spills can be catastrophic for seabirds and marine life. Nearly 15 years on from the biggest marine spill in history, are we any better at cleaning up oil at sea? Jocelyn Timperley examines the latest science of ocean clean-ups.\nOn April 20, 2010, a blowout caused a huge explosion on the offshore drilling rig operated by BP in the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven people were killed. Two days later, the rig collapsed. Oil began seeping into the sea, and it continued to flow for almost three months.\nThe Deepwater Horizon disaster is among the most lamented environmental catastrophes of the past century. It's hard to comprehend how incredibly huge the spill was. It was the world's largest ever marine oil spill, releasing an estimated 4.9 million barrels of crude oil (779 million litres, or over 300 Olympic swimming pools-worth). Up to a million seabirds were killed outright, and the human health and socioeconomic effects are still being felt today.\nNorth Sea oil spill\nOn 10 March 2025, two ships collided in the North Sea: the oil tanker MV Stena Immaculate and a cargo ship called Solong.\nThe company that owns Immaculate has said that the ship's load \u2013 jet fuel \u2013 is now leaking into the sea.\nFollow\u00a0BBC News' live page on the collision here.\nBP, rig operator Transocean, and several government agencies immediately tried to limit the damage, with BP's chief executive saying the company was \"determined to do everything in our power\" to contain the spill. Booms were deployed to try to contain the oil, skimmer ships nibbled at the edges of the widening slick and fires were set to try to burn it off the sea surface. Various devices were deployed deep below the surface to try to contain or capture the oil. BP also began to spray the oil with enormous amounts of dispersants both on the sea surface and 1.5km (0.9 miles) underwater, where oil was gushing from the wellhead.\nHowever, it is thought that these measures recovered or dispersed only around a third of the spilled oil. The BP spill sparked a huge amount of research into oil spills and their impacts. But 14 years on, what hope is there for better measures should another oil spill occur?\nJeffrey Short, an expert in oil spills and now-retired scientist from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), was working for Oceana, a marine conservation organisation when the BP spill occurred. When a colleague told him about the spill at lunchtime, he felt sick.\n\"I knew immediately that this would be ecologically and economically disastrous, that it would wreck tens of thousands of people's lives, and that it would dominate my professional life for the next several years,\" he says. \"All of which proved true.\"\nOil spills are the third largest source of oil in the sea, after land-based runoff (largely from cities and vehicles) and natural oil seeps. The problem with spills, of course, is the sheer volume of oil that enters the sea all at once. This means that oil spills \u2013 especially big ones \u2013 are \"much, much more dangerous per unit oil released\", says Short.\nWhile no spill has since surpassed Deepwater Horizon's in sheer volume, Noaa responds to more than 150 oil spills every year. Just last month, oil began spewing from a submerged\u00a0oil tanker and at least two other sunken vessels in Manila Bay, in the Philippines, after they were hit by monsoon rains and Typhoon Gaemi.\u00a0Another oil tanker hit by projectiles from Yemen's Houthi movement remains in a precarious position in the Red Sea. However, the number of oil spills from tankers is today far lower than in the 1970s, due to improved standards.\nWhen oil spills occur, the first step is to control the source, \"whether that be a ship, pipeline, or leaking well\", says Doug Helton, regional supervisor of the emergency response division at Noaa's Office of Response and Restoration. \"The second priority is recovering oil at sea.\"\nThe major priority is to avoid the oil reaching the shoreline, where it can do the most damage. Shoreline cleanups can last days to years, depending on the type of oil and severity of contamination, says Helton.\nSpilt oil tends to spread quickly into a thin layer on the sea surface. Within days, centimetres-thick layers become a film of a millimetre or less, spread in drifting patches over a wide area. Efforts to scoop up the oil from the sea surface therefore offer diminishing returns as time goes on. \"Floating oil spreads very quickly and there is a limited window of time \u2013 days \u2013 when at-sea tools are effective,\" says Helton.\nHundreds of skimmers were deployed to clean up the BP Deep Horizon spill. Skimmers are boats that scoop up spilled oil from the water's surface, usually after the slick is first surrounded with floating booms to keep it from spreading. They do this in various ways \u2013 some, for example, suck up the oil like a vacuum cleaner, while others use oil-attracting \"conveyor belts\" or gravity to carry the spilled oil into a reservoir.\nBut hopes at the time that the skimmers could pick up oil \"like a lawnmower cutting grass\" proved to be overblown. They only recovered an estimated 3% of the oil. \"At sea, the oil may spread more rapidly than the skimming vessels trying to capture oil,\" says Helton. \"Going faster is not an easy option because the bow wave from the ship will push the oil away.\"\nThe satellite photos of the BP disaster \"speak volumes\", says Short. \"You'll see a half a dozen surface skimming boats that, from the sea surface next to the boat, look quite large and quite effective. But from a satellite, you realise that you are [...] just having a nearly negligible effect on the size of the spill.\"\nIn fact, a 2020 review of 30 large offshore oil spills found only 2-6% of oil was recovered using mechanical methods like skimmers. Short says that mechanical recovery has improved in recent decades, with better booms to corral the oil and better systems to remove it from the sea surface. But even with improvements, mechanical methods can't have much impact on a large spill, he says.\nIn recent years a plethora of studies and reports have emerged looking at different ways to soak up oil spills, from laser-treated cork and textiles based on leaves to graphene, magnets and even hair and fur. These mostly rely on the oil-attracting and water-hating properties of the material, with various forms of oil-attracting sponges a particularly common solution. But the difficulty of handling oil-soaked materials means these techniques are typically only useful for small spills.\nWhen Guihua Yu, a professor of materials science at the University of Texas at Austin, and his team began considering whether a new material his lab was working on could be used to help clean up oil spills, he says he was surprised about the lack of focus on how these innovative materials could be used in practice.\nOne central problem, he says, is that most can only be used in a non-continuous way, requiring processing to remove the oil before the same material can be used again.\nYu and his team landed on a solution which he thinks could help. In a 2023 paper, his lab developed a prototype with a collection speed 10 times faster than current clean up rates.\nThe lab produced their own super oleophilic gel capable of 99% separation of oil from water, which they used to cover a mesh filter. But they also designed a continuous roller system, which Yu says would be attached to the front of a ship. This conveyer belt picks up oil from the water surface, then rolls it round to beside an induction heater, which heats the oil, detaching it and allowing it to drip down to a collector in the middle. The roller is freed up to be directly reused as it rolls down to the water again.\n\"The most important [innovation in our work] is probably higher throughput,\" says Yu. \"I personally felt it's very unique and very different from what is conventional.\"\nThe invention has so far only been tested on a small motor oil spill in a lake in China using a metre-scale prototype, but Yu says he has had conversations with industry potentially interested in scaling it up. The overall costs, he believes, would be reasonable. However, he admits his current design does not address the bow-wave issue of oil being pushed away from the ship, noting that how to balance collection and bow wave is \"worthy of further investigation\".\nBut Short says that, for large spills which require more than a day to clean up, movement of oil during the night (when operations can usually not be carried out) will always limit the efficacy of collecting oil on the sea surface.\n\"The following day, the oil must first be located before response equipment can be effectively deployed,\" he says. \"For large spills, especially when response equipment is limited, these challenges may limit the amount of recoverable oil to less than 10% of the initial spill volume.\"\nStill, improvements have been made in tracking the oil too. Noaa now uses drones and satellites to help find and track oil spills, and tools for mapping and coordination have advanced. Undersea manned and autonomous tools that can tap into sunken vessels to extract oil have also been developed since the Deepwater Horizon spill, says Helton.\nBurning is another, more controversial, way to remove floating oil at sea. An estimated 5% of the BP oil spill was burnt off the surface.\nBurning requires concentrating the oil on the sea surface to at least 2-3mm \u2013 relatively thick for an oil spill. It also requires quick action, and lucky weather conditions. In the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska in 1989, a storm dispersed the oil over a wide area into a film too thin to catch alight.\nImproved boom designs to better corral oil have improved the effectiveness of burning over the years, says Short. But successful burning also has its own problems for the environment and human health in the form of air pollution.\nThe impacts of air pollution on the workers attempting to clean up the BP oil spill are still being investigated today. A major 2022 study found that workers involved in cleaning up the spill were 60% more likely to be diagnosed with asthma or experience asthma symptoms one to three years after the spill, compared with those who did not work on the cleanup.\nBurning is not the only culprit for air pollution. The evaporation of the oil itself is also highly toxic, as is another controversial way to try to dissipate the impacts of oil spills: dispersants.\nDuring the Deepwater Horizon disaster, BP sprayed roughly 1.84 million gallons (8.37 million litres) of the dispersant Corexit on the surface and deep into the water column \u2013 the largest volume of dispersant ever used for an oil spill.\nDispersants work by breaking down the oil into smaller droplets that can mix with the water below, which both helps it to degrade and removes it from the surface, where it tends to do most damage (especially to diving seabirds, surfacing marine mammals, turtles and young fish). But it needs to be added quickly after oil spills.\nLittle was known about exactly how this quantity of dispersant would affect the environment in the BP spill, but the hope was that it would stop the oil from reaching shoreline habitats. But the sheer volume used has been widely criticised as largely ineffective as well as harmful to the environment and humans. It's thought just 8% of the oil was dispersed using Corexit.\nIn Short's view, prior knowledge about oil spills meant that in the Deepwater Horizon spill \"you can be quite certain in advance\" that the continued application of dispersants on parts of the oil slick which had already emulsified was \"a waste of time\" beyond the first few days. \"But it shows the public that you're doing something.\"\nEnvironmentalists and scientists have a term for these kinds of reactions to oil spills \u2013 \"response theatre\". It describes when companies responsible for a spill focus more on being seen to do something about the spill than necessarily doing the best thing.\nSome researchers, however, say the dispersants were relatively effective and may have helped avoid further air pollution by getting rid of the oil. A 2019 report from the US National Academies found that dispersants can help cope with oil spills in some circumstances, but that limitations in the research make it hard to make conclusions about whether it improves the human health aspect compared to not using dispersants.\nStill, counterintuitive as it may sound, there are occassions where some interventions could be a worse option than leaving an oil spill alone. In many places, ocean microbes have developed to eat the oil seeping naturally into the environment. These same bacteria and fungi can munch away at oil spills too \u2013 albeit relatively slowly and some more than others \u2013 but if they are impacted by chemicals, such as those in dispersants, this process could be disrupted.\nBioremediation \u2013 such as adding nutrients to encourage oil-degrading bacteria \u2013 has a long history of use in oil spills. But scientists are still at the beginning of understanding the complex interactions between microbial communities and chemical dispersants, as well as how these interact with environmental factors like temperature and sunlight. Research, for example, has shown that sunlight levels impact oil degradation in different microbes differently.\nA study published in 2024 became the first to use an advanced microbiology technique to look at these interactions. Rather than look at the DNA of microbes, as previous studies have done, the scientists examined the protein expression of microbes in waters off the coast of Florida \u2013 a technique usually only used in medical or clinical science.\nUsing these techniques can show far more detail than looking at DNA alone, says Sabine Matallana-Surget, an associate professor of environmental and molecular microbiology at the University of Stirling, Scotland, who led the study. If she did a similar study on humans, for example, she would be able to tell when they had lunch by tracking the enzymes involved in food digestion.\nMore like this: \nHer team found that Corexit induces a high expression of proteins involved in oxidative stress in oil-degrading bacteria. \"I have never seen so many proteins involving DNA damage [and] repair, [as] when you introduce the Corexit to your microbial community,\" says Matallana-Surget. More sunlight also increased the toxicity of Corexit and oil in their experiment, creating a \"double pill effect\", she adds.\nThe team plan to conduct similar experiments in other places with natural seepages of oil, with different microbes, temperature and sunlight levels. If there is another oil spill in one of these places, Matallana-Surget says, these findings could inform the optimum level of Corexit to use in that particular location for maximum oil recovery. \"I'm hoping that in the near future, if there was an accident somewhere else, we would be able to say, 'Well, listen, no, you shouldn't apply Corexit in that region, or not as much, or maybe this concentration.'\"\nDispersants aren't the only intervention after oil spills that have caused concern. \"We have found after lengthy research that aggressive cleanup of some environments can cause more harm than the oil,\" says Helton. \"Marshes and sheltered intertidal habitats, for example, are often treated very carefully.\"\nThe high-pressure, hot-water washing used to clean the ecologically sensitive shorelines of Prince William Sound in Alaska after the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill, for example, sterilised the beaches, inadvertently killing bacteria as well as larger animals. Research has shown that areas not cleaned by the hot water recovered faster than the treated sites.\nCleaning seabirds\nOil-soaked birds are often one of the most immediate and visible impact of oil spills, and depressing survival rates \u2013 which can be lower than 1%\u00a0\u2013 led experts such as German biologist Silvia Gaus to argue euthanasia is a more humane option.\nBut wildlife rescuers say these rates may be improving as they learn better animal husbandry, such as allowing rest and hydration before embarking on the stressful process of removing oil from feathers. Guidelines have also been developed for cleaning turtles and marine mammals.\nIf a spill like Deepwater Horizon happened today, says Matallana-Surget, the reaction would be completely different. \"There have been huge conversations around what happened with applying tonnes of [a] chemical [where] we have no idea what's going in the environment. I think nobody in any part of the world would do that.\"\nUltimately, since spills are so hard to clean up, avoiding them happening in the first place remains the most important thing. \"Prevention is going to be the most fruitful line of approach,\" says Short. \"Continuing to implement safety measures and especially being vigilant.\" The problem is that standards are expensive to maintain, he says. If years go by without a spill, they \"tend to start slipping\".\nMajor changes have been made to US regulations governing offshore oil and gas operations, as well as advances in preventing blowouts in the first place. New performance measures and enforcement mechanisms have been introduced to improve pipeline safety. However, there are also new potential risks for oil spills: deeper drilling, ageing infrastructure, transport of new types of oil and through different routes such as the Arctic, and climate impacts like sea-level rise and more intense and frequent storms.\nA report released by BP in September 2010 concluded that decisions made by \"multiple companies and work teams\", including BP and others, had contributed to the spill. The unprecedented costs \u2013 over $65bn (\u00a349bn) \u2013 to BP of the Deepwater Horizon has acted as an incentive to companies maintain the vigilance to avoid future disasters, says Short. \"I think that's really got a lot of attention in the industry, that this is not a trivial operating expense that you can just write off as business as usual.\"\nBP also quickly announced $500m (\u00a3380m) for a 10 year research programme, which has been credited with galvanising advancement in oil spill science.\nBut while risks can be reduced, so long as oil is being produced, \"you're not going to get rid of [spills]\", adds Short. Oil supply is set to reach a record high this year, with the US last year producing more oil than any country ever has before. Until oil dependence begins to fall, sadly the risks of another oil spill will stay with us.\nBoth BP and ExxonMobil declined to comment for this article.\n* Jocelyn Timperley is a senior journalist for BBC Future.

        "article_text": "On his 18th birthday, Raphinha sat alone in his tiny room in Florianopolis, staring at his phone. No messages. No calls. No offers. Injured and out of the Avai U20 team, he was on the verge of giving up. \nFootball had been his escape from the favelas of Brazil's Porto Alegre, but now it felt like a dead end. His dream was slipping away and for the first time - although by no means the last - he wondered if he was chasing something that wasn't meant for him.\nThen came the voice that changed everything. His mother, always his fiercest supporter, refused to let him quit. \"If you stop now,\" she told him, \"you'll have to live with this for the rest of your life. Are you ready for that?\"\nThat moment became his turning point. Fast forward to today, and the same player who nearly walked away from football is now at the heart of Barcelona's revival, delivering goals and defying expectations.\nRaphinha's journey from Porto Alegre to Barcelona's dressing room is a story of resilience, discipline, and continuous self-improvement. His transformation into a top-level performer is not just about talent. It's about mindset, sacrifice, and an unwavering desire to succeed.\nShould Barcelona somehow manage to win this inaugural season of the new-look Champions League, it will also be a personal triumph for the 28-year-old, who as recently as last summer was cast in the role of sacrificial lamb in Barcelona's attempt to bring in Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams.\nHe again showed his worth in Tuesday's last-16 second leg against Benfica, scoring twice to help send Barca through to the quarter-finals.\nPlot the route to Champions League glory - who is your winner?\nPlay BBC Sport's new Champions League game\nRaphinha was raised in the relentless, grinding poverty seen across the sprawling shanty towns that litter the landscape in and around the neighbourhood of Restinga in the city of Porto Alegre.\nIn a neighbourhood where violence and drug trafficking are often a way of life, Raphael Dias Belloli knew from an early age that football was not just a way out - it was the only way out. \nHe has spoken about how he saw talented friends take the wrong path. Unlike them, he had the support of his family, especially his mother and uncle, who encouraged him to keep pushing forward with sport despite financial struggles. \nHis mother worked tirelessly, and his family made sacrifices to buy him football boots and pay for his transport to training sessions.\nHis football education was all about survival; playing barefoot against older opponents in the streets helped him develop endurance and technical skills under pressure. Both would become his most defining traits.\nHe was initially rejected by clubs like Internacional and Gremio because they considered him too thin and lightweight for professional football. \nDespite these setbacks, the rejection fuelled his competitive spirit and obsession with proving people wrong. Eventually he got a chance at Avai, a smaller club with a solid youth system where he learnt to handle the physical side of the game before having to face the first of many crises.\nA serious injury at Avai's U20 team left him sidelined and questioning his footballing future. The turning point came when his mother reminded him in no uncertain terms that giving up would mean having to find a 'proper' job.\nFrom that moment, his commitment to discipline and sacrifice became absolute, he started seeing football not just as a passion but his only way to a better life.\nUnlike many Brazilian stars who first shine at major domestic clubs, Raphinha had to prove himself in Europe from the bottom up.\nIn Portugal, first with Vitoria Guimaraes and then Sporting, he showed his ability to beat defenders and create chances, while at Rennes he proved he could be a game changer.\nHe was catching the eyes of the bigger clubs and, fortunately for him, he attracted the attention of the hardest of taskmasters that is Marcelo Bielsa, who took him to Leeds and rapidly accelerated his development albeit via a harsh, unforgiving regime.\nIt was there that he developed an outstanding physical endurance, which made his explosive playing style sustainable, improved his off-the-ball movement and pressing intensity and learned to move intelligently without the ball.\nHe also caught the attention of Barcelona who signed him on a five-year contract for a reported initial fee of \u00a350m, potentially rising to \u00a355 million in add-ons.\nRaphinha struggled initially playing for an elite club. \nCoach Xavi saw him more as a squad member than as an undisputed starter and even when he started to be a regular in the line up, he rarely played full games.\nBarcelona's inability to buy without selling first due to financial issues put him firmly in the frame as the club's biggest playing asset and the player most likely to be sold - especially while Barcelona were trying to sign Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams last summer.\nFocus was also elsewhere with the precocious and outrageously talented Lamine Yamal the centre of everyone's attention and effectively undroppable.\nIn two seasons at the club, Raphinha was used off the bench 11 times and started just 42 times out of a possible 76.\nThe message coming out of Barcelona was simple. \"We don't want to lose you, but we think you ought to go,\" seemed to be the gist of it.\nRaphinha had other ideas, although it was a close-run thing.\n\"There were several moments, not just one [when I considered leaving],\" he admits now.\n\"There was a lot of self-doubt. I have a nasty habit of criticising myself heavily, so to speak, so that pressure made me think about leaving.\"\n\nHansi Flick was appointed Barcelona head coach in May 2024\nThe dismissal of manager Xavi in May and subsequent appointment of Hansi Flick changed everything.\nThe German coach gave him a bigger role and allowed him to play with confidence. He is now a player reborn.\nFlick focused his work on the importance of making smarter decisions, knowing when to dribble, when to pass. The more direct style suited him too.\nThese days he loses the ball less and is more efficient and composed in front of goal. His current stats are remarkable.\nHe has 26 goals and 19 assists in 40 games and has scored in every match he has played in the Champions League this season.  He has established himself as one of Barcelona's key players and a genuine Ballon d'Or contender.\nHe has also been voted as one of the team captains, receiving the fourth-highest tally of votes behind Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Ronald Araujo and Frenkie de Jong. When they were injured he became the club's outright skipper.\nLamine Yamal, who also played a starring role in Tuesday's win over Benfica, has publicly said Raphinha is his main mentor in the squad.\nThat complements well with the fact that with the Brazilian national team he is the undisputed number one leader in the group.\nHis last-minute winner in the club's pulsating 4-5 group stage win in Benfica was a key moment in his and the club's season.\nHis celebration, with Barca's entire bench running towards him in the pouring rain, became a symbolic image of the team's unity and cemented his status as a dressing room leader.\nHe is clearly one of the most-respected voices in the dressing room, not overly vocal, but rather a leader by example, not just in matches but just as importantly in training.\nRaphinha knows just how hard it has been for him to get where he is today, just how fickle footballing fate can be and that it is primarily during your most successful times that you find yourself closest to failure.\nTo that end he leaves nothing to chance. He has spoken openly about how he avoids distractions outside football. \nHe has no interest in nightlife or partying, preferring to spend time at home with his family or focusing on training.

Frankfurt, Germany's busiest airport, said passengers would be unable to board flights and transfer would \"almost certainly\" be affected.\nVerdi, which represents public sector and transport workers, is in an ongoing dispute over wages and working conditions. \nGerman media reports thousands of flights could be cancelled across the day, disrupting travel for more than 500,000 passengers.\nThe Lufthansa group, whose main hub is in Frankfurt, confirmed \"delays and extensive cancellations\" across all its airlines.\nMeanwhile, Munich Airport warned of a \"greatly reduced flight schedule\". This includes flights by Eurowings, Austrian Airlines and Swiss Air.\nKatja Bromm, spokeswoman for Hamburg Airport, where all 143 departures scheduled on Monday have already been cancelled, said Verdi was \"dishonourable\" to call a strike without notice at the start of the holiday season.\nShe said that Sunday's walkouts were \"excessive and unfair to tens of thousands of travellers who have nothing to do with the disputes\".\nA spokesman for Verdi accepted that the strike would affect many, but said the travel disruption was necessary to extracting a better pay offer. \nLars Stubbe, the union's Hamburg representative, told the BBC: \"The workers are aware that disruptions do happen, and they are uncomfortable with that, but in any case, it is the employer that caused these strikes because they haven't put a negotiable offer on the table.\"\nMany of Frankfurt Airport's 1,770 scheduled flights have already been cancelled, while the majority of Munich's 820 flights are expected to be cancelled.\nHundreds more cancellations are anticipated across Stuttgart, Dusseldorf, Cologne and Berlin. \nMany passengers had already checked in their luggage and were having problems getting it returned, according to public broadcaster NDR. \nADV, which represents major German airports, said the strike had \"almost completely paralysed air traffic\".\nVerdi's demands include an 8% pay rise, or at least \u20ac350 (\u00a3294) more per month, for all workers - and three extra days of holiday, plus one additional day for union members. \nStubbe said that while airport wages range were above minimum wage, ranging from \u20ac13-\u20ac25 per hour, workers in different roles - particularly security staff - received less annual leave than others.\n\"There have been two rounds of negotiations in which the employers have not yet offered one penny,\" he added. \n\"It is quite usual that we don't get any offers in the first round, but now even in the second round, the employers have basically said, 'No, we're not going to give you an offer because we don't have any money'.\"\nBDLS, the body which sets security workers' pay, said in a statement: \"The damage caused by this strike is almost exclusively to companies that are not at the negotiating table.\"\nIt called on the government to outlaw short-notice strikes, adding that air transport was \"essential for Germany as a business location\" which \"must not be exploited\" in collective pay disputes.\nRalph Beisel, ADV's general manager, said the strike was having an impact on European and global air traffic, leading to missed connections due to a \"domino effect\".\nHe called for reforms to German strike laws concerning \"critical\" infrastructure. \nThe so-called \"warning strike\", an established tactic in German wage negotiations, concerns two separate pay disputes: one relating to airport security workers, and a broader disagreement over pay for federal and municipal government employees.\nVerdi has also called for strikes in waste collection across several German cities, including Berlin, Essen and Kiel, where bins have gone unemptied since last week.\nPay talks for government workers are set to restart on Friday in Potsdam, while the next round of talks for airport security staff is scheduled to begin on 26 March.\nNiklas Benrath, of the VKA, which regulates pay and conditions for municipal workers, also criticised the strikes, saying Verdi's demands would cost nearly \u20ac15bn.\n\"With a total municipal debt of around \u20ac160bn, these demands are not financially viable,\" he added.",

        "article_text": "You would never say Arsenal and Manchester United are having similar seasons, but Sunday's Premier League stalemate at Old Trafford was a reminder that they have something in common - a problem to solve up front.\nWhile the Gunners' attacking flaw appears to be a glaring one, in that they have played much of this campaign without a recognised centre-forward, United do have some strikers, but their regular failure to find the net has left people questioning whether they are good enough to help Ruben Amorim's side climb the table.\nWayne Rooney had sympathy for Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund when he analysed their display for his former club on Match of the Day 2, but felt Arsenal's issue again proved costly after watching them lose even more ground to Liverpool in an increasingly one-sided title race.\n\"I always feel the teams with the best number nines have the best chance of winning things,\" United's all-time record goalscorer, who won five Premier League titles, told BBC Sport.\n\"Liverpool are probably an exception to that, with the way they rotate the player they use through the middle, rather than having a regular number nine that the team is built around.\n\"The number nine is still so important for them, though. Mohamed Salah, cutting in from wide areas, is their main goalscorer but, whether it is Luis Diaz, Diogo Jota or Darwin Nunez in the centre, they all chip in with a good amount of goals.\"\nThis video can not be played\nHojlund needs more confidence to start scoring  - Rooney\nLiverpool have scored 17 more league goals than Arsenal this season - a simple statistic but a telling one, even taking into account the leaders have played one game more.\nWith Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz out for the season and another key attacker, Bukayo Saka, absent, it has been left to midfielder Mikel Merino to fill in as an emergency striker for Mikel Arteta's side in the way he did against United, this time with little effect.\nWhile the Gunners controlled the game for long periods, goalscorer Declan Rice conceded afterwards that they did not have the cutting edge needed. Rooney felt a specialist finisher was what they were missing.\n\"A proper number nine - a forward who has played there his whole life - brings  something different to any team,\" he explained.\n\"I am talking about that natural goalscoring instinct, which a player who is trying to learn the position probably doesn't have.\n\"A midfielder playing forward like Merino can get hold of the ball and bring others into play, but what a goalscorer brings is that selfishness of wanting to be in the penalty area to finish chances.\n\"As we saw on Sunday, Rice was trying to help Arsenal to fill that position, as the player who was always making forward runs and arriving in the box. He did really well in that advanced role, but he cannot always be there.\"\nDeclan Rice made six touches inside the United box, along with Jurrien Timber the joint-most by an Arsenal player\nMerino may be a midfielder, but he has scored three Premier League goals this year. Hojlund and Zirkzee have none.\nThose numbers may not suggest the answer to United's goalscoring problems lies within their current squad, but Rooney argues that any striker would find it difficult playing up front for United at present.\n\"Before they scored at the end of the first half, United had managed one shot at goal and none on target,\" Rooney said.\n\"Their problem was their lack of movement in midfield, because they could not make the passes to get up the pitch. Instead, they were forced to play balls up to Zirkzee and it was very hard for him to do anything with them.\n\"The best centre-halves, like Arsenal's are, force you under the ball in that situation or nick balls off you.\n\"If the ball is getting chipped in to you around the halfway line, which is what Zirkzee was getting, and you haven't got the support in and around you, then it is very difficult and you have to work extremely hard.\n\"Firstly, you are fighting the centre-half and holding him off you. Then you've got to get the ball under control and try to bring someone into play.\n\"If the quality of the pass up to you is not great, especially when it is coming to you around your neck like some of United's passes were, it is even harder.\n\"A lot of the time Zirkzee was getting given a 50-50 ball, the kind where you have to work wonders to win it. Ideally, what you want is your team to make a few passes and play out of the pressure, then as the striker you are getting the ball to feet, which makes it a lot easier, and you are closer to the opposition goal too.\n\"For a centre-half, if you are facing your own goal and in your own half, then it makes their job a lot easier, but if you are higher up the pitch the striker has lots more options. The defender cannot be all over you because they are afraid of giving free-kicks away.\n\"What United needed to do was get some control of the game, and get on the ball. Then the striker can make the little five yard bursts to get behind the defence, which give you a better chance of scoring.\"\nWhile Zirkzee had few sights of goal in the first half, replacement Hojlund got a couple of good opportunities to end his drought when the game opened up late on - but was unable to take them.\n\"There was one chance where his shot was blocked after he had shown fantastic movement to get to the near post,\" Rooney said.\n\"He goes once, he checks back, goes again, got across Gabriel and got a good contact on his shot, so he had done everything right. It is only a great block that stops the goal.\"\nHojlund's run to the near post - his first-time shot was blocked and flew wide\n\"The one that will be highlighted, though, is the one where Rice gets back and tackles him after the ball breaks for him in the area, and that was purely down to a lack of confidence.\n\"You see Hojlund take a touch and then he is looking up to see where he wants to put his shot when he doesn't have the time for that.\n\"That's the kind of scenario where, as a striker, if you are scoring goals you don't even have to look up - you know where the goal is.\n\"To me that really showed how much he needs a goal right now, but all he can do is keep working.\n\"I've got faith in him. He's a good player who works hard, which is really important. He needs that bit of luck as well, but once he gets a break then more goals will follow.\n\"As a striker for Manchester United, when you are not scoring goals there is a lot of pressure and a lot of people questioning if you can do it for United.\n\"The best thing for Hojlund to do is simplify it. Making runs into the penalty box is as easy at it comes. There was an attack late on against Arsenal I highlighted on Match of the Day 2 where Alejandro Garnacho is about to put in a cross and Hojlund needs to have that desire to get in the box.\n\"He goes to go, then for some reason he stops. If he carries on his run then he is in the right place around about the six yard box to get a tap-in for the winner when Bruno Fernandes' shot is saved.\n\"When you are short of confidence you have got to make sure you make it into the penalty area and put yourself in a position where you can score, so that is something he can improve on.\nThe arrow shows the run Rooney thinks Hojlund should have made\n\"We are still waiting to see Hojlund find his feet for United, but it's important to point out that the whole team have not been at their best.\n\"I feel for him from that point of view because, nine times out of 10, forwards rely on their team-mates for service.\n\"United have not been playing well or creating enough chances, so he has not been in a team dominating possession, sliding balls in behind the defence or putting balls into the box.\"\nOne way for both clubs to solve their attacking issues will be in the summer transfer window, but it is not just United and Arsenal who seemingly need a new striker.\nChelsea are also being linked with a string of number nines, and even Liverpool are supposedly lining up a goalscorer as a potential replacement for Salah, whose contract is up at the end of the season.\nIpswich's Liam Delap is reportedly being targeted by several clubs. The 22-year-old is a player Rooney considered signing in the past, when he was a teenager available on loan from Manchester City in 2021.\n\"Liam is someone I looked at for the clubs I've been at, and he is a fantastic player,\" Rooney said. \"He is a powerful lad and has a great physique to play the role he does.\n\"He probably surprised a few people by going to Ipswich, but he has scored some great goals.\n\"Ipswich are struggling in the league, so it is not always that easy for him, and I have seen a few games where he can get frustrated because he is not getting the service - exactly the problem I was talking about with United.\n\"But Liam has a massive amount of potential and I am sure he is going to have a fantastic career.\n\"I can see why the top clubs are being linked with him, but they are all going for the same players, because there is a shortage of number nines.\"\nLiam Delap has scored 10 Premier League goals this season\nIt does seem like the same strikers are on the summer shortlist of several clubs.\nArsenal failed with a January bid for Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, while Crystal Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta has been talked about as a target for the Gunners and United.\n\"Mateta is a big, strong lad who scores a lot of goals,\" Rooney said. \"From watching Arsenal over the past few games in the Premier League, they have put a lot of balls into the box without having anyone to get on the end of them. I am sure he would help from that point of view.\"\nAs well as finding someone who suits your playing style, availability is another obstacle.\nNewcastle's Alexander Isak is often viewed as the answer to Arsenal's lack of strikers, and he has also been touted as a potential Salah replacement.\n\"Isak would fit into any team,\" Rooney said. \"He has been fantastic over the past couple of years and scored a lot of goals. His link-up play and movement is brilliant too.\n\"You look at any team in the Premier League, and whether it is United and Arsenal or Liverpool then he would improve them, but I also think it will be very difficult to get him out of Newcastle. Why would they sell him?\"",

        "article_text": "Subscribers to Joshuanette Francis's YouTube channel \u2013 set up to document her journey after being diagnosed with osteoarthritis at just 24 \u2013 did not see the tears.\nNeither were they privy to the days when she tackled the most acute personal struggles, alone behind closed doors. \nAfter being told she could lose the ability to walk by age 40, Joshuanette was determined to embrace life, hiking every nature trail in her native Antigua and visiting each one of the Caribbean island's touted 365 beaches while she still could.\nConsistently upbeat and smiling in her videos and in public, her private tears were amplified when she lost her job as a restaurant supervisor - because of her condition, she says - followed by her mortgage and her dream of building her own home.\nSix years on, the young mother's sunny persona is the one she uses to fight her public battle: championing the rights of others living with a disability in a country where inequity is rife and crucial resources are in short supply.\nShe channels her energy into a pioneering non-profit she founded in 2023, Good Humans 268, which strives for a brighter future for people with physical challenges. \n\n\"Arthritis has changed my life so much, I can only imagine what it must be like for someone with a major disability,\" Joshuanette tells the BBC.\nOsteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease that causes pain and stiffness, typically affects older people, but can strike at any age.\n\"I couldn't believe it when I was diagnosed. My biggest fear was, what happens to life now?\" Joshuanette says.\nGood Humans' far-reaching work ranges from pushing for the establishment of an equal rights tribunal to preside over purported discriminatory practices, to a recycling programme that in turn employs local residents with disabilities.\nThe latter has already been implemented in more than 80 local schools, diverting about a million bottles and cans from the national dump site. Eight people have been hired to sort and process, and sometimes repurpose, the waste.\nGood Humans has also launched a nationwide educational programme to encourage more residents to recycle, something Kelisha Pigott was employed to assist with.\nShe says working with the organisation has been life-changing.\n\"There are a lot of people with disabilities out there who have no one to turn to. Joshuanette has moulded me to believe in myself more. It's because of her that I took the chance to apply for university and got in,\" Kelisha enthuses.\nShe hopes her online degree in tourism management will help her eventually merge her small travel company with Good Humans to create additional job opportunities.\n\"Change starts with us. I was amazed to see how much plastic we diverted from landfill in a short space of time; imagine if everyone did it,\" she says.\nThere have been some smaller triumphs too. Like the case of the 10-year-old girl who for several years couldn't use the toilet at school unassisted because of the lack of wheelchair-friendly facilities. That indignity went largely overlooked until Joshuanette took it on as a personal endeavour, leading to the creation of an accessible bathroom.\n\"We must shift the way we do things. People with disabilities must be able to do the same things everyone else can,\" Joshuanette says passionately. \"I'm so excited by what I know Good Humans can achieve.\"\nPlans include rolling out the recycling scheme to private households and ultimately creating a purpose-built centre to consolidate the group's diverse work.\nStill, she's aware of the challenges ahead. Even a stroll around the capital, St John's, is fraught with hazards for many with an impairment, thanks to omnipresent open gutters, crudely covered drains and cracked paving.\n\"Accessibility is a serious concern,\" says Bernard Warner, head of the country's disability association. \"For a start, there's a lack of access to assistive devices to help people live more meaningfully.\"\nBoth Bernard's group and Good Humans have been calling for legislation passed in 2017, which seeks to protect the rights of those with disabilities, to be enforced. An equal rights tribunal was a key part of the act, but has never been created.\n\"There's a lot of discrimination; people are treated with indifference or turned away from employment opportunities,\" Bernard says. \"And due to poverty, most don't have money to hire lawyers.\"\nBernard lost his right leg when his motorbike was struck by a drunk driver in 1996. Despite a lengthy court case, which ruled in his favour, he has never received compensation.\n\"After years of torment, I now rally for a better society,\" he explains. \"We have to alter our mindset with how we view people with disabilities. We've been leaving them out for too long. Even now, I see high-rise buildings going up with no disability access,\" he adds.\nKelly Hedges, principal of the Victory Centre for children with special needs, agrees. Her school currently has 27 students aged five to 18.\n\"The challenge is, when students leave us as young adults, where do they go? People are still wary about hiring people with special needs or disabilities. Unless they have personal connections or can go to work with a parent, they generally just stay home,\" she says.\nThe Victory Centre is among the schools to have joined Good Humans' recycling scheme.\n\"As Good Humans becomes bigger and needs more staff, hopefully our children can segue into positions there, become contributing members of society and live more independently,\" Kelly adds.\nJoshuanette believes that mental health should be a key focus of disability awareness. Despite her largely positive outlook, she admits depression struck again recently when she turned 30 and still could not afford her own home.\nShe continues to battle for compensation against the company she says fired her unfairly.\n\"Fighting is exhausting,\" she says. \"But change will only happen when more people talk about disability and demand change.\"",

After being told she could lose the ability to walk by age 40, Joshuanette was determined to embrace life, hiking every nature trail in her native Antigua and visiting each one of the Caribbean island's touted 365 beaches while she still could.Consistently upbeat and smiling in her videos and in public, her private tears were amplified when she lost her job as a restaurant supervisor - because of her condition, she says - followed by her mortgage and her dream of building her own home.Six years on, the young mother's sunny persona is the one she uses to fight her public battle: championing the rights of others living with a disability in a country where inequity is rife and crucial resources are in short supply.She channels her energy into a pioneering non-profit she founded in 2023, Good Humans 268, which strives for a brighter future for people with physical challenges. It's because of her that I took the chance to apply for university and got in,\" Kelisha enthuses.Courtesy of Good Humans 268Kelisha (left) says she has been inspired by Joshuanette (right)She hopes her online degree in tourism management will help her eventually merge her small travel company with Good Humans to create additional job opportunities.",

Retailers are also advised to make parents fully aware of this guidance.\"\nThe FSA added: \"While the symptoms of glycerol intoxication are usually mild, it is important that parents are aware of the risks - particularly at high levels of consumption.\"",

Otherwise, people are not safe,\" says Mr Prince, who before becoming a rubbish-picker had been studying law at the Islamic University of Uganda.\nUnable to afford tuition fees after his family became financially unstable, his daily routine is now a far cry from libraries and lecture halls.\nYouth unemployment is at crisis levels in Uganda, and there are many like Mr Prince who often risk their health and abandon their dreams just to make a living.\n\"I come here to the dump in the morning, collect polythene bags, take them for washing and sell them,\" says Mr Prince. \"I make 10,000 shillings [equivalent to $2.70 or \u00a32.10] a day.\"\nThe collapse has left him in further financial distress as he used to live by the side of the dump - but has had to move because of safety concerns.\nThe houses of others were also destroyed during rescue operations.\nCompensation money has been paid to the families of those who died, but not to around 200 people who lost their homes, local authorities have admitted to the BBC.\nOfficials are \"waiting for the valuation and budget allocation\", says Dr Sarah Karen Zalwango, the new head of public health and the environment at the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA).\nSome argue that the Kiteezi collapse was inevitable because basic common sense was ignored.\n\"You can't take four million people, get all that waste, mingled - degradable and non-degradable - and take it to one dumping site. No, that's not how we [ought to] do it. But we've been doing it for over 20 years,\" Frank Muramuzi, a Kampala-based urban planner, tells the BBC.\nThe Kiteezi landfill was built in 1996, with financing from the World Bank, to provide a single, major depository for solid waste generated by Kampala.\nAs Kampala has grown, so too has its biggest rubbish dump.\nOn the northern edge of the city, it now covers 15 hectares (37 acres) - an area the size of more than 22 football pitches - with its stench spreading further still. \nBirds of prey can be seen flying overhead.\nThe city's residents and businesses generate an estimated 2,500 tonnes of waste every day, half of which ends up in dumping sites across the city - the biggest being Kiteezi.\nBut the problem is that Kiteezi lacks the on-site recycling, sorting and incineration facilities that landfills are supposed to have.\n\"With each layer of trash piled up, the bottom layers become weaker, especially as the decay and decomposition of organic waste increases the temperature,\" Mr Muramuzi explains.\n\"Without vents, methane and other gases remain trapped at the bottom, further multiplying the fragility of the loosely held structure.\"\nYet this can easily be fixed, he adds, so long as the government commits to periodic monitoring and audits which factor in environmental, social and economic needs.\nHad that already been in place, \"the havoc that happened in Kiteezi would have been avoided\", he says.\nSo, if the solution is this simple, why is it not already happening?\nThe answer seems to be a combination of power struggles and financial mismanagement.\nUltimate responsibility for keeping Kampala \"clean, habitable, and sustainable environment\" lies with the KCCA, but Mayor Erias Lukwago, from the opposition Forum for Democratic Change party, says his office lacks the necessary power to enact the changes.\nThe KCCA says it has repeatedly proposed plans to decommission Kiteezi but says the funds needed to do so - $9.7m - exceed the city's budget and have not been made available by central government.\n\"All the support we have been getting is courtesy of development partners and donors like Bill and Melinda Gates, GIZ, and WaterAid\u2026 but their capacity is very limited,\" the Kampala mayor said recently.\n\"If we were getting adequate funding from the central government, we would be very far right now.\"\nThere is no word from the government on whether it will allocate funds for Kampala's biggest dump.\nIt did pay $1,350 to each of the families of the deceased, saying any further money would only be forthcoming if government agencies were \"found to be responsible\".\nA month later, a report furnished by the country's police and crime investigation department led to President Yoweri Museveni - a noted political opponent of Kampala's mayor - sacking three senior KCCA officials, including the authority's executive and public health directors.\nJames Bond Kunobere, Kampala's solid waste management officer, admits that last year's deadly collapse was a much-needed wake-up call.\nAt present, the authorities in the Ugandan capital are drafting plans to turn organic waste into compost and reduce \"unnecessary waste\" coming into the city.\nBut they want the public to take some responsibility too. At the moment people pay one of the seven private waste firms operating in Kampala to collect their rubbish, which is all bundled together with little thought given to recycling.\n\"We haven't changed the mindset of residents to sort waste,\" Mr Kunobere tells the BBC.\n\"If you sort, waste has different destinations. If you mix, it all goes to one - the landfill.\"\nExperts say such initiatives are important but do not address the bigger structural inadequacies at Kiteezi.\nAnd for people whose lives have been shattered by recent events there, it is too little too late.\n\"They promised us compensation, but I haven't received anything - almost everyone is complaining too,\" Mr Prince tells the BBC.\n\"We lost our friend. All that transpired in the process was sorrow.\"\nAdditional reporting by Natasha Booty.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

What is rare is the use of them,\" he reasons.\nProf Rosing says the vastness of Greenland and the lack of infrastructure are just two elements why the island may not be the cashpoint some Americans are hoping for.\n\"They are a minuscule part of the mining industry and the economy of extracting them is very uncertain, whereas the investment to start extracting is very high. The risk of the investment is too high relative to the potential gain.\"\nThe current Greenlandic government says there will be a vote on independence at some point following next week's election.\nAlthough surely unintentional, President Trump's designs on the island have shone a light on a desire found among the Inuit to finally break free from 300 years of Danish control.\nBut Prof Rosing believes, despite all the latent mineral wealth, his fellow Greenlanders are in no hurry to forego the annual block grant of the equivalent of \u00a3480m (\u20ac570m) it receives from Copenhagen.\nThis accounts for easily more than half of the island's public budget.\n\"People talk about health services, schools, the next outboard engine they want on their boat and what is the price of gas and all of these things that normal people do,\" he says.\n\"It's not like they stand up with a big knife, wave it in the air and shout independence, independence.\"\nIn terms of Trump's apparent obsession with taking Greenland, Fogh Rasmussen fears there may be a troubling conclusion to be drawn.\nOne that would render the Danes unable to do business with a man whose view on territorial integrity is so wildly incompatible from theirs.\n\"I understand very well the American strategic interest in the minerals, but when it comes to mining in Greenland, they have shown no interest,\" he says.\n\"That leaves me with the concern that maybe it's not about security, maybe it's not about minerals, maybe it is just a question of expanding the territory of the United States.\n\"And that's actually a point where we are not able to accommodate President Trump.\"\nAdditional reporting by Kostas Kallergis",

        "article_text": "In the quantum world, our intuitive grasp of past, present and future may not apply. Richard Fisher explores the discombobulating concepts of \"negative time\" and \"retrocausality\".\nTony Soprano is smoking a cigar, driving home. His journey begins in Manhattan, where he enters the Lincoln Tunnel, headed towards New Jersey. There's no traffic, so he passes through in a few minutes, emerging into the daylight.\u00a0\nSo begins the familiar opening credits of The Sopranos TV show.\u00a0\nIn the physical world of mafia bosses, one event follows another. So if Tony strikes a match to light his cigar, this needs to happen before the tip ignites. Such causality appears to be fundamental to how we experience the Universe.\nHowever, at the quantum level, temporal sequencing is not so clear or intuitive. In recent years, physicists have been exploring some seriously head-scratching behaviours at very small scales \u2013\u00a0some of which can be explained; some of which seem to throw our understanding of past, present and future into question.\nTo get a flavour, imagine The Sopranos opening credits featured an FBI helicopter watching Tony emerge from the Lincoln Tunnel \u2013\u00a0but they can't make sense of what they're seeing. From their perspective, the mafia boss leaves the tunnel before he enters. And when the confused FBI officers check their watches, he has spent a negative amount of time driving between Manhattan and New Jersey.\nThat of course is impossible. However, recently physicists were in the headlines for measuring a duration of \"negative time\". In quantum experiments, they sent light-pulses through the equivalent of a tunnel \u2013\u00a0but like Tony Soprano's puzzling drive, the pulses apparently spent less than zero time travelling through.\nAnd that's not the only baffling example of temporal strangeness at very small scales \u2013 other theorists think it's conceivable that some particles could even change the past from the future, via an effect called \"retrocausality\". In the quantum world, it seems our familiar understanding of time quickly becomes, well, disordered.\u00a0\nThis year will mark 100 years since the development of quantum mechanics, and the UN has designated 2025 as the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology. Over the past century, physicists have explored all sorts of unusual behaviours in the quantum world: entanglement, superposition, uncertainty and more.\nOne of the lesser-known examples is a puzzling way that light tunnels through barriers, such as clouds of atoms. In the 1990s, physicists fired photons through a barrier as a \"wave packet\" (a bundle of waves that describes both the particle and wave nature of light). Puzzlingly, the packet's peak apparently emerged before they entered \u2013\u00a0like a car leaving a tunnel before it drove in.\nEarlier theory in the mid-20th Century had predicted the effect \u2013 now known as a \"negative group delay\" \u2013 but observing it experimentally was another thing, because it should be impossible. It suggested that light could travel faster than itself, which is nonsensical. Moreover, events in time were apparently occurring out of order.\n\"We had to find a new way to reconcile that with our ideas of causality,\" says physicist Aephraim Steinberg of the University of Toronto.\nIn the intervening years, Steinberg and his fellow physicists proposed what could be happening, without violating known physical laws. In short, they argued that the wave packet was not time-travelling but reorganising itself to give the appearance of effect coming before cause.\nTo understand, imagine a line of cars driving between New York and New Jersey, says Steinberg. We might picture them as 100 Tony Sopranos, each driving bumper-to-bumper. These represent photons in a wave packet.\nThe line of Tonys depart Manhattan at 13.00. At around 13.30, the midpoint of this car-train enters the Lincoln Tunnel. This is the peak of a wave packet. You would expect this peak to emerge a few minutes later, right? However, the peak has already left the tunnel \u2013\u00a0at 13.25. Tony Soprano, apparent time-traveller.\nWhat may actually be happening at the quantum level, inside the barrier, is that not all the photons are making it through, says Steinberg. In the car analogy, some Tonys are getting pulled over or turned back; in the experiment, they are absorbed or ejected by atoms within the barrier. When this happens, the forward tail of the wave packet reshapes itself into a new peak. It looks uncannily like the one entering.\nNaturally, it's more complex than that \u2013\u00a0photons don't act like queuing cars because their position is undetermined. \"The photons don't have any individual identity,\" says Steinberg. \"That's why the tunnel is purely an analogy, but it's meant to show that there's no contradiction with causality.\" So what appears to be a violation of physical laws is more like a reorganisation within the light-pulse. With this explanation, no particle is experiencing negative time and there's no faster-than-light travel.\nMystery solved? Not quite.\nMore recent experiments from Steinberg's group have added a new twist and can't be explained (yet). Whereas physicists in the earlier work were observing an apparent negative delay \u2013\u00a0a pulse leaving a barrier before it entered \u2013\u00a0this time, a team led by physicist Daniela Angulo Murcillo calculated a negative duration.\nDelay and duration sound like they should be the same: after all, if your flight has a delay, that's the same as the duration you spend waiting. But that doesn't appear to be the case at atomic scales. \"It turns out quantum mechanics says there might be one process \u2013 one event \u2013 that's described by multiple time scales,\" says Steinberg. \"So you might ask, 'when does [a photon] arrive?' You might ask, 'how long does it spend in the barrier?' You're not necessarily going to get the same answer.\"\u00a0\nA negative measurement of duration has added a new level of strangeness. In the car analogy, Tony Soprano is spending less than zero amount of time in the tunnel, and it can't be explained by the same wave packet reshuffling that explained the negative delay.\n\"When the weirdness was explored in the 1990s, people made sense of it. But looking again, a little deeper, the mystery appears to be kind of irrepressible now. There's something here that is truly, seemingly paradoxical,\" says Josiah Sinclair, now at MIT, who worked with Steinberg and colleagues in recent years to explore this phenomenon.\nIt began with a seemingly simple question: how long do photons spend tunnelling through a barrier? Making this measurement is not as easy as setting a stopwatch. Unlike cars in a tunnel, photons have no fixed position or trajectory through space. \"An incredibly fundamental and deep insight about the nature of photons is that they don't have the same reality,\" says Sinclair. \"Their existence is fundamentally different to cars. We can't label and track them.\"\nSo, the physicists measured the spent time indirectly, by analysing the excitation of atoms within the barrier, as photons pass through or strike them. To return to the car-tunnel analogy, Sinclair says it's a bit like analysing passing vehicles using only their emissions. If you installed a carbon monoxide monitor inside the Lincoln Tunnel, you couldn't track individual cars but you could maybe figure out how long the passing vehicles spent in there.\n\"The shocking thing is that when you design something that measures how long are the cars in the tunnel \u2013 this carbon monoxide monitor \u2013 it turns out that the monitor in this kind of quantum mechanical situation will read negative minutes,\" says Sinclair.\n\"We understand mathematically why it's happening, but we don't know how to talk about the physical meaning of it,\" he continues. \"There's no clear correspondence to the world that we know: the physical world we experience. And so we're just left saying, 'Okay, well, I guess quantum mechanics are just different'.\"\nIf you think that is strange though, quantum mechanics has even more bewilderment in store. In recent years, some theorists have proposed that particles may be able to change the past from the future \u2013\u00a0so-called \"retrocausality\".\nWhile this idea doesn't have the observational evidence of the quantum tunnel experiments, it's a prospect taken seriously by physicists. The reason is that such temporal weirdness would help to solve an apparent impossibility they have observed, dubbed \"spooky action at a distance\".\nThis spooky action happens when two particles are \"entangled\", which means they are strongly connected, regardless of how far apart they are physically. In principle, they could be at opposite sides of the Universe, but when scientists measure, say, the spin or polarisation of one entangled particle, a corresponding property of its entangled partner becomes instantly determined.\u00a0\nTo return to The Sopranos, it's a bit like if Tony had a twin brother who lived in California. If Tony orders veal at Vesuvio's restaurant in New Jersey, his brother's order at a Los Angeles restaurant instantly becomes veal too (or perhaps fish; the property needn't be identical, but the key point is that the brother's meal is not determined until that moment).\u00a0\nWhat makes it spooky is that particles don't have these properties until they are measured; until then, they exist in multiple states simultaneously. In the Soprano twin analogy, there's no pre-planning about their meal choices; it's as if some influence is passing instantaneously between them as the waiter takes Tony's order, faster than light.\n\"It's possible to show mathematically that those correlations are not explainable in terms of a common cause in the past,\" says physicist Emily Adlam at Chapman University in California. \"It looks naively as though there's some kind of instantaneous signal going from one particle to the other telling this particle what measurement you performed, or vice versa. That's pretty weird. Physicists don't think that signals should be able to send faster than light.\"\nOne way to get round the spooky-action-at-a-distance problem \u2013 also known as non-locality \u2013 is to invoke retrocausality. In this scenario, information does not need to pass instantaneously between the particles across space; it happens across time.\u00a0\nIf true, it would mean that a measured particle passes information into the past \u2013 to the moment it was entangled with its pair \u2013 and then forwards to the moment at which the measurement happens. Or in the Sopranos analogy, Tony's meal order in New Jersey goes back to when the two twins were in the womb, and then forwards to the California restaurant.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why does time go forward, not backward?\n\u2022 Is time travel really possible? Here's what physics says\n\u2022 Time: The Ultimate Guide\nThis is admittedly a counterintuitive concept to get your head around, and it seemingly replaces one impossibility with another \u2013\u00a0a cure that seems worse than the disease. And that's not to mention the fact that it would seem to open the door to paradoxes of time travel, where influencing the past alters the present. However, it wouldn't be the first time quantum mechanics has defied common sense.\nIn its defence, retrocausality's supporters have pointed out that it only seems unlikely because we \u2013 at the macroscopic scale \u2013 experience time in one direction. At very small scales, it's long been believed that the physical laws are time-symmetric (with some exceptions). And as for the apparent time-travel problem, that only applies if the particle was measured in the past, they say. That doesn't happen; instead, it stays in its quantum underdetermined state.\nStill, if it's true, the Universe would have to work differently than we currently imagine, says Adlam. In one scenario, two timelines would essentially sit side-by-side. \"When people mention retrocausality, what they seem to have in mind is a picture in which there's a forward evolution and a backwards evolution of the Universe. It's a picture with two separate and independent causal arrows,\" she says. \"That's a kind of 'dynamical' picture of retrocausality, where you have literal forwards and backwards processes happening in some combination.\"\nAdlam, however, doubts this scenario. \"It is not a very appealing way of thinking about retrocausality, because you can very easily get inconsistencies, contradictions and paradoxes,\" she says.\u00a0\nInstead, she argues that retrocausality is more plausible if we live in what's known as a \"block universe\". This is a hypothetical (and philosophically controversial) model of existence, where all moments in time \u2013 past, present, and future \u2013 exist in a four-dimensional object.\u00a0\nIf this block is filled with every event that ever has or will happen, then it's easier to see how some hypothetical influence could pass between particles within it, says Adlam. To explain the spooky actions of entangled particles, information would not need to travel backward on some alternative retrocausal timeline. \"There's no temporal flow,\" she says. \"Time is just another dimension within the block, rather than being a material thing that moves.\"\nIf that is the case, we have arrived at what may be the most troubling implication of all about quantum mechanics and its weird temporal behaviour. If you accept the most fatalistic interpretation of the block universe, then, like Tony Soprano, we're all just characters in some cosmic TV series. We may experience life episodically, but our future is just as determined as our past.

In quantum experiments, they sent light-pulses through the equivalent of a tunnel \u2013\u00a0but like Tony Soprano's puzzling drive, the pulses apparently spent less than zero time travelling through.And that's not the only baffling example of temporal strangeness at very small scales \u2013 other theorists think it's conceivable that some particles could even change the past from the future, via an effect called \"retrocausality\".",

        "article_text": "Gurpreet Singh was handcuffed, his legs shackled and a chain tied around his waist. He was led on to the tarmac in Texas by US Border Patrol, towards a waiting C-17 military transport aircraft.\nIt was 3 February and, after a months-long journey, he realised his dream of living in America was over. He was being deported back to India. \"It felt like the ground was slipping away from underneath my feet,\" he said.\nGurpreet, 39, was one of thousands of Indians in recent years to have spent their life savings and crossed continents to enter the US illegally through its southern border, as they sought to escape an unemployment crisis back home.\nThere are about 725,000 undocumented Indian immigrants in the US, the third largest group behind Mexicans and El Salvadoreans, according to the most recent figures from Pew Research in 2022.\nNow Gurpreet has become one of the first undocumented Indians to be sent home since President Donald Trump took office, with a promise to make mass deportations a priority.\nGurpreet intended to make an asylum claim based on threats he said he had received in India, but - in line with an executive order from Trump to turn people away without granting them asylum hearings - he said he was removed without his case ever being considered.\nAbout 3,700 Indians were sent back on charter and commercial flights during President Biden's tenure, but recent images of detainees in chains under the Trump administration have sparked outrage in India.\nUS Border Patrol released the images in an online video with a bombastic choral soundtrack and the warning: \"If you cross illegally, you will be removed.\"\n\"We sat in handcuffs and shackles for more than 40 hours. Even women were bound the same way. Only the children were free,\" Gurpreet told the BBC back in India. \"We weren't allowed to stand up. If we wanted to use the toilet, we were escorted by US forces, and just one of our handcuffs was taken off.\"\nOpposition parties protested in parliament, saying Indian deportees were given \"inhuman and degrading treatment\". \"There's a lot of talk about how Prime Minister Modi and Mr Trump are good friends. Then why did Mr Modi allow this?\" said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, a key opposition leader.\nGurpreet said: \"The Indian government should have said something on our behalf. They should have told the US to carry out the deportation the way it's been done before, without the handcuffs and chains.\"\nAn Indian foreign ministry spokesman said the government had raised these concerns with the US, and that as a result, on subsequent flights, women deportees were not handcuffed and shackled.\nBut on the ground, the intimidating images and President Trump's rhetoric seem to be having the desired effect, at least in the immediate aftermath.\n\"No-one will try going to the US now through this illegal 'donkey' route while Trump is in power,\" said Gurpreet.\nIn the longer term, this could depend on whether there are continued deportations, but for now many of the Indian people-smugglers, locally called \"agents\", have gone into hiding, fearing raids against them by Indian police. \nGurpreet said Indian authorities demanded the number of the agent he had used when he landed back home, but the smuggler could no longer be reached.\n\"I don't blame them, though. We were thirsty and went to the well. They didn't come to us,\" said Gurpreet.\nWhile the official headline figure puts the unemployment rate at only 3.2%, it conceals a more precarious picture for many Indians. Only 22% of workers have regular salaries, the majority are self-employed and nearly a fifth are \"unpaid helpers\", including women working in family businesses.\n\"We leave India only because we are compelled to. If I got a job which paid me even 30,000 rupees (\u00a3270/$340) a month, my family would get by. I would never have thought of leaving,\" said Gurpreet, who has a wife, a mother and an 18-month-old baby to look after.\n\"You can say whatever you want about the economy on paper, but you need to see the reality on the ground. There are no opportunities here for us to work or run a business.\"\n\nGupreet's trucking company was among the cash-dependent small businesses that were badly hit when the Indian government withdrew 86% of the currency in circulation with four hours notice. He said he didn't get paid by his clients, and had no money to keep the business afloat. Another small business he set up, managing logistics for other companies, also failed because of the Covid lockdown, he said.\nHe said he tried to get visas to go to Canada and the UK, but his applications were rejected.\nThen he took all his savings, sold a plot of land he owned, and borrowed money from relatives to put together 4 million rupees ($45,000/\u00a336,000) to pay a smuggler to organise his journey, Gurpreet told us.\nOn 28 August 2024, he flew from India to Guyana in South America to start an arduous journey to the US.\nGurpreet pointed out all the stops he made on a map on his phone. From Guyana he travelled through Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, mostly by buses and cars, partly by boat, and briefly on a plane - handed from one people-smuggler to another, detained and released by authorities a few times along the way.\nFrom Colombia, smugglers tried to get him a flight to Mexico, so he could avoid crossing the dreaded Dari\u00e9n Gap. But Colombian immigration didn't allow him to board the flight, so he had to make a dangerous trek through the jungle.\nA dense expanse of rainforest between Colombia and Panama, the Dari\u00e9n Gap can only be crossed on foot, risking accidents, disease and attacks by criminal gangs. Last year, 50 people died making the crossing.\n\"I was not scared. I've been a sportsman so I thought I would be OK. But it was the toughest section,\" said Gurpreet. \"We walked for five days through jungles and rivers. In many parts, while wading through the river, the water came up to my chest.\"\nEach group was accompanied by a smuggler - or a \"donker\" as Gurpreet and other migrants refer to them, a word seemingly derived from the term \"donkey route\" used for illegal migration journeys.\nAt night they would pitch tents in the jungle, eat a bit of food they were carrying and try to rest.\n\"It was raining all the days we were there. We were drenched to our bones,\" he said. They were guided over three mountains in their first two days. After that, he said they had to follow a route marked out in blue plastic bags tied to trees by the smugglers.\n\"My feet had begun to feel like lead. My toenails were cracked, and the palms of my hands were peeled off and had thorns in them. Still, we were lucky we didn't encounter any robbers.\"\nWhen they reached Panama, Gurpreet said he and about 150 others were detained by border officials in a cramped jail-like centre. After 20 days, they were released, he said, and from there it took him more than a month to reach Mexico, passing through Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala.\nGurpreet said they waited for nearly a month in Mexico until there was an opportunity to cross the border into the US near San Diego.\n\"We didn't scale a wall. There is a mountain near it which we climbed over. And there's a razor wire which the donker cut through,\" he said.\nGurpreet entered the US on 15 January, five days before President Trump took office - believing that he had made it just in time, before the borders became impenetrable and rules became tighter.\nOnce in San Diego, he surrendered to US Border Patrol, and was then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). \nDuring the Biden administration, illegal or undocumented migrants would appear before an immigration officer who would do a preliminary interview to determine if each person had a case for asylum. While a majority of Indians migrated out of economic necessity, some also left fearing persecution because of their religious or social backgrounds, or their sexual orientation.\nIf they cleared the interview, they were released, pending a decision on granting asylum from an immigration judge. The process would often take years, but they were allowed to remain in the US in the meantime. \nThis is what Gurpreet thought would happen to him. He had planned to find work at a grocery store and then to get into trucking, a business he is familiar with.\nInstead, less than three weeks after he entered the US, he found himself being led towards that C-17 plane and going back to where he started.\nIn their small house in Sultanpur Lodhi, a city in the northern state of Punjab, Gurpreet is now trying to find work to repay the money he owes, and fend for his family.\nAdditional reporting by Aakriti Thapar",

It's very hard to discover what it is you might like and you might miss out on some hidden gems.\" \nA lot has been written about layoffs and studio closures in the video games industry, but Brian points out that many websites and magazines dedicated to it have also closed. \n\"So you have this rising tide of new games coming out and then a drop in the number of people covering video games,\" he says.\nBrian thinks Ludocene has got people interested partly because it fills that space for people looking for more detailed, informed recommendations.\n\"Having an approach that helps you discover things that give you a better sense of whether you're going to like it allows you to invest your money, and for me, more importantly, your time in the things that you really enjoy,\" he says.\nLudocene seems to have struck a chord with the gaming community.\nIt's currently a prototype, but breezed past its \u00a326,000 Kickstarter target four days ahead of its deadline and plans to fully launch as a web app in August.\nIndependent developer Jodie Azhar, founder of studio Teazelcat Games, says she thinks the project looks \"really exciting\" overall.\n\"Hopefully, they're finding the things that existing algorithms are missing - really high quality games that didn't quite get the marketing at launch or the media coverage,\" she says.\nBut she does have some hesitation about the dating app mechanic.\n\"It's a binary swipe one way,\" she says.\n\"The worry there is, if you ignore a particular game, is that going to cut out a whole bunch of other games that the algorithm deemed similar?\n\"So a lot hinges on how good the algorithm is in working out what games are similar and what a player may enjoy interacting with.\"\nJodie says she has some concerns about the team's ability to keep up with the pace of new releases and ensure that its recommendations stay varied.\n\"How quickly can you update or how vast can you make that dataset to make it really effective?\" she says.\nHowever, Jodie is pleased the app will be free to use when it launches, and says that will make people \"more likely to give it a try to invest in it\".\nAndy admits that keeping the database updated will be a challenge.\nHe's also the founder of The Family Gaming Database, which adds about two games per day.\nHe expects Ludocene to update more quickly because it needs less data for each entry.\nHaving experts on board helps to identify \"blind spots\", he says, and hitting the crowdfunding goal means the project will have time to build its database before launch.\nBackers can try the full app early and any money raised above the target will go towards building extra features.\nAndy hopes the indie-focused project will ultimately help to shine a spotlight on the \"passion projects\" often made by small teams or individuals. \n\"The idea is it's kind of levelling the playing field,\" he says. \n\"Just having someone as a bit of a cheerleader to say diversity in games is really important.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

This can sometimes involve gene editing to tweak the food's properties. The claimed benefits are that they are better for the environment and potentially healthier.\nThe government is keen for lab-grown food firms to thrive because it hopes they can create new jobs and economic growth. \nThe UK is good at the science, but the current approvals process is much slower than in other countries. Singapore, the US and Israel in particular have faster procedures.\nIvy Farm Technologies in Oxford is ready to go with lab-grown steaks, made from cells taken from Wagyu and Aberdeen Angus cows.\nThe firm applied for approval to sell its steaks to restaurants at the beginning of last year. Ivy Farm's CEO, Dr Harsh Amin, explained that two years was a very long time to wait.\n\"If we can shorten that to less than a year, while maintaining the very highest of Britain's food safety standards, that would help start-up companies like ours to thrive.\"\nDr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial College, London's Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar. It involves introducing a gene found in a berry into yeast. This process enables her to produce large amounts of the crystals that make it taste sweet. \nIt doesn't make you fat, she says, and so is a potential sweetener and healthy substitute in fizzy drinks.\nIn this case I am allowed to taste it. It was incredibly sweet and slightly sour and fruity, reminding me of lemon sherbet. But Dr Graham's firm, MadeSweetly, is not allowed to sell it until it gets approval.\n\"The path to getting approval is not straightforward,\" she tells me. \n\"They are all new technologies, which are not easy for the regulator to keep up with. But that means that we don't have one specific route to product approval, and that is what we would like.\"\nThe FSA says it will complete a full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the next two years and have the beginnings of a faster and better system for applications for approvals of new lab-grown foods. \nProf May of the FSA says the purpose of working with experts from the companies involved as well as academics is to get the science right.\n\"It can be quite complex, and it is critical that we understand the science to make sure the foods are safe before authorising them.\"\nBut Ms Thomas says that these high-tech foods may not be as environmentally friendly as they are made out to be as it takes energy to make them and that in some cases their health benefits are being oversold.\n\"Lab-grown foods are ultimately ultra-processed foods and we are in an era where we are trying to get people to eat fewer ultra-processed foods because they have health implications,\" he said.\n\"And it is worth saying that these ultra-processed foods have not been in the human diet before.\"\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

And how can they afford it? What does it look like? And what happens to the current stadium? \nBBC Sport looks at some of the key questions surrounding the project.\nKey questions, images & reaction to Man Utd's new \u00a32bn stadium\nMan Utd plan to build 'iconic' \u00a32bn 100,000-capacity stadium\nThe Football News Show: Manchester United unveil new stadium plans\nManchester United believe the new stadium can be completed in five years.\nA project of this size would normally take about 10 years to complete.\nHowever, the club think they can halve the building time by making full use of the Manchester ship canal.\n\"Normally, if you were building a 100,000-seater stadium from the ground up, in an area that needs to be regenerated, it's a 10-year project. But if we get going with the government then I think it's a five-year project, not a 10-year project,\" said Ratcliffe.\nThe club plan to build large parts of the stadium off-site before shipping it to the Old Trafford site via the Manchester ship canal.\n\"It will be a modular build - that means it can be built far more quickly,\" said Ratcliffe.\n\"There are yards which specialise in building very large structures, which are then shipped to locations around the world.\"\nArchitect Norman Foster added: \"Normally a stadium would take 10 years to build, we halved that time - five years. How do we do that?

I think they want to get going quite quickly, because they want to see progress in this parliament.\n\"I'm assuming that will go well and it will go quickly.\"\nUnited's chief operating officer Collette Roche says the club will work closely with the authorities to make the project proceed \"as smooth and quick as possible\".\n\"One of the things we are establishing is a mayoral development corporation, that gives a lot of rights to speed these things through,\" she added.\n\"You also heard today that Jim mentioned us potentially doing some pre-fabrication. So that means we can do a lot of the enabling works and start to design and build the pieces in advance of having to do anything on the ground in Old Trafford.\"\nIt is unclear what will happen to United's existing home - but it looks unlikely the current Old Trafford will be kept.\nArchitects Foster and Partners had suggested Old Trafford would be demolished - and there is no sign of the current stadium in the new artists impressions.\nGiven the proximity of the new stadium to the current site, this option looks likely.\n\"By building next to the existing site, we will be able to preserve the essence of Old Trafford,\" Ratcliffe said.\nIt had been suggested in 2024 that the current stadium could be scaled back and used as a home for United's women and youth teams.\nUnited chief executive Omar Berrada said the club may revisit that plan, but it is \"unlikely\".\n\nThat's the ambition.\nBerrada says the club wants to grow the women's team fanbase enough for them to play at the main stadium, which could incorporate matches or events with smaller capacities.\nHe added they were looking at pitch technology that would allow for the surface to be in \"mint condition\" for both the men's and women's teams.\nRoche added: \"The great thing about having this type of stadium is it can actually be creative for different venues.\n\"There is technology now that can still give you a sense of a smaller, great atmospheric stadium. That could benefit the women's team with a smaller crowd \u2013 and that's the kind of thing we are looking at.\"\nManchester United say the new stadium will cost about \u00a32bn.\n\"We're looking at a ballpark [figure] of \u00a32bn,\" Berrada told BBC sports editor Dan Roan.\nThe club have not said how the stadium will be financed.\nThere are several options on the table, such as loans, private investment or investment from co-owner Ratcliffe.\nHowever, the proposal to build a new \u00a32bn stadium runs alongside the cost-cutting measures being made by Ratcliffe since his investment in the club.\n'What we're doing now is try to put ourselves in the best financial position to be able to finance a stadium and other infrastructure projects,\" said Berrada.\n\"Our aim is to be the most profitable club within three years. We think this will put us in the best financial footing to make this investment and to work with private investors who are willing to work with us.\"\nThe club are more than \u00a31bn in debt.\nHowever, football finance expert Kieran Maguire says the club have more headroom to borrow money.\n\"The good news for Manchester United is that the club is in a position to borrow substantial sums, despite existing levels of debt,\" Maguire told BBC Sport.\n\"If the club does borrow a substantial amount of the estimated \u00a32bn cost of the new stadium, it is likely to do so with some form of interest only loan.\n\"When Tottenham took a similar approach to building a new stadium in London a few years ago, they negotiated at very low interest rates. These loans have resulted in Tottenham's interest costs rising from \u00a312m in the final season at White Hart Lane in 2016-17 to \u00a346m in 2022-23. During that same period matchday income had increased by \u00a372m and commercial income by \u00a3155m.\n\"The increase in commercial income is due to the club having a bigger multi-function stadium, used for a myriad football and non-football events such as NFL, music concerts and boxing.\"\nSpeaking to BBC sports editor Dan Roan, Ratcliffe said: \"The financing is not the issue, I think it's eminently financeable. But the detail of that we'd rather talk about in the future. It will be financeable, I think.\"\nRatcliffe told the Overlap podcast, external that no public money will be used to build the stadium, but the project will not be possible without wider regeneration funded by the government.\n\"We can't afford to regenerate southern Manchester. It is too big a bill for the club,\" he said.\n\"We don't need any government funding for the stadium, but it has to be the underpin for the regeneration.\"\nAccording to Berrada, no.\n\"We don't want to inhibit our ability to invest in the team, for us to continue being competitive while we are building a new stadium,\" he added.\n\"There are various ways around that. One of the things we are looking at is to shorten the construction timelines.\n\"In the meantime, by getting our finances back in order and becoming profitable, we believe that we can be very competitive.\n\"The big, big benefit that this club has is that it has the biggest fanbase in the world and therefore the ability to be the number one in terms of revenues that it generates.\"\nRoche added: \"Our number one goal is to get our teams winning and to get the men's team competing for all the titles consistently. We are not going to deviate from that.\"\n'Some Man Utd players not good enough & overpaid'\nThe new stadium is to be built next to Old Trafford, which Ratcliffe hopes will \"preserve the essence\" of their current home.\nThe new stadium will form part of a wider regeneration of the Old Trafford area. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has already given Government backing to the plans.\nUnited say the project has the potential to create 92,000 new jobs, bring an additional 1.8 million visitors to the area annually and will be worth an additional \u00a37.3bn per year to the UK economy.\nOld Trafford's current capacity is 74,310, so the new stadium will accommodate more than 25,000 new spectators.\nHow will United fill it? And who will they be?\n\"Those Manchester United fans on the waiting list for season tickets may be disappointed if they thought the additional capacity of the stadium would result in many more season tickets becoming available,\" said Maguire. \n\"Manchester United have a huge global fanbase who are more likely to be willing to pay higher prices than those available to season ticket holders. Liverpool have in recent years increased the capacity of Anfield from 45,000 to over 61,000 as owners Fenway Sports Group have made most of the extra tickets available to fans in the membership scheme rather than those who want to have a coveted season ticket.\"\nIn a statement, the Manchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST) said fans \"remain anxious\" about the plans and whether ticket prices will be driven up, forcing out local supporters.\n\"We look forward to further consultation with supporters discussing these vital questions with the club. If they are able to produce a new stadium as stunning as the plans suggest without harming the atmosphere, without hiking ticket prices and without harming investment elsewhere, then this could be very exciting.\n\"But until the questions are answered, our optimism about plans to make Old Trafford the biggest and the best again will be restrained by caution about what the consequences for fans might be.\"\nMan Utd's new \u00a32bn stadium - all the key reaction and best images\nFans tell of hopes and fears for new Man Utd stadium\nThis video can not be played\nWatch promotional film of Man Utd's new stadium\nArchitects at Foster and Partners, who will design the project, said the new stadium would feature an umbrella design and a new public plaza that is \"twice the size of Trafalgar Square\".\nThe design will feature three masts described as \"the trident\", which the architects say will be 200 metres high and visible from 25 miles away.\n\"As you move away from the stadium, it's not a fortress surrounded by a sea of cars.

However, that rule has been scrapped.This season, any team who win the Europa League but do not qualify for the Champions League via their domestic league position will go into the Champions League.This raises the possibility of Manchester United or Tottenham, both through to the knockout stage of the Europa League but languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League, qualifying for the Champions League alongside the top four or five.

        "article_text": "Mark Carney has won the race to succeed Justin Trudeau as Canada's prime minister, vowing to win the trade war with the US and President Donald Trump.\nThe former governor of the Canadian central bank and Bank of England beat three rivals in the Liberal Party's leadership contest in a landslide. \nIn much of his victory speech, Carney, 59, attacked Trump, who has imposed tariffs on Canada and said he wants to make the country the 51st US state. \"Americans should make no mistake,\" he said. \"In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.\"  \nCarney is expected to be sworn in the coming days and will lead the Liberals in the next general election, which could be called in the coming weeks.\nCarney, now prime minister-designate, has never served in elected office. \nThe Liberal leadership race began in January after Trudeau resigned following nearly a decade in office. He had faced internal pressure to quit over deep unpopularity with voters, who were frustrated with a housing crisis and the rising cost of living. \nCarney won on the first ballot on Sunday evening, taking 85.9% of the vote to beat his nearest rival, former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland.\nLoud cheers erupted as the results were announced to a crowd of some 1,600 party faithful in Ottawa, Canada's capital.  \nThe party said more than 150,000 people had cast ballots in the race. \nCarney, who will lead a minority government in parliament, could either call a snap general election himself or opposition parties could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month.\nThe governing Liberals have seen a remarkable political turnaround since Trudeau's exit, as Canadians have been galvanised by Donald Trump's trade threats and support for annexing their country\nAt the beginning of the year, they trailed the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, by more than 20 points in election polls.\nThey have since narrowed the gap and some polls show them statistically tied with Poilievre's party.\nMuch of Carney's speech focused on what he called Trump's \"unjustified tariffs\" on Canada, America's largest trading partner. \nThe US imposed levies of 25% on Canadian goods last Tuesday, but rowed back within days to exempt goods compliant with an existing trade agreement.\nCanada responded with retaliatory tariffs of its own as Trudeau accused his US counterpart of trying to collapse the country's economy.\nCarney echoed that in his victory speech, saying Trump was \"attacking Canadian workers, families, and businesses\". \n\"We can't let him succeed,\" he added, as the crowd booed loudly.\nHe said his government would keep tariffs on US imports \"until the Americans show us respect\".\nCanada's economy depends significantly on trade with the US and risks tipping into recession if the sweeping tariffs threatened by Trump are fully imposed.\n\"I know these are dark days,\" Carney said. \"Dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust. \n\"We're getting over the shock, but let us never forget the lessons: we have to look after ourselves and we have to look out for each other. We need to pull together in the tough days ahead.\"\nCarney also pledged to \"secure our borders\" - a key demand of Trump who has accused Canada of failing to control the flow of migrants and fentanyl going south.\nThe US president even got a mention in Carney's attacks on his main opponent, Conservative leader Poilievre.\n\"Pierre Poilievre's plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,\" said Carney. \n\"Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him.\"\nShortly before Carney took to the stage, Trudeau gave an emotional farewell speech, reflecting on his 12 years as Liberal leader.\nHe warned that Canada was facing an \"existential challenge\" from the US under Trump.\nThe Conservatives have had to pivot politically since Trudeau's resignation, and are attacking Carney as not representing change but rather being \"just like Justin\".\nThey accuse the Liberals of a \"sneaky\" plan to win a fourth term by simply substituting their leader.\nPoilievre's party has also accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York. \nCarney said the formal decision by shareholders to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board at the start of this year but a letter emerged showing he had recommended the move in December.\nFederal Public Safety Minister David McGuinty, who endorsed Carney, told the BBC that he \"embodies the kind of quiet determination, but steely determination and competence to deal with some of these big issues\". \n\"I'm really, really excited for what's coming. And frankly, it's time for an election.\" \nThe Liberals will face Poilievre's Conservatives, who are the official opposition with 120 seats in the House of Commons; the Bloc Quebecois, who have 33 seats; and the New Democrats, who have 24, when Canadians next go to the polls. \nThe former central banker has run on a broadly centrist agenda, a shift from Trudeau, who moved the Liberals to the left.\nA major promise is to push forward major energy projects like pipelines, which have faced political roadblocks in recent years.\nHe has promised major investments in housing and clean energy projects, and to liberalise trade within Canada, where barriers remain between provinces, as well as diversifying the economy away from the US.\nDuring the leadership race, Carney promised to cap the size of the federal government, which expanded 40% under Trudeau.",

We knew it was going to be risky, but we want to show the fans that we don't want to kick as much and play with the ball.\"\nWing Ollie Sleightholme, who crossed twice for the hosts, added: \"Us as players decided just to beat people, score more tries and be more aggressive with the ball.\"\nIt was clear. England kicked 31 times, but carried 145 times. Against Scotland last time out, they kicked five times more and carried 67 times fewer.\nA remarkable shift, even allowing for the change in opposition.\nIt isn't a tactic that comes naturally to England's coaching staff, whose Premiership triumph with Leicester in 2022 came via grindingly accurate percentage rugby and a barrage of kicks.\nAnd, even with the near-wholesale adoption of a Northampton backline which won the 2024 domestic crown in more style, England's attack took time to throw off the ring rust.\nA duff pass from Tommy Freeman drew the first groan from the stands inside 30 seconds.

A twin-moment, 10-point swing, that critical passage eased the pressure and allow England to loosen up their style.\nWhen Sleightholme dotted down his second it was via a party game of a passing move, with England's forwards improvising increasingly outlandish offloads.

        "article_text": "Head in hands, eight-year-old Timmy muttered to himself as he tried to beat a robot powered by artificial intelligence at a game of chess.\nBut this was not an AI showroom or laboratory \u2013 this robot was living on a coffee table in a Beijing apartment, along with Timmy.\nThe first night it came home, Timmy hugged his little robot friend before heading to bed. He doesn't have a name for it \u2013 yet.\n\"It's like a little teacher or a little friend,\" the boy said, as he showed his mum the next move he was considering on the chess board.\nMoments later, the robot chimed in: \"Congrats! You win.\" Round eyes blinking on the screen, it began rearranging the pieces to start a new game as it continued in Mandarin: \"I've seen your ability, I will do better next time.\"\nChina is embracing AI in its bid to become a tech superpower by 2030.\nDeepSeek, the breakthrough Chinese chatbot that caught the world's attention in January, was just the first hint of that ambition. \nMoney is pouring into AI businesses seeking more capital, fuelling domestic competition. There are more than 4,500 firms developing and selling AI, schools in the capital Beijing are introducing AI courses for primary and secondary students later this year, and universities have increased the number of places available for students studying AI. \n\"This is an inevitable trend. We will co-exist with AI,\" said Timmy's mum, Yan Xue. \"Children should get to know it as early as possible. We should not reject it.\"\nShe is keen for her son to learn both chess and the strategy board game Go \u2013 the robot does both, which persuaded her that its $800 price tag was a good investment. Its creators are already planning to add a language tutoring programme.\nPerhaps this was what the Chinese Communist Party hoped for when it declared in 2017 that AI would be \"the main driving force\" of the country's progress. President Xi Jinping is now betting big on it, as a slowing Chinese economy grapples with the blow of tariffs from its biggest trading partner, the United States.\nBeijing plans to invest 10tn Chinese yuan ($1.4tn; \u00a31tn) in the next 15 years as it competes with Washington to gain the edge in advanced tech. AI funding got yet another boost at the government's annual political gathering, which is currently under way. This comes on the heels of a 60 billion yuan-AI investment fund created in January, just days after the US further tightened export controls for advanced chips and placed more Chinese firms on a trade blacklist.\nBut DeepSeek has shown that Chinese companies can overcome these barriers. And that's what has stunned Silicon Valley and industry experts \u2013 they did not expect China to catch up so soon.\nIt's a reaction Tommy Tang has become accustomed to after six months of marketing his firm's chess-playing robot at various competitions.\nTimmy's machine comes from the same company, SenseRobot, which offers a wide range in abilities \u2013 Chinese state media hailed an advanced version in 2022 that beat chess Grand Masters at the game.\n\"Parents will ask about the price, then they will ask where I am from. They expect me to come from the US or Europe. They seem surprised that I am from China,\" Mr Tang said, smiling. \"There will always be one or two seconds of silence when I say I am from China.\"\nHis firm has sold more than 100,000 of the robots and now has a contract with a major US supermarket chain, Costco.\nOne of the secrets to China's engineering success is its young people. In 2020, more than 3.5 million of the country's students graduated with degrees in science, technology, engineering and maths, better known as STEM.\nThat's more than any other country in the world - and Beijing is keen to leverage it. \"Building strength in education, science and talent is a shared responsibility,\" Xi told party leaders last week.\nEver since China opened its economy to the world in the late 1970s, it has \"been through a process of accumulating talent and technology,\" says Abbott Lyu, vice-president of Shanghai-based Whalesbot, a firm that makes AI toys. \"In this era of AI, we've got many, many engineers, and they are hardworking.\"\nBehind him, a dinosaur made of variously coloured bricks roars to life. It's being controlled through code assembled on a smartphone by a seven-year-old.\nThe company is developing toys to help children as young as three learn code. Every package of bricks comes with a booklet of code. Children can then choose what they want to build and learn how to do it. The cheapest toy sells for around $40.\n\"Other countries have AI education robots as well, but when it comes to competitiveness and smart hardware, China is doing better,\" Mr Lyu insists.\nThe success of DeepSeek turned its CEO Liang Wenfeng into a national hero and \"is worth 10 billion yuan of advertising for [China's] AI industry,\" he added.\n\"It has let the public know that AI is not just a concept, that it can indeed change people's lives. It has inspired public curiosity.\"\nSix homegrown AI firms, including DeepSeek, have now been nicknamed China's six little dragons by the internet \u2013 the others are Unitree Robotics, Deep Robotics, BrainCo, Game Science, and Manycore Tech.\nSome of them were at a recent AI fair in Shanghai, where the biggest Chinese firms in the business showed off their advances, from search and rescue robots to a backflipping dog-like one, which wandered the halls among visitors.\nIn one bustling exhibition hall, two teams of humanoid robots battled it out in a game of football, complete in red and blue jerseys. The machines fell when they clashed \u2013 and one of them was even taken off the field in a stretcher by their human handler who was keen to keep the joke going.\nIt was hard to miss the air of excitement among developers in the wake of DeepSeek. \"Deepseek means the world knows we are here,\" said Yu Jingji, a 26-year-old engineer.\nBut as the world learns of China's AI potential, there are also concerns about what AI is allowing the Chinese government to learn about its users.\nAI is hungry for data - the more it gets, the smarter it makes itself and, with around a billion mobile phone users compared to just over 400 million in the US, Beijing has a real advantage.\nThe West, its allies and many experts in these countries believe that data gathered by Chinese apps such as DeepSeek, RedNote or TikTok can be accessed by the Chinese Communist Party. Some point to the country's National Intelligence Law as evidence of this.\nBut Chinese firms, including ByteDance, which owns TikTok, says the law allows for the protection of private companies and personal data. Still, suspicion that US user data on TikTok could end up in the hands of the Chinese government drove Washington's decision to ban the hugely popular app.\nThat same fear \u2013 where privacy concerns meet national security challenges - is hitting Deepseek. South Korea banned new downloads of DeepSeek, while Taiwan and Australia have barred the app from government-issued devices.\nChinese companies are aware of these sensitivities and Mr Tang was quick to tell the BBC that \"privacy was a red line\" for his company. Beijing also realises that this will be a challenge in its bid to be a global leader in AI.\n\"DeepSeek's rapid rise has triggered hostile reactions from some in the West,\" a commentary in the state-run Beijing Daily noted, adding that \"the development environment for China's AI models remains highly uncertain\".\nBut China's AI firms are not deterred. Rather, they believe thrifty innovation will win them an undeniable advantage \u2013 because it was DeepSeek's claim that it could rival ChatGPT for a fraction of the cost that shocked the AI industry.\nSo the engineering challenge is how to make more, for less. \"This was our Mission Impossible,\" Mr Tang said. His company found that the robotic arm used to move chess pieces was hugely expensive to produce and would drive the price up to around $40,000.\nSo, they tried using AI to help do the work of engineers and enhance the manufacturing process. Mr Tang claims that has driven the cost down to $1,000.\n\"This is innovation,\" he says. \"Artificial engineering is now integrated into the manufacturing process.\"\nThis could have enormous implications as China applies AI on a vast scale. State media already show factories full of humanoid robots. In January, the government said that it would promote the development of AI-powered humanoid robots to help look after its rapidly ageing population.\nXi has repeatedly declared \"technological self-reliance\" a key goal, which means China wants to create its own advanced chips, to make up for US export restrictions that could hinder its plans.\nThe Chinese leader knows he is in for a long race \u2013 the Beijing Daily recently warned that the DeepSeek moment was not a time for \"AI triumphalism\" because China was still in \"catch-up mode\".\nPresident Xi is investing heavily in artificial intelligence, robots and advanced tech in preparation for a marathon that he hopes China will eventually win.",

        "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d69c/live/a0436320-fd95-11ef-896e-d7e7fb1719a4.jpg",
        "article_text": "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, will be Canada's next prime minister, at least for now. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.\nMark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.\nHe had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.\nBut unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States. \nBut holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect it to be called as early as this month.\nAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working for Goldman Sachs in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.\nThe son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University. \nIn 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.\nIn 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.\nAlthough central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. \nThat move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.\nIn his time at the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, he oversaw considerable changes in how the institution worked. At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority.\nHe is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.\nIn 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.\nInterest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.\nConfusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a monicker which stuck around long after the original controversy died down.\nUnlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.\nIn 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.\nBefore the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.\nIn the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.\nHe described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.\nThe Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.\nHis final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\". \n\nCarney's time at the bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.\nFrom 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.\nHe was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.\nHe is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\nHis political ambitions have been rumoured for years, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.\n\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.\nThings changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.\nReports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.\nFreeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.\n\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\" \nStill, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. \nThe Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.\nThey have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament. \nHis team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.",

        "summary": "He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Getty ImagesJerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve (left) and Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England, walk the grounds during the Jackson Hole economic symposium in 2019Carney's time at the bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.He is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. How Britain's former top banker became Canada's next prime minister2 days agoShareSaveBen King and Robin Levinson KingBBC NewsReporting fromLondon, UK and Toronto, CanadaShareSaveWatch: Key moments on Mark Carney\u2019s journey from banker to Canada's PMThe former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, will be Canada's next prime minister, at least for now. In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority.He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a monicker which stuck around long after the original controversy died down.Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",

        "article_text": "Gurpreet Singh was handcuffed, his legs shackled and a chain tied around his waist. He was led on to the tarmac in Texas by US Border Patrol, towards a waiting C-17 military transport aircraft.\nIt was 3 February and, after a months-long journey, he realised his dream of living in America was over. He was being deported back to India. \"It felt like the ground was slipping away from underneath my feet,\" he said.\nGurpreet, 39, was one of thousands of Indians in recent years to have spent their life savings and crossed continents to enter the US illegally through its southern border, as they sought to escape an unemployment crisis back home.\nThere are about 725,000 undocumented Indian immigrants in the US, the third largest group behind Mexicans and El Salvadoreans, according to the most recent figures from Pew Research in 2022.\nNow Gurpreet has become one of the first undocumented Indians to be sent home since President Donald Trump took office, with a promise to make mass deportations a priority.\nGurpreet intended to make an asylum claim based on threats he said he had received in India, but - in line with an executive order from Trump to turn people away without granting them asylum hearings - he said he was removed without his case ever being considered.\nAbout 3,700 Indians were sent back on charter and commercial flights during President Biden's tenure, but recent images of detainees in chains under the Trump administration have sparked outrage in India.\nUS Border Patrol released the images in an online video with a bombastic choral soundtrack and the warning: \"If you cross illegally, you will be removed.\"\n\"We sat in handcuffs and shackles for more than 40 hours. Even women were bound the same way. Only the children were free,\" Gurpreet told the BBC back in India. \"We weren't allowed to stand up. If we wanted to use the toilet, we were escorted by US forces, and just one of our handcuffs was taken off.\"\nOpposition parties protested in parliament, saying Indian deportees were given \"inhuman and degrading treatment\". \"There's a lot of talk about how Prime Minister Modi and Mr Trump are good friends. Then why did Mr Modi allow this?\" said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, a key opposition leader.\nGurpreet said: \"The Indian government should have said something on our behalf. They should have told the US to carry out the deportation the way it's been done before, without the handcuffs and chains.\"\nAn Indian foreign ministry spokesman said the government had raised these concerns with the US, and that as a result, on subsequent flights, women deportees were not handcuffed and shackled.\nBut on the ground, the intimidating images and President Trump's rhetoric seem to be having the desired effect, at least in the immediate aftermath.\n\"No-one will try going to the US now through this illegal 'donkey' route while Trump is in power,\" said Gurpreet.\nIn the longer term, this could depend on whether there are continued deportations, but for now many of the Indian people-smugglers, locally called \"agents\", have gone into hiding, fearing raids against them by Indian police. \nGurpreet said Indian authorities demanded the number of the agent he had used when he landed back home, but the smuggler could no longer be reached.\n\"I don't blame them, though. We were thirsty and went to the well. They didn't come to us,\" said Gurpreet.\nWhile the official headline figure puts the unemployment rate at only 3.2%, it conceals a more precarious picture for many Indians. Only 22% of workers have regular salaries, the majority are self-employed and nearly a fifth are \"unpaid helpers\", including women working in family businesses.\n\"We leave India only because we are compelled to. If I got a job which paid me even 30,000 rupees (\u00a3270/$340) a month, my family would get by. I would never have thought of leaving,\" said Gurpreet, who has a wife, a mother and an 18-month-old baby to look after.\n\"You can say whatever you want about the economy on paper, but you need to see the reality on the ground. There are no opportunities here for us to work or run a business.\"\n\nGupreet's trucking company was among the cash-dependent small businesses that were badly hit when the Indian government withdrew 86% of the currency in circulation with four hours notice. He said he didn't get paid by his clients, and had no money to keep the business afloat. Another small business he set up, managing logistics for other companies, also failed because of the Covid lockdown, he said.\nHe said he tried to get visas to go to Canada and the UK, but his applications were rejected.\nThen he took all his savings, sold a plot of land he owned, and borrowed money from relatives to put together 4 million rupees ($45,000/\u00a336,000) to pay a smuggler to organise his journey, Gurpreet told us.\nOn 28 August 2024, he flew from India to Guyana in South America to start an arduous journey to the US.\nGurpreet pointed out all the stops he made on a map on his phone. From Guyana he travelled through Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, mostly by buses and cars, partly by boat, and briefly on a plane - handed from one people-smuggler to another, detained and released by authorities a few times along the way.\nFrom Colombia, smugglers tried to get him a flight to Mexico, so he could avoid crossing the dreaded Dari\u00e9n Gap. But Colombian immigration didn't allow him to board the flight, so he had to make a dangerous trek through the jungle.\nA dense expanse of rainforest between Colombia and Panama, the Dari\u00e9n Gap can only be crossed on foot, risking accidents, disease and attacks by criminal gangs. Last year, 50 people died making the crossing.\n\"I was not scared. I've been a sportsman so I thought I would be OK. But it was the toughest section,\" said Gurpreet. \"We walked for five days through jungles and rivers. In many parts, while wading through the river, the water came up to my chest.\"\nEach group was accompanied by a smuggler - or a \"donker\" as Gurpreet and other migrants refer to them, a word seemingly derived from the term \"donkey route\" used for illegal migration journeys.\nAt night they would pitch tents in the jungle, eat a bit of food they were carrying and try to rest.\n\"It was raining all the days we were there. We were drenched to our bones,\" he said. They were guided over three mountains in their first two days. After that, he said they had to follow a route marked out in blue plastic bags tied to trees by the smugglers.\n\"My feet had begun to feel like lead. My toenails were cracked, and the palms of my hands were peeled off and had thorns in them. Still, we were lucky we didn't encounter any robbers.\"\nWhen they reached Panama, Gurpreet said he and about 150 others were detained by border officials in a cramped jail-like centre. After 20 days, they were released, he said, and from there it took him more than a month to reach Mexico, passing through Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala.\nGurpreet said they waited for nearly a month in Mexico until there was an opportunity to cross the border into the US near San Diego.\n\"We didn't scale a wall. There is a mountain near it which we climbed over. And there's a razor wire which the donker cut through,\" he said.\nGurpreet entered the US on 15 January, five days before President Trump took office - believing that he had made it just in time, before the borders became impenetrable and rules became tighter.\nOnce in San Diego, he surrendered to US Border Patrol, and was then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). \nDuring the Biden administration, illegal or undocumented migrants would appear before an immigration officer who would do a preliminary interview to determine if each person had a case for asylum. While a majority of Indians migrated out of economic necessity, some also left fearing persecution because of their religious or social backgrounds, or their sexual orientation.\nIf they cleared the interview, they were released, pending a decision on granting asylum from an immigration judge. The process would often take years, but they were allowed to remain in the US in the meantime. \nThis is what Gurpreet thought would happen to him. He had planned to find work at a grocery store and then to get into trucking, a business he is familiar with.\nInstead, less than three weeks after he entered the US, he found himself being led towards that C-17 plane and going back to where he started.\nIn their small house in Sultanpur Lodhi, a city in the northern state of Punjab, Gurpreet is now trying to find work to repay the money he owes, and fend for his family.\nAdditional reporting by Aakriti Thapar",

        "article_text": "The family of an Indian man who was shot dead while illegally crossing into Israel say he was a victim of a job scam.\nThomas Gabriel Perera was killed by Jordanian security forces by the border with Israel on 10 February.\nHe was lured to Jordan by the promise of a lucrative job, and when it did not materialise he tried to enter Israel as he was told he could find work there, his family told the BBC. \nReports of Indians falling for employment scams and illegally entering other countries to look for work have become increasingly common.\nPerera, 47, had been accompanied by his brother-in-law Edison Charlas, who was injured in the incident. Mr Charlas was treated in hospital and spent a fortnight in prison before he was repatriated to India.\nThe two men were from the southern Indian state of Kerala where they worked as auto-rickshaw drivers.\nAn agent had promised them they could get blue-collar jobs in Jordan earning 350,000 rupees ($4,000; \u00a33,110) a month.\nMr Charlas told the BBC he paid 210,000 rupees to an agent before they left India, and paid an additional $600 after reaching Jordan on a tourist visa.\nBut when the two men arrived in Jordan's capital city Amman in early February, they were told by the agent that there were no jobs available. \nThe agent then suggested they should try illegally crossing into Israel, claiming there were plenty of opportunities there.\nOn 10 February, Mr Charlas and Perera joined a group that drove for hours to Jordan's border with Israel.\n\"We were taken in a car. It was a long distance. We got into the car at 2pm and reached the location only around midnight. Then we were made to walk several kilometres along a coastline. It was while walking in the dark that we were shot,'' said Mr Charlas.\nThe BBC has seen a letter sent to Perera's family by the Indian embassy in Jordan. It states that \"security forces tried to stop them but they did not listen to the warning, the guards opened fire on them\".\n\"One bullet hit Mr Thomas [Perera] in his head and he passed away on the spot.''\nMr Charlas, however, disputed this account and said there was \"no such warning (from the guards). They just shot.''\n\"I was walking slowly behind the others in the dark... That was when the bullet hit me and I lost consciousness. I had no clue what happened to Thomas,'' he said.\nThe BBC has asked India's foreign ministry and Jordanian authorities for comment on Mr Charlas' allegation.\nMr Charlas said he was later taken to a hospital for treatment and then moved between several Jordanian government offices before being transferred to prison, where he was kept for 18 days.\nWhile in prison, he managed to contact his wife and told her what had happened, and his wife contacted Indian embassy officials.\nMr Charlas was deported to India on 28 February. \nPerera's body is still in Jordan. In response to BBC queries, India's foreign ministry said they were working to bring the body back to India as soon as possible.\n\"I am told that it will take one or two days for the process of documentation and other things to be completed,\" said Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for the foreign ministry.\nOn Monday, Shashi Tharoor, the member of parliament representing Perera's constituency Thiruvananthapuram, said that members of the Indian embassy in Jordan had verified the victim's identity and that the process of transportation of the body had begun. \nDespite numerous government warnings, many Indians are still falling prey to job scams and taking the risk of entering countries illegally to find work, say observers.\n\"The modus operandi is to get a tourist visa for one country and then enter the neighbouring country,\" said Ajith Kolassery, the CEO of Norka, the Kerala government's department overseeing migration.\n\"No country will accept illegal entry. We have been consistently issuing advisories to people to be wary of job rackets, but they are still going.\"\nIn recent years hundreds of Indians have been rescued from scam centres in Cambodia and other parts of South East Asia. They were trafficked to the centres after they were lured overseas by promises of good jobs. \nScores of Indian nationals were also tricked into fighting for Russia in the war with Ukraine after they were offered fake jobs and opportunities to study abroad.\nThe 100 Indians who were deported from the US last month after being accused of entering the country illegally had also been lured by the hope of a better life, pointed out Irudaya Rajan, who chairs the International Institute of Migration and Development in Thiruvananthapuram.\n\"They also paid money to agents and were cheated. It's the struggle to get better wages [that is driving this],\" he said.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

There's no heroes at training.\n\"I've taken a few so you build up a bit of belief that if it's in that area, you have a chance. \n\"I've dropped plenty of them as well but, ultimately, if you push yourself to the limit, you're going to find where it is.\"\nIndia beat New Zealand in the group stage of the Champions Trophy but one of the highlights of the match was Phillips' catch to dismiss Virat Kohli\nWhen you sit with Phillips his attributes are obvious. \nBulging forearms, broad shoulders, huge thighs and a stocky frame all help him cover ground at speed, throw and leap from a low centre of gravity. He has also spoken about embracing being diagnosed with ADHD. \nBut Phillips, who was born in South Africa before moving to New Zealand with his family aged five, is not happy to settle with what he has been given physically. \nThe 28-year-old is a studier of the mechanics of fielding. He watches the NFL and, in particular, baseball for theories of how he can push those limits.\nHe practises throwing with his non-dominant left arm and tests different ways to collect the ball in the field, like picking up with his left hand and throwing with his right and vice versa to maintain momentum through the ball.\n\"In baseball, it's significantly quicker to pick it up on the move on your mitt side, carry on through the ball and then throw,\" Phillips says. \n\"Obviously that provides a lot of momentum and power. That becomes slightly difficult when you've got bare hands.\n\"I'm yet to find out whether there is actually a difference in it. I've used it in a game a couple of times and it's felt really cool.\"\nThose that know Phillips describe him as one of those people that is good at everything. \nElectric in the field, he is also a hard-hitting batter, bowls canny off-spin and has even been wicketkeeper at international level, something he has now stopped because \"there was no ability to move, no running, no diving and no ability to do something special unless the ball comes your way in your one specific spot\".\nPhillips has also taken up archery, which he believes helps his cricket.\n\"The element that I've taken out of that is being more process driven,\" he says.\n\"Obviously, baseball, I've seen the fielding element of it. Golf, the real patience side of things. \n\"But then archery is a real process-driven sport where if you focus on trying to hit the target, it often doesn't really work. \n\"If you focus on doing the things that you can do well, that being the process, the end result takes care of itself.\"\nPhillips believes New Zealand's fielding gives them \"an edge in big tournaments\" - they have reached a fourth men's white-ball final since 2015 here - but is also able to see the big picture when showing off his art.\n\"If it's a little thing I can do to give back to the cricket community and inspire the next generation to enjoy fielding rather than wanting to just sit on the sidelines and just bat and bowl, I think that's something that I'd be really happy to come out of this game with one day,\" Phillips says.\nPhillips hopes to be flying the skies after retirement. Perhaps others will follow his lead on the field.",

This can sometimes involve gene editing to tweak the food's properties. The claimed benefits are that they are better for the environment and potentially healthier.\nThe government is keen for lab-grown food firms to thrive because it hopes they can create new jobs and economic growth. \nThe UK is good at the science, but the current approvals process is much slower than in other countries. Singapore, the US and Israel in particular have faster procedures.\nIvy Farm Technologies in Oxford is ready to go with lab-grown steaks, made from cells taken from Wagyu and Aberdeen Angus cows.\nThe firm applied for approval to sell its steaks to restaurants at the beginning of last year. Ivy Farm's CEO, Dr Harsh Amin, explained that two years was a very long time to wait.\n\"If we can shorten that to less than a year, while maintaining the very highest of Britain's food safety standards, that would help start-up companies like ours to thrive.\"\nDr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial College, London's Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar. It involves introducing a gene found in a berry into yeast. This process enables her to produce large amounts of the crystals that make it taste sweet. \nIt doesn't make you fat, she says, and so is a potential sweetener and healthy substitute in fizzy drinks.\nIn this case I am allowed to taste it. It was incredibly sweet and slightly sour and fruity, reminding me of lemon sherbet. But Dr Graham's firm, MadeSweetly, is not allowed to sell it until it gets approval.\n\"The path to getting approval is not straightforward,\" she tells me. \n\"They are all new technologies, which are not easy for the regulator to keep up with. But that means that we don't have one specific route to product approval, and that is what we would like.\"\nThe FSA says it will complete a full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the next two years and have the beginnings of a faster and better system for applications for approvals of new lab-grown foods. \nProf May of the FSA says the purpose of working with experts from the companies involved as well as academics is to get the science right.\n\"It can be quite complex, and it is critical that we understand the science to make sure the foods are safe before authorising them.\"\nBut Ms Thomas says that these high-tech foods may not be as environmentally friendly as they are made out to be as it takes energy to make them and that in some cases their health benefits are being oversold.\n\"Lab-grown foods are ultimately ultra-processed foods and we are in an era where we are trying to get people to eat fewer ultra-processed foods because they have health implications,\" he said.\n\"And it is worth saying that these ultra-processed foods have not been in the human diet before.\"\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

The government says it is aware of the harm caused by chemsex and has issued guidance to local authorities on managing the issue.\nChris was initially offered drugs at a party, but it was not until a few months later that he then began to actively seek it out more and find people who were taking drugs.\nHe said at first it took away \"a lot of the shame and guilt you have about growing up being gay. It's kind of quite liberating\".\nHowever, that quickly changed.\n\"No-one really speaks about it. Everyone is slightly ashamed about it. It's all behind closed doors. It doesn't really spill out into the real world. It's very secretive,\" he said.\nChris said his friends told him he was almost like a \"zombie\".\n\"Slowly, your life starts to deteriorate because you are missing work on a Monday. And then your work is obviously not up to standard. \n\"You can't do much until Wednesday. And then it all starts again on a Friday,\" he said.\n\"You have to eat, you have to sleep, you have to get on with your life but all you're really doing is looking forward to the next time you can take drugs,\" he added.\n\"Which is to escape the horror that is your life, the misery that is your life which you've created but, in a way, you don't seem to see that because all you want to do is take drugs.\"\nCampaigners have said chemsex among some gay men has a stigma attached that meant many were not seeking the help they needed.\nIgnacio Labayen De Inza, chief executive of the London-based charity Controlling Chemsex, is calling for people to start a conversation around chemsex to help change that stigma.\nHe said: \"Chemsex is very available but not everyone has access to reliable information.\n\"Not just the government but no-one is doing very much. People think there is nothing we can do because it's going to carry on happening, but people could make sure that they set boundaries and to keep safe.\"\nHe said there was a stigma attached to it because \"we are talking about sex, we are talking about gay sex, we are talking about drugs\".\nPhilip Hurd, a specialist adviser at Controlling Chemsex, was involved in chemsex 12 years ago and said it took a near-death overdose for him to realise he needed to stop.\nHe said: \"You get close to the criminal justice system, and you start doing things that are dangerous.\n\"And then I had a near-death overdose. The doctors said I was very lucky to survive, and I had to get my parents down from the country in their early eighties. That was the point I thought I can't do this; I'm going to die.\"\nMr Hurd, who lives in London and now volunteers at Controlling Chemsex, uses his personal experience to help others.\n\"I think it's possible for a person with good psychology, sociology skills to support somebody coming out of chemsex but nothing can replace having been there knowing,\" he said.\nAn Opinium Research poll of 2,000 people for the charity found that 76% of those surveyed were not familiar with chemsex.\nJust over a third of those who identified as gay/lesbian were not familiar with the risks of chemsex, the study also found.\nVeronika Carruthers, a lecturer at Portsmouth University, has been looking into the current support available across the south of England and found it was still \"pretty limited\" and \"patchy\".\n\"We consider this to be a bit of a postcode lottery,\" she said.\nShe explained that some people did not know the right services to turn to.\n\"Particularly if we look at it from a divide of drug counselling services and sexual health clinics, while sexual health clinics are preferred there is still an element of staff not having the appropriate knowledge of what chemsex actually is and in turn not being able to provide the most effect support,\" she said.\n\"In regards to drug counselling services, quite often we have recovery workers who have never actually heard of chemsex and therefore they're not able to provide any form of support and individuals often don't feel that is the most appropriate place for them.\n\"As a result people don't want to call for help or support from particular organisations over others.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said in addition to issuing guidance to local authorities, it had boosted the Public Health Grant by almost \u00a3200m. \n\"Local authorities can use this to improve drug and alcohol treatment and recovery interventions, including for people involved in chemsex,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"We continue to work with substance misuse commissioners and sexual health commissioners to improve access to support services for those who use drugs in this context.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

They are all in Grimsby and are likely to be repatriated in due course.\nPolice said they had begun a criminal investigation into the cause of the collision and was working with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.\nThe Marine Accident Investigation Branch was also undertaking a parallel preliminary assessment to establish the causes of the crash, police said.\nHM Coastguard confirmed 36 people had been taken safely to shore.\nDet Ch Supt Craig Nicholson said: \"Humberside Police have taken primacy for the investigation of any potential criminal offences which arise from the collision between the two vessels.\"\nHe said the arrested man was in custody.\n\"Following inquiries undertaken by my team, we have arrested a 59-year-old man on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the collision.\n\"This follows the conclusion of search operations by HM Coastguard for the missing crew member of the Solong.\n\"Our thoughts are with the family of the missing crew member, and I have appointed family liaison officers to make contact and provide support to the family.\"\nSmoke is continuing to billow from Solong.\nThe ship's German owner, Ernst Russ, said it was supporting the missing crew member's family. \nIt also confirmed there were no containers on board carrying sodium cyanide, as had been initially feared.\n\"There are four empty containers that have previously contained the hazardous chemical and these containers will continue to be monitored,\" the firm said.\nCrowley, the maritime company managing Stena Immaculate, said the vessel was struck by Solong while anchored off the coast of Hull, causing \"multiple explosions\" on board and an unknown quantity of jet fuel to be released.\nThe firm said Stena Immaculate was carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel in 16 segregated cargo tanks, at least one of which was ruptured when it was struck.\nGraham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, said officials had told him there was no evidence so far of any of the heavy engine oil leaking from either ship, or pollution in the water or the air.\nEarlier, Kane told the House of Commons the \"working assumption\" was that one crew member from the cargo ship had died.\nAlexander said she had met with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and been informed that early indications suggest both vessels are now expected to stay afloat.\nShe added Solong could be \"towed away from the shore, and salvage operations can get under way\".\nStena Immaculate was operating as part of the US government's tanker security programme, a group of commercial vessels that can be contracted to carry fuel for the military when needed, according to Crowley.\nIt had been anchored while waiting for a berth to become available at the Port of Killingholme on the River Humber, the company said.\nAdditional reporting by Stuart Harratt and Kevin Shoesmith.",

German firm Ernst Russ, which owns the Solong, confirmed to the BBC that the man arrested is the master of the ship.It said he, along with the rest of the crew, were assisting the investigation.A crew member from the cargo ship was still missing and presumed dead after a search and rescue operation ended on Monday evening, according to Transport Minister Mike Kane.Whitehall sources have told the BBC there were Russians and Filipinos among the crew of the Solong.The BBC understands all 23 crew on board the Stena Immaculate are Americans. \"There are four empty containers that have previously contained the hazardous chemical and these containers will continue to be monitored,\" the firm said.Crowley, the maritime company managing Stena Immaculate, said the vessel was struck by Solong while anchored off the coast of Hull, causing \"multiple explosions\" on board and an unknown quantity of jet fuel to be released.The firm said Stena Immaculate was carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel in 16 segregated cargo tanks, at least one of which was ruptured when it was struck.Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, said officials had told him there was no evidence so far of any of the heavy engine oil leaking from either ship, or pollution in the water or the air.PA MediaTug boats shadow the Solong container ship as it drifts in the Humber Estuary while alightEarlier, Kane told the House of Commons the \"working assumption\" was that one crew member from the cargo ship had died.Alexander said she had met with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and been informed that early indications suggest both vessels are now expected to stay afloat.She added Solong could be \"towed away from the shore, and salvage operations can get under way\".Stena Immaculate was operating as part of the US government's tanker security programme, a group of commercial vessels that can be contracted to carry fuel for the military when needed, according to Crowley.It had been anchored while waiting for a berth to become available at the Port of Killingholme on the River Humber, the company said.Additional reporting by Stuart Harratt and Kevin Shoesmith.Humberside Police \"Watch: Aerial images show extent of damage to a North Sea oil tankerSmoke is continuing to billow from Solong.The ship's German owner, Ernst Russ, said it was supporting the missing crew member's family.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'Arriving in red will be cool' - Hamilton's Melbourne excitment\nLewis Hamilton's move to Ferrari is the single biggest storyline of the 2025 Formula 1 season.\nThe sport's biggest star - the only driver who truly transcends the sport - has joined its most iconic team, and interest in how their partnership develops is stratospheric.\nThese are the key questions as Hamilton begins his new adventure.\nHamilton signed with Ferrari in January 2024, just over six months after sealing a new contract with Mercedes.\nIt was the talks over that new Mercedes deal that led to the Ferrari move.\nMercedes wanted to offer Hamilton only a one-year contract - team boss Toto Wolff was planning for the future. The seven-time world champion knew he wanted to stay in F1 longer.\nThey compromised on what is known as a \"one-plus-one\" contract - a firm deal for 2024 with an option for 2025.\nBut Mercedes' reticence to commit to him led Hamilton to consider his future. He had always had a hankering after driving for Ferrari and he has a close relationship with their team boss Frederic Vasseur, which dates back 20 years to their time in the junior categories together.\nHamilton's single biggest ambition is to win the record eighth title of which he feels he was robbed by race director Michael Masi making up the rules and mishandling a late safety-car period in the 2021 title decider in Abu Dhabi.\nMercedes had not furnished him with a car in which he could do that since, so he had plenty of doubts on that front, too.\nHamilton approached Ferrari and the team were keen to do a deal. So when they offered him a longer contract - at least to the end of 2026 - and a close to 50% pay rise to a reputed salary of 65m euros (\u00a355m), it was a no-brainer.\nThe fact that Ferrari had finished 2023 in stronger shape than Mercedes made the decision even easier.\nIn 2024, Hamilton was comprehensively out-qualified by a team-mate for the first time in his career, ending the season 19-5 down to George Russell in their one-lap head-to-head, at an average deficit of 0.171 seconds.\nAlthough both won two races, Hamilton finished 22 points adrift in the championship.\nIt was a confusing situation, because in 2022 and 2023, the two had been closely matched in qualifying, and one of them finished ahead in the championship one year and the other the other.\nThe bottom line is that Hamilton struggled with the characteristics of the 2024 Mercedes more than Russell.\nThe car had slow-corner understeer. The way to counteract this was to slide the rear on entry to promote turn-in. But doing that generates rear tyre temperature, which reduces grip, a problem that increases over time. Hamilton was less able to deal with this than Russell.\nOn top of this, there is no question that, frustrated by his qualifying deficit, Hamilton would sometimes push too hard when it mattered right at the end of qualifying. That led to mistakes, which further harmed his performance.\nThe Mercedes engineers felt that there was something about the general characteristics of the current generation of cars and their ground-effect design philosophy that does not marry as well with Hamilton's style as the previous generations of cars.\nBut just because that was the case last year does not mean it will be the same this year at Ferrari. It may depend on how the car behaves.\nEqually, it's impossible to know how much of an effect psychology had - Hamilton had to do a whole year with Mercedes, the longest season in history, knowing he was leaving at the end of the season, and with his heart effectively already elsewhere.\nCertainly Vasseur believes that is too important to ignore. And Hamilton is of the same opinion.\nHamilton turned 40 in January and is the second oldest driver in F1.\nOf course, athletic performance declines over time, but Fernando Alonso - who is three and a half years older than Hamilton - insists his age is not a problem, and there is no evidence in his case that it is.\nAlonso is still performing at an extremely high level, and produced some outstanding drives last year - as he did in 2023, when again he was older than Hamilton is now.\nThere is no evidence or reason to suggest Hamilton's age will have a deleterious effect on him.\nLewis Hamilton was sixth fastest on the final day of pre-season testing in Bahrain at the end of February\nHamilton does not speak Italian. He is trying to learn, but it is unlikely the fact he cannot speak the language will have a serious effect on him.\nFor a start, all technical debriefs in Ferrari are conducted in English. Vasseur also does not speak Italian.\nMichael Schumacher could not speak Italian - and he won five world titles with Ferrari and is their most successful driver. Neither could Nigel Mansell. He won on his debut with Ferrari, at the 1989 Brazilian Grand Prix. He became a folk hero in his two years with the team and is still idolised as 'Il Leone' (the Lion) now.\nVasseur says: \"You know that 99% of the job is in English. It's good to speak a little bit of Italian for the mechanics and the relationship in the team but I am not sure it is crucial for the performance.\"\nCharles Leclerc finished third in the 2024 drivers' championship on 356 points. Hamiton was seventh with 223\nHamilton's partner/rival in the other Ferrari is Charles Leclerc, a 27-year-old from Monaco who has won eight grands prix and set 26 pole positions since joining the team in 2019.\nLeclerc is a Ferrari protege - he has been nurtured by the team since he was a teenager. He is richly talented and regarded as possibly the fastest driver over one lap in F1 at the moment, and his career statistics back that up.\nLeclerc does not have such a big offset between his qualifying and race success stats because he is bad at racing. He has it because his ability and raw speed has often meant he has qualified the car higher than its competitive level can sustain over a race distance.\nHamilton is also a brilliant qualifier - he holds the all-time record for pole positions. And in many ways the two drivers are very similar. Both of them have an ability to produce 'wow' performances in qualifying - laps that leave people open-mouthed, thinking, 'where did that come from?'\nHamilton might have to accept that there is a strong chance he will be out-qualified by Leclerc over the season. But he will be confident that what he probably considers his greater race-craft and experience will see him through over a season.\nHe says: \"Charles is very professional, very embedded in this team. He is very fast and I am completely aware of that. You have seen his qualifying laps.\n\"I told him in Bahrain many years ago (in 2019) he had a bright future ahead of him.  It is not going to be easy to beat him. Especially in his home. But we will work together and have some great races, I hope.\"\nHamilton cannot control whether Ferrari build him a competitive car. And if they don't, the minimum that could be considered success would be to come out on top against Leclerc.\nBut Hamilton has not gone to Ferrari to score a few podium finishes. He wants an eighth world title. He's confident he and the team can do it. And given his level of career success, and Ferrari's history in F1, nothing less than a championship will suffice.\nHe says: \"This team already has an insane legacy and are not short of championships they have won. They have a winning mentality in their DNA.\n\"The competition is fierce. It is going to be close. but I have a great team-mate, the energy I have seen from the team, there is magic here.\n\"It is going to take a lot of hard work and everyone is putting that in. But it is also about belief. Everyone in this team dreams of winning with Ferrari.\n\"I have worked with two title-winning teams before,  I know what one looks and feels like. The passion is like nothing you have ever seen. They have got everything they need to win a championship. It is just about putting the pieces together.\"\nHow to follow Australian Grand Prix on the BBC\nWhat is at stake at under-pressure Red Bull?\n'I know my time will come' - Russell exclusive\nWho are the rookies joining the F1 grid in 2025? \nWho will win F1 drivers' title?

The industry is less well protected with fewer mechanisms in place to stop them laundering the funds.Recent hacks linked to North Korea include:The 2019 hack on UpBit for $41mThe $275m theft of crypto from exchange KuCoin (most of the funds were recovered)The 2022 Ronin Bridge attack which saw hackers make off with $600m in cryptoApproximately $100m in crypto was stolen in an attack on Atomic Wallet in 2023In 2020, the US added North Koreans accused of being part of the Lazarus Group to its Cyber Most Wanted list.",

        "article_text": "Mark Carney's elevation to the top job in Canada is of particular significance at this moment when his country is at the frontline of a North American trade war. He becomes the \"anti-Trump\" on the US president's doorstep.\nThe former Bank of England governor chose to lean strongly into resisting Donald Trump's policies at his acceptance speech. He said the US president had brought \"dark days\" from \"a country we can no longer trust\" and that he was \"proud\" of Canadians resisting the US \"with their wallets\".\nWhile on trade specifically Mr Carney vowed to keep the retaliatory tariffs \"until Americans show us respect\", it was clear that the general threats against Canadian sovereignty are equally as important in his thinking. \nTrump has repeatedly said he will use economic power to encourage Canada to become the 51st state of the US, but Carney hit back. \"The Americans want our resources, our land, our water, our country\u2026 Canada will never be part of America in any way, shape or form,\" he said.\nBehind the scenes, Carney has been encouraging a very robust response to Mr Trump. As he told me last month in his only UK interview during his campaign to succeed current Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, it was necessary to \"stand up to a bully\". \nHe ridiculed Trump's allegations of Canada's involvement in fentanyl trade, and the US president's suggestion that Canada has ripped off the US. Canada's trade deficit is caused \"entirely\" by its exports of subsidised oil, Carney told me, and \"perhaps we should ask for that subsidy back\".\nHe follows in the footsteps of former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi as a former top central banker who became a G7 leader. It is an otherwise rare path, but it may be good timing when Canada's nearest neighbour has suggested using economic power to take over.\nCarney has experience in this area having dealt with a number of acute political-economic crises, such as the banking crash, the eurozone crisis, sterling's sharp slide after Brexit, and the start of the pandemic. \nHe has also regularly attended G20 meetings at leader level, including in the presence of Trump, as chair of the Financial Stability Board, an international economic body. At one such meeting, the Trump team threatened to leave the International Monetary Fund. \nCarney believes that Trump only respects power. Of any attempt to mollify Trump, he said \"good luck with that\". He will focus further tariff retaliation on bringing inflation and interest rate rises to Canada's \"southern neighbour\".\nThe Canadian election is due by October, but Carney might call an earlier one. Depending on that, he is on course to host Trump in Canada at the G7 Summit in June.\nHis rise to the top job raises the stakes for the UK. On the one hand, a more robust approach from an allied G7 leader stands in contrast to the UK's attempt to hug the White House closely.  \nOn the other hand, Carney also hinted at wanting to diversify trade towards \"more reliable\" partners, which would include the UK and EU. Canada might send its subsidised energy to Europe, rather than the US.\nThe bigger strategic point is that Carney's background means a focus on international solidarity, and defence of the existing multilateral system.

        "article_text": "The Los Angeles District Attorney has announced his opposition to the resentencing of the notorious Menendez brothers, a move that could have paved the way for their freedom.\nDistrict Attorney Nathan Hochman's decision marks a departure from his predecessor who had sought to have the brothers resentenced and considered for parole. Both brothers are serving life sentences. \nLyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted of killing their parents in 1989, have long maintained that the murders were driven by years of sexual and physical abuse, rather than financial gain.\nHochman argued that the brothers' claims of self-defence was part of a litany of \"lies\".\nA California judge is set to consider the option of resentencing the brothers on 20 and 21 March.\nSpeaking at a news conference on Monday, Hochman outlined much of the criminal case, the defences the brothers had taken and the alleged lies he said they continued to stand by. \nHe said the brothers had not demonstrated true accountability, citing their continued insistence that the killings were an act of self-defence because they believed their parents were planning to kill them. \n\"They have not shown full insight into their crimes,\" Hochman said, adding that their self-defence claim was \"fabricated.\"\nHochman's predecessor, George Gasc\u00f3n, had pushed to reduce the Menendez brothers' sentences to 50 years to life, which would have made them immediately eligible for parole. \nOn Monday, newly elected District Attorney Hochman moved to rescind that request, arguing the brothers' meticulously planned the murders and attempted to cover up the crime. \nIn his court filing, Hochman presented detailed evidence of the brothers' planning of the murders, contrasting sharply with Gasc\u00f3n's stance. \nGasc\u00f3n, known for his progressive approach to criminal justice, had argued the brothers had been rehabilitated during their three decades behind bars\u2014earning college degrees and establishing prison programs to aid fellow inmates.\nHochman suggested the brothers' resentencing request could only be reconsidered if they fully admitted to fabricating their self-defence claims. He said the Menendez brothers had \"acknowledged\" only four of 20 alleged lies they told about the case.\nHe emphasised how they repeatedly changed their account of events\u2014initially denying involvement and suggesting their parents were victims of a Mafia hit. The truth about their culpability emerged after Erik Menendez confessed to his therapist, whose recorded session was later handed over to law enforcement.\n\"They convinced, not just the media, not just the police, but their family and their friends that they were 100% innocent of these crimes, until eventually these tapes came out,\" Hochman said.\nThe resentencing bid is one of three avenues the Menendez brothers have been working on in hopes of gaining their freedom. \nThey've asked for a new trial but Hochman has said his office will oppose the request. \nThe brothers have also asked California Governor Gavin Newsom for clemency, which could mean a reduced sentence or even a pardon. \nNewsom has ordered the parole board to conduct a risk assessment to examine whether the brothers are a danger to society - one step in a broader process that could lead to clemency. \nMuch of the Menendez family has been pushing for the brothers to be released, holding news conferences, appearing at court hearings and meeting with prosecutors in the case. \nBut after meeting Hochman about the case, one family member accused the new district attorney of  a \"hostile, dismissive and patronizing tone\" in a complaint filed with the state's department of corrections and rehabilitation, US media reported. \nTamara Goodell, a cousin of the brothers, said in the complaint that Hochman violated her rights as a victim and accused him of having a bias against Erik and Lyle Menendez. \nAt least one member of the family has publicly come out against the bids for their freedom. \nA lawyer for Kitty Menendez's brother, Milton Andersen, has called the killings \"cold-blooded\" and said the murders \"shattered their family and left a trail of grief that has persisted for decades.\"\nMr Andersen has said he believes his nephews should stay in prison for their \"heinous act\", said the lawyer, Kathy Cady.",

        "article_text": "From Manchester to Reykjav\u00edk, innovative tours are highlighting forgotten stories and re-incorporating female legacies into the popular tourist narrative.\nA bouquet of white roses hangs from the bronze wrist of Emmeline Pankhurst. But her rallying stance \u2013 hand outstretched towards Manchester's former Free Trade Hall where she organised the first suffragette meetings that would change the course of British history \u2013 remains defiantly unchanged. Further bunches of white flowers, symbolising the purity of the women's suffrage movement and its fight for female political equality, have been tucked at her feet, wilting gently in the spring sunlight that filters through the city's skyscrapers. They are a reminder of the immense progress made in British women's rights since Pankhurst's early 20th-Century campaigns \u2013 and, perhaps, of how far there is left to go.\nManchester has long touted its association with the historic struggle for gender parity, yet the city's civic championing of the women who helped shape its progress is muted at best. When Pankhurst's bronze likeness (titled \"Rise Up, Women\") was unveiled in 2018, it became the first statue of a woman to be erected in a public space in the city since a monument of Queen Victoria was installed in Piccadilly Gardens in 1905. Even now, it is one of only four city-centre statues of named women, compared to 18 of men.\nBut a counter-revolution is quietly brewing. I'm visiting the Pankhurst statue as part of a new self-guided walking route, the Feminist Tour of Manchester, which explores little-known stories of its impactful women and historically marginalised LGBTQ+ figures.\nThough the suffragettes naturally feature, it emphasises those who never became household names: for example, Mary Fildes, a trailblazing 19th-Century birth control activist; and Enriqueta Rylands, who founded the Neo-Gothic masterpiece that is the John Rylands Library, becoming the first woman to receive honorary Freedom of the City of Manchester. There's a thought-provoking stop at the Peterloo Massacre Memorial (commemorating those who lost their lives in a peaceful working-class protest for parliamentary representation and universal suffrage that turned violent); while the neon jumble of Chinatown's alleyways provides the backdrop to the story of the author and campaigner Alicia Little, whose work highlighted \u2013 and eventually helped change \u2013 the poor status of women's rights in British marital law.\u00a0\n\"People have a feeling that there is feminist history in Manchester, but they can't pinpoint what it is,\" says Zakia Moulaoui Guery, founder of Invisible Cities, the social enterprise behind the tour, which launches this month. \"It's not too late to retrieve those stories or to have more of that representation.\"\nManchester isn't the only city where under-represented women are getting their moment in the spotlight. Across Europe, feminist walking tours that uncover \"forgotten\" stories that have often been preserved in letters and diaries or handed down through word of mouth are gaining popularity. Here are five more tours re-incorporating female legacies into the popular tourist narrative.\nIceland regularly ranks at the top of the World Economic Forum's gender gap index, yet the urban planning of its capital, Reykjav\u00edk, doesn't necessarily reflect its progressive values. \"We don't even have a statue up of the first female democratically elected president in the world \u2013 there's no statue of her anywhere in Reykjav\u00edk,\" says resident Tinna Eik Rakelard\u00f3ttir, referring to Iceland's former president Vigd\u00eds Finnbogad\u00f3ttir.\nInspired by a tour she took in Ljubljana, Eik Rakelard\u00f3ttir launched the Reykjav\u00edk Feminist Walking Tour, unpicking 200 years of the nation's drive for gender equality and providing context from her experience as a woman in contemporary Icelandic society. The scenic walk begins in the neighbourhood of M\u00e6\u00f0ragar\u00f0ur before moving downtown through the capital's manicured squares, concluding at the historic school Kvennsk\u00f3linn (Reykjav\u00edk Women's Gymnasium). Participants learn about Finnbogad\u00f3ttir \u2013 who happened to be Eik Rakelard\u00f3ttir's neighbour growing up \u2013 alongside lesser-known women and marginalised groups whose influence on gender progress she feels should be more publicly visible. After all, she concludes: \"We should know what methods they used and let those stories inspire us.\"\nFrench gender and science researcher Averil Huck first noticed an absence of female representation upon moving to Prague and taking walking tours around the Czech capital, where just 5% of street names honouring people reference women. She began conducting her own research and launched Prague Feminist Tours in summer 2023. Her popular tour To the Roots of Czech Women's Emancipation leads participants through the city's spellbinding historic streets, taking in fabled landmarks such as the Charles Bridge, National Theatre and Old Town Square, while regaling them with the tales of those who fought for access to education, careers and voting rights in the 19th and early 20th Centuries.\nShe has since launched three additional tours, including one held around the festival of Du\u0161i\u010dky (All Souls' Day) on 2 November, which takes place in the city's Ol\u0161any Cemeteries and pays tribute to nine of its most important female historical and cultural figures. \"We stop in front of their graves and light a little candle or leave a flower and I tell the stories of these people,\" says Huck. \"I like to do it in the fall because this cemetery is really overgrown with nature and the colours become beautiful.\"\nCriminals such as Jack the Ripper brought gritty infamy to the streets of London's East End in the 19th Century, yet the neighbourhood has also been home to scores of influential women \u2013 notably Mary Wollstonecraft, the writer and philosopher often dubbed Britain's first feminist; or prominent textile designer Anna Maria Garthwaite. Women of London, a tour company founded by Becky Laxton-Bass, spotlights both figures and countless other women who inhabited the vibrant neighbourhood from the 1660s through to the 1940s, analysing how they lived and highlighting the social issues they faced. \"I think it's an area of London lots of people don't really know, so it attracts both locals and tourists,\" says Laxton-Bass.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The female travellers who shaped the ancient world\n\u2022\u00a0The women porters making history on Peru's Inca Trail\n\u2022\u00a0In the steps of history's forgotten female explorers\u00a0\nThe company also runs walking tours of Westminster and Bloomsbury, unearthing women's stories rarely relayed by traditional tours and crafting a narrative that blends historical and contemporary feminist issues. \"My hope,\" says Laxton-Bass, \"is that people realise that women's history is everywhere.\"\nIn Paris, Julie Marang\u00e9 launched her first walking tour, focussing on feminist street art, after being disappointed by the French reaction to the #MeToo movement. It led to the creation of Feminists in the City, which now operates in the French capital as well as Lyon, Bordeaux, Toulouse and Marseille, and spotlights women through history and culture via walking tours, conferences and masterclasses. Its most popular tour is currently The Witch Hunt, Powerful Women of Paris, which uncovers the powerful women accused of sorcery from the Middle Ages onwards. Another centres on female sexual liberation in the lively streets of the Pigalle neighbourhood, delving into the rebellious and subversive feminist roots of the French can-can dance now associated with the Moulin Rouge and the story of the venue's first known female clown, Cha-U-Kao. The tours are extensively researched by Marang\u00e9 with the help of the historian and women\u2019s rights specialist Claudine Monteil, who was a close friend of the legendary feminist Simone de Beauvoir. \"We're not re-writing history, we are just telling a different story,\" says Marang\u00e9. \"It's a different angle, a different perspective; really it's about making women visible in the story of humanity.\"\nAmsterdam's modern feminist history is inherently synonymous with the story of Anne Frank, the Jewish diarist who spent more than two years hidden in a secret annexe in the city alongside her family during World War Two and became one of the most famous victims of the Holocaust. These days, Anne Frank's House receives more than one million visitors annually \u2013 but the Dutch capital's gabled canal-front buildings have cultivated plenty of other female legends.\nMany of them are brought to light on Martine Bontjes' Women of Amsterdam tour that loops through the city's historic centre, taking in the work of pioneering figures such as Lijsbeth Vaas, an 18th-Century undercover police officer. Bontjes, whose viewpoint is also inspired by her grandmother's experiences as a woman securing financial independence in post-WW2 Amsterdam, launched her popular tour in 2022 and now runs it every week. \"It's something that so many women are now connected to, since there are so many laws now under pressure,\" she says. \"I believe that this really is the time for women to come together and to share stories.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump called a meeting of his cabinet secretaries on Thursday to discuss Elon Musk and his efforts to slash government spending and personnel numbers.\nIt turned heated, according to media reports.\nMusk accused Secretary of State Marco Rubio of failing to cut enough staff at the state department, reports the New York Times.\nThe tech mogul told Rubio he was \"good on TV\", according to the newspaper, pointedly skipping any praise of his work as America's top diplomat.\nThe billionaire also clashed with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy over whether Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) task force had tried to lay off air traffic controllers who were already in short supply in the Federal Aviation Administration, according to the New York Times.\nDuffy's department has been under scrutiny after two US airline crashes since Trump took office in January. \nAfter listening to the back-and-forth, the Republican president reportedly intervened to make clear he still supported Doge, but from now on cabinet secretaries would be in charge and the Musk team would only advise. \nA state department spokeswoman told the newspaper Rubio felt the cabinet meeting was an \"open and productive discussion\". The White House has not responded to BBC requests for further comment.\nSpeaking in the Oval Office after the meeting, Trump said cabinet members should decide who to cut, but if they didn't, Musk would do the job.\n\"I had a meeting, and I said I want the cabinet members to go first\", Trump said. \"And if they can cut it's better, if they don't cut, then Elon will do the cutting.\"\nThe hastily planned gathering could provide evidence that the president has decided to curtail the sweeping power the SpaceX and Tesla boss and his Doge cost-cutting initiative have commanded in the early weeks of his administration.\nTrump first commented on the substance of Thursday's meeting, which was disclosed only in after-the-fact media reports, through a post that evening on his social media site, Truth Social.\nHe said that he had instructed his secretaries to work with Doge on \"cost-cutting measures\".\n\"As the secretaries learn about, and understand, the people working for the various departments, they can be very precise as to who will remain, and who will go,\" he wrote, adding that they should use a \"scalpel\" not a \"hatchet\".\nJust a few weeks ago, Musk wielded a shiny chainsaw at a conservative conference \u2013 a visible symbol of aggressive attempts to slash government spending that have angered Democrats and concerned some officials in the Trump administration.\nMusk's team had sent multiple emails from an official government account to millions of federal workers, encouraging them to accept months of advance pay in exchange for their resignations.\nFederal workers were instructed to provide accounts of their weekly accomplishments or risk firing \u2013 a request some agencies instructed their employees to ignore.\nDoge also ordered the dismissal of many newly hired government employees who, because of their \"probationary\" status, did not have full civil service protections. \nSome government agencies have since rescinded these orders because employees deemed essential, such as those who oversee nuclear weapon security, had been affected.\nDuring an Oval Office event on Friday, Trump responded to questions about the cabinet meeting \u2013 and reports of its heated exchanges. He insisted there was \"no clash\". He praised both Rubio and Musk and said the two got along \"great\".\nTrump's Thursday Truth Social post, however, appears to give department heads more authority to push back against Musk. \nIt also may be an attempt to insulate the Trump administration from lawsuits that allege Musk is wielding too much power for someone who, unlike cabinet secretaries, is not subject to Senate review and confirmation.\nSeveral federal judges overseeing these cases have already expressed concern about Musk's authority \u2013 concerns that may be further fuelled by Trump's comments during his address to Congress on Tuesday that the billionaire was, in fact, the man in charge of Doge.\nMusk and Trump have formed a formidable partnership so far \u2013 as the richest man in the world and the most powerful politician in America. Washington has been rife with speculation for months about whether that partnership could ultimately fracture.\nThose predictions, however, have usually been followed by renewed signs of comity between the two men. \nOn Friday night, Musk was seen boarding Air Force One with the president for a flight to Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida for the weekend.\nThe cabinet room dust-up may be the first crack in the foundation \u2013 but there is plenty of evidence that Trump still supports Musk's broader efforts and goals, even if he might prefer he use a scalpel in the days ahead, not a chainsaw.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Sir Keir Starmer has called the current benefits system unsustainable, indefensible and unfair, and said the government could not \"shrug its shoulders and look away\". \nAddressing Labour MPs on Monday evening, the prime minister said the current welfare system was \"the worst of all worlds\", discouraging people from working while producing a \"spiralling bill\". \nThe comments come as Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall prepares to set out changes to the welfare system and cut the benefits bill in the coming weeks.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement.\nChanges likely to be announced in the coming days include restrictions on eligibility for the Personal Independent Payment, which provides help with extra living costs to those with a long-term physical or mental health condition, and cuts to incapacity benefits for people unable to work and receiving Universal Credit. \nThere is unease over the plans within the party, with Labour MP Rachael Maskell warning against \"draconian cuts\" that risk \"pushing disabled people into poverty\".\nMaskell told the BBC she had picked up \"deep, deep concern\" among Labour MPs.\nShe said: \"I look in the past at what Labour has achieved in this space and believe that we can hold on to our values, ensure that we're helping people and not harming people.\"\nAnother Labour MP, Neil Duncan-Jordan, also expressed concern, telling Newsnight: \"If we are going to make poor people poorer then there will be a number of MPs who won't be able to sign up to that.\n\"It feels like it could be a re-run of austerity and I'm worried about that.\"\nHowever, other sections of the Parliamentary Labour Party are calling for change. \nThe Get Britain Working group of 36 Labour MPs has said the government has a \"moral duty\" to help long-term sick and disabled people to work if they can.\nIn a letter to Kendall, the MPs said the country faced \"hard choices\" to overcome a \"crisis of economic inactivity\".\nSpeaking at a meeting of Labour MPs on Monday night, Sir Keir said: \"We've found ourselves in a worst of all worlds situation - with the wrong incentives - discouraging people from working, the taxpayer funding a spiralling bill.\n\"A wasted generation, one-in-eight young people not in education, employment or training, and the people who really need that safety net still not always getting the dignity they deserve.\n\"That's unsustainable, it's indefensible and it is unfair, people feel that in their bones.\n\"So, this needs to be our offer to people up and down the country: If you can work, we will make work pay - if you need help, that safety net will be there for you. \n\"But this is the Labour Party - we believe in the dignity of work and we believe in the dignity of every worker.\"\nA number of MPs leaving the meeting said they had been satisfied with the prime minister's words. \nOne said they accepted that welfare reform had to happen and were reassured that he had said it had to be done with Labour values and through the dignity of work.\nHowever, another said constituents were frightened and needed to know that support would be there.\nThey said there had been little recognition that reducing benefits like the Personal Independence Payment, which helps people keep their independence, had the potential to push up costs.\nLabour MP Diane Abbott said she would have liked to query the impact of the prime minister's proposed cuts to welfare but was told the meeting was full.\n\nIn a letter to Reeves, a dozen charities have argued there is \"little evidence to suggest cutting benefits increases employment outcomes\".\nThe charities - including Disability Rights UK, Citizens Advice, Scope and Sense - urged her to \"think again about cuts to disability benefits\".\nThey said: \"There are disabled people out of work who want to work given the right support. And for some disabled people, work isn't appropriate.\n\"Changes to welfare must start here. Not with cuts.\"\nBut ministers are worried about the surge in the number of people claiming benefits since the Covid-19 pandemic and the cost to the taxpayer.\nAs of January, 9.3 million people aged 16 to 64 in the UK were economically inactive - a rise of 713,000 since the pandemic.\nThe Department of Work and Pensions says some 2.8 million people are economically inactive because of long-term sickness.\nLast year, the government spent \u00a365bn on sickness benefits and that figure is forecast to increase by tens of billions before the next general election.\nSome of the reforms to the welfare system have already been announced and include plans to use 1,000 work coaches to help the long-term unemployed into work.\nConservative shadow businesses secretary Andrew Griffith said Sir Keir had \"rightly\" talked about the problem of millions of working-age people on welfare.\n\"That is a stain on our country's character,\" Griffith told the BBC. \"But it also holds back the economy and it's one of the reasons why we're not growing.\"\nHowever, Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Steve Darling said \"slashing support without fixing broken public services is not the answer\".\n\"We need long-term reform and investment in health and social care, not short-term cuts that balance the nation's finances on the backs of the most vulnerable,\" he said.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments. \nIt'll be delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.",

There is unease over the plans within the party, with Labour MP Rachael Maskell warning against \"draconian cuts\" that risk \"pushing disabled people into poverty\".Maskell told the BBC she had picked up \"deep, deep concern\" among Labour MPs.She said: \"I look in the past at what Labour has achieved in this space and believe that we can hold on to our values, ensure that we're helping people and not harming people. \"But ministers are worried about the surge in the number of people claiming benefits since the Covid-19 pandemic and the cost to the taxpayer.As of January, 9.3 million people aged 16 to 64 in the UK were economically inactive - a rise of 713,000 since the pandemic.The Department of Work and Pensions says some 2.8 million people are economically inactive because of long-term sickness.Last year, the government spent \u00a365bn on sickness benefits and that figure is forecast to increase by tens of billions before the next general election.Some of the reforms to the welfare system have already been announced and include plans to use 1,000 work coaches to help the long-term unemployed into work.Conservative shadow businesses secretary Andrew Griffith said Sir Keir had \"rightly\" talked about the problem of millions of working-age people on welfare.",

        "article_text": "If you had asked Canadians a few months ago who would win the country's next general election, most would have predicted a decisive victory for the Conservative Party.\nThat outcome does not look so certain now.\nIn the wake of US President Donald Trump's threats against Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party has surged in the polls, shrinking the double-digit lead their Conservative rivals had held steadily since mid-2023.\nThe dramatic change in the country's political landscape reflects how Trump's tariffs and his repeated calls to make Canada \"the 51st state\" have fundamentally altered Canadian voters' priorities.\nTrump's rhetoric has \"pushed away all of the other issues\" that were top of mind for Canadians before his inauguration on 20 January, notes Luc Turgeon, a political science professor at the University of Ottawa.\nIt has even managed to revive the once deeply unpopular Trudeau, whose approval rating has climbed by 12 points since December. The prime minister, of course, will not be in power for much longer, having announced his resignation at the start of the year.\nOn Sunday, his Liberals will declare the results of the leadership contest to determine who takes over a party running a precarious minority government. The new leader will have two immediate decisions to make: how to respond to Trump's threats, and when to call a general election. The answer to the first dilemma will surely influence the second.\nWho is in the running to replace Trudeau as Liberal Party leader?\nA federal election must be held on or before 20 October, but could be called as early as this week.\nPolls indicate that many Canadians still want a change at the top. But what that change would look like - a Liberal government under new leadership, or a complete shift to the Conservatives - is now anyone's guess, says Greg Lyle, president of the Toronto-based Innovative Research Group, which has been polling Canadians on their shifting attitudes.\n\"Up until now, it was a blowout for the Conservatives,\" he tells the BBC.\nThat is because the centre-right party led by Pierre Poilievre, has been effective in its messaging on issues that have occupied the Canadian psyche for the last few years: the rising cost of living, housing unaffordability, crime and a strained healthcare system.\nPoilievre successfully tied these societal problems to what he labelled Trudeau's \"disastrous\" policies, and promised a return to \"common sense politics\".\nBut with Trudeau's resignation, and Trump's threats to Canada's economic security and even its sovereignty, that messaging has become stale, Mr Lyle says. His polling suggests the majority of the country is now most afraid of Trump's presidency and the impact it will have on Canada.\nTrump's 25% tariffs on all Canadian imports to the US, some of which have been paused until 2 April, could be devastating for Canada's economy, which sends three-quarters of all its products to the US. Officials have predicted up to a million job losses as a result, and Canada could head into a recession if the tax on goods persists.\nTrudeau left no doubt how seriously he is taking the threat, when he told reporters this week that Trump's stated reason for the US tariffs - the flow of fentanyl across the border - was bogus and unjustified.\n\"What he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that'll make it easier to annex us,\" the prime minister warned.\n\"In many ways, it's an all encompassing, fundamental issue about the survival of the country,\" Prof Turgeon tells the BBC. Who is best placed to stand up for Canada against Trump has therefore become the key question in the forthcoming election.\nThe Conservatives are still ahead in the polls, with the latest averages suggesting 40% of voters back them. The Liberals' fortunes, meanwhile, have been revived, with their support climbing to slightly over 30% - up 10 points from January.\nLiberals have attempted to highlight similarities between the Conservative leader and Republican president. At last week's leadership debate, candidates referred to Poilievre as \"our little version of Trump here at home\" and said he was looking to \"imitate\" the US president. A Liberal Party attack ad juxtaposed clips of the two using similar phrases such as \"fake news\" and \"radical left\".\nThere are clear differences, however, between the two politicians, in terms of style and substance. And Trump himself has downplayed any parallels, telling British magazine The Spectator in a recent interview that Poilievre is \"not Maga enough\".\nStill, polls suggest a slipping of Conservative support. A recent poll by national pollster Angus Reid indicates Canadians believe Liberal leadership front-runner Mark Carney is better equipped to deal with Trump on issues of tariffs and trade than Poilievre. \nThe former central banker for both Canada and England is touting his experience dealing with economic crises, including the 2008 financial crash and Brexit.\nAnd the shift in the political mood has forced Conservatives to recalculate their messaging.\nIf the election is called soon, the campaign will take place at a moment when Trump's threats have inspired a fierce patriotism among Canadians. Many are boycotting American goods at their local grocery stores or even cancelling trips to the US.\nProf Turgeon says this \"rallying around the flag\" has become a key theme of Canadian politics.\nThe Conservatives have shifted away from their \"Canada is Broken\" slogan, which Mr Lyle says risked coming across as \"anti-patriotic\", to \"Canada First\".\nConservatives have also redirected their attacks towards Carney. Before Trump's tariffs, they ran ads saying he is \"just like Justin\" in an attempt to tie him to Trudeau. But in recent weeks, the Conservatives have started digging into Carney's loyalty to Canada.\nSpecifically, they have questioned whether he had a role in moving the headquarters of Brookfield Asset Management - a Canadian investment company - from Toronto to New York when he served as its chair.\nCarney has responded that he had left the firm by the time that decision was made, but company documents reported on by public broadcaster CBC show the board approved the move in October 2024, when Carney was still at Brookfield.\nThe move, and Carney's equivocation of his involvement with it, was criticised by the editorial board of Canada's national newspaper the Globe and Mail, which wrote on Thursday that Carney must be transparent with Canadians.\nMore broadly, the paper wrote: \"Every party leader must understand that Canada is entering a years-long period of uncertainty. The next prime minister will have to call on the trust of Canadians to lead the country where it needs to head but may not want to go.\"\nGiven the anxiety reverberating among Canadians, Mr Lyle says that any ambiguity about Carney's loyalty to the country could yet be damaging for him and the Liberals.\nWhenever the election comes, and whoever wins, one thing is certain: Trump will continue to influence and reshape Canadian politics just as he has in the United States.",

        "article_text": "Located on a lonely mountain plain in Colorado ski country, the silver-rush-era town of Leadville holds secrets as deep as its tunnels and old mine workings.\nThe highway climbs through aspen forest glinting gold in the Sun, rising through zigzag gullies, escarpments and precipices onto a high mountain plain so lonesome it seems to hum with silence. Snowdrifts huddle at the road's verges and on it goes persistently, almost gasping for air, past lonely farms beneath besieging summits.\nThere are many superlative road trips to take in North America, but if you find yourself on US Route 24, driving through Lake County in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, know you are on an old road to somewhere extraordinary.\nAmong the places on this storied route is Leadville, with a reputation often chalked up to its elevation. At 3,109m (10,200ft), it's the highest incorporated city in North America. But while the town is always in danger of being dwarfed by the surrounding landscape, the setting also reveals much mythology about Colorado's most lionised subjects: the gold rush and the Wild West.\n\"So many people, Americans included, are so unfamiliar with our story,\" said Katie Hild, manager of Leadville's Tourism and Visitor Center, housed today in the original red sandstone American National Bank building. \"This is a town that's been shaped by bust and boom \u2013 so much has happened here.\"\nThe triumph of Leadville, as Hild puts it, is its many strata. The first mineral deposits were found in the area's California Gulch in 1860, and, within a year, around 10,000 prospectors had flooded the high plain, with more than $3m in ore extracted. By 1880, Leadville was served by three railroads, and between 1878 and 1884 the town had freighted 54 million ounces of silver. Soon, rich seams of zinc, iron, gold and lead were being quarried.\n\"Mining is our root and some of the largest pockets of precious ores on the continent have been found here,\" added Hild. \"At its peak, there were 30,000 people in Leadville, but by 1893 silver prices had plummeted and the glory days were over nearly as quickly as they'd begun.\"\nThe Open Road\nThe Open Road is a celebration of the world's most remarkable highways and byways, and a reminder that some of the greatest travel adventures happen via wheels.\nExploring Leadville nowadays is a kind of treasure hunt \u2013 and much of this deep history can be absorbed in the Mining District outside town in the foothills below Mount Sherman. The Route of the Silver Kings, once the backdrop for one of the richest mining camps in the US, reveals 14 original structures and 20 sites from the era that visitors can explore on a signposted gravel road. Incredibly, the US Bureau of Mines estimates there are 1,329 shafts, 1,628 prospect holes and more than 200 miles of workings, all hidden beneath the surface.\u00a0\nFor many, the 21-mile circuit represents more than just a charmingly loose collection of mineshafts. Rather, the ghost towns and, most dramatically of all, the buckled headframes and mining camp hoists have come to embody an idealisation of the American dream. It is telling that the names of the camps are Silver Spoon, Diamond Dolly, Upper Oro and Hopemore. But those with a silver gleam in their eyes are advised against any Indiana Jones type antics: all treasure hunting and metal detecting is strictly forbidden.\nLeadville's name evokes tin-hatted miners picking through ore, but the town turns out to be equally infused with the spirit of a Wild West film set. There are around a dozen beautiful buildings that sag characterfully, bringing to mind the rootin' tootin' cowboy country of Buffalo Bill and Doc Holliday, both of whom visited during their late-19th-Century heyday. Walk south down Harrison Avenue from the National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum and on the left is the Delaware Hotel, once a premier lodging for mining magnates. A few blocks away, you see the Tabor Opera House, constructed by silver baron Horace Tabor in 1879, and where miners and madams once mingled.\nLocals might tell you Oscar Wilde once performed there, while such was the fiscal boom that an additional door was built to get circus elephants into the opera house. One night, illusionist Harry Houdini is also said to have disappeared through the stage's trap door. It's easy to understand how he must have felt. Entering Leadville today feels like slipping through a portal into another time.\nPerhaps the most engrossing example of the street's preserved architecture is a timber-clad landmark across the road: the Silver Dollar Saloon, where tipplers can still order a whiskey under the diamond dust mirrors at the original wooden bar from 1879.\n\"You couldn't label Leadville as the capital of the Old Wild West, especially when weighed against other legendary towns like Dodge City or Tombstone, but it certainly played a pivotal role during the transformative gold and silver rush eras,\" said Adam Ducharme, Lake County's tourism and economic development director. \"Walk into the Silver Dollar Saloon and you're not just stepping into a bar \u2013 it's an immersion into a living relic of this time.\"\nBut wherever you go in Colorado in winter these days, the subject everyone is obsessed with is not silver dollars, but snowfall \u2014 and 11 miles farther along US Route 24, the next chapter in Leadville's untold history is slowly revealed.\nSki Cooper isn't Colorado's most celebrated mountain resort, but where it beats others in the state is it retains the authenticity of a mountain as it used to be. Non-profit and municipality owned, it looks out to Mount Elbert, the state's highest mountain at 4,399m (14,433ft). More than that, the landscape has the emptiness that purists seek away from the surrounding busier towns.\n\"Cooper is not a resort, but a place to come skiing,\" said head of operations Patrick Torsell. \"We only have three lifts \u2013 nothing compared to the mega-resorts \u2013 but Leadville locals have a strong relationship with us and our history. It's a peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches in the parking lot kind of place.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The US' awe-inspiring 'Highway to the Sky'\n\u2022 A 210km drive through 'the most beautiful place on Earth'\n\u2022\u00a0An epic road trip over and under the Atlantic Ocean\u00a0\nLikewise, this is a mountain that covers its tracks well. For this is where Colorado's ski culture began.\nThe story starts with the first mountain unit in US military history, the 10th Mountain Division of World War Two. In summer 1941, its soldiers received extensive training in winter warfare on Cooper Hill, constructing what was then the world's longest draglift. Then, in the winter of 1944-1945, three of its regiments marshalled a series of surprise attacks during a surprise offensive in Italy's Apennine Mountains. It's a melancholy tale: around 1,000 soldiers were killed and 4,000 injured. And yet, their actions were instrumental in Germany's later surrender.\u00a0\nWhat many don't know is following their return to the Rockies, the 10th's veterans shaped the American ski industry. More than 66 ski resorts were managed or founded by former military personnel, including Aspen, Vail and Arapahoe Basin \u2013 and this taps into a broader strain of patriotism among locals today.\nAt Arapahoe Basin, during the 1953-1954 season, for instance, the unit installed the first Poma lift in the US. Then, in 1957 at Winter Park, they constructed two draglifts said to be the fastest in the world. The division's backcountry cabins, once used for deep-snow combat training, are now open to visitors to book year-round.\nBut that's not all. Six miles from Leadville in the Pando Valley, the 10th Mountain Division trained at Camp Hale. Sitting between sheer-sided rocky spurs and snow-daubed mountains with the Eagle River winding nearby, it was once a sprawling encampment of 14,000 soldiers, 226 barracks, 100 mess halls, three theatres, a chapel, horse and mule barns and a hospital. Little remains nowadays, but a 10-stop self-guided tour of relics snakes past ammunition bunkers, a guard shack and a field house. To be so rapidly transplanted from pistes to pistols fires the imagination.\nThe best story at Camp Hale concerns the CIA, which took over the base in the 1950s to train secretive special ops teams. At one time, 170 Tibetans were drafted in for secret operations against the Communist government in China. The unexpected coda is locals were told it was a test site for bombs. Nowadays, with snowshoe, hiking, biking and horse-riding trails, it is a less-assuming and simpler world away from the currents of history.\nIn few places in Colorado are the ghosts of the past so alive as on US Route 24. Leadville, this Wild West city in the clouds, is faithful to this picture. It then comes as a bit of a shock to head out on the road out of town, to leave the Old West and silver-rush-era mines behind in the rearview, to return to the 21st-Century of haulage trucks, roadside fast food stops and gas stations framed by the Rockies, in all their glory.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

The law will take its course on all,\" he told Reuters news agency.\n\"We fought to defend the oppressed, and we won't accept that any blood be shed unjustly, or goes without punishment or accountability, even among those closest to us,\" he said. \nThe government launched the operation in Latakia province in response to a growing insurgency by Assad loyalists in recent weeks. The region is the heartland of the Alawite sect, to which many of the former regime's political and military elite belonged.\nOn Thursday, security personnel were ambushed by gunmen in the town of Jableh as they tried to arrest a wanted Assad regime official. At least 13 officers were reportedly killed.\nSecurity forces responded by sending reinforcements to the region, who were joined by armed supporters of the government. Over the next four days, they stormed many Alawite towns and villages, where residents said they carried out revenge killings and lootings.\nA widely shared video showed the bodies of at least two dozen men in civilian clothing, piled in the yard of a house, in al-Mukhtareyah. Elsewhere, accounts emerged of fighters searching for Alawite members and killing entire families on the spot.\nHiba, an Alawite woman in Baniyas, told the BBC that Chechen fighters loyal to the government had attacked her neighbourhood.\n\"Our neighbours were killed including children. They came and took everything, gold, everything\u2026 They stole all of the cars in the neighbourhood. They even went to the supermarket and they took everything from the shelves.\"\n\"We were waiting for our turn. We didn't know when it would come. We saw death, we saw people dying in front of us and now all of our friends, our neighbours, are gone,\" she added. \"They killed innocent people in cold blood who had nothing to do with any of this.\"\nAn Alawite man whose family lives in Baniyas said in a voice message that a relative was kidnapped from his home by gunmen from Sharaa's Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), who went door to door searching for Alawites. \n\"His mother made a mistake opening the door when she did. An HTS member fired between her legs... so she screamed,\" he said. \"Her son... ran to see what happened with her. When they [saw] him, they took him with them and disappeared. And they didn't return.\"\nHe also said residents of Alawite neighbourhoods of Baniyas were still hiding in their houses on Monday morning because they were too afraid to venture outside to see if it was safe. \nThe bodies of those killed had been buried in a mass grave near a shrine on the outskirts of the town, while those who were kidnapped had not yet returned, he added.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that more than 1,540 people have been killed in Latakia, Tartous, Hama and Homs provinces.\nThey included 1,068 civilians, the vast majority of them Alawites who it said had died as a result of \"killings, field executions and ethnic cleansing operations\" by security personnel or pro-government fighters, as well as 230 security personnel and 250 pro-Assad fighters.\nSecurity sources also told Reuters that 300 security personnel had been killed.\nThe BBC has been unable to independently verify the death tolls.\nState news agency Sana said a mass grave containing the bodies of security personnel had been found in the former president's hometown of Qardaha on Sunday.

        "article_text": "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, will be Canada's next prime minister, at least for now. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.\nMark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.\nHe had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.\nBut unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States. \nBut holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect it to be called as early as this month.\nAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working for Goldman Sachs in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.\nThe son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University. \nIn 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.\nIn 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.\nAlthough central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. \nThat move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.\nIn his time at the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, he oversaw considerable changes in how the institution worked. At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority.\nHe is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.\nIn 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.\nInterest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.\nConfusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a monicker which stuck around long after the original controversy died down.\nUnlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.\nIn 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.\nBefore the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.\nIn the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.\nHe described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.\nThe Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.\nHis final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\". \n\nCarney's time at the bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.\nFrom 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.\nHe was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.\nHe is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\nHis political ambitions have been rumoured for years, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.\n\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.\nThings changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.\nReports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.\nFreeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.\n\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\" \nStill, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. \nThe Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.\nThey have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament. \nHis team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.",

Getty ImagesJerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve (left) and Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England, walk the grounds during the Jackson Hole economic symposium in 2019Carney's time at the bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.He is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. How Britain's former top banker became Canada's next prime minister2 days agoShareSaveBen King and Robin Levinson KingBBC NewsReporting fromLondon, UK and Toronto, CanadaShareSaveWatch: Key moments on Mark Carney\u2019s journey from banker to Canada's PMThe former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, will be Canada's next prime minister, at least for now. In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority.He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a monicker which stuck around long after the original controversy died down.Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",

        "article_text": "An argument in the White House tore apart the US alliance with Ukraine, shook European leaders and highlighted JD Vance's key role in forcefully expressing Donald Trump's foreign policy. The vice-president has come out punching on the global stage - so what is it that drives his worldview?\nVance's first major foreign speech, at the Munich Security Conference in mid-February, caught many by surprise.\nRather than focusing on the war raging in Ukraine, the US vice-president only briefly mentioned the bloodiest European conflict since World War Two.\nInstead, he used his debut on the international stage to berate close US allies about immigration and free speech, suggesting the European establishment was anti-democratic. He accused them of ignoring the wills of their people and questioned what shared values they were truly banding together with the US to defend.\n\"If you are running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you, nor for that matter is there anything you can do for the American people,\" he warned.\nIt was a bold and perhaps unexpected way to introduce himself to the world - by angering European allies. But days later he was back in the news, at the centre of a blistering row with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whom he accused of being ungrateful.\nFor those who have been studying the rise of Vance, these two episodes came as no surprise.\nThe vice-president has come to represent an intellectual wing of the conservative movement that gives expression to Trumpism and in particular how its America First mantra applies beyond its borders. In writings and interviews, Vance has expressed an ideology that seems to join the dots between American workers, global elites and the role of the US in the wider world.\nOn the campaign trail with Donald Trump last year, Vance spent much of his time sharply criticising Democrats - the usual attack-dog duties that traditionally get dished out to running mates - and sparring with reporters.\nAnd while Elon Musk's outsized and unconventional role in the Trump administration initially overshadowed him, that Munich speech and the Oval Office showdown have raised the profile of Trump's deputy.\nIt's also led to questions about the winding ideological journey he's made during his years in the conservative movement - and what he truly believes now.\n\"He's much more of a pragmatist than an ideologue,\" said James Orr, associate professor of philosophy of religion at the University of Cambridge and a friend whom Vance has described as his \"British sherpa\".\n\"He's able to articulate what is and is not in the American interest,\" Orr said. \"And the American interest is not the interest of some abstract utopia or matrix of propositions and ideas, but the American people.\"\nVance has repeatedly returned to this \"America First\" - or perhaps \"Americans First\" - theme in speeches, drawing a line between what he castigates as Washington's economic and foreign policy orthodoxy abroad and the struggles of the left-behind American working class at home.\nAt the Republican National Convention last summer, for example, he lamented how in small towns across the US \"jobs were sent overseas and children were sent to war\". And he attacked then-President Joe Biden, saying: \"For half a century, he's been a champion of every single policy initiative to make America weaker and poorer.\"\nBut Vance is also someone who, after a tough upbringing in an Ohio family with Appalachian roots and sudden fame on the back of a bestselling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, has tried out many different views.\nNot only is he a former \"Never Trumper\" who described the US president in 2016 as \"reprehensible\" and \"an idiot\", his book places much of the blame for the plight of the rural poor squarely on the choices made by individuals.\nMore recently he's shifted that blame to elites \u2013 a group he's variously defined as Democrats, conventional Republicans, liberals, corporate leaders, globalists and academics.\nIn speeches, Vance regularly argues that \"America is not just an idea\u2026 America is a nation.\"\nHe couples this statement with an anecdote about his family's ancestral graveyard in Kentucky, where he says he, his wife and their children will one day be buried, arguing that family and homeland are more important than some of America's traditional core ideas.\nIn Vance's view, the Trump administration's priority should be to make life better for Americans who have been in the country for generations, and yet have little of the nation's vast wealth.\nRod Dreher, a conservative American writer who is also a friend of the vice-president, said Vance's thinking arises from a belief that \"moderate normie Republicans\u2026 failed to offer anything to stop the so-called forever wars, and they also failed to offer anything to ordinary Americans like where he comes from, who are suffering economically from globalism and from the effects of mass migration and fentanyl\".\n\"He got red-pilled, so to speak, by Donald Trump,\" Dreher told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme this week.\n\"Red-pilled\" is internet slang for suddenly waking up to a supposedly hidden truth, as featured in The Matrix movies. It's commonly used by those on the right online who believe they have special access to reality and that people with liberal, centrist or establishment views are uncritical thinkers.\nVance is a vice-president who, more than his boss, seems extremely plugged into internet culture. He's an enthusiastic user of X, often jumping directly into arguments rather than using it, as many politicians do, as a platform for announcements.\nHis appearances on fringe right-wing podcasts, while he was trying to drum up support for a Senate run, provided fodder for his opponents, as did provocative trollish comments such as that the US was being run by \"childless cat ladies\".\nMarried to the daughter of Indian immigrants, he has rejected and been rejected by members of the alt-right even if he does echo some of their views. However, he does have friends and allies both at the top of Silicon Valley and in some of its lesser known corners.\nAfter graduating from Yale Law School, he was brought into the world of venture capital by influential Silicon Valley conservative Peter Thiel, who later funded his US Senate campaign.\nHe has cited people like the blogger Curtis Yarvin, a key guru in the \"neo-reactionary\" movement which dreams up fantasies of technologically-assisted, hyper-capitalist societies led by powerful monarchs.\nHis familiarity with the internet's fringes was further demonstrated when he spread false rumours about immigrants eating pets and an allegation about Ukrainian corruption - which the BBC traced back to Moscow.\n\"He sort of stews in this online world,\" said Cathy Young, a writer for the conservative, anti-Trump media outlet The Bulwark.\nAt the same time, Young said, his anecdote about family graveyards and homeland suggests another political tendency - a \"disturbing undertone of nativism\".\n\"That bothers some people and rightly so,\" she said. \"Part of the American legacy is that we are a nation of immigrants. [Former Republican President] Ronald Reagan talked about that, about one of the distinctive things about this country is that anyone can come here from any part of the world and become an American.\"\nVance's \"Americans First\" thinking clearly extends to the issue of the war in Ukraine. When he was a senator, he was often critical of America's involvement in the war and the huge sums spent on it, his former Senate colleague Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, recalled.\n\"His position then was very much like what it is now\u2026 that the conflict must end,\" Hawley told the BBC. \"It needs to end in a way that's maximally advantageous to the security of the United States and it needs to end in a way that gets our European allies to take increased responsibility.\"\nVance regularly accused the Biden administration of being more interested in Ukraine than in stemming illegal immigration. Writing in 2022, during his Senate campaign and after the Russian invasion, he said: \"I will be damned if I am going to prioritise Ukraine's eastern border right now when our own southern border is engulfed by a human tsunami of illegal migrants.\"\nHis views burst out into the open during that dramatic argument with President Zelensky in the Oval Office. Vance accused Zelensky of lacking respect, of sending politicians on a \"propaganda tour\" of Ukraine and of being insufficiently thankful for US aid.\n\"Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's trying to save your country,\" he told the Ukrainian president.\nThe argument left European leaders scrambling to defend Zelensky, while also trying to maintain negotiations over a possible peace deal.\nVance then prompted widespread outrage from allies when he poured scorn on the idea of security guarantees in the form of troops \"from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\".\nHe later denied he was talking about the UK or France, the only two European countries that have publicly stated their willingness to send peacekeepers to Ukraine.\nBut the vice-president's willingness to step on the toes of allies reflect a world view which, in his words, has little time for \"moralisms about 'this country is good', 'this country is bad'\".\n\"That doesn't mean you have to have a complete moral blind spot, but it means that you have to be honest about the countries that you're dealing with, and there's a complete failure to do that with most of our foreign policy establishment in this country,\" he told a New York Times columnist last year.\nHis tone has shifted from the two years he spent in the US Senate before being picked by Trump. Democrat Cory Booker remembered Vance as \"very pragmatic and thoughtful\".\n\"That's why some of this stuff surprises me,\" Booker told the BBC.\nOthers detect the same disconnect.\nDavid Frum, now a writer for The Atlantic magazine, said that Vance's views have changed significantly from when he first commissioned the former marine, who was attending Ohio State University at the time, to write for his website on conservative politics more than 15 years ago.\n\"He was not in any way the culture warrior that he is today,\" Frum said.\nFrum, a former George W Bush speechwriter and staunch critic of Trump, said that Vance's view of Russia represented \"ideological admiration\".\nIn Munich, as he spoke about free speech, the vice-president cited cases involving conservatives and Christians in Western countries but avoided any mention of Russia's harsh clampdowns on expression.\nVance and his allies reject that he is sympathetic to Putin.\n\"I've never once argued that Putin is a kind and friendly person,\" Vance, then an Ohio senator, said in a speech at the 2024 Munich Security Conference.\n\"We don't have to agree with him. We can contest him and we often will contest him,\" he said. \"But the fact that he's a bad guy does not mean we can't engage in basic diplomacy and prioritising America's interests.\"\nThe BBC has asked the White House for comment on Vance's stance in relation to Ukraine and Russia.\nA quick end to the conflict in Ukraine is, in Vance's view, not only about putting a stop to billions of dollars being spent thousands of miles away.\nHe himself has said that there are bigger issues for the US and its friends to focus on than Ukraine, namely the threat of China, which he has called \"our most significant competitor... for the next 20 or 30 years\".\nVance's views on Ukraine and his willingness to publicly air them provided a dramatic moment in the early days of Trump's second presidential term.\nBut it also offered a vivid illustration of the vice-president's ideology, his prominence in the Trump administration and how he views America's place in the world.\nWith reporting by Rachel Looker and Anthony Zurcher in Washington and Lily Jamali in San Francisco\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Fighting back the tears, 22-year-old rubbish collector Okuku Prince recalls the moment his best friend's lifeless body was found at a massive rubbish dump in Uganda's capital, Kampala.\nThe landslide at the Kiteezi dump last August killed 30 people, including his friend Sanya Kezia.\n\"I think some people are still underneath the garbage,\" he tells the BBC.\nMany of them eked out a living by washing and selling whatever discarded items they found that still had value - anything from fishing nets to plastic bottles, glass jars and the components of old electronic devices.\nA blame-game erupted after the fatal collapse, with Kampala's city council and central government accusing each other of negligence, while some of the dead still languished under tonnes of rubbish without the dignity of a burial.\nWhen government tractors did eventually dig up Kezia's body, there were injuries to the 21-year-old's face.\nIt was horrifying for his friend to see him enveloped by stinking, rotting waste.\n\"We're not safe here. Unless they [repair] it, maybe level it. Otherwise, people are not safe,\" says Mr Prince, who before becoming a rubbish-picker had been studying law at the Islamic University of Uganda.\nUnable to afford tuition fees after his family became financially unstable, his daily routine is now a far cry from libraries and lecture halls.\nYouth unemployment is at crisis levels in Uganda, and there are many like Mr Prince who often risk their health and abandon their dreams just to make a living.\n\"I come here to the dump in the morning, collect polythene bags, take them for washing and sell them,\" says Mr Prince. \"I make 10,000 shillings [equivalent to $2.70 or \u00a32.10] a day.\"\nThe collapse has left him in further financial distress as he used to live by the side of the dump - but has had to move because of safety concerns.\nThe houses of others were also destroyed during rescue operations.\nCompensation money has been paid to the families of those who died, but not to around 200 people who lost their homes, local authorities have admitted to the BBC.\nOfficials are \"waiting for the valuation and budget allocation\", says Dr Sarah Karen Zalwango, the new head of public health and the environment at the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA).\nSome argue that the Kiteezi collapse was inevitable because basic common sense was ignored.\n\"You can't take four million people, get all that waste, mingled - degradable and non-degradable - and take it to one dumping site. No, that's not how we [ought to] do it. But we've been doing it for over 20 years,\" Frank Muramuzi, a Kampala-based urban planner, tells the BBC.\nThe Kiteezi landfill was built in 1996, with financing from the World Bank, to provide a single, major depository for solid waste generated by Kampala.\nAs Kampala has grown, so too has its biggest rubbish dump.\nOn the northern edge of the city, it now covers 15 hectares (37 acres) - an area the size of more than 22 football pitches - with its stench spreading further still. \nBirds of prey can be seen flying overhead.\nThe city's residents and businesses generate an estimated 2,500 tonnes of waste every day, half of which ends up in dumping sites across the city - the biggest being Kiteezi.\nBut the problem is that Kiteezi lacks the on-site recycling, sorting and incineration facilities that landfills are supposed to have.\n\"With each layer of trash piled up, the bottom layers become weaker, especially as the decay and decomposition of organic waste increases the temperature,\" Mr Muramuzi explains.\n\"Without vents, methane and other gases remain trapped at the bottom, further multiplying the fragility of the loosely held structure.\"\nYet this can easily be fixed, he adds, so long as the government commits to periodic monitoring and audits which factor in environmental, social and economic needs.\nHad that already been in place, \"the havoc that happened in Kiteezi would have been avoided\", he says.\nSo, if the solution is this simple, why is it not already happening?\nThe answer seems to be a combination of power struggles and financial mismanagement.\nUltimate responsibility for keeping Kampala \"clean, habitable, and sustainable environment\" lies with the KCCA, but Mayor Erias Lukwago, from the opposition Forum for Democratic Change party, says his office lacks the necessary power to enact the changes.\nThe KCCA says it has repeatedly proposed plans to decommission Kiteezi but says the funds needed to do so - $9.7m - exceed the city's budget and have not been made available by central government.\n\"All the support we have been getting is courtesy of development partners and donors like Bill and Melinda Gates, GIZ, and WaterAid\u2026 but their capacity is very limited,\" the Kampala mayor said recently.\n\"If we were getting adequate funding from the central government, we would be very far right now.\"\nThere is no word from the government on whether it will allocate funds for Kampala's biggest dump.\nIt did pay $1,350 to each of the families of the deceased, saying any further money would only be forthcoming if government agencies were \"found to be responsible\".\nA month later, a report furnished by the country's police and crime investigation department led to President Yoweri Museveni - a noted political opponent of Kampala's mayor - sacking three senior KCCA officials, including the authority's executive and public health directors.\nJames Bond Kunobere, Kampala's solid waste management officer, admits that last year's deadly collapse was a much-needed wake-up call.\nAt present, the authorities in the Ugandan capital are drafting plans to turn organic waste into compost and reduce \"unnecessary waste\" coming into the city.\nBut they want the public to take some responsibility too. At the moment people pay one of the seven private waste firms operating in Kampala to collect their rubbish, which is all bundled together with little thought given to recycling.\n\"We haven't changed the mindset of residents to sort waste,\" Mr Kunobere tells the BBC.\n\"If you sort, waste has different destinations. If you mix, it all goes to one - the landfill.\"\nExperts say such initiatives are important but do not address the bigger structural inadequacies at Kiteezi.\nAnd for people whose lives have been shattered by recent events there, it is too little too late.\n\"They promised us compensation, but I haven't received anything - almost everyone is complaining too,\" Mr Prince tells the BBC.\n\"We lost our friend.

        "article_text": "Canada's governing Liberal Party will announce on Sunday who will take over from Justin Trudeau as leader, after a crucial vote that will change the face of Canadian politics.\nAbout 140,000 of the party's members have been voting for their preferred candidate, with results expected to be announced around 18:00 EDT (22:00 GMT).\nThe new leader will become the country's prime minister. But because the Liberals are a minority government, holding onto the top job will require winning a general election, which could be called in the coming weeks.\nWhoever replaces Trudeau will have to grapple with US President Donald Trump's threats against Canada, which include an escalating trade war and repeated calls to make the country the US's \"51st state\".\nThe issue has dominated the campaigns of all four candidates vying for the top job. Here's what to know about them.\nFormer Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney has pitched himself as a strong fiscal manager who can help countries navigate challenging times, including his own.\n\"I've helped manage multiple crises, and I've helped save two economies,\" he said in his campaign launch speech.\nWidely seen as the frontrunner for the job, he's sought to position himself as the man who can steer the country through the fallout caused by Trump's tariffs.\n\"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills,\" he said during a leadership debate last month.\nThe 59-year-old was born in Canada's Northwest Territories and grew up in Edmonton, Alberta. \nHe has sought to highlight his Canadian roots and paint himself as a political outsider. \nHe has served in recent months as a special economics adviser to Trudeau, and has long been considered a contender for the top job, though the Harvard graduate has never held public office.\nTrudeau himself admitted that he had long been trying to recruit Carney to his team.\nCarney tried to distance himself from the unpopular PM, saying he is \"not the only Liberal in Canada who believes that the prime minister and his team let their attention wander from the economy too often\". Trudeau's approval ratings have however improved since Trump's return to office. \nCarney brings with him expertise on environmental matters through his role as the United Nations special envoy on climate action, recently calling the goal of net zero \"the greatest commercial opportunity of our time\".\nHe is a champion of some Liberal policies that have been unpopular, like the federal carbon tax, the party's signature climate policy that critics argue is a financial burden for Canadians.\nHe has recently backed away from the policy, saying in May that it had \"served a purpose up until now\".\nHe has received a number of cabinet endorsements, including Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault and Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly.\nThe Toronto member of parliament became one of the most well-known members of Trudeau's team.\nWhile she had long been seen as a trusted senior official in his inner circle, a rift with the prime minister's office led to her recent abrupt resignation in December. \nThat was a blow to Trudeau's already-shaky hold on power, helping to usher in his own resignation.\nThe two disagreed on how to address President Trump's threat of tariffs, among other financial policies as Canada faced a C$60bn deficit ($42bn; \u00a333bn).\nBorn to a Ukrainian mother in the western province of Alberta, the 56-year-old was a journalist before entering politics.\nShe entered the House of Commons in 2013 and two years later joined Trudeau's cabinet with a trade brief after he swept the party to power.\nAs Minister of Foreign Affairs she helped Canada renegotiate a free trade deal with the US and Mexico. \nShe was later named deputy prime minister and minister of finance and oversaw Canada's financial response to the Covid pandemic.\nA 2019 Globe and Mail profile said depending who you asked, Freeland is either a last, best hope for the liberal world order or an out-of-touch idealist.\nHer steadfast support of Ukraine earned praise in some quarters but the Harvard-educated MP has had her share of critics, including Trump who recently called her \"toxic\".\nIn her launch - walking onto the stage to the 1982 song, Maneater - she leaned into her time renegotiating a trade deal under the first Trump administration, and said she would take on the president again.\n\"I will lead a true Canadian response to the threat we now face. We will be united, we will be strong, we will be smart and that's why we will win,\" she told the crowd of supporters. \nShe has received the backing of Health Minister Mark Holland and Justice Minister Arif Virani, among other MPs. \nKarina Gould, a former trade and investment specialist, has thrown her hat in the ring, declaring she would represent a \"new generation\" if elected. \nShe was first elected in 2015 and has served a number of roles in Trudeau's cabinet - the youngest woman to serve as a minister in Canada. \nThe 37-year-old was families minister, international development minister and later Minister of Democratic Institutions, before taking on her current role as House Leader, where she oversees the government's legislative agenda.\nGould launched her bid by saying \"Canadians have lost trust in our party\".\nShe has taken aim at the US when trying to convince voters to choose her as leader, telling CNBC \"trust has been broken\" between Canada and its southern neighbour.\nShe said fentanyl, one of Trump's justifications for imposing tariffs, comes from Canada in \"miniscule amounts.\"\n\"But if that's what he cares about,\" she said, referring to the US president, \"well then let's put together an inspection team at the border to inspect every truck that goes south for fentanyl and every truck that comes north for illegal guns\".\nFrank Baylis, a former Liberal member of parliament, was the first out of the gate to announce he is seeking the leadership of the party. \nHe has said he will bring his experience from the world of business to address the affordability and cost-of-living challenges facing Canadians. \nBaylis is the executive chairman of a medical device company that was founded by his mother and where he later served as president. It was sold to a US firm in 2021. He is an engineer by training.\nBaylis served in parliament from 2015-2019 and was a founding member of the Parliamentary Black Caucus. \nHe has been heavily critical of Trudeau's approach to Trump's tariff threats and has claimed he would deal with Trump better than his opponents, casting his outsider experience as a businessman as a strength.\n\"Whether we like it or not, the Americans have put as a president a highly aggressive bully of a man, who's a businessman,\" he told The Canadian Press. \"And people coming from a genteel world of bureaucrats or banking, they're not going to know how to deal with this character,\" he said, taking aim at his opponents.\nMany prominent cabinet ministers chose not to run in this race, including Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc, Foreign Minister Melanie Joly and Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, who all said they need to focus on their current duties.\nJaime Battiste, a member of parliament (MP) from the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia, dropped out earlier in the race.\nAnother hopeful, former Toronto area MP Ruby Dhalla, was kicked out of the race over \"extremely serious\" violations, the party said. Those include allegations of inaccuracies in her campaign's financial reporting. Ms Dhalla has appealed the decision. ",

        "article_text": "Australian Grand Prix\nVenue: Albert Park, Melbourne Dates: 14 March-16 March Race start: 04:00 GMT on Sunday, 16 March\nCoverage: Live radio commentary of practice and qualifying on BBC 5 Sports Extra, race live on BBC Radio 5 Live. Live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app\nAfter a three-month break, the 2025 Formula 1 season is almost upon us. \nThe Australian Grand Prix this weekend is the first of 24 races between now and Abu Dhabi in December.\nThere are plenty of talking points with Lewis Hamilton preparing for his Ferrari debut, Max Verstappen chasing a fifth consecutive drivers' title and McLaren hoping to maintain the pace that brought them the constructors' championship in 2024.\nBBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions before the season gets under way in Melbourne.\nWhat is the pragmatic expectation at Ferrari this year? Fernando Alonso, Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc have all failed to win them a championship so far. Is too much expected from Lewis Hamilton? \u2013 Kenneth\nHamilton has been clear - he is going to Ferrari to win an eighth world title.\nWhen a driver of that level goes to such a storied team, it's obvious what the target is. So, questions about whether too much is expected of him miss the point - he and Ferrari expect that of themselves.\nThe impact of such an achievement would be massive.\nHamilton's move to Ferrari has already dramatically increased interest in F1 in the run-up to this season. Imagine what the reaction would be to the sport's most celebrated driver breaking the only remaining all-time record while driving for its most iconic team.\nWill he do it? That depends on two things. Whether the Ferrari car is up to it, and whether Hamilton can beat his team-mate, Charles Leclerc.\nAs for comparisons with Alonso and Vettel, neither managed to win the title they and Ferrari so craved.\nAlonso was plain unlucky - he should have won in 2010 and 2012. He was outstanding in both years, especially in 2012.\nHad it not been for a catastrophic strategy decision in Abu Dhabi in 2010, and two separate assaults from two different Lotus drivers at the start of two different grands prix in 2012, he would have been champion.\nVettel's situation was more complex - arguably he and Ferrari threw away chances in both 2017 and 2018 through a combination of driver errors and team fallibility. Many people believe Alonso would have won at least one of those titles had he stayed at Ferrari.\nBut that was then. The belief is that this is about as good a time as Hamilton could go to Ferrari. \nIn Frederic Vasseur, they have a team boss who has given the team a more international outlook, and is very matter-of-fact and focused on practicality. He seems to be having a good effect and moving them in the right direction.\nNo one knows what will happen. But it is sure is going to be entertaining finding out, however it ends.\nThis video can not be played\n'Arriving in red will be cool' - Hamilton's Melbourne excitment\nWhat would success look like? Key questions for Hamilton at Ferrari\n'I know my time will come' - Russell exclusive\nIs this a critical season for George Russell, especially given the possibility that Max Verstappen might leave Red Bull in the future? - David\nEvery season is critical in F1 - people are always looking for signs of weakness. But the stakes are quite high for Russell this year, and that's almost independent of Max Verstappen.\nRussell is out of contract at the end of the year, and his new team-mate is an 18-year-old rookie, Andrea Kimi Antonelli. From the point of view of his reputation within the sport, Russell has to come out on top.\nIf he doesn't, though, that does not necessarily mean his Mercedes career is over. But it would mean Antonelli had marked himself out as a potential future great.\nIf Verstappen is not available, Toto Wolff will stick with his current driver line-up into 2026 - Russell has come out of three seasons with Lewis Hamilton and just about won bragging rights. He has earned his status as one of F1's very top drivers.\nThe pressure is also on Antonelli, even though his raw talent is believed to be immense. If he is comfortably beaten by Russell, he won't be around long. Such is the way of things in F1.\nIt's a tough world, and only the strongest survive.\nComparing the apparently friendly relationship between Max Verstappen and Lando Norris with the ongoing fallout of the Verstappen-Russell spat, does that show that Verstappen doesn't really fear Norris, but he does fear Russell? \u2013 Joe\nIf you asked that question to Max Verstappen himself, I know exactly what he would say. He fears no one.\nVerstappen is absolutely confident that if he is given a car in which it is possible to win the title, he will win it. Doesn't matter who the opponent is.\nHow he gets on with someone out of the car has no bearing whatsoever on his behaviour in it - you only have to look at last year's Mexico City Grand Prix and his two penalised incidents with Norris to see that.\nHe is as ruthless as they come, and anyone who gets in his way will get the same treatment.\nHow they respond to him off the track is a different question. But Verstappen doesn't care about that either. Friendly, or not. Makes no difference to him. He'll race them just has hard.\nThis video can not be played\nRussell won't 'bow down' to Verstappen\nDo you think the conflict between F1 and the FIA might escalate? Where will it lead?  - Sam\nThere has been for some time widespread concern within Formula 1 about the actions of Mohammed Ben Sulayem, the president of governing body the FIA, and nothing over the winter has changed that.\nBen Sulayem has been embroiled in a series of controversies since he took office in December 2021, and his recent actions in changing the FIA's internal rules to reduce accountability, and codifying a method by which drivers can be banned for swearing have just added to a long list of actions perceived to be problematic by many within the sport.\nAt the moment, though, there is no open conflict between F1 and the FIA, nor between the teams and the FIA.\nHowever, everyone in the sport is very aware of the growing disquiet within the FIA itself - the latest facet of which was revealed by BBC Sport last week in its report on a number of world motorsport council members being barred from its latest meeting, a dispute that could yet see further legal action.\nWith an FIA presidential election looming at the end of the year, the sport's bosses are keeping a close eye on events. But unless Ben Sulayem does something that directly affects F1 business, it is unlikely F1 itself will take any action.\nBut with the drivers unhappy, and the FIA facing a lawsuit from Susie Wolff, and who knows what else coming down the line, this story is not going anywhere any time soon.\nAfter a first-lap red flag, Charles Leclerc managed his tyres to win his home race for the first time in 2024\nAs the FIA has now introduced an extra mandatory pit stop for Monaco, do you think that introducing this across all the grand prix would improve the racing as there would be less tyre saving? \u2013 Andrew\nThe idea of introducing an extra pit stop into the Monaco Grand Prix has been given a guardedly warm response so far.\nThe hope is that this will add extra excitement to the race and reduce its tendency to become a procession.\nLewis Hamilton said he believed it was his idea originally, and added: \"Monaco has to be at least a two-stop. The one-stop was never really great. \n\"That (two stops) won't fix it all. We'll still see some of the issues of not overtaking and stuff, but I think it will make it more exciting.\"\nSome, though, have wondered whether this was a reaction to a particularly bad event last year, which was itself caused by a specific set of circumstances.\nLast year, there was a first-lap crash that led to a red flag. So all the front-runners fitted a set of tyres to get them to the end of the race, and planned not to stop again. That led to Charles Leclerc leading the race at a pedestrian pace and nothing happening.\nBut it's not like that every year. Regardless of the difficulty in overtaking, Monaco has seen a series of interesting races in recent years, some influenced by weather, and others by problems experienced by one driver or another.\nThe mandatory two-stop has been arrived at as a necessary evil - introducing an element of artificiality to ameliorate a specific problem.\nIn general, introducing that level of gimmickry is not something on which the powers that be in F1 are keen.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\nHow to follow Australian Grand Prix on the BBC\nWhat is at stake at under-pressure Red Bull?\nWho are the rookies joining the F1 grid in 2025? \nWho will win F1 drivers' title?

Such is the way of things in F1.It's a tough world, and only the strongest survive.Comparing the apparently friendly relationship between Max Verstappen and Lando Norris with the ongoing fallout of the Verstappen-Russell spat, does that show that Verstappen doesn't really fear Norris, but he does fear Russell?

Follow and listen on the BBC Sport website, app, 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds from 19:30 GMT on 15 March and from 18:00 on 16 March\nWhile negotiations aimed at reunifying men's golf grind to a halt, the PGA Tour is taking steps to speed up play.\nCommissioner Jay Monahan's state of the union news conference, before this week's Players Championship here at Sawgrass, made clear that eradicating slow play has become more of a priority than ever before for a circuit that has always indulged slowcoaches.\nBut this, the tour's marquee tournament, will again be played in the shadow of the ongoing split brought about by the arrival in 2022 of the breakaway LIV tour.\nThis year's Players will play out in the absence of the reigning US Open champion.  Last year the Masters winner was missing and in 2023 there was no title defence.\nThis, of course, is because Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith all play on LIV.\nTheir absence from the PGA Tour is felt more keenly this week than any other. The old debate as to whether the Players is the 'fifth' major is no longer relevant and will not be until the game reunifies.\nHere we have the most stark imperative for a deal to be done with LIV's Saudi backers.\nAn agreement, though, is not imminent. \nMonahan reiterated that no follow-up meetings are in the diary after the recent White House gathering with the Saudi Public Investment Fund's governor Yasir Al Rumayyan ended without settlement.\n\"We appreciate Yasir's innovative vision,\" Monahan said. \"And we can see a future where we welcome him on to our board and work together to move the global game forward.\n\"As part of our negotiations, we believe there's room to integrate important aspects of LIV Golf into the PGA Tour platform. We're doing everything that we can to bring the two sides together.\"\nMonahan added that while his organisation has \"removed some hurdles, others remain\". \nIn other words, something has to give to end the stalemate.\n'Hurdles' in PGA-LIV deal - but Trump 'bolstering' talks\nAnd no matter how hard the golf media tried, the commissioner flat-batted every enquiry as to how that might be achieved.  \nMonahan does not play verbal 'Bazball'; every non-answer dictated by the delicate nature of golf's future.\nWhere he was more forthcoming, was an acceptance - at long last - that men's professional golf has a problem with slow play.  It seems steps are being taken where the biggest offenders will start to be named and shamed.\n\"We've committed to addressing the speed of play,\" Monahan said as he announced working group recommendations that will be implemented to try to erase one of the sport's biggest blights.\n\"We will begin publishing speed-of-play-related statistics later this season,\" he added.  From 14 April testing will begin on the PGA Tour's feeder circuits to impose stroke penalties on the slowest golfers.\nMonahan also confirmed that the use of range finders will be allowed at tournaments between next month's Masters and the US PGA Championship in May to see whether this improves round times.\n\"We're listening to our fans and we're responding, and clearly this is something where they would like to see improvement,\" the commissioner said.\n\"I think there's a real commitment from players across the board to make certain that we're doing everything that we possibly can to improve, and these three steps are just a start.\"\nThis is a marked shift from an organisation that for decades insisted that slow play was not a problem. The rival LIV circuit has imposed stroke penalties on slowcoaches and now the PGA Tour is starting to respond.\n\"I look at this as a very positive development,\" Monahan insisted.\n\"I think it's pretty telling that when you've got six player directors that sit on our boards, and you've got 16 members of our Player Advisory Council, that there's a lot of shaking of heads and there's an understanding that this is an area where we need to improve.\"\nTwo-time major winner Collin Morikawa says publishing data that shows which players are quicker than others, thereby identifying the slowest, is a good idea. \n\"I don't know why you wouldn't want it to be released,\" said the 2021 Open winner.\n\"You just have to start giving guys actual penalties, whether it be strokes or FedExCup (point deductions). What I've learned is that monetary fines are useless.\"\nMorikawa added:  \"What is there to hide, right? If you're slow, you know you're slow. I mean, if you don't know, then there's an issue.\n\"To me, there's no issue with letting it out. It's only going to make things better because then you're either going to have a target on you, put a little more pressure and hopefully you pick it up, or you get penalised. It's very simple.\"\nDouble US PGA Championship winner Justin Thomas agrees that publicly revealing which players are the slowest will have a beneficial effect. \n\"Nobody wants to be known as that,\" said the US Ryder Cup star.\n\"I'm the first to admit I'm on the slow side of players. It bothers me, but I've talked to many officials about it, like I want to know why I'm slow because obviously the first thing that any slower player thinks is that they're not slow.\"\nFans will surely welcome such long-awaited initiatives to improve pace of play on the game's biggest tour.\nBut those awaiting some kind of resolution that brings the game back together are still left playing the waiting game.",

Arakawa was found in a bathroom with scattered pills nearby. Hackman was found near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses. One of their three dogs was found dead in a crate. \nBut a police investigation found no foul play. \nInstead, the case has shed light on the grim realities of Alzheimer's disease, which damages and destroys cells in one's brain over time - taking away memory and other important mental functions. \n\"It's like he was living in a reel,\" Catherine V Piersol, PhD, an occupational therapist with decades of experience in dementia care, told the BBC of how Hackman may have experienced the repeated loss of his wife.\nShe noted patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease like the actor live in the present and are unable to both look back at moments in the past or look forward and act. \n\"I imagine he would be trying to wake her up and not being successful. But then [he] could have been distracted in another room because of one of the dogs or something,\" she described. \nThen later, he'd again notice his wife on the ground and would \"live through it again\", she said. \nThough no one knows how Hackman spent his last days alive, the grim nature of the possibilities were discussed by authorities and the area's medical examiner.\nAt a press conference last week, Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico's chief medical examiner, said Arakawa died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Hackman's death was the result of significant heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor. \nGiven Hackman's advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", Dr Jarrell said.\nHis autopsy indicated he had not eaten recently, though he showed no signs of dehydration. Officials found no evidence that he had communicated with anyone after his wife's death and could not determine whether he was able to care for himself.\nMs Piersol said patients with advanced Alzheimer's aren't able to pick up on environmental cues like light and darkness, making it harder to determine when he should eat, sleep or bathe. \n\"Those [cues] are oftentimes just, no longer available to people at this stage of dementia,\" she said.\nDr Brendan Kelley, a neurologist who specialises in memory and cognition at UT Southwestern Medical Center, explained why Hackman may also not have been able to call authorities for help. He said Alzheimer's disease can leave patients caught between emotional discomfort and the inability to act on it.\n\"A person might feel worried or frightened, but at the same time they might not be capable to take the actions that you or I might normally think to do in order to alleviate that worry or concern, such as calling somebody else, or going to speak to a neighbour.\"\nDr Kelley says Alzheimer's patients experience emotions like pain and sadness, and experience physical needs like hunger and thirst, it's just harder for them to identify what they are feeling.\nHe said missing meals could also increase levels of confusion and agitation.\nThe couple's deaths and the startling details of Hackman living in the home for a week after his wife's passing has shocked the Santa Fe area, where the couple had lived for more than 20 years. \n\"It's just absolutely devastating,\" says Jeffery Gomez, a long-time resident of the city, who remembers seeing Hackman around town in his different cars, always with a smile on his face.\nHis partner, Linda, said the details were triggering, explaining she cared for her elderly mother with dementia. \"Even when you have help, it's a lot,\" she said. \n\"We know Gene and his wife were very private people and she was probably trying to shield him from the public,\" she added, \"but the thought of doing that alone? It's a lot to shoulder.\"\nLaura N Gitlin, PhD, a behavioural scientist who researches ways to support caregivers told the BBC, this is becoming a common problem among caregivers. \n\"With the aging of a population, we also simultaneously have a shrinking of the number of people in the family, number of children, or relatives who live nearby,\" she explained. \nMs Gitlin noted along with there being fewer caregivers, there is less support for these individuals on making big decisions - such as when it's time to place a loved one in a home instead of caring for them by yourself. \nJeffery Gomez said he couldn't understand how no one checked in on the couple for such a long while.  \n\"It breaks my heart he was alone so long.\" \nA list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump called a meeting of his cabinet secretaries on Thursday to discuss Elon Musk and his efforts to slash government spending and personnel numbers.\nIt turned heated, according to media reports.\nMusk accused Secretary of State Marco Rubio of failing to cut enough staff at the state department, reports the New York Times.\nThe tech mogul told Rubio he was \"good on TV\", according to the newspaper, pointedly skipping any praise of his work as America's top diplomat.\nThe billionaire also clashed with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy over whether Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) task force had tried to lay off air traffic controllers who were already in short supply in the Federal Aviation Administration, according to the New York Times.\nDuffy's department has been under scrutiny after two US airline crashes since Trump took office in January. \nAfter listening to the back-and-forth, the Republican president reportedly intervened to make clear he still supported Doge, but from now on cabinet secretaries would be in charge and the Musk team would only advise. \nA state department spokeswoman told the newspaper Rubio felt the cabinet meeting was an \"open and productive discussion\". The White House has not responded to BBC requests for further comment.\nSpeaking in the Oval Office after the meeting, Trump said cabinet members should decide who to cut, but if they didn't, Musk would do the job.\n\"I had a meeting, and I said I want the cabinet members to go first\", Trump said. \"And if they can cut it's better, if they don't cut, then Elon will do the cutting.\"\nThe hastily planned gathering could provide evidence that the president has decided to curtail the sweeping power the SpaceX and Tesla boss and his Doge cost-cutting initiative have commanded in the early weeks of his administration.\nTrump first commented on the substance of Thursday's meeting, which was disclosed only in after-the-fact media reports, through a post that evening on his social media site, Truth Social.\nHe said that he had instructed his secretaries to work with Doge on \"cost-cutting measures\".\n\"As the secretaries learn about, and understand, the people working for the various departments, they can be very precise as to who will remain, and who will go,\" he wrote, adding that they should use a \"scalpel\" not a \"hatchet\".\nJust a few weeks ago, Musk wielded a shiny chainsaw at a conservative conference \u2013 a visible symbol of aggressive attempts to slash government spending that have angered Democrats and concerned some officials in the Trump administration.\nMusk's team had sent multiple emails from an official government account to millions of federal workers, encouraging them to accept months of advance pay in exchange for their resignations.\nFederal workers were instructed to provide accounts of their weekly accomplishments or risk firing \u2013 a request some agencies instructed their employees to ignore.\nDoge also ordered the dismissal of many newly hired government employees who, because of their \"probationary\" status, did not have full civil service protections. \nSome government agencies have since rescinded these orders because employees deemed essential, such as those who oversee nuclear weapon security, had been affected.\nDuring an Oval Office event on Friday, Trump responded to questions about the cabinet meeting \u2013 and reports of its heated exchanges. He insisted there was \"no clash\". He praised both Rubio and Musk and said the two got along \"great\".\nTrump's Thursday Truth Social post, however, appears to give department heads more authority to push back against Musk. \nIt also may be an attempt to insulate the Trump administration from lawsuits that allege Musk is wielding too much power for someone who, unlike cabinet secretaries, is not subject to Senate review and confirmation.\nSeveral federal judges overseeing these cases have already expressed concern about Musk's authority \u2013 concerns that may be further fuelled by Trump's comments during his address to Congress on Tuesday that the billionaire was, in fact, the man in charge of Doge.\nMusk and Trump have formed a formidable partnership so far \u2013 as the richest man in the world and the most powerful politician in America. Washington has been rife with speculation for months about whether that partnership could ultimately fracture.\nThose predictions, however, have usually been followed by renewed signs of comity between the two men. \nOn Friday night, Musk was seen boarding Air Force One with the president for a flight to Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida for the weekend.\nThe cabinet room dust-up may be the first crack in the foundation \u2013 but there is plenty of evidence that Trump still supports Musk's broader efforts and goals, even if he might prefer he use a scalpel in the days ahead, not a chainsaw.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

A spokesperson said it was a \"childish, criminal act\". \nPolice Scotland confirmed it was investigating the incident.\nPresident Trump caused widespread international criticism after repeatedly proposing to empty the Gaza strip of all Palestinians.\nHe proposed taking ownership of the Gaza Strip and redeveloping it, after saying earlier that Palestinians should move out of the region.\n\"The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too,\" Trump said during a joint conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last month.\nTrump made the comments after meeting with the Israeli leader at the White House. Netanyahu responded, saying the idea is \"worth paying attention to\".\nThe US president has previously said neighbouring nations could take in displaced Palestinians from Gaza - a proposal that was rejected by Arab nations.\nThe president later posted an AI-generated video of what Gaza might look like under his proposals.\nTurnberry is widely rated as one of the top five golf courses in the world.\nIt has hosted The Open Championship four times, including in 1977 when Tom Watson beat Jack Nicklaus in what famously became known as the \"Duel In The Sun\".\nBut it has not been included on the Open schedule since Trump bought the resort in 2014.\nThe Turnberry resort underwent a massive refurbishment after it was bought from a Dubai-based company in 2014.\nIt became the organisation's second golf resort in Scotland. Trump International Golf Links opened north of Aberdeen in 2012, after years of controversy.\nTrump was moved to build a course in Scotland as a tribute to his later mother, who was born and brought up in Lewis.\nThe president has been a regular visitor to Scotland over the years and last month was invited to meet King Charles at Balmoral. \nPalestine Action describes itself as a \"direct action network dismantling British complicity with Israeli apartheid\".\nA statement from the group said: \"Palestine Action rejects Donald Trump's treatment of Gaza as though it were his property to dispose of as he likes. \n\"To make that clear, we have shown him that his own property is not safe from acts of resistance.

But with the early onset of summer this year, the company is staring at a washout season and having to shift gears.  \n\"We've had to start making t-shirts instead of sweaters as the winter is getting shorter with each passing year. Our sales have halved in the last five years and are down a further 10% during this season,\" Goel told the BBC. \"The only recent exception to this was Covid, when temperatures dropped significantly.\"\nAcross India as cool weather beats a hasty retreat, anxieties are building up at farms and factories, with cropping patterns and business plans getting upended.\nData from the Indian Meteorological Department shows that last month was India's hottest February in 125 years. The weekly average minimum temperature was also above normal by 1-3C in many parts of the country.\nAbove-normal maximum temperatures and heatwaves are likely to persist over most parts of the country between March and May, the weather agency has warned.\nFor small business owners like Goel, such erratic weather has meant much more than just slowing sales. His whole business model, practised and perfected over decades, has had to change.\nGoel's company supplies clothes to multi-brand outlets across India. And they are no longer paying him on delivery, he says, instead adopting a \"sale or return\" model where consignments not sold are returned to the company, entirely transferring the risk to the manufacturer.\nHe has also had to offer bigger discounts and incentives to his clients this year.\n\"Big retailers haven't picked up goods despite confirmed orders,\" says Goel, adding that some small businesses in his town have had to shut shop as a result.\nNearly 1,200 miles away in Devgad town on India's western coast, the heat has wreaked havoc on India's much-loved Alphonso mango orchards.\n\"Production this year would be only around 30% of the normal yield,\" said Vidyadhar Joshi, a farmer who owns 1,500 trees.\nThe sweet, fleshy and richly aromatic Alphonso is a prized export from the region, but yields across the districts of Raigad, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri, where the variety is predominantly grown, are lower, according to Joshi.\n\"We might make losses this year,\" Joshi adds, because he has had to spend more than usual on irrigation and fertilisers in a bid to salvage the crop.\nAccording to him, many other farmers in the area were even sending labourers, who come from Nepal to work in the orchards, back home because there wasn't enough to do.\nScorching heat is also threatening winter staples such as wheat, chickpea and rapeseed.\nWhile the country's agriculture minister has dismissed concerns about poor yields and predicted that India will have a bumper wheat harvest this year, independent experts are less hopeful.\nHeatwaves in 2022 lowered yields by 15-25% and \"similar trends could follow this year\", says Abhishek Jain of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (Ceew) think tank.\nIndia - the world's second largest wheat producer - will have to rely on expensive imports in the event of such disruptions. And its protracted ban on exports, announced in 2022, may continue for even longer.\nEconomists are also worried about the impact of rising temperatures on availability of water for agriculture.\nReservoir levels in northern India have already dropped to 28% of capacity, down from 37% last year, according to Ceew. This could affect fruit and vegetable yields and the dairy sector, which has already experienced a decline in milk production of up to 15% in some parts of the country.\n\"These things have the potential to push inflation up and reverse the 4% target that the central bank has been talking about,\" says Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist with Bank of Baroda.\nFood prices in India have recently begun to soften after remaining high for several months, leading to rate cuts after a prolonged pause.\nGDP in Asia's third largest economy has also been supported by accelerating rural consumption recently after hitting a seven-quarter low last year. Any setback to this farm-led recovery could affect overall growth, at a time when urban households have been cutting back and private investment hasn't picked up.\nThink tanks like Ceew say a range of urgent measures to mitigate the impact of recurrent heatwaves needs to be thought through, including better weather forecasting infrastructure, agriculture insurance and evolving cropping calendars with climate models to reduce risks and improve yields.\nAs a primarily agrarian country, India is particularly vulnerable to climate change.\nCeew estimates three out of every four Indian districts are \"extreme event hotspots\" and 40% exhibit what is called \"a swapping trend\" - which means traditionally flood-prone areas are witnessing more frequent and intense droughts and vice-versa.\nThe country is expected to lose about 5.8% of daily working hours due to heat stress by 2030, according to one estimate. Climate Transparency, the advocacy group, had pegged India's potential income loss across services, manufacturing, agriculture and construction sectors from labour capacity reduction due to extreme heat at $159bn in 2021- or 5.4% of its GDP.\nWithout urgent action, India risks a future where heatwaves threaten both lives and economic stability.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "James Finlayson failed to make it as a lead man in Holywood but became one of the most memorable comic foils ever to grace the silver screen.\nThe Scottish actor performed in more than 100 films but was best known for being the \"third man\" to Laurel and Hardy. \nWith his distinctive fake moustache, he starred with the iconic duo in 33 of their films and later became the inspiration for Homer Simpson's \"D'oh!\" catchphrase.\nNow Finlayson has been memorialised with a new portrait in the Scottish theatre where he first tread the boards more than a century ago. \nDobbie Hall in his hometown of Larbert, Stirling, commissioned the oil painting to celebrate the actor's career and rise to international fame in the early days of cinema. \nThe portrait by young artist Connor Draycott was unveiled by Finlayson's family, some of whom had travelled from the US for the occasion.\nThey were joined by fans of the black and white movies and \"talkies\" from the UK chapters of Sons of the Desert, named after the fictional lodge that Laurel and Hardy belonged to in the 1933 film of the same name. \nFinlayson, known as Fin to his fans and as Jimmy to his good friend Stan Laurel, was born in Larbert in 1887.\nHe worked for a while as a tinsmith in his father's foundry before moving to Edinburgh to study and then pursue an acting career. \nAt the age of 23 he was performing at the Theatre Royal, but his ambitions were not satisfied. \nAfter the death of his parents he moved to New York with his brother.\nWithin the year he had landed a role on Broadway in The Great Game, for which reviews offered \"nothing but praise\". \nIn May 1912, the New York Dramatic Mirror said Finlayson had \"an excellent opportunity, which he did not miss, for developing two characters in his one role - the simple, naive Scotsman and the artful, determined detective\". \nIt added: \"The remarkable thing is that he managed to do them both at the same time.\"\nHe took on another Scottish character in the Broadway production of Bunty Pulls the Strings, but pulled out of the national tour in 1916 when Holywood beckoned. \nBy 1919 he was signed with the \"King of Comedy\" Mack Sennet, appearing as a Keystone Cop and lauded as a \"legitimate and screen player of international celebrity\".\nAfter a move to Hal Roach at Culver City in 1923, Finlayson was tested in different billings, sometimes in a lead role or as one of a comic trio with up-and-coming comics Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. \nHe eventually found his niche as their established comic support or antagonist. \nBy the time he died aged 66 in 1953, he had more than 100 film credits to his name and his eccentric mannerisms were internationally recognised. \nThe double-take, the squint then a one-eyed stare and raised eyebrow - Finlayson's madcap facial expressions became his trademark, along with the drawn-out \"dohhhh\".\nIt inspired Dan Castellaneta when he voiced Homer in The Simpsons, which first aired in 1989. \nIt is also said Finlayson's fake walrus moustache allowed him a degree of anonymity even in his heyday in Holywood. \nThe artist who created his new portrait said he toyed with the idea of picturing the actor without his famous facial hair. \nDraycott, who is studying fine art at Glasgow School of Art, was commissioned to produce the artwork by the Dobbie Hall Trust.\nIt wanted to commemorate the Larbert man's global success and inspire young performers who appear in shows at the theatre.\nDraycott, 20, said it was an honour to be asked to create the portrait for the theatre.\nAnd he revealed he spent hours watching Finlayson's films to \"recreate his trademark facial expression\". \nDraycott said: \"James is such a well-known face among fans of black and white movies and I wanted to capture the distinctive look that made him a real superstar of his day.\" \nThe award-winning artist said he was fascinated by Finlayson's look and story.\nHe added: \"There was initially some debate as to whether I should include his moustache in the portrait, as it was actually a false moustache that he wore specially for filming, but we decided that his moustache was such an integral part of his unique look that it should feature in the painting.\"\n\"I like the fact that despite his face being so well-known during the 19040s and 50's he could apparently remove the moustache and walk around Hollywood without being recognised by members of the public.\"\nBut now, thanks to his portrait, new generations in his hometown will recognise the young man from Larbert who followed his dream all the way to Holywood.",

        "article_text": "If a passenger dies on board a flight, cabin crew members like Jay Robert have to think fast.\n\"We go from service to lifesaving to mortician, dealing with dead bodies and then doing crowd control,\" the 40-year-old says. \"We're having to calculate: 'Okay, we still need to serve 300 people breakfast or dinner and we have to deal with this'.\"\nJay, a cabin manager for a major European airline and a former crew member for Emirates, has more than a decade's experience working on planes. Like all cabin crew, he has been trained to deal with passenger deaths, but has only experienced one himself.\nHe says deaths on planes are \"very uncommon\" and that people are more likely to die on longer flights because of the physical toll of being immobile for a long period. Some flight crew don't experience an on-board fatality during their entire career, he says.\nA study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2013 concluded that dying on a flight was \"rare\". The study, which looked at emergency calls from five airlines to a medical communications centre between January 2008 and October 2010, found that 0.3% of patients who had an in-flight medical emergency died.\nLast month, an Australian couple spoke about their \"traumatic\" experience of sitting next to a body on a plane from Melbourne to Doha after a woman died during the flight.\nMitchell Ring and Jennifer Colin said cabin crew placed her corpse, covered in blankets, next to Mr Ring for the remaining four hours of the flight without offering to move him. Qatar Airways said it followed appropriate guidelines and apologised for \"any inconvenience or distress this incident may have caused\".\nBBC News has spoken to cabin crew and other aviation experts about how mid-air deaths are usually handled, what the rules are around storing corpses on planes and what it's like to work on a flight when someone has died.\nFlight crew themselves can't certify a death - this has to be done by medical personnel. Sometimes, this happens on the plane if there's someone qualified on board but more often, it is done upon landing. Most airlines follow the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) guidelines on what to do if a passenger has been presumed dead, though policies vary slightly by airline.\nIn a medical emergency, cabin crew would administer first aid and seek help from any passengers who were medical professionals, while the captain would use a telecommunications system to get instructions from emergency doctors on the ground, says Marco Chan, a former commercial pilot and a senior lecturer at Buckinghamshire New University. If necessary, the captain would divert the flight as soon as possible.\nBut it's not always possible to save a passenger.\nIf a passenger is presumed dead, the person's eyes should be closed and they should be placed in a body bag, if available, or otherwise, covered with a blanket up to the neck, according to the IATA guidelines.\nPlanes have very limited space, and it's a challenge to find a suitable spot to place the body without disturbing other passengers and compromising the plane's safety. Per the IATA, the body should be moved to a seat away from other passengers or to another area of the plane, if possible. But if the plane is full, they would usually be returned to their own seat.\nIn a narrow-body plane - those typically used for short-haul flights across the UK or within Europe - there isn't enough room on board \"to really shield a passenger from what has happened\", says Ivan Stevenson, associate professor in aviation management at Coventry University.\nSpace on these planes is \"very, very confined\", he says. \"If someone dies on board an aircraft like that, it's quite likely they will need to be placed in a seat.\"\nProf Stevenson acknowledges it's \"very unfortunate, very unpleasant\" but that crew have to put the plane's safety first.\nCrew will \"try to give some decency to the dead body\" by placing it on an empty aisle and using curtains, blankets and dim lights, Jay says, but they might not have much choice.\nThe body can't be placed in the galley in case it blocks an emergency exit. It also can't be left in the aisles in case there is an emergency evacuation, Jay says, or placed in the crew rest area on a long-haul flight. \nIt's also hard to physically manoeuvre a body in such a confined space, Jay says. This is what happened in the Qatar Airways case, when Mr Ring said the deceased passenger couldn't be carried down the aisle.\nA plane would divert to save a passenger's life in the event of a medical emergency - but it usually wouldn't if they were already presumed dead, aviation experts and cabin crew say. There's \"no point diverting\", Mr Chan says.\nThe captain would inform both the airline's operations centre and air traffic control of the passenger's death as soon as possible, and the plane would be met by local authorities, Prof Stevenson says. Either local authorities or a representative from the airline would contact the passenger's family if they were flying alone.\nAlly Murphy, who hosts the Red Eye Podcast where she interviews flight attendants, experienced one passenger death during a flight in her 14 years working as cabin crew.\nA male passenger who had been travelling alone from Accra, Ghana, to London passed out in his seat. After being alerted by the passenger in the seat next to him, the crew realised he wasn't breathing normally and didn't have a pulse.\nThe crew moved the man to the galley to perform CPR. \"You're kind of trapped in a tin can that's not designed for roaming around,\" Ally recalls. But there was more space than usual in the galley because the carts were out for meal service.\nAlly and another crew member performed CPR for 40 minutes without success. The captain then decided to divert the plane to Lyon, France, and though Ally and her colleague knew they should have strapped themselves in for landing, they continued performing CPR the whole time, she says.\n\"We didn't want to leave him.\"\nAfter landing, paramedics took the passenger away. He was declared dead, having suffered an abdominal aortic aneurysm, Ally recalls.\n\"I held him in my arms for the final moments of his life,\" she says. \"He probably would have chosen someone else for that, but he got me.\"\nAfter the plane set off again following the diversion, the passengers were \"quite quiet and sombre,\" she says. But on arrival at their destination airport, one passenger from the flight started shouting at her because he missed his connecting flight. \n\"That's the one and only time that I've ever told a passenger where to go,\" she says.\nWitnessing a passenger dying was a traumatic experience for Ally.\n\"I went home and sat in the bath and I cried.

Some of those internal messages are repeated by players in interviews, but without context as to why Brendon is saying them - things like 'we don't care about winning' - that is nonsense. \n\"Sometimes you have got to be above the players and you have got to drag them up, and sometimes when things are going well you've got to be below them and bring them down - and that does happen, too.\" \nComments which caused a stir include Ben Duckett saying it did not matter that England lost 3-0 to India as long as they went on to win the Champions Trophy, while in September last year Harry Brook said \"if you get caught somewhere on the boundary, then who cares?\" when asked about his side's batting approach.\nBut Key added that McCullum is a \"master\" at knowing the differences between his players, such as who needs a harder approach and who thrives by being more relaxed.\n\"After the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston, an absolute rollercoaster, Brendon said something along the lines of how those close games feel like ones you've won,\" Key added.\n\"So that's why it is annoying when it is taken out of context. What he's trying to do is lift everyone, he's trying to make sure they don't walk out feeling like the world has ended because they are gutted, but they still have four Tests left to play.\"\nTest Match Special podcast: Rob Key\nStokes considered as England white-ball captain\n'Karachi a familiar low - England's rebuild starts here'\nKey also denied suggestions he and the England management had put too much focus on Test cricket which resulted in poor results from the white-ball side. \nHe said that during Joe Root's tenure as Test captain, he was often playing without his full-strength XI but this winter the selection decisions were inevitable.\n\"The white-ball team [when I started] were the best or one of the best in the world, and they had done a lot of work with an era of cricketers who were very established and experienced and knew exactly what they were doing,\" said Key.\n\"The problem that we found this winter is that we had a decision to make - and it wasn't a matter of choosing between white and red ball - it was more the fact that it is almost impossible to have your best team play in both formats now.\" \nEngland played three Tests in Pakistan in October, a white-ball series in the Caribbean started a day after that series ended and then three further Tests in New Zealand followed. \nKey said he would have made the same selections again because of the complexity of the schedule.\n\"It meant that the white-ball team suffered, but there was almost no choice,\" he said. \n\"It was either one or the other. Every step along the way we've had to make a call of 'you can only have your best team at one of these series'.\" \nKey's next significant decision will be to appoint Jos Buttler's successor as white-ball captain after he stood down at the end of the Champions Trophy. The process will take time and Key said he has not had any conversations with current Test skipper Stokes about the vacancy. \nEngland next play a one-off Test against Zimbabwe in May, followed by a white-ball series against West Indies.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Never has there been so much international interest in Greenland and its election, after President Donald Trump said he wanted to make the semi-autonomous Danish territory part of the US.\nAround 44,000 Greenlanders out of a population of 57,000 are eligible to vote to elect 31 MPs, as well as the country's government.\nSix parties are on the ballot. Five favour Greenland's independence from Denmark, differing only on how quickly that should come about.\nThe current prime minister, Mute B Egede, has made clear that Greenland is not for sale and deserves to be \"treated with respect\".\nHis party Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA) is projected to come out top with 31% of the vote, followed by the social democrat Simiut.\nThere are 72 polling stations scattered around Greenland's coast and voting continues until 20:00 (22:00 GMT), with results expected early on Wednesday.\nThe sheer size of Greenland and the remoteness of many of its settlements and small towns means delivering ballots on time can be a challenge. \nNo two towns are connected by road or rail, and the island is exposed to extreme Arctic weather.\nBack in 2018, the 55 residents of Savissivik in northern Greenland never received their ballots due to inclement weather, according to Danish reports. So an Air Greenland base manager on his 4x4 and a local hunter on dog sled joined forces to deliver the ballots on time.\nPlanes, helicopters, ships, speedboats, cars, snowmobiles and dog sleds are routinely employed to ensure ballots reach all corners of the country before the election.\nWhen the polls close, stations send their results in by email to Greenland's five municipalities to be added to the tally.\nAt the last parliamentary election in Greenland in 2021, the voter turnout was 65.9%.\nThe state of the healthcare system, social issues, fisheries and the economy have all been discussed over the course of the electoral campaign.\nBut it is the question of Greenland's independence from Denmark which has dominated the debate.\nAlthough it now semi-autonomous, Greenland has been controlled by Denmark \u2013 nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away \u2013 for about 300 years.\nNaleraq - currently the largest opposition party - has gained momentum and promises to hold a snap vote on independence within three to four years.\nOther parties are more careful and have avoided giving exact timelines.\nSevering ties with Denmark would be a big blow to Greenland's economy, which depends on the fisheries sector. Danish subsidies currently contribute more than $565m (\u00a3435m) a year - a fifth of its total economic output or GDP.\n\"At the moment, [Greenland] is not ready for independence,\" the director of the Bank of Greenland Martin Kviesgaard told Danish media on the eve of the election. \"It will take many years to become completely ready for it, if you are talking about becoming financially self-sufficient... Fishing is not enough.\"\nPast colonial wrongdoings have meant that Denmark has largely kept out of the independence debate. \nPrime Minister Mette Frederiksen has repeatedly said it is for Greenlanders to decide their future.\nThe US president first floated the idea of buying Greenland in 2019, towards the end of his first term in office.\nHowever, since the start of this year, he has expressed interest in acquiring the Arctic island with increasing frequency, to the alarm of many in Greenland as well as Denmark.\nIn January, Trump's son Donald Jr. visited Greenland on what he said was a \"personal day-trip\" but which sparked real nervousness that the Trumps' interest was not just fleeting.\nGreenland lies on the shortest route from North America to Europe, making it strategically important for the US. \nIt also has a large American space facility and reserves of valuable minerals which have so far proved hard to exploit. \nLast week, Trump told the US Congress \"we're going to get [Greenland] - one way or the other\".\nThe president's shadow has therefore loomed large over this election. \nAt the final candidates' debate on Sunday night, five out of six party leaders said they did not believe the US president could be trusted.\nIf Greenland does eventually choose independence from Denmark, it would then have the freedom to pursue closer ties and become far more exposed to US interest.\nSo it is unsurprising that in January Donald Trump reposted a 2019 poll that indicated 68% of Greenlanders supported independence from Denmark.\nTrump's comments on Greenland caused barely concealed panic in Copenhagen earlier this year. \nMette Frederiksen spent much of January holding crisis talks with her government as well as other Scandinavian and European leaders. She also spoke to Trump on the phone on more than one occasion.\nThe frantic diplomacy has cooled in recent weeks as Ukraine and other global issues took centre stage in Washington.\nBut as Greenlanders voted on Tuesday, Danish foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen made an oblique reference to President Trump, saying that \"major powers have a different interest in Greenland than they have had before\".\nOf course it was important, he added diplomatically, \"that Greenland elects some steadfast politicians to lead the country through it\".",

        "article_text": "When Branneisha Cooper was overweight, she felt both invisible and like she stood out.\nHer friends would get attention when they were out together, while she was overlooked. But she also had a sense that everyone was staring at her, scrutinising her.\nEveryday scenarios were daunting: fairground rides (would she fit in the seat?), working out (would it hurt?), clothes shopping (would she find attractive clothing in her size?).\nAt the end of 2022, Branneisha, now 28 and working in Texas for a major retailer, began using weight-loss injection Mounjaro. She's lost about six stone (38kg).\nThings changed quickly. Suddenly, she could exercise without her body getting sore, colleagues made more small talk with her and she felt comfortable going on adventurous dates with her boyfriend. She was go-karting, dancing and going to arcades - activities that previously made her feel self-conscious.\nBut despite feeling like she had a \"second chance at life\", weight loss was bittersweet.\n\"It was almost like I had stepped into a different world overnight,\" Branneisha recalls. \"People were suddenly more friendly, more attentive, and I was given opportunities and respect that didn't exist before.\"\n\"That rapid shift was jarring and really opened my eyes to just how deeply size bias is ingrained in our culture,\" she continues. \"Psychologically, it was a lot to process because while I was the same person, the way I was perceived had completely changed.\"\nWeight-loss transformations are nothing new. In the 90s and 00s, they filled the pages of tabloid newspapers, sold celebrity diet regimes and inspired popular TV series like The Biggest Loser, You Are What You Eat and Celebrity Fit Club.\nBut in the 2020s, the advent of weight-loss injections like semaglutide and tirzepatide (marketed under brand names Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro) has meant people can lose huge amounts of weight rapidly, without undergoing invasive surgery. The jabs suppress people's appetites, causing them to feel fuller sooner.\nWegovy has been available on the NHS in England, Wales and Scotland since September 2023 with strict eligibility criteria, but weight-loss drugs are expected to become more accessible when Mounjaro becomes available through NHS England later this year.\nThe jabs, which are not suitable for everyone and can have severe side effects, are also available from pharmacies in the UK for people who can't get them prescribed by their GPs.\nSo other than the physical difference, how does the way you're perceived change when you lose weight quickly and look different to the world?\nPeople who have used the injections have told BBC News that rapid weight loss has caused a massive shift in the way they are treated - by both strangers and loved ones - as well as a change in how they approach their lives.\nBranneisha's feeling of sticking out and being overlooked at the same time while overweight is one others can relate to.\nWhen you're overweight, people either avoid eye contact or \"really stare and glare at you\", says Jess Phillips, 29, a primary school teacher from Sittingbourne, Kent.\nShe previously felt uncomfortable taking flights, travelling on public transport and eating at restaurants. Finding suitable seating worried her, as well as the feeling she was \"taking other people's space\".\nPeople had even shouted \"fat\" at her from cars and at a festival.\nA trip in 2023 to Sorrento, on the Italian coast, was a major catalyst for starting weight-loss injections last June.\n\"Everyone was staring at me the whole time,\" she says. \"They're just not used to people being that big out there.\"\nSince losing weight, Jess has noticed a big difference in how she's treated in public.\n\"Strangers seem to be a lot more chatty with me than they ever were before,\" she explains.\nShe feels \"more invisible in a nice way\", she continues. \"I don't feel like people are looking at me when I go to different places. I feel nicely anonymous... I'm not standing out in any particular way.\"\nThis is something that Jeannine A Gailey, sociology professor at Texas Christian University, explored in her 2014 book The Hyper(in)visible Fat Woman.\n\"My argument is that those who are marginalised, including fat people, become hyper-visible and hyper-invisible\", meaning they're sometimes ignored and sometimes made into a \"spectacle\", she tells the BBC.\nAmy Toon, 34, a content creator from Solihull, felt this way. Before starting on the drugs, she shopped online \"because of the overwhelming fear of people looking at me\", she says. \"I just didn't want to leave the house.\"\nSince losing weight, \"people are a lot more smiley and just make eye contact,\" she says. \"I never had that before. It's really strange and it's also really sad at the same time.\"\nSociety has preconceptions about how overweight people are expected to behave, and treats them accordingly, says Caleb Luna, an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara specialising in fat studies.\n\"Fat people are expected to hide and shrink ourselves and not be proud,\" says Prof Luna.\nWeight isn't a protected characteristic in the UK or in most other parts of the world, meaning it isn't illegal to discriminate based on size, except if the person's weight is classed as a disability.\nAcademics say that anti-fat bias can have significant implications, from how people are perceived in job interviews to how doctors interact with them. People make \"all kinds of personality assumptions\" about other people based on their body size, according to Prof Luna.\n\"I don't understand why there's this rage that some people seem to feel upon looking at someone who's overweight,\" says Alix Harvey, a 35-year-old marine biologist from Plymouth who's lost around three stone (20kg) after starting weight-loss injections last year. \"It's socially acceptable to hate fat people.\"\nWeight-loss drugs have helped people like Branneisha, Jess, Amy and Alix lose weight - but they're not right for everyone. Some in the healthcare industry have concerns about the wrong people getting hold of the jabs - including those who are already a healthy weight or have a history of eating disorders.\nCommon side effects of semaglutide and tirzepatide include diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice). Rarer side effects include acute gallstone disease and pancreatitis, and the NHS warns that there is also a risk of hypoglycaemia, which happens when your blood sugar level drops too low.\nJonathan Pinkney, professor of endocrinology and diabetes at the University of Plymouth, says while there are \"great expectations and hope around the drugs\", trials show people \"do tend to relapse\" after they stop taking them, meaning the weight loss isn't sustained.\nAlix says this worries her. \"Am I going to be treated differently again? Because I like the way I'm currently being treated.\"\nSome people who take the medication say there's stigma attached to using the drugs to lose weight, too, which Alix says puts some people off taking the injections.\n\"I didn't expect the hatred,\" she says, noting that some people see the use of weight-loss injections as \"cheating\" and a \"socially unacceptable\" way to lose weight.\n\"A lot of people see it as the lazy way out,\" Amy says, referring to comments about weight-loss drugs left on her social media videos.\nFor sustained weight loss, the injections need to be used as part of a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise.\n\"People think that it's a magic wand then it's not,\" Amy says. \"It doesn't just melt the fat away.\"\n\"Even if you injected yourself once a week and a pound a week just evaporated from your body, what would that matter?\" Alix says. \"Why is that cheating?\"\n\"You basically can't win,\" she says, referring to the stigma attached to both being overweight and using injections to lose weight.\nPeople who've lost weight using the jabs tell the BBC their self-confidence has massively improved. Many say they feel much happier to take trains and planes. Some say they now wear brighter colours and tighter clothes. Others say they're more vocal sharing their opinions at work. \nAmy says she now feels comfortable taking her children swimming, while Jess says she's been able to book her first-ever ski trip, something she'd never thought was possible before.\n\"I actually think it must be annoying how confident I am at the moment,\" Jess laughs.\nBut many of the women we spoke to were left feeling sad for their previous selves, or frustrated at the unfairness of their past treatment.\n\"It's so sad that your weight can define you,\" Amy says. \"I haven't changed at all as a person. The only thing that has changed my appearance.\"\nBranneisha echoes these thoughts.\n\"It makes me sad when I have experiences that are different now because the larger me deserved that same attention and love,\" Branneisha says. \"Being smaller now makes me sad for my former self because people looked at me differently.\"",

        "article_text": "You would never say Arsenal and Manchester United are having similar seasons, but Sunday's Premier League stalemate at Old Trafford was a reminder that they have something in common - a problem to solve up front.\nWhile the Gunners' attacking flaw appears to be a glaring one, in that they have played much of this campaign without a recognised centre-forward, United do have some strikers, but their regular failure to find the net has left people questioning whether they are good enough to help Ruben Amorim's side climb the table.\nWayne Rooney had sympathy for Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund when he analysed their display for his former club on Match of the Day 2, but felt Arsenal's issue again proved costly after watching them lose even more ground to Liverpool in an increasingly one-sided title race.\n\"I always feel the teams with the best number nines have the best chance of winning things,\" United's all-time record goalscorer, who won five Premier League titles, told BBC Sport.\n\"Liverpool are probably an exception to that, with the way they rotate the player they use through the middle, rather than having a regular number nine that the team is built around.\n\"The number nine is still so important for them, though. Mohamed Salah, cutting in from wide areas, is their main goalscorer but, whether it is Luis Diaz, Diogo Jota or Darwin Nunez in the centre, they all chip in with a good amount of goals.\"\nThis video can not be played\nHojlund needs more confidence to start scoring  - Rooney\nLiverpool have scored 17 more league goals than Arsenal this season - a simple statistic but a telling one, even taking into account the leaders have played one game more.\nWith Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz out for the season and another key attacker, Bukayo Saka, absent, it has been left to midfielder Mikel Merino to fill in as an emergency striker for Mikel Arteta's side in the way he did against United, this time with little effect.\nWhile the Gunners controlled the game for long periods, goalscorer Declan Rice conceded afterwards that they did not have the cutting edge needed. Rooney felt a specialist finisher was what they were missing.\n\"A proper number nine - a forward who has played there his whole life - brings  something different to any team,\" he explained.\n\"I am talking about that natural goalscoring instinct, which a player who is trying to learn the position probably doesn't have.\n\"A midfielder playing forward like Merino can get hold of the ball and bring others into play, but what a goalscorer brings is that selfishness of wanting to be in the penalty area to finish chances.\n\"As we saw on Sunday, Rice was trying to help Arsenal to fill that position, as the player who was always making forward runs and arriving in the box. He did really well in that advanced role, but he cannot always be there.\"\nDeclan Rice made six touches inside the United box, along with Jurrien Timber the joint-most by an Arsenal player\nMerino may be a midfielder, but he has scored three Premier League goals this year. Hojlund and Zirkzee have none.\nThose numbers may not suggest the answer to United's goalscoring problems lies within their current squad, but Rooney argues that any striker would find it difficult playing up front for United at present.\n\"Before they scored at the end of the first half, United had managed one shot at goal and none on target,\" Rooney said.\n\"Their problem was their lack of movement in midfield, because they could not make the passes to get up the pitch. Instead, they were forced to play balls up to Zirkzee and it was very hard for him to do anything with them.\n\"The best centre-halves, like Arsenal's are, force you under the ball in that situation or nick balls off you.\n\"If the ball is getting chipped in to you around the halfway line, which is what Zirkzee was getting, and you haven't got the support in and around you, then it is very difficult and you have to work extremely hard.\n\"Firstly, you are fighting the centre-half and holding him off you. Then you've got to get the ball under control and try to bring someone into play.\n\"If the quality of the pass up to you is not great, especially when it is coming to you around your neck like some of United's passes were, it is even harder.\n\"A lot of the time Zirkzee was getting given a 50-50 ball, the kind where you have to work wonders to win it. Ideally, what you want is your team to make a few passes and play out of the pressure, then as the striker you are getting the ball to feet, which makes it a lot easier, and you are closer to the opposition goal too.\n\"For a centre-half, if you are facing your own goal and in your own half, then it makes their job a lot easier, but if you are higher up the pitch the striker has lots more options. The defender cannot be all over you because they are afraid of giving free-kicks away.\n\"What United needed to do was get some control of the game, and get on the ball. Then the striker can make the little five yard bursts to get behind the defence, which give you a better chance of scoring.\"\nWhile Zirkzee had few sights of goal in the first half, replacement Hojlund got a couple of good opportunities to end his drought when the game opened up late on - but was unable to take them.\n\"There was one chance where his shot was blocked after he had shown fantastic movement to get to the near post,\" Rooney said.\n\"He goes once, he checks back, goes again, got across Gabriel and got a good contact on his shot, so he had done everything right. It is only a great block that stops the goal.\"\nHojlund's run to the near post - his first-time shot was blocked and flew wide\n\"The one that will be highlighted, though, is the one where Rice gets back and tackles him after the ball breaks for him in the area, and that was purely down to a lack of confidence.\n\"You see Hojlund take a touch and then he is looking up to see where he wants to put his shot when he doesn't have the time for that.\n\"That's the kind of scenario where, as a striker, if you are scoring goals you don't even have to look up - you know where the goal is.\n\"To me that really showed how much he needs a goal right now, but all he can do is keep working.\n\"I've got faith in him. He's a good player who works hard, which is really important. He needs that bit of luck as well, but once he gets a break then more goals will follow.\n\"As a striker for Manchester United, when you are not scoring goals there is a lot of pressure and a lot of people questioning if you can do it for United.\n\"The best thing for Hojlund to do is simplify it. Making runs into the penalty box is as easy at it comes. There was an attack late on against Arsenal I highlighted on Match of the Day 2 where Alejandro Garnacho is about to put in a cross and Hojlund needs to have that desire to get in the box.\n\"He goes to go, then for some reason he stops. If he carries on his run then he is in the right place around about the six yard box to get a tap-in for the winner when Bruno Fernandes' shot is saved.\n\"When you are short of confidence you have got to make sure you make it into the penalty area and put yourself in a position where you can score, so that is something he can improve on.\nThe arrow shows the run Rooney thinks Hojlund should have made\n\"We are still waiting to see Hojlund find his feet for United, but it's important to point out that the whole team have not been at their best.\n\"I feel for him from that point of view because, nine times out of 10, forwards rely on their team-mates for service.\n\"United have not been playing well or creating enough chances, so he has not been in a team dominating possession, sliding balls in behind the defence or putting balls into the box.\"\nOne way for both clubs to solve their attacking issues will be in the summer transfer window, but it is not just United and Arsenal who seemingly need a new striker.\nChelsea are also being linked with a string of number nines, and even Liverpool are supposedly lining up a goalscorer as a potential replacement for Salah, whose contract is up at the end of the season.\nIpswich's Liam Delap is reportedly being targeted by several clubs. The 22-year-old is a player Rooney considered signing in the past, when he was a teenager available on loan from Manchester City in 2021.\n\"Liam is someone I looked at for the clubs I've been at, and he is a fantastic player,\" Rooney said. \"He is a powerful lad and has a great physique to play the role he does.\n\"He probably surprised a few people by going to Ipswich, but he has scored some great goals.\n\"Ipswich are struggling in the league, so it is not always that easy for him, and I have seen a few games where he can get frustrated because he is not getting the service - exactly the problem I was talking about with United.\n\"But Liam has a massive amount of potential and I am sure he is going to have a fantastic career.\n\"I can see why the top clubs are being linked with him, but they are all going for the same players, because there is a shortage of number nines.\"\nLiam Delap has scored 10 Premier League goals this season\nIt does seem like the same strikers are on the summer shortlist of several clubs.\nArsenal failed with a January bid for Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, while Crystal Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta has been talked about as a target for the Gunners and United.\n\"Mateta is a big, strong lad who scores a lot of goals,\" Rooney said. \"From watching Arsenal over the past few games in the Premier League, they have put a lot of balls into the box without having anyone to get on the end of them. I am sure he would help from that point of view.\"\nAs well as finding someone who suits your playing style, availability is another obstacle.\nNewcastle's Alexander Isak is often viewed as the answer to Arsenal's lack of strikers, and he has also been touted as a potential Salah replacement.\n\"Isak would fit into any team,\" Rooney said. \"He has been fantastic over the past couple of years and scored a lot of goals. His link-up play and movement is brilliant too.\n\"You look at any team in the Premier League, and whether it is United and Arsenal or Liverpool then he would improve them, but I also think it will be very difficult to get him out of Newcastle. Why would they sell him?\"",

        "article_text": "Tesla facilities across the US are facing protests and vandalism in response to the political role Elon Musk, who owns the car manufacturer, has played in the Trump administration.\nMost \"Tesla Takedown\" protests have been peaceful, but a few have been destructive with fires intentionally set at Tesla showrooms and charging stations in Colorado and Massachusetts last week. \nThat was followed by six arrests in New York over the weekend when hundreds of protesters occupied a Tesla showroom.\nThere has also been a spike in Cybertruck vandalism across the US, and some car owners are defacing their own Teslas in protest of Musk.\nOne woman showed up to a protest outside a Burbank Tesla on Sunday with an expletive and Musk's name scrawled in chalk across her white Model X sedan. Another car carried an \"Anti Elon Tesla Club\" sticker.\nThe protests illustrate a growing unease over Musk's influence on the US government since President Donald Trump allowed him to create the cost-cutting task force Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).\nSo far, Doge has fired or offered buyouts to about 100,000 federal employees and gained access to the sensitive personal and financial information of millions of Americans.\nCritics have resorted to calling the tech billionaire \"President Musk\", arguing that he has too much power in the White House. Some at the protest in Burbank held signs that said \"Deport Elon\" and \"Boycott Swasticar\" - with protesters attempting to connect the car to fascism.\nTesla produced the must-have electric cars for many Americans with progressive views, but several protesters said they regretted their purchase after Musk involved himself with Trump and US politics.\nKaren Rabwin, a protester at the Burbank Tesla on Sunday, attended just two days after trading in her Tesla for a Cadillac. She had slapped a bumper sticker on her old vehicle that read \"Bought This Car Before We Knew\" in a veiled reference to Musk, but she felt that wasn't enough.\n\"It was embarrassing,\" she said of driving the Tesla. \"It wasn't what I stood for. How could I drive that car? I have principles.\"\nSinger Sheryl Crow donated her Tesla to National Public Radio last month. She posted a video to Instagram waving goodbye to the car as it was towed away.\n\"There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla,\" Ms Crow wrote.\nMusk has responded to the protests by sharing a video on X - the social media platform he owns - of a Cybertruck customer in Texas marvelling at the vehicle's full self-driving mode.\n\"Heartfelt thanks to everyone supporting Tesla, despite many attacks against our stores and offices,\" Musk wrote.  \nThe social media platform has many posts of Tesla owners showcasing their electric cars. But there are also now videos showing a growing trend of Cybertrucks vandalised with swastikas, used as skate ramps or covered in garbage. \nDuring Mardi Gras in New Orleans, spectators booed an orange Cybertruck and pelted it with beads, calling the futuristic looking vehicle a \"Deplorean\" or other unfriendly monikers.\nProtesters on Sunday said they want to take down Telsa's value because they are concerned that Mr Musk is damaging the economy and the the country - and their efforts may be having an effect. \nWhile Tesla's share price surged after Trump was elected - with Musk by his side on election night in Florida - they have tumbled back to pre-election levels following the  backlash to Musk's political involvement. \nSome on Sunday also raised concerns that Musk's government involvement is benefiting his businesses. \nCritics note that the tech entrepeneur's companies have billions of dollars of contracts with the US government, primarily with Nasa and the Defense Department, which are increasingly reliant on Musk's SpaceX for satellite launches and space exploration.\nLast week, reports claimed the Musk had attempted to get the Federal Aviation Administration to cancel a $2.4bn (\u00a31.9bn) contract with Verizon to revamp the agency's telecommunications system and awarding it to Starlink, a company owned by SpaceX, instead.\nSpaceX denied that report, posting on X that \"Starlink is a possible partial fix to an aging system. There is no effort or intent for Starlink to 'take over' any existing contract\".\nSome constituents are furious at Musk's involvement and the White House's effort to cut certain jobs and programmes. Many have shown up at Republican town halls to protest the cuts and the tech billionaire's growing influence.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republican leaders urged members of their party to stop hosting events in response, claiming without evidence that they were being disrupted by \"professional protesters\".",

Another car carried an \"Anti Elon Tesla Club\" sticker.The protests illustrate a growing unease over Musk's influence on the US government since President Donald Trump allowed him to create the cost-cutting task force Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).So far, Doge has fired or offered buyouts to about 100,000 federal employees and gained access to the sensitive personal and financial information of millions of Americans.Critics have resorted to calling the tech billionaire \"President Musk\", arguing that he has too much power in the White House. So long Tesla,\" Ms Crow wrote.Musk has responded to the protests by sharing a video on X - the social media platform he owns - of a Cybertruck customer in Texas marvelling at the vehicle's full self-driving mode.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'Arriving in red will be cool' - Hamilton's Melbourne excitment\nLewis Hamilton's move to Ferrari is the single biggest storyline of the 2025 Formula 1 season.\nThe sport's biggest star - the only driver who truly transcends the sport - has joined its most iconic team, and interest in how their partnership develops is stratospheric.\nThese are the key questions as Hamilton begins his new adventure.\nHamilton signed with Ferrari in January 2024, just over six months after sealing a new contract with Mercedes.\nIt was the talks over that new Mercedes deal that led to the Ferrari move.\nMercedes wanted to offer Hamilton only a one-year contract - team boss Toto Wolff was planning for the future. The seven-time world champion knew he wanted to stay in F1 longer.\nThey compromised on what is known as a \"one-plus-one\" contract - a firm deal for 2024 with an option for 2025.\nBut Mercedes' reticence to commit to him led Hamilton to consider his future. He had always had a hankering after driving for Ferrari and he has a close relationship with their team boss Frederic Vasseur, which dates back 20 years to their time in the junior categories together.\nHamilton's single biggest ambition is to win the record eighth title of which he feels he was robbed by race director Michael Masi making up the rules and mishandling a late safety-car period in the 2021 title decider in Abu Dhabi.\nMercedes had not furnished him with a car in which he could do that since, so he had plenty of doubts on that front, too.\nHamilton approached Ferrari and the team were keen to do a deal. So when they offered him a longer contract - at least to the end of 2026 - and a close to 50% pay rise to a reputed salary of 65m euros (\u00a355m), it was a no-brainer.\nThe fact that Ferrari had finished 2023 in stronger shape than Mercedes made the decision even easier.\nIn 2024, Hamilton was comprehensively out-qualified by a team-mate for the first time in his career, ending the season 19-5 down to George Russell in their one-lap head-to-head, at an average deficit of 0.171 seconds.\nAlthough both won two races, Hamilton finished 22 points adrift in the championship.\nIt was a confusing situation, because in 2022 and 2023, the two had been closely matched in qualifying, and one of them finished ahead in the championship one year and the other the other.\nThe bottom line is that Hamilton struggled with the characteristics of the 2024 Mercedes more than Russell.\nThe car had slow-corner understeer. The way to counteract this was to slide the rear on entry to promote turn-in. But doing that generates rear tyre temperature, which reduces grip, a problem that increases over time. Hamilton was less able to deal with this than Russell.\nOn top of this, there is no question that, frustrated by his qualifying deficit, Hamilton would sometimes push too hard when it mattered right at the end of qualifying. That led to mistakes, which further harmed his performance.\nThe Mercedes engineers felt that there was something about the general characteristics of the current generation of cars and their ground-effect design philosophy that does not marry as well with Hamilton's style as the previous generations of cars.\nBut just because that was the case last year does not mean it will be the same this year at Ferrari. It may depend on how the car behaves.\nEqually, it's impossible to know how much of an effect psychology had - Hamilton had to do a whole year with Mercedes, the longest season in history, knowing he was leaving at the end of the season, and with his heart effectively already elsewhere.\nCertainly Vasseur believes that is too important to ignore. And Hamilton is of the same opinion.\nHamilton turned 40 in January and is the second oldest driver in F1.\nOf course, athletic performance declines over time, but Fernando Alonso - who is three and a half years older than Hamilton - insists his age is not a problem, and there is no evidence in his case that it is.\nAlonso is still performing at an extremely high level, and produced some outstanding drives last year - as he did in 2023, when again he was older than Hamilton is now.\nThere is no evidence or reason to suggest Hamilton's age will have a deleterious effect on him.\nLewis Hamilton was sixth fastest on the final day of pre-season testing in Bahrain at the end of February\nHamilton does not speak Italian. He is trying to learn, but it is unlikely the fact he cannot speak the language will have a serious effect on him.\nFor a start, all technical debriefs in Ferrari are conducted in English. Vasseur also does not speak Italian.\nMichael Schumacher could not speak Italian - and he won five world titles with Ferrari and is their most successful driver. Neither could Nigel Mansell. He won on his debut with Ferrari, at the 1989 Brazilian Grand Prix. He became a folk hero in his two years with the team and is still idolised as 'Il Leone' (the Lion) now.\nVasseur says: \"You know that 99% of the job is in English. It's good to speak a little bit of Italian for the mechanics and the relationship in the team but I am not sure it is crucial for the performance.\"\nCharles Leclerc finished third in the 2024 drivers' championship on 356 points. Hamiton was seventh with 223\nHamilton's partner/rival in the other Ferrari is Charles Leclerc, a 27-year-old from Monaco who has won eight grands prix and set 26 pole positions since joining the team in 2019.\nLeclerc is a Ferrari protege - he has been nurtured by the team since he was a teenager. He is richly talented and regarded as possibly the fastest driver over one lap in F1 at the moment, and his career statistics back that up.\nLeclerc does not have such a big offset between his qualifying and race success stats because he is bad at racing. He has it because his ability and raw speed has often meant he has qualified the car higher than its competitive level can sustain over a race distance.\nHamilton is also a brilliant qualifier - he holds the all-time record for pole positions. And in many ways the two drivers are very similar. Both of them have an ability to produce 'wow' performances in qualifying - laps that leave people open-mouthed, thinking, 'where did that come from?'\nHamilton might have to accept that there is a strong chance he will be out-qualified by Leclerc over the season. But he will be confident that what he probably considers his greater race-craft and experience will see him through over a season.\nHe says: \"Charles is very professional, very embedded in this team. He is very fast and I am completely aware of that. You have seen his qualifying laps.\n\"I told him in Bahrain many years ago (in 2019) he had a bright future ahead of him.  It is not going to be easy to beat him. Especially in his home. But we will work together and have some great races, I hope.\"\nHamilton cannot control whether Ferrari build him a competitive car. And if they don't, the minimum that could be considered success would be to come out on top against Leclerc.\nBut Hamilton has not gone to Ferrari to score a few podium finishes. He wants an eighth world title. He's confident he and the team can do it. And given his level of career success, and Ferrari's history in F1, nothing less than a championship will suffice.\nHe says: \"This team already has an insane legacy and are not short of championships they have won. They have a winning mentality in their DNA.\n\"The competition is fierce. It is going to be close. but I have a great team-mate, the energy I have seen from the team, there is magic here.\n\"It is going to take a lot of hard work and everyone is putting that in. But it is also about belief. Everyone in this team dreams of winning with Ferrari.\n\"I have worked with two title-winning teams before,  I know what one looks and feels like. The passion is like nothing you have ever seen. They have got everything they need to win a championship. It is just about putting the pieces together.\"\nHow to follow Australian Grand Prix on the BBC\nWhat is at stake at under-pressure Red Bull?\n'I know my time will come' - Russell exclusive\nWho are the rookies joining the F1 grid in 2025? \nWho will win F1 drivers' title?

I thought Henrik was five metres in front of me. When you're in a line you can't really tell what is going on. I was pushing every bit of me to the line,\" Azu, who has returned his training to the UK following the birth of his son, told BBC Sport.\n\"I know I'm in the right place and this confirmed to me that I've made the right decisions. This is just the start of the journey for us as a team.

There will also be artistic creations by Brazilian World Cup winner Ra\u00ed, England defender Lotte Wubben-Moy, and former Mexico goalkeeper Jorge Campos.Mata, who is co-curator of the exhibition, said: \"The worlds of football and art can both be beautiful, complicated and powerful; something that is explored through these collaborations. \"Football City, Art United will run at Aviva Studios in Manchester in July and August.Edgar Davids said his interest in art began as a graffiti artist when he was youngerIt will be one of the centrepieces of the Manchester International Festival, which happens every two years and stages an array of events spanning art, music, theatre and dance.It will run from 3 to 20 July and other highlights, announced on Tuesday, will include:The Herds will open the festival with more than 100 life-size animal puppets reaching Manchester on a trek across Africa and Europe, with performances to \"vividly dramatise the climate crisis\"A stage adaptation of Christopher Isherwood's 1964 novel A Single Man will  feature the Royal Ballet with former principal Ed Watson, and US musician John GrantRapper and choreographer Blackhaine will stage the premiere of And Now I Know What Love Is, inspired by the \"seemingly desolate\" Lancashire landscapes where he grew upThe play Liberation will mark the 80th anniversary of the Fifth Pan African Congress, which was held in Manchester in 1945 and was a key moment for independence movementsIn A Symphony of Flesh and Bones, artist Juliet Ellis is inspired by her world champion bodybuilder father and former cage fighter brotherThe Beginning of Knowledge will be the first international solo exhibition by Santiago Yahuarcani, an artist, activist and leader of the Uitoto people in northern PeruFootball's creative talents team up for exhibitionEric Cantona: 'The Rolling Stones should support me'Cantona launches football museum exhibitionArt \"He said he was \"very happy\" to be paired with Pfeiffer, calling him \"an unbelievable artist\".",

        "article_text": "As the clocks go forward this spring, see if you can solve these puzzles based on ancient calendars.\nWhen the clocks change for Daylight Saving Time, it can often involve a bit more mental arithmetic than usual as we try to figure out our schedules. This is especially true for those of us trying to navigate different time zones.\nFor most of the US, the clocks go forward one hour on the second Sunday in March \u2013 unless you're in Arizona and Hawaii, which do not observe Daylight Saving Time. Spare a thought for the Navajo Nation living in Arizona \u2013 they move to daylight savings time even though the rest of the state stays on standard time.\nAnd for those making transatlantic calls, the time difference is a little shorter for the next three weeks as the UK and the rest of Europe do not move to their summer time schedule until later in March. But even here there can be mental agility needed - the clocks at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London, are a frequent cause of confusion for visitors as they remain on GMT throughout the summer.\nIn the ancient world, there were far more radical changes to the way people observed and formalised time. The changes to the calendars used by the Romans, for instance, led to seemingly impossible conundrums.\nTo help limber up your brain for the weeks ahead, we've put together the following time-based riddles with the advice of Helen Parish, professor of history at the University of Reading in the UK. Scroll to the bottom of the article for the answers \u2013 or if you'd like a clue, get some hints in this story first.\u00a0 \nPuzzle 1: The impossible letter\nA woman sits down to write a letter in France on 8 November 1582.\u00a0\nThree days earlier, the letter is received in England.\u00a0\nWhat happened?\nPuzzle 2: The mystery of the missing birthdays\nIn the year 46BC, in Rome, a child is born in spring.\u00a0\nShe lives to be 60 years old, though she never has another birthday again.\u00a0\nBut why?\nPuzzle 3: The strangely ageing farmhand\nAfter working in the fields on the last day of December 800BC, a farm labourer downs his tools and goes to bed.\u00a0\nOn the first day of the new year, when he picks up his tools to start work again, he is two months older.\u00a0\nHow can this be?\nThe impossible letter \u2013 Puzzle 1\nIn the 1500s, the old Julian calendar was replaced by the Gregorian calendar. But different countries in Europe adopted the new calendar at different times \u2013 which meant the days across the continent were often out of sync, leaving some countries several days or weeks behind others.\nThe mystery of the missing birthdays \u2013 Puzzle 2\nRomans used to use extra months known as \"intercalary months\", which were added ad hoc to realign the 355-day Roman year with the solar year. The child in question was born in the intercalary month of Mercedonius. The last time the month of Mercedonius was used was spring 46BC, so the child was severely short-changed on birthdays.\nThe strangely ageing farmhand \u2013 Puzzle 3\nThe pre-Julian calendar only had 10 months, and didn't calendarise the roughly 60 days of wintertime when there was no agricultural work to be done. During this wintertime, there was no real concept of \"months\".\nBonus:\nEven in our modern world there are calendar quirks that mean some people live in multiple time zones where they can be several different ages at once. With a bit of border-hopping, it is also possible to travel back to the 1300s or forward to the 26th Century.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nScotland survive late Wales comeback to win\nFifty minutes gone at Murrayfield and it was freewheelin' time. Five Scottish tries in the bag, a 27-point lead on the board and Finn Russell directing his players around the pitch with the authority of the world's greatest traffic cop.\nEasy. Scotland were all width and class, pace and execution. They were a joy. Blair Kinghorn, Huw Jones, Darcy Graham, Tom Jordan - even big Duhan van der Merwe was coming off his wing and getting involved in the show.\nAn exhibition of what is best about this team. Devastating. \nThey made bits of Wales, who were vulnerable to the wide game and who were caught out when Scotland ran up their guts. \nTheir composure was so shot that they gave their hosts a free seven-points when Ben Thomas lost the plot in the lead-up to Scotland's fourth try. They had a man in the bin and all hope in a skip. \nBut, hold on. This feeling of certainty and Scotland sit as well together as a hornets' nest and a big stick. When you watch Scotland through the decades that precise feeling of comfort in a game is when you really should start to feel uncomfortable.\nFive-try Scotland survive spirited Wales comeback\nScotland must be more 'ruthless' after Wales fright\nScotland reaction, analysis & have your say\nSame last year in Cardiff when the visitors led by 27 points early in the second half and were hanging on at the end. And same on Saturday. It wasn't quite the smelling salts and stretchers of 2024, but it was close.\nNobody can be sure, but with Wales scoring 21 unanswered points from the 62nd minute (plus a try for Taulupe Faletau that was disallowed) many people would have bet the house on Wales winning had it gone on much longer.\nIn boxing parlance, Scotland were stuck on the ropes, almost defenceless, eyes rolling in the back of their head as Wales unloaded. The last bell saved them from possible mortification.\nIn the first half they'd built their lead which saw them home and fair play to them for that. They won, they got five points and now they'll move on to Paris to try to stop what seems like the inevitable - a French title.\nThey'll travel, of course, with all the good wishes of their friends across the water. Irish fans are suddenly Scotland fans. \nGenerous souls that they are they'll wish Gregor Townsend and his players nothing but the best in Paris. A bit late to don the tartan, perhaps, but anyway.\nThis video can not be played\n'Superb' Russell stakes Lions claim\nSaturday was Scotland in microcosm, their excellence and their weakness. It was a day that showed again why you can't see them progressing to the status of contenders even if you buried your face in a vat of happy juice.\nEverything really started to go wrong when Russell was taken off as an injury precaution and the bench started to appear. Not enough of them make a positive impact. Several of them added to the errors and the chaos.\nScotland's hair caught fire when Teddy Williams drove over with 11 minutes left. Too easy, that. The home team had stopped working as hard it had been.\nFaletau's try didn't stand but it left an impact. In the preamble, Blair Morgan was missed by Stafford McDowall and Kyle Rowe, then after the illegal hurdling, he did George Horne. The score was correctly ruled out, but Wales were on a roll.\nThat last try showed Scotland in their panicked state. Joe Roberts eluded Kinghorn, then slipped out of trouble when Rowe, Jordan and Matt Fagerson came to him. It was like he was slathered in butter.\nA penalty, a lineout, a try for Max Llewellyn. Murrayfield silent, apart from the faint sound of sobbing. \nThe cameras turned to Russell who shook his head and looked like saying something beginning with F before the director cut away.\nScotland went to sleep, he said later. They switched off. The message all week, he stated, was to play for 80 minutes, but they didn't. Again. \nFair play to Russell, not just for the elegance of his performance but for the honesty of his assessment.\nThis video can not be played\n'Struggling to process last 20 minutes'\nThis team has a well-developed and debilitating trend of falling asleep in games. They didn't score in the last 33 minutes on Saturday. \nA fortnight ago they went an hour without scoring against England, against Ireland they didn't score for 41 minutes and then 26 minutes. Against Italy, they went 33 minutes without a point.\nThis is repeat behaviour from Scotland. Last season threw up similar numbers and so did the season before.  \nIt didn't cost them this time, but it remains a puzzler as to why this keeps happening. Are they always going to have the propensity for napping during games? \nIt's why we can admire many of the things this team does, but it's very hard to trust them. We can marvel at their creativity, but elan alone is not cutting it at the sharp end of the championship.\nAnd so to Paris against the mighty French. Scotland at their very, very best are unpredictable enough, and mad enough, to make it a scary day for Fabien Galthie.\nScotland are not a conventional team. They have players that could hurt France. They have a mindset that could cut them open and give them much to think about. \nThey don't have a hang-up about the French the way they do against the Irish. Psychology won't be a problem.\nFrance will surely win - and maybe very comfortably - because on top of the flair in the backline they have monsters up front. Many, many monsters. \nThey have eight starters and possibly another seven on the bench. To hell, Fabien, go 8-0 and be done with it. Bring out every brute, from Perpignan to Picardy.\nFrance won a seismic victory in Dublin and will feel invincible now. Scotland won a shaky one in Edinburgh and Lord only knows how they'll be feeling. \nThey won, though. That's kinda the point. But does it always have to be so dramatic?\nPodcast: 'Scotland took foot off gas and switched off'\n08/03/25",

His dream was slipping away and for the first time - although by no means the last - he wondered if he was chasing something that wasn't meant for him.\nThen came the voice that changed everything. His mother, always his fiercest supporter, refused to let him quit. \"If you stop now,\" she told him, \"you'll have to live with this for the rest of your life. Are you ready for that?\"\nThat moment became his turning point. Fast forward to today, and the same player who nearly walked away from football is now at the heart of Barcelona's revival, delivering goals and defying expectations.\nRaphinha's journey from Porto Alegre to Barcelona's dressing room is a story of resilience, discipline, and continuous self-improvement. His transformation into a top-level performer is not just about talent. It's about mindset, sacrifice, and an unwavering desire to succeed.\nShould Barcelona somehow manage to win this inaugural season of the new-look Champions League, it will also be a personal triumph for the 28-year-old, who as recently as last summer was cast in the role of sacrificial lamb in Barcelona's attempt to bring in Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams.\nHe again showed his worth in Tuesday's last-16 second leg against Benfica, scoring twice to help send Barca through to the quarter-finals.\nPlot the route to Champions League glory - who is your winner?\nPlay BBC Sport's new Champions League game\nRaphinha was raised in the relentless, grinding poverty seen across the sprawling shanty towns that litter the landscape in and around the neighbourhood of Restinga in the city of Porto Alegre.\nIn a neighbourhood where violence and drug trafficking are often a way of life, Raphael Dias Belloli knew from an early age that football was not just a way out - it was the only way out. \nHe has spoken about how he saw talented friends take the wrong path. Unlike them, he had the support of his family, especially his mother and uncle, who encouraged him to keep pushing forward with sport despite financial struggles. \nHis mother worked tirelessly, and his family made sacrifices to buy him football boots and pay for his transport to training sessions.\nHis football education was all about survival; playing barefoot against older opponents in the streets helped him develop endurance and technical skills under pressure. Both would become his most defining traits.\nHe was initially rejected by clubs like Internacional and Gremio because they considered him too thin and lightweight for professional football. \nDespite these setbacks, the rejection fuelled his competitive spirit and obsession with proving people wrong. Eventually he got a chance at Avai, a smaller club with a solid youth system where he learnt to handle the physical side of the game before having to face the first of many crises.\nA serious injury at Avai's U20 team left him sidelined and questioning his footballing future. The turning point came when his mother reminded him in no uncertain terms that giving up would mean having to find a 'proper' job.\nFrom that moment, his commitment to discipline and sacrifice became absolute, he started seeing football not just as a passion but his only way to a better life.\nUnlike many Brazilian stars who first shine at major domestic clubs, Raphinha had to prove himself in Europe from the bottom up.\nIn Portugal, first with Vitoria Guimaraes and then Sporting, he showed his ability to beat defenders and create chances, while at Rennes he proved he could be a game changer.\nHe was catching the eyes of the bigger clubs and, fortunately for him, he attracted the attention of the hardest of taskmasters that is Marcelo Bielsa, who took him to Leeds and rapidly accelerated his development albeit via a harsh, unforgiving regime.\nIt was there that he developed an outstanding physical endurance, which made his explosive playing style sustainable, improved his off-the-ball movement and pressing intensity and learned to move intelligently without the ball.\nHe also caught the attention of Barcelona who signed him on a five-year contract for a reported initial fee of \u00a350m, potentially rising to \u00a355 million in add-ons.\nRaphinha struggled initially playing for an elite club. \nCoach Xavi saw him more as a squad member than as an undisputed starter and even when he started to be a regular in the line up, he rarely played full games.\nBarcelona's inability to buy without selling first due to financial issues put him firmly in the frame as the club's biggest playing asset and the player most likely to be sold - especially while Barcelona were trying to sign Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams last summer.\nFocus was also elsewhere with the precocious and outrageously talented Lamine Yamal the centre of everyone's attention and effectively undroppable.\nIn two seasons at the club, Raphinha was used off the bench 11 times and started just 42 times out of a possible 76.\nThe message coming out of Barcelona was simple. \"We don't want to lose you, but we think you ought to go,\" seemed to be the gist of it.\nRaphinha had other ideas, although it was a close-run thing.\n\"There were several moments, not just one [when I considered leaving],\" he admits now.\n\"There was a lot of self-doubt. I have a nasty habit of criticising myself heavily, so to speak, so that pressure made me think about leaving.\"\n\nHansi Flick was appointed Barcelona head coach in May 2024\nThe dismissal of manager Xavi in May and subsequent appointment of Hansi Flick changed everything.\nThe German coach gave him a bigger role and allowed him to play with confidence. He is now a player reborn.\nFlick focused his work on the importance of making smarter decisions, knowing when to dribble, when to pass. The more direct style suited him too.\nThese days he loses the ball less and is more efficient and composed in front of goal. His current stats are remarkable.\nHe has 26 goals and 19 assists in 40 games and has scored in every match he has played in the Champions League this season.  He has established himself as one of Barcelona's key players and a genuine Ballon d'Or contender.\nHe has also been voted as one of the team captains, receiving the fourth-highest tally of votes behind Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Ronald Araujo and Frenkie de Jong. When they were injured he became the club's outright skipper.\nLamine Yamal, who also played a starring role in Tuesday's win over Benfica, has publicly said Raphinha is his main mentor in the squad.\nThat complements well with the fact that with the Brazilian national team he is the undisputed number one leader in the group.\nHis last-minute winner in the club's pulsating 4-5 group stage win in Benfica was a key moment in his and the club's season.\nHis celebration, with Barca's entire bench running towards him in the pouring rain, became a symbolic image of the team's unity and cemented his status as a dressing room leader.\nHe is clearly one of the most-respected voices in the dressing room, not overly vocal, but rather a leader by example, not just in matches but just as importantly in training.\nRaphinha knows just how hard it has been for him to get where he is today, just how fickle footballing fate can be and that it is primarily during your most successful times that you find yourself closest to failure.\nTo that end he leaves nothing to chance. He has spoken openly about how he avoids distractions outside football. \nHe has no interest in nightlife or partying, preferring to spend time at home with his family or focusing on training. It is this discipline that has been key to raising him to his physical and mental peak.\nAnd now he has reached this point, there is no stopping him and if Barcelona go far in the Champions League, nobody should argue his right to be considered one of the top players in the world.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "As the clocks go forward this spring, see if you can solve these puzzles based on ancient calendars.\nWhen the clocks change for Daylight Saving Time, it can often involve a bit more mental arithmetic than usual as we try to figure out our schedules. This is especially true for those of us trying to navigate different time zones.\nFor most of the US, the clocks go forward one hour on the second Sunday in March \u2013 unless you're in Arizona and Hawaii, which do not observe Daylight Saving Time. Spare a thought for the Navajo Nation living in Arizona \u2013 they move to daylight savings time even though the rest of the state stays on standard time.\nAnd for those making transatlantic calls, the time difference is a little shorter for the next three weeks as the UK and the rest of Europe do not move to their summer time schedule until later in March. But even here there can be mental agility needed - the clocks at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London, are a frequent cause of confusion for visitors as they remain on GMT throughout the summer.\nIn the ancient world, there were far more radical changes to the way people observed and formalised time. The changes to the calendars used by the Romans, for instance, led to seemingly impossible conundrums.\nTo help limber up your brain for the weeks ahead, we've put together the following time-based riddles with the advice of Helen Parish, professor of history at the University of Reading in the UK. Scroll to the bottom of the article for the answers \u2013 or if you'd like a clue, get some hints in this story first.\u00a0 \nPuzzle 1: The impossible letter\nA woman sits down to write a letter in France on 8 November 1582.\u00a0\nThree days earlier, the letter is received in England.\u00a0\nWhat happened?\nPuzzle 2: The mystery of the missing birthdays\nIn the year 46BC, in Rome, a child is born in spring.\u00a0\nShe lives to be 60 years old, though she never has another birthday again.\u00a0\nBut why?\nPuzzle 3: The strangely ageing farmhand\nAfter working in the fields on the last day of December 800BC, a farm labourer downs his tools and goes to bed.\u00a0\nOn the first day of the new year, when he picks up his tools to start work again, he is two months older.\u00a0\nHow can this be?\nThe impossible letter \u2013 Puzzle 1\nIn the 1500s, the old Julian calendar was replaced by the Gregorian calendar. But different countries in Europe adopted the new calendar at different times \u2013 which meant the days across the continent were often out of sync, leaving some countries several days or weeks behind others.\nThe mystery of the missing birthdays \u2013 Puzzle 2\nRomans used to use extra months known as \"intercalary months\", which were added ad hoc to realign the 355-day Roman year with the solar year. The child in question was born in the intercalary month of Mercedonius. The last time the month of Mercedonius was used was spring 46BC, so the child was severely short-changed on birthdays.\nThe strangely ageing farmhand \u2013 Puzzle 3\nThe pre-Julian calendar only had 10 months, and didn't calendarise the roughly 60 days of wintertime when there was no agricultural work to be done. During this wintertime, there was no real concept of \"months\".\nBonus:\nEven in our modern world there are calendar quirks that mean some people live in multiple time zones where they can be several different ages at once. With a bit of border-hopping, it is also possible to travel back to the 1300s or forward to the 26th Century.

The plane can carry up to 342 passengers.\nAt that point of time the plane was already flying over the Atlantic Ocean, according to Air India's statement. Due to restrictions on night operations at most European airports at the time, the pilots decided to return to Chicago for \"passenger comfort and safety\".\nA BBC check on flight tracking website Flightradar24 found the plane was near Greenland when it turned around, and had spent a total of 10 hours in the air.\nAir India said an investigation later found \"polythene bags, rags and clothes that had been flushed down and stuck in the plumbing\" of the plane's toilets.\nIt released several pictures showing bags containing waste cleared from the toilets. One photo showed a crew member holding a drainage pipe completely stuffed with what appeared to be rags.\nThe statement said that all passengers and crew disembarked normally in Chicago and were provided with accommodation and alternative flight options.\nPlane toilets store human waste in special tanks and use a vacuum system for flushing. These are normally disposed of once the plane has landed. \nWhile clogged toilets are not uncommon, it is \"next to impossible\" for all toilets to break down \"due to only passengers' fault, and in a way that it causes an emergency diversion\", Mark Martin, an aviation expert, told the Hindustan Times newspaper.\nBut Air India said it had previously found objects such as blankets, innerwear and diapers flushed down its planes' toilets.\n\"We take this opportunity to urge passengers to use lavatories only for the purposes that they are meant for,\" it said. \nOn X, many criticised the airline for poor upkeep and the lack of sanitation facilities on its aeroplanes. \n\"Only Air India has such frequent mishaps. Honestly what has happened is indefensible,\" one user said.\nBut others pointed out that the airline could not be held responsible for the situation. \n\"Can we honestly dump all the blame on Air India and the crew, when people can't follow basic travel etiquette?\" another user said. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

rather pregnancy and the prospect of being kicked by not only one or two feet at a time, but potentially four, and as many arms.\n\"Twins, yeah, a massive shock,\" said the smiling GB athlete, who is competing at the European Rifle Shooting Championships while six months pregnant.\n\"It's definitely a strange one [to compete] and not a normal thing people do!\n\"I've had some rough training sessions ahead of the Europeans and some days where every shot felt like I was climbing Mount Everest because I was in so much pain and doubt was creeping into my mind.\n\"But, sometimes it's about showing up, pushing through and embracing that struggle; I also need to remember to not be too hard on myself because I am growing two humans inside me right now.\"\nMwandumba confesses that little can prepare you for the news that \"you have two in there\" but, on reflection, she feels her mind may have been preparing her in the days ahead of the first scan.\n\"Weirdly, I had a dream that the sonographer found more than one baby, so even though it was a surprise, I feel my body trying to warn me, so I feel like part of me knew deep down, inside, like intuition,\" she told BBC Sport.\nWhen prompted to reflect on her use of the word 'dream' rather than 'nightmare', she clarifies, while laughing; \"No actually you're right, it was a nightmare!\n\"I woke up going, 'that can't be happening, it's not happening, right?'\"\nThe 29-year-old has also endured a tricky pregnancy, with nausea and vomiting extending into her second trimester.\n\"The whole pregnancy in general was a bit of a shock because I struggle quite badly with endometriosis,\" she revealed.\n\"It took four years of experiencing extreme pelvic pain, as well as really, really intense periods, before I was first officially diagnosed in 2017 and I've had two surgeries since.\"\nEndometriosis is a condition in which tissue, similar to the lining of the uterus, grows outside the uterus, and can cause infertility.\nShe had \"difficult conversations\" with healthcare providers who warned her she might not be able to conceive naturally.\n\"It was almost scary to be discussing the possibility, at the age of 22-23, that I might not be able to have kids in the future.\n\"So, to have had those conversations and then all of a sudden be expecting twins, never mind just one, was a huge shock,\" said Mwandumba, who thought she might need IVF but ultimately did not require it.\n\"I think it's great to show it's not all doom-and-gloom and despite the negative experiences you can still get a beautiful experience at the end.\"\nUK Sport recently released enhanced pregnancy guidance, pledging to \"increase and improve support\" for female athletes.\nMwandumba's British team-mate Amber Rutter was one of the first to receive this additional assistance in the lead up to the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, where she ultimately won silver, three months after becoming a mother.\n\"British Shooting have been so supportive from the beginning and I think the experience with Amber before the Olympics means they can use a lot of the same support and resources,\" said Mwandumba, who was a travelling reserve for the Paris 2024 Games.\nWhile optimistic about the future, one area of concern is becoming a parent and bringing black children into the world.\nThe shooter, who has Malawian heritage, has been a prominent figure in the push for greater diversity in the sport, launching the #TargetChange initiative in 2022, while she has also previously spoken about her own concerns around racism in the UK.\n\"I think we're still very much in a scary world, and it definitely is something that scares me,\" she said.\n\"Change might be slow, but it is happening and I'll always be open with them about how they might be viewed or how they might approach certain situations, but hopefully by the time they are teenagers, things will be a bit different.\"\nWell before her children reach their teen years though, Mwandumba is hoping to not only return to the sport, but become an Olympian.\nShe was the reserve to Seonaid McIntosh in the 10m air rifle event at the 2024 Games and has set her sights on the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.\n\"Once upon a time, I felt as though pregnancy within elite sport automatically meant retirement, and obviously we're at a point now where that's not the case,\" said Mwandumba.\n\"So many people have been successful at their sport, gotten pregnant, had a family, then come back and have still managed to be just as successful, if not more so and I think that's so inspiring to those of us who are going through the journey.\n\"It's definitely motivated me to because my plan is to come back and still hopefully aim for those major competitions, with the Olympics the long-term goal.\n\"To do it with my twins watching on, would be all the more special.\"",

Ultimately he has to make decisions and he's never going to please everyone.\"\nForward Vivianne Miedema told BBC Radio 5 Live that Taylor had \"helped her enjoy football again\" but the players\u2019 focus had to immediately turn to Saturday\u2019s final.\n\"We are professional footballers so coming in this morning, the switch needed to be on straight away,\" said Miedema.\n\"Nick [Cushing] left a really, really good impression straight away with lots of energy. The most important thing right now is to move forward to the big cup final on Saturday.\"\nCushing will be in charge for the remainder of the season, having previously helped City win the WSL and the FA Cup, plus the League Cup twice, before leaving in January 2020 to join MLS side New York City.\n\"We were excited by that appointment because he knows the club really well, he's been here before, he comes with a huge history of winning and his mentality to win is second to none,\" said Greenwood, who is currently sidelined with a knee injury. \n\"I had a really, really good chat with him on Tuesday morning.\n\"He had a great meeting with the team - a really, really positive one. It was ultimately about winning and what is achievable, what we need to focus on, which, first of all, is Saturday.\"\nFormer Manchester City players Ellen White and Jen Beattie, who both played under Taylor, have questioned the timing of the sacking. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Women's Football Weekly podcast, White said: \"Very odd timing I would say - it's super strange.\n\"I feel a bit sorry for him because [he has] a lot of injuries. But you've got to throw it back to the club at the same time to be like - are you invested into this team, where do you want this team to go?\n\"He could have gone months ago, last year potentially. I don't think they're in that bad a position at the moment. It's just the weirdest timing ever.\"\nBeattie said it was the players she felt for most and the impact it has on their cup final preparation.\n\"It's the timing for me, absolutely wild, five days before a cup final.\n\"I understand the decision making, but I do think the timing was really, really unfair on the players.\"\nBoth White and Beattie worked under Cushing in his previous spell at City and believe he is the right choice to take the club forward.\n\"He understands what Man City is about, he understands the club, the expectations and he is a figure that a lot of people will know,\" said White.\n\"I think he's got some great ideas. He's very diligent, he's very tactical, he's good at communication and he loves being on the grass. He's a very, very good coach.\"\nBeattie played under Cushing for four seasons at City and was part of the WSL-winning side in 2016 and won two FA Cups and two League Cups under him.\n\"In my experience under Nick, Nick had this unbelievable ability to make you focus on the task in hand and to be able to shut out the noise,\" she said.\n\"He will be able to take this chaotic time for the team, simplify it, and allow them to focus on the games.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump called a meeting of his cabinet secretaries on Thursday to discuss Elon Musk and his efforts to slash government spending and personnel numbers.\nIt turned heated, according to media reports.\nMusk accused Secretary of State Marco Rubio of failing to cut enough staff at the state department, reports the New York Times.\nThe tech mogul told Rubio he was \"good on TV\", according to the newspaper, pointedly skipping any praise of his work as America's top diplomat.\nThe billionaire also clashed with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy over whether Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) task force had tried to lay off air traffic controllers who were already in short supply in the Federal Aviation Administration, according to the New York Times.\nDuffy's department has been under scrutiny after two US airline crashes since Trump took office in January. \nAfter listening to the back-and-forth, the Republican president reportedly intervened to make clear he still supported Doge, but from now on cabinet secretaries would be in charge and the Musk team would only advise. \nA state department spokeswoman told the newspaper Rubio felt the cabinet meeting was an \"open and productive discussion\". The White House has not responded to BBC requests for further comment.\nSpeaking in the Oval Office after the meeting, Trump said cabinet members should decide who to cut, but if they didn't, Musk would do the job.\n\"I had a meeting, and I said I want the cabinet members to go first\", Trump said. \"And if they can cut it's better, if they don't cut, then Elon will do the cutting.\"\nThe hastily planned gathering could provide evidence that the president has decided to curtail the sweeping power the SpaceX and Tesla boss and his Doge cost-cutting initiative have commanded in the early weeks of his administration.\nTrump first commented on the substance of Thursday's meeting, which was disclosed only in after-the-fact media reports, through a post that evening on his social media site, Truth Social.\nHe said that he had instructed his secretaries to work with Doge on \"cost-cutting measures\".\n\"As the secretaries learn about, and understand, the people working for the various departments, they can be very precise as to who will remain, and who will go,\" he wrote, adding that they should use a \"scalpel\" not a \"hatchet\".\nJust a few weeks ago, Musk wielded a shiny chainsaw at a conservative conference \u2013 a visible symbol of aggressive attempts to slash government spending that have angered Democrats and concerned some officials in the Trump administration.\nMusk's team had sent multiple emails from an official government account to millions of federal workers, encouraging them to accept months of advance pay in exchange for their resignations.\nFederal workers were instructed to provide accounts of their weekly accomplishments or risk firing \u2013 a request some agencies instructed their employees to ignore.\nDoge also ordered the dismissal of many newly hired government employees who, because of their \"probationary\" status, did not have full civil service protections. \nSome government agencies have since rescinded these orders because employees deemed essential, such as those who oversee nuclear weapon security, had been affected.\nDuring an Oval Office event on Friday, Trump responded to questions about the cabinet meeting \u2013 and reports of its heated exchanges. He insisted there was \"no clash\". He praised both Rubio and Musk and said the two got along \"great\".\nTrump's Thursday Truth Social post, however, appears to give department heads more authority to push back against Musk. \nIt also may be an attempt to insulate the Trump administration from lawsuits that allege Musk is wielding too much power for someone who, unlike cabinet secretaries, is not subject to Senate review and confirmation.\nSeveral federal judges overseeing these cases have already expressed concern about Musk's authority \u2013 concerns that may be further fuelled by Trump's comments during his address to Congress on Tuesday that the billionaire was, in fact, the man in charge of Doge.\nMusk and Trump have formed a formidable partnership so far \u2013 as the richest man in the world and the most powerful politician in America. Washington has been rife with speculation for months about whether that partnership could ultimately fracture.\nThose predictions, however, have usually been followed by renewed signs of comity between the two men. \nOn Friday night, Musk was seen boarding Air Force One with the president for a flight to Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida for the weekend.\nThe cabinet room dust-up may be the first crack in the foundation \u2013 but there is plenty of evidence that Trump still supports Musk's broader efforts and goals, even if he might prefer he use a scalpel in the days ahead, not a chainsaw.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

You don't worry; you don't start your day by reading the news about what happened in Ukraine, where there were attacks,\" she says.\n\"You fall asleep peacefully and wake up peacefully because your children are next to you, and nothing else is needed.\"\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

        "article_text": "An argument in the White House tore apart the US alliance with Ukraine, shook European leaders and highlighted JD Vance's key role in forcefully expressing Donald Trump's foreign policy. The vice-president has come out punching on the global stage - so what is it that drives his worldview?\nVance's first major foreign speech, at the Munich Security Conference in mid-February, caught many by surprise.\nRather than focusing on the war raging in Ukraine, the US vice-president only briefly mentioned the bloodiest European conflict since World War Two.\nInstead, he used his debut on the international stage to berate close US allies about immigration and free speech, suggesting the European establishment was anti-democratic. He accused them of ignoring the wills of their people and questioned what shared values they were truly banding together with the US to defend.\n\"If you are running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you, nor for that matter is there anything you can do for the American people,\" he warned.\nIt was a bold and perhaps unexpected way to introduce himself to the world - by angering European allies. But days later he was back in the news, at the centre of a blistering row with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whom he accused of being ungrateful.\nFor those who have been studying the rise of Vance, these two episodes came as no surprise.\nThe vice-president has come to represent an intellectual wing of the conservative movement that gives expression to Trumpism and in particular how its America First mantra applies beyond its borders. In writings and interviews, Vance has expressed an ideology that seems to join the dots between American workers, global elites and the role of the US in the wider world.\nOn the campaign trail with Donald Trump last year, Vance spent much of his time sharply criticising Democrats - the usual attack-dog duties that traditionally get dished out to running mates - and sparring with reporters.\nAnd while Elon Musk's outsized and unconventional role in the Trump administration initially overshadowed him, that Munich speech and the Oval Office showdown have raised the profile of Trump's deputy.\nIt's also led to questions about the winding ideological journey he's made during his years in the conservative movement - and what he truly believes now.\n\"He's much more of a pragmatist than an ideologue,\" said James Orr, associate professor of philosophy of religion at the University of Cambridge and a friend whom Vance has described as his \"British sherpa\".\n\"He's able to articulate what is and is not in the American interest,\" Orr said. \"And the American interest is not the interest of some abstract utopia or matrix of propositions and ideas, but the American people.\"\nVance has repeatedly returned to this \"America First\" - or perhaps \"Americans First\" - theme in speeches, drawing a line between what he castigates as Washington's economic and foreign policy orthodoxy abroad and the struggles of the left-behind American working class at home.\nAt the Republican National Convention last summer, for example, he lamented how in small towns across the US \"jobs were sent overseas and children were sent to war\". And he attacked then-President Joe Biden, saying: \"For half a century, he's been a champion of every single policy initiative to make America weaker and poorer.\"\nBut Vance is also someone who, after a tough upbringing in an Ohio family with Appalachian roots and sudden fame on the back of a bestselling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, has tried out many different views.\nNot only is he a former \"Never Trumper\" who described the US president in 2016 as \"reprehensible\" and \"an idiot\", his book places much of the blame for the plight of the rural poor squarely on the choices made by individuals.\nMore recently he's shifted that blame to elites \u2013 a group he's variously defined as Democrats, conventional Republicans, liberals, corporate leaders, globalists and academics.\nIn speeches, Vance regularly argues that \"America is not just an idea\u2026 America is a nation.\"\nHe couples this statement with an anecdote about his family's ancestral graveyard in Kentucky, where he says he, his wife and their children will one day be buried, arguing that family and homeland are more important than some of America's traditional core ideas.\nIn Vance's view, the Trump administration's priority should be to make life better for Americans who have been in the country for generations, and yet have little of the nation's vast wealth.\nRod Dreher, a conservative American writer who is also a friend of the vice-president, said Vance's thinking arises from a belief that \"moderate normie Republicans\u2026 failed to offer anything to stop the so-called forever wars, and they also failed to offer anything to ordinary Americans like where he comes from, who are suffering economically from globalism and from the effects of mass migration and fentanyl\".\n\"He got red-pilled, so to speak, by Donald Trump,\" Dreher told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme this week.\n\"Red-pilled\" is internet slang for suddenly waking up to a supposedly hidden truth, as featured in The Matrix movies. It's commonly used by those on the right online who believe they have special access to reality and that people with liberal, centrist or establishment views are uncritical thinkers.\nVance is a vice-president who, more than his boss, seems extremely plugged into internet culture. He's an enthusiastic user of X, often jumping directly into arguments rather than using it, as many politicians do, as a platform for announcements.\nHis appearances on fringe right-wing podcasts, while he was trying to drum up support for a Senate run, provided fodder for his opponents, as did provocative trollish comments such as that the US was being run by \"childless cat ladies\".\nMarried to the daughter of Indian immigrants, he has rejected and been rejected by members of the alt-right even if he does echo some of their views. However, he does have friends and allies both at the top of Silicon Valley and in some of its lesser known corners.\nAfter graduating from Yale Law School, he was brought into the world of venture capital by influential Silicon Valley conservative Peter Thiel, who later funded his US Senate campaign.\nHe has cited people like the blogger Curtis Yarvin, a key guru in the \"neo-reactionary\" movement which dreams up fantasies of technologically-assisted, hyper-capitalist societies led by powerful monarchs.\nHis familiarity with the internet's fringes was further demonstrated when he spread false rumours about immigrants eating pets and an allegation about Ukrainian corruption - which the BBC traced back to Moscow.\n\"He sort of stews in this online world,\" said Cathy Young, a writer for the conservative, anti-Trump media outlet The Bulwark.\nAt the same time, Young said, his anecdote about family graveyards and homeland suggests another political tendency - a \"disturbing undertone of nativism\".\n\"That bothers some people and rightly so,\" she said. \"Part of the American legacy is that we are a nation of immigrants. [Former Republican President] Ronald Reagan talked about that, about one of the distinctive things about this country is that anyone can come here from any part of the world and become an American.\"\nVance's \"Americans First\" thinking clearly extends to the issue of the war in Ukraine. When he was a senator, he was often critical of America's involvement in the war and the huge sums spent on it, his former Senate colleague Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, recalled.\n\"His position then was very much like what it is now\u2026 that the conflict must end,\" Hawley told the BBC. \"It needs to end in a way that's maximally advantageous to the security of the United States and it needs to end in a way that gets our European allies to take increased responsibility.\"\nVance regularly accused the Biden administration of being more interested in Ukraine than in stemming illegal immigration. Writing in 2022, during his Senate campaign and after the Russian invasion, he said: \"I will be damned if I am going to prioritise Ukraine's eastern border right now when our own southern border is engulfed by a human tsunami of illegal migrants.\"\nHis views burst out into the open during that dramatic argument with President Zelensky in the Oval Office. Vance accused Zelensky of lacking respect, of sending politicians on a \"propaganda tour\" of Ukraine and of being insufficiently thankful for US aid.\n\"Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's trying to save your country,\" he told the Ukrainian president.\nThe argument left European leaders scrambling to defend Zelensky, while also trying to maintain negotiations over a possible peace deal.\nVance then prompted widespread outrage from allies when he poured scorn on the idea of security guarantees in the form of troops \"from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\".\nHe later denied he was talking about the UK or France, the only two European countries that have publicly stated their willingness to send peacekeepers to Ukraine.\nBut the vice-president's willingness to step on the toes of allies reflect a world view which, in his words, has little time for \"moralisms about 'this country is good', 'this country is bad'\".\n\"That doesn't mean you have to have a complete moral blind spot, but it means that you have to be honest about the countries that you're dealing with, and there's a complete failure to do that with most of our foreign policy establishment in this country,\" he told a New York Times columnist last year.\nHis tone has shifted from the two years he spent in the US Senate before being picked by Trump. Democrat Cory Booker remembered Vance as \"very pragmatic and thoughtful\".\n\"That's why some of this stuff surprises me,\" Booker told the BBC.\nOthers detect the same disconnect.\nDavid Frum, now a writer for The Atlantic magazine, said that Vance's views have changed significantly from when he first commissioned the former marine, who was attending Ohio State University at the time, to write for his website on conservative politics more than 15 years ago.\n\"He was not in any way the culture warrior that he is today,\" Frum said.\nFrum, a former George W Bush speechwriter and staunch critic of Trump, said that Vance's view of Russia represented \"ideological admiration\".\nIn Munich, as he spoke about free speech, the vice-president cited cases involving conservatives and Christians in Western countries but avoided any mention of Russia's harsh clampdowns on expression.\nVance and his allies reject that he is sympathetic to Putin.\n\"I've never once argued that Putin is a kind and friendly person,\" Vance, then an Ohio senator, said in a speech at the 2024 Munich Security Conference.\n\"We don't have to agree with him. We can contest him and we often will contest him,\" he said. \"But the fact that he's a bad guy does not mean we can't engage in basic diplomacy and prioritising America's interests.\"\nThe BBC has asked the White House for comment on Vance's stance in relation to Ukraine and Russia.\nA quick end to the conflict in Ukraine is, in Vance's view, not only about putting a stop to billions of dollars being spent thousands of miles away.\nHe himself has said that there are bigger issues for the US and its friends to focus on than Ukraine, namely the threat of China, which he has called \"our most significant competitor... for the next 20 or 30 years\".\nVance's views on Ukraine and his willingness to publicly air them provided a dramatic moment in the early days of Trump's second presidential term.\nBut it also offered a vivid illustration of the vice-president's ideology, his prominence in the Trump administration and how he views America's place in the world.\nWith reporting by Rachel Looker and Anthony Zurcher in Washington and Lily Jamali in San Francisco\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Oval Invincibles and London Spirit were the men's and women's champions in The Hundred in 2024\nThe Hundred draft takes place on Wednesday before the fifth edition of the tournament this summer.\nWith a host of big-name players up for grabs, the 16 teams - eight men's and eight women's - will be looking for the additions to give themselves the best chance of lifting the trophy at Lord's on 31 August.\nBBC Sport and data analysts CricViz look at how the squads are shaping up, what each team needs and who they may target.\nRehan Ahmed took 11 wickets over three seasons with Southern Brave\nCurrent squad: Liam Livingstone, Ben Duckett, Trent Boult (overseas), Jacob Bethell, Benny Howell, Adam Milne (o), Dan Mousley, Tim Southee (o), Will Smeed, Chris Wood, Aneurin Donald.\nWhat do they need? The best player available. With established openers (Duckett and Smeed), a flurry of all-rounders (Livingstone, Bethell, Mousley, Howell) and their Kiwi pace trio (Boult, Milne, Southee), Phoenix can be flexible with their selection and pick who they think is the best player available at the time.\nRehan Ahmed could give Phoenix a specialist leg-spin option to complement their army of finger-spinning all-rounders.\nCurrent squad: Jamie Smith, Liam Dawson, Daniel Worrall, Kane Williamson (o), Richard Gleeson, Olly Stone, Ollie Pope, Keaton Jennings.\nWhat do they need? An explosive all-rounder.\nGiven a slow-ish scoring top four of Jennings, Smith, Williamson and Pope and tricky six-hitting conditions at Lord's at the end of innings, Jamie Overton could fit the bill. \nHe has a strike-rate of 167 in the last 25 balls of Hundred matches. He also clocks 87mph when fit and is an exceptional fielder. Spirit have the first pick in the men's draft.\nNoor Ahmad was part of the Afghanistan squad at the Champions Trophy\nCurrent squad: Jos Buttler, Phil Salt, Heinrich Klaasen (o), Matthew Hurst, Scott Currie, Josh Tongue, Tom Hartley, Sonny Baker, Tom Aspinwall.\nWhat do they need? A wicket-taking spinner. The Originals only picked up 31 wickets across eight games last season, the joint lowest for any side.\nLeft-arm wrist-spinner Noor Ahmad took 13 wickets at 17.5 in the recent SA20 with an economy of 6.90.\nThe 2.5\u00b0 average turn at Old Trafford in the last two Hundred seasons is the second highest in the competition, which would help him. Given the Originals' new owners RP Sanjiv Goenka Group also own Durban Super Giants - Ahmad's SA20 side - it would be no surprise to see the Afghanistan international head to Manchester.\nCurrent squad: Harry Brook, Adil Rashid, David Miller (o), Mitchell Santner (o), Brydon Carse, Matthew Potts, Ben Dwarshuis (o), Graham Clark, Pat Brown, Tom Lawes.\nWhat do they need? A top order run-scorer. Nicholas Pooran (fourth with 227 runs) was the only Supercharger in the top 10 run-scorers last season. Their top three batters collectively average 18.9 (only Spirit were worse in 2024).\nDespite tricky conditions at Lord's, Dan Lawrence has averaged 24 in Hundred games there while striking at 147. He'll be even more suited to the flat pitches of Headingley and provides a back-up captaincy option to Brook.\nLhuan-dre Pretorius scored 397 runs for Paarl Royals in the SA20\nCurrent squad: Sam Curran, Will Jacks, Tom Curran, Jordan Cox, Rashid Khan (o), Saqib Mahmood, Sam Billings, Gus Atkinson, Nathan Sowter, Donovan Ferreira (o), Tawanda Muyeye.\nWhat do they need? A left-handed opener. Having retained most of their back-to-back title winning squad, with the exception of Dawid Malan, they'll be looking for a good value overseas option in the middle rounds of the draft.\nEighteen-year-old Lhuan-dre Pretorius lit up the SA20 in January, finishing as the leading run-scorer in the competition with 397 runs at an average of 33 and a strike rate of 166.\nCurrent squad: James Vince, Jofra Archer, Tymal Mills, Chris Jordan, Faf du Plessis (o), Leus Du Plooy, Craig Overton, Laurie Evans, Finn Allen (o), Danny Briggs, James Coles.\nWhat do they need? Lower-order power. Established top-order batters Du Plessis and Vince should do the bulk of the run scoring but the squad is missing a big hitter to clear the ropes at number six.\nKieron Pollard, who memorably hit Rashid Khan for five sixes to win Southern Brave a match last year, could return. He boasts a six every nine deliveries he faces in Hundred cricket.\nHis availability is a slight issue with the Caribbean Premier League starting in mid-August, but he can be replaced.\nSunil Narine has starred in franchise leagues around the world for the past decade\nCurrent squad: Joe Root, Marcus Stoinis (o), Tom Banton, John Turner, Sam Cook, Sam Hain, Tom Alsop, Calvin Harrison.\nWhat do they need? Mystery spin. Rashid Khan has left for Oval Invincibles and Andy Flower's side have always had an overseas spinner in their ranks (Rashid, Chris Green, Ish Sodhi, Tabraiz Shamsi, Imad Wasim).\nSunil Narine could be the next. His availability because of the CPL is a concern but that hasn't stopped them picking Rashid in the past.\nWith 24 wickets at 16.5 in 19 previous Hundred games, while conceding at just 1.15 runs per ball, the experienced former West Indies international might be a shrewd pick.\nCurrent squad: Chris Woakes, Steve Smith (o), Jonny Bairstow, Tom Kohler-Cadmore, Tom Abell, Luke Wells, Stephen Eskinazi.\nWhat do they need? Bowlers! Fire released all of them, with only Woakes coming in. Franchise-leading wicket-taker David Payne was a particularly surprising release.\nNew Zealand quick Matt Henry is an exceptional new-ball bowler in helpful conditions and in high demand after his Champions Trophy exploits.\nHe has 11 wickets at 11.9 in eight previous games for Welsh Fire.\nThe Hundred 2025: Full squad lists\nAnderson 'hungry' for Hundred chance\nMaxwell and Healy among big names in Hundred draft\nCurrent squad: Ellyse Perry (o), Amy Jones, Emily Arlott, Megan Schutt (o), Hannah Baker, Charis Pavely, Sterre Kalis, Ailsa Lister.\nWhat do they need? A top-order batter. The departure of Sophie Devine leaves a big gap - but Phoenix will pick first in the women's draft.\nGeorgia Voll is a WPL star and now an Australia international. The 21-year-old's stock has only risen throughout the winter thanks to both franchise and international exploits.\nSince the start of the 2024 WBBL, Voll is averaging 31 while striking at 148 across 22 innings. She's also the fastest scoring batter inside the powerplay in this timeframe.\nLondon Spirit are expected to bring back Heather Knight after she led them to victory in 2024\nCurrent squad: Grace Harris (o), Danielle Gibson, Sarah Glenn, Charlie Dean, Deepti Sharma (o), Georgia Redmayne (o), Eva Gray, Cordelia Griffith, Tara Norris, Sophie Munro.\nWhat do they need? Their title-winning captain. After lifting the title last year, Spirit followed both Oval Invincibles and Welsh Fire in retaining 10 players, with their 11th an established player returning in the top bracket.\nSkipper Heather Knight was superb with the bat for the Spirit last year, finishing as the second leading run-scorer behind Nat Sciver-Brunt. She also finished not out in four successful chases last year.\nCurrent squad: Amelia Kerr (o), Sophie Ecclestone, Beth Mooney (o), Lauren Filer, Mahika Gaur, Eve Jones, Kathryn Bryce, Fi Morris, Danielle Gregory.\nWhat do they need? A dynamic middle-order batter. With Beth Mooney and Amelia Kerr expected to score the bulk of the runs, the Originals will be looking for a quick scoring batter to finish off innings.\nNo-one strikes a longer ball than Deandra Dottin. The big-hitting Barbadian has history in Originals colours, scoring 259 runs in 10 innings across the 2022 and 2023 editions, with an impressive 32 average and 140 strike-rate.\nMady Villiers won The Hundred with Oval Invincibles in 2021 and 2022\nCurrent squad: Phoebe Litchfield (o), Annabel Sutherland (o), Georgia Wareham (o), Kate Cross, Bess Heath, Linsey Smith, Hollie Armitage, Alice Davidson-Richards, Grace Ballinger, Davina Perrin.\nWhat do they need? The best player available. With the Superchargers not picking until round nine, they'll have jump on whoever drops down.\nMady Villiers has been a mainstay at Oval Invincibles and, while capable of bowling in both the powerplay and at the death, her ability to keep it tight through the middle has helped her side squeeze opposition.\nVilliers would elevate the likes of Sutherland and Wareham as wicket-taking options by holding up an end.\nCurrent squad: Marizanne Kapp (o), Alice Capsey, Lauren Winfield-Hill, Amanda-Jade Wellington (o), Meg Lanning (o), Tash Farrant, Ryana Macdonald-Gay, Sophia Smale, Jo Gardner, Rachel Slater.\nWhat do they need? Continuity. Jonathan Batty has kept a core of players throughout his time as Invincibles head coach and has been joined by his WPL skipper Meg Lanning in the off-season.\nPaige Scholfield has capped herself at \u00a350,000 for the draft and looks all but certain to return to the Invincibles.\nScholfield has flipped between opening and a middle-order role across the last couple of years, making her the perfect squad batter to complement the established stars.\nChinelle Henry has starred for UP Warriorz at the WPL\nCurrent squad: Laura Wolvaardt (o), Danni Wyatt-Hodge, Maia Bouchier, Lauren Bell, Freya Kemp, Georgia Adams, Tilly Corteen-Coleman, Rhianna Southby.\nWhat do they need? All-round talent.\nLauren Bell led the Brave in wickets last year with nine, but that was only joint 13th best in the competition. With the bat, Brave's scoring rate in the final 25 balls of the match was the second lowest in the competition, a clear sign of a lack of power.\nWest Indies' Chinelle Henry has lit up the 2025 WPL, averaging 27 while striking at 196 with the bat, hitting more sixes (15) than fours (12).\nHenry is also a capable new-ball swing bowler, keeping her economy inside the powerplay below a run-a-ball.\nCurrent squad: Ash Gardner (o), Nat Sciver-Brunt, Alana King (o), Heather Graham (o), Bryony Smith, Grace Scrivens, Kirstie Gordon, Alexa Stonehouse, Natasha Wraith, Cassidy McCarthy.\nWhat do they need? X-factor pace. While pace isn't everything, the Rockets were the only side last year to not register a ball over 70mph in the entire competition.\nWhile spinners Gardner and King are exceptional, they could be backed up by spells of fiery pace.\nLook no further than Issy Wong. While she has had a tough time of late, only Lauren Filer is also capable of clocking into the late 70s among domestic bowlers.\nSophia Dunkley played for Welsh Fire in 2023 and 2024\nCurrent squad: Hayley Matthews (o), Tammy Beaumont, Jess Jonassen (o), Shabnim Ismail (o), Sarah Bryce, Georgia Elwiss, Freya Davies, Georgia Davis, Emily Windsor, Beth Langston.\nWhat do they need? Continuity. Welsh Fire have retained the core of last year's runners-up side and will look to do the same with their only pick in the top eight rounds, with Sophia Dunkley expected to return.\nDunkley started the 2024 Hundred brightly before her form tailed off.\nThis shouldn't put off the Fire from retaining her in the top bracket, with Dunkley performing well for England at times this winter - hitting 59 off 30 balls in Sydney during the Women's Ashes.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

He's assistant professor of finance at Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University near Chicago, and has studied how card payment systems work.\nHe points out that credit cards are more expensive for merchants, be they retailers, or bars and restaurants to accept than debit cards as they incur a higher processing fee. \nProf Wang says merchants are likely to put up prices to cover the additional cost of people using credit cards.\n\"We typically think that corporations, you know, they're facing higher costs, they're going to pass on a pretty substantial share of those costs onto consumers,\" he explains.\n\"If we impose all these costs on the merchant, it ends up being a cost that is ultimately borne by all of us as consumers.

It was a bad fit when Arsenal desperately needed a goalscorer.\nThe sight of midfielder Mikel Merino labouring as an emergency striker to no effect emphasised how Arsenal had left that key position to the fates and lost.\nArteta admitted as much as he said: \"The efficiency we had in the last 20 metres wasn't good enough. We know that.\n\"To come to Old Trafford and do what we did is superb, but you have to capitalise and we didn't. We then had to try to overturn the result after going behind and you know how difficult that is here.\"\nThis does not take into account Arsenal had 48 hours more to prepare for this game than Manchester United, who played away to Real Sociedad in the Europa League on Thursday, and have injury problems of their own.\nArsenal, who won 7-1 at PSV in their Champions League last-16 first leg tie on Tuesday, had these factors in their favour but were still not good enough to cash in.\nRice scores equaliser but Arsenal held at Man Utd\n'We need more Brunos' - Fernandes 'steps up all the time' for Man Utd\nWhen could Liverpool seal Premier League title?\nA disappointed Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta after his side's Premier League title chase faltered again at Manchester United\nArteta, by most measures, has improved Arsenal and been successful. The only gauge that matters at a club of their stature, though, is the tangible success of trophies and he still only has their 2020 FA Cup success to show for his progress.\nThis is not to suggest the Spaniard has been a failure. Far from it.\nArteta, understandably, retains the complete faith of the Arsenal hierarchy as he has moved them in the right direction. And it is expected he will soon be working with a new sporting director in Andrea Berta, who is to succeed Edu after the Italian left the same position with Atletico Madrid in January.\nIn his first 200 matches, Arteta has 118 wins, the fifth highest tally of any manager in that amount of Premier League games.\nAnd since his appointment in succession to Unai Emery in 2019, only Pep Guardiola, his mentor at Manchester City when he was assistant manager there, has more victories and points in the Premier League.\nArteta also has eight more wins than Arsene Wenger achieved when he hit the mark of 200 top-flight matches.\nArsenal can also consider themselves live contenders for the Champions League, with a quarter-final place virtually assured after their spectacular away win at PSV.\nIt does mean, however, the pressure is increasing on Arteta to deliver a trophy that has eluded him for five years \u2013 if not this season, then certainly next.\nArsenal needed a miraculous injury-time save by keeper David Raya from Bruno Fernandes to prevent defeat at Manchester United\nArsenal must consider this season's title race a missed opportunity after running Manchester City close in the last two campaigns - only to stumble near the finishing line. City's unforeseen collapse opened the door to their rivals, but it is Arne Slot's Liverpool who have stepped through it, while the Gunners faltered once more.\nLiverpool's relentless march has seen them ease away from Arsenal, who have fallen away to such an extent that even the subdued reception from players and supporters in a corner of Old Trafford after the final whistle carried a resigned air.\nThey know the game is up.\nAsked if the title race is over in the press conference, having walked out when asked the same question by Sky Sports, the Arsenal boss said: \"I don't want to say that, but today the frustration is that we haven't won a game.\n\"We know the urgency and we are obligated to win every single match if you want to have any chance of doing that. I don't think it's the right moment to talk about that anyway.\"\nWhile it is effectively meaningless in the wider title context, it could have been even worse for Arsenal.\nGoalkeeper David Raya was culpable for Fernandes' opener, positioning himself too far to his right, allowing the Portuguese midfielder to show his expertise by planting the free-kick perfectly as the Spaniard scrambled away in vain to his left.\nThis video can not be played\nWall distance or keeper error? Why did Arsenal concede from Fernandes free-kick?\nRaya, however, made amends with two superb second-half saves from Noussair Mazraoui and Joshua Zirkzee, before a miraculous moment in the dying seconds. Having first blocked a shot from Fernandes, Raya somehow regained his position to claw the ball away from right on the line as a dramatic late United winner looked certain.\nIn between, it took a magnificent saving tackle from goalscorer Rice to rob United substitute Rasmus Hojlund as he raced into the area with only Raya to beat.\nIt will not make much difference to the destiny of the title. It simply emphasised that Arsenal's impotence at one end leaves them increasingly vulnerable at the other.\nAnd this reflects badly on Arteta and Arsenal's recruitment team, who failed to address an obvious problem up front last summer.\nAs he moves on from his managerial landmark, the urgency is growing to mark his progress in the manner that matters most.\nThat is by actually winning a trophy.\nPremier League Review with Darren Fletcher\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\nGet Arsenal news sent straight to your phone",

And it is expected he will soon be working with a new sporting director in Andrea Berta, who is to succeed Edu after the Italian left the same position with Atletico Madrid in January.In his first 200 matches, Arteta has 118 wins, the fifth highest tally of any manager in that amount of Premier League games.And since his appointment in succession to Unai Emery in 2019, only Pep Guardiola, his mentor at Manchester City when he was assistant manager there, has more victories and points in the Premier League.Arteta also has eight more wins than Arsene Wenger achieved when he hit the mark of 200 top-flight matches.Arsenal can also consider themselves live contenders for the Champions League, with a quarter-final place virtually assured after their spectacular away win at PSV.It does mean, however, the pressure is increasing on Arteta to deliver a trophy that has eluded him for five years \u2013 if not this season, then certainly next.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Arsenal needed a miraculous injury-time save by keeper David Raya from Bruno Fernandes to prevent defeat at Manchester UnitedArsenal must consider this season's title race a missed opportunity after running Manchester City close in the last two campaigns - only to stumble near the finishing line.

On the first night, I'd only been in the country a couple of days, there was a girl from Lampeter and she knew my auntie's farm.\"\nIt is one thing to find these links organically, but under time pressure it becomes harder. \nAs The Cymru Connection theme music kicks in each week, James is often seen putting his head in his hands. \n\"I find it immensely stressful,\" he said. \n\"It pays off because as long as I Cymru Connect I'm floating on air for hours. If I fail I'm incredibly depressed for about a day.\n\"Often if I'm wearing a jumper or a jacket I've got to take it off because I start to sweat. So the head in hands, that's genuine, it's very, very authentic, I'm not putting it on for effect.\n\"I always start with where people grew up and where they went to school, and how old they are.\n\"The stats have proven it doesn't always work. But that's where I begin.\"\nJames and Robins have worked together for more than a decade - firstly on XFM and now for the BBC - but have been friends for much longer.\n\"It's quite an interesting thing to observe because it's obviously a very natural interaction for Welsh people,\" said Robins, from Bristol.\n\"I watch Elis connecting thinking 'is this really happening every week?' and it is. It's on national radio.\"\nBut why is it happening? \nDr Martin Graff, a psychologist at the University of South Wales, believes \"we all want to meet people who have a degree of familiarity to ourselves\".\n\"In Wales there's three million of us \u2013 we're a fairly exclusive club. Therefore when we meet someone Welsh it's kind of thrilling.\n\"From an evolutionary angle, meeting someone who is familiar makes them more predictable.\n\"If people's behaviour is more predictable we feel safer in their company.\"\nBorn and bred in Bridgend, I couldn't finish my interview without putting James to the test - could he find a Cymru Connection with me?\nRobins, who acts as adjudicator, declared in advance that mutual BBC colleagues did not count.\nDespite that, after roughly 45 seconds, James managed to name somebody he knew who was in the year above me at school.\nJob done - our very own Cymru Connection.",

And I am so grateful for that process, because I realised through all of it that, if I were not around, my children would be on the right path.\n\"If this hadn't happened to me, I'd have stayed in 'mum mode'. I love my kids so much, but I looked at them and thought: 'Would they be OK without me?'

Some of those internal messages are repeated by players in interviews, but without context as to why Brendon is saying them - things like 'we don't care about winning' - that is nonsense. \n\"Sometimes you have got to be above the players and you have got to drag them up, and sometimes when things are going well you've got to be below them and bring them down - and that does happen, too.\" \nComments which caused a stir include Ben Duckett saying it did not matter that England lost 3-0 to India as long as they went on to win the Champions Trophy, while in September last year Harry Brook said \"if you get caught somewhere on the boundary, then who cares?\" when asked about his side's batting approach.\nBut Key added that McCullum is a \"master\" at knowing the differences between his players, such as who needs a harder approach and who thrives by being more relaxed.\n\"After the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston, an absolute rollercoaster, Brendon said something along the lines of how those close games feel like ones you've won,\" Key added.\n\"So that's why it is annoying when it is taken out of context. What he's trying to do is lift everyone, he's trying to make sure they don't walk out feeling like the world has ended because they are gutted, but they still have four Tests left to play.\"\nTest Match Special podcast: Rob Key\nStokes considered as England white-ball captain\n'Karachi a familiar low - England's rebuild starts here'\nKey also denied suggestions he and the England management had put too much focus on Test cricket which resulted in poor results from the white-ball side. \nHe said that during Joe Root's tenure as Test captain, he was often playing without his full-strength XI but this winter the selection decisions were inevitable.\n\"The white-ball team [when I started] were the best or one of the best in the world, and they had done a lot of work with an era of cricketers who were very established and experienced and knew exactly what they were doing,\" said Key.\n\"The problem that we found this winter is that we had a decision to make - and it wasn't a matter of choosing between white and red ball - it was more the fact that it is almost impossible to have your best team play in both formats now.\" \nEngland played three Tests in Pakistan in October, a white-ball series in the Caribbean started a day after that series ended and then three further Tests in New Zealand followed. \nKey said he would have made the same selections again because of the complexity of the schedule.\n\"It meant that the white-ball team suffered, but there was almost no choice,\" he said. \n\"It was either one or the other. Every step along the way we've had to make a call of 'you can only have your best team at one of these series'.\" \nKey's next significant decision will be to appoint Jos Buttler's successor as white-ball captain after he stood down at the end of the Champions Trophy. The process will take time and Key said he has not had any conversations with current Test skipper Stokes about the vacancy. \nEngland next play a one-off Test against Zimbabwe in May, followed by a white-ball series against West Indies.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Actor Gene Hackman was alone. \nThe two-time Academy Award winner didn't make any calls and missed meals. \nMedical experts say it's possible the 95-year-old, who was in declining health and suffering from advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, did not even realise his wife of more than 30 years was dead in the home where he was living. \nIf he did, experts told the BBC, he likely went through various stages of confusion and grief, trying to wake her up before the disease caused him to become distracted or too overwhelmed to act - a process that likely repeated for days before he, too, died. \nOfficials in New Mexico say Betsy Arakawa, 65, died of a rare virus about seven days before Hackman perished on 18 February of natural causes. \nThe pair - and one of their dogs - were found dead in their Santa Fe home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through a window. \nAuthorities, at first, said the grim discovery was \"suspicious enough\" to launch an investigation.\nTheir remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition. Arakawa was found in a bathroom with scattered pills nearby. Hackman was found near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses. One of their three dogs was found dead in a crate. \nBut a police investigation found no foul play. \nInstead, the case has shed light on the grim realities of Alzheimer's disease, which damages and destroys cells in one's brain over time - taking away memory and other important mental functions. \n\"It's like he was living in a reel,\" Catherine V Piersol, PhD, an occupational therapist with decades of experience in dementia care, told the BBC of how Hackman may have experienced the repeated loss of his wife.\nShe noted patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease like the actor live in the present and are unable to both look back at moments in the past or look forward and act. \n\"I imagine he would be trying to wake her up and not being successful. But then [he] could have been distracted in another room because of one of the dogs or something,\" she described. \nThen later, he'd again notice his wife on the ground and would \"live through it again\", she said. \nThough no one knows how Hackman spent his last days alive, the grim nature of the possibilities were discussed by authorities and the area's medical examiner.\nAt a press conference last week, Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico's chief medical examiner, said Arakawa died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Hackman's death was the result of significant heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor. \nGiven Hackman's advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", Dr Jarrell said.\nHis autopsy indicated he had not eaten recently, though he showed no signs of dehydration. Officials found no evidence that he had communicated with anyone after his wife's death and could not determine whether he was able to care for himself.\nMs Piersol said patients with advanced Alzheimer's aren't able to pick up on environmental cues like light and darkness, making it harder to determine when he should eat, sleep or bathe. \n\"Those [cues] are oftentimes just, no longer available to people at this stage of dementia,\" she said.\nDr Brendan Kelley, a neurologist who specialises in memory and cognition at UT Southwestern Medical Center, explained why Hackman may also not have been able to call authorities for help. He said Alzheimer's disease can leave patients caught between emotional discomfort and the inability to act on it.\n\"A person might feel worried or frightened, but at the same time they might not be capable to take the actions that you or I might normally think to do in order to alleviate that worry or concern, such as calling somebody else, or going to speak to a neighbour.\"\nDr Kelley says Alzheimer's patients experience emotions like pain and sadness, and experience physical needs like hunger and thirst, it's just harder for them to identify what they are feeling.\nHe said missing meals could also increase levels of confusion and agitation.\nThe couple's deaths and the startling details of Hackman living in the home for a week after his wife's passing has shocked the Santa Fe area, where the couple had lived for more than 20 years. \n\"It's just absolutely devastating,\" says Jeffery Gomez, a long-time resident of the city, who remembers seeing Hackman around town in his different cars, always with a smile on his face.\nHis partner, Linda, said the details were triggering, explaining she cared for her elderly mother with dementia. \"Even when you have help, it's a lot,\" she said. \n\"We know Gene and his wife were very private people and she was probably trying to shield him from the public,\" she added, \"but the thought of doing that alone? It's a lot to shoulder.\"\nLaura N Gitlin, PhD, a behavioural scientist who researches ways to support caregivers told the BBC, this is becoming a common problem among caregivers. \n\"With the aging of a population, we also simultaneously have a shrinking of the number of people in the family, number of children, or relatives who live nearby,\" she explained. \nMs Gitlin noted along with there being fewer caregivers, there is less support for these individuals on making big decisions - such as when it's time to place a loved one in a home instead of caring for them by yourself. \nJeffery Gomez said he couldn't understand how no one checked in on the couple for such a long while.  \n\"It breaks my heart he was alone so long.\" \nA list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line.",

This included about 125 fighters linked to the new Islamist-led government and 148 pro-Assad fighters.\nReuters news agency reported sources in the new Syrian government saying at least 200 of the fighters had been killed.\nSpeaking from a mosque in the capital, Damascus, on Sunday, the interim president said: \"What is currently happening in Syria is within the expected challenges.\"\nHe also announced in a statement that he had launched an investigation into the violence which would \"identify those responsible\" and refer the perpetrators to court. \nHe did not comment directly on accusations that atrocities were being committed by his supporters in the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartous.\nIn a later update on Telegram, the presidency announced the creation of a new independent committee to investigate and identify the perpetrators behind the attacks.\nOn Sunday, Syrian media reported that fighting between government forces and Assad loyalists had also broken at a gas power plant in Banias, a city about halfway between Latakia and Tartous.\nThe violence of recent days has been sparked after ambushes on government forces on Thursday. A Syrian defence ministry spokesman described it to the Sana state news agency as \"treacherous attacks\" against security personnel.\nIt has since escalated into a wave of clashes between Assad loyalists and government forces.\nHundreds of Syrians gathered in Damascus to protest against the deadly violence in the country. Demonstrators congregated in Marjeh Square - also known as Martyrs' Square - with placards on Sunday.\nAmid the fighting, hundreds of civilians living along the Mediterranean coast have fled their homes. The provinces of Latakia and Tartous were former heartlands of deposed president Bashar al-Assad, who also belongs to the Alawite minority.\nAlawites, whose sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam, make up around 10% of Syria's population, which is majority Sunni Muslim.\nThe violence has left the Alawite community in \"a state of horror\", an activist in Latakia told the BBC on Friday.\nLarge crowds sought refuge at a Russian military base at Hmeimim in Latakia, according to the Reuters news agency. \nVideo footage shared by Reuters showed dozens of people chanting \"people want Russian protection\" outside the base.\nMeanwhile, local media reported dozens of families had also fled to neighbouring Lebanon.\nThe UN's special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, said he was \"deeply alarmed\" by \"very troubling reports of civilian casualties\" in Syria's coastal areas. \nHe called on all sides to refrain from actions which could \"destabilise\" the country and jeopardise a \"credible and inclusive political transition\".\nSimilarly, the UN human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk called the reports \"extremely disturbing\", adding the need for \"prompt, transparent and impartial investigations\" into all the violations.\nIran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, described the killings of Alawites in Latakia and Tartous as \"systematic\" and \"extremely dangerous\", and accused Syria's interim government of failing to control the crisis. \n\"It was expected that after the fall of the Assad government, Syria would face a difficult transition,\" Amani said. \"But the scale of violence now unfolding is unprecedented and deeply troubling.\"\nIran's government was aligned with Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, which was toppled last December. Assad was ousted after decades of repressive and brutal rule by his family and an almost 14-year-long civil war.",

        "article_text": "Residents of Greenland are going to the polls on Tuesday in a vote that in previous years has drawn little outside attention - but which may prove pivotal for the Arctic territory's future.\nUS President Donald Trump's repeated interest in acquiring Greenland has put it firmly in the spotlight and fuelled the longstanding debate on the island's future ties with Copenhagen.\n\"There's never been a spotlight like this on Greenland before,\" says Nauja Bianco, a Danish-Greenlandic policy expert on the Arctic.\nGreenland has been controlled by Denmark \u2013 nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away \u2013 for about 300 years. It governs its own domestic affairs, but decisions on foreign and defence policy are made in Copenhagen.\nNow, five out of six parties on the ballot favour Greenland's independence from Denmark, differing only on how quickly that should come about.\nThe debate over independence has been \"put on steroids by Trump\", says Masaana Egede, editor of Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq.\nThe island's strategic location and untapped mineral resources have caught the US president's eye. He first floated the idea of buying Greenland during his first term in 2019.\nSince taking office again in January, he has reiterated his intention to acquire the territory. Greenland and Denmark's leaders have repeatedly rebuffed his demands.\nAddressing the US Congress last week, however, Trump again doubled down. \"We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're gonna get it,\" he said, prompting applause and laughter from a number of politicians, including Vice-President JD Vance.\nIn Nuuk, his words struck a nerve with politicians who were quick to condemn them. \"We deserve to be treated with respect and I don't think the American president has done that lately since he took office,\" Prime Minister Mute Egede said.\nStill, the US interest has stoked calls for Greenland to break away from Denmark, with much of the debate focused on when \u2013 not if \u2013 the process of independence should begin.\nGreenland's independence goal is not new, Nauja Bianco points out, and has been decades in the making.\nA string of revelations about past mistreatment of Inuit people by the Danes have hurt Greenlandic public opinion about Denmark. Earlier this year, PM Egede said the territory should free itself from \"the shackles of colonialism\".\nBut it is the first time the subject has taken centre stage in an election.\nInuit Ataqatigiit (IA), the party of Prime Minister Mute Egede, favours gradual steps towards autonomy. \"Citizens must feel secure,\" he told local media.\nArctic expert Martin Breum says Egede's handling of the challenge from Trump and strong words against Denmark over past colonial wrongdoings \"will give him a lot of votes\".\nSmaller rivals could also gain ground and potentially shake up alliances.\nOpposition party Naleraq wants to immediately kick-off divorce proceedings from Copenhagen and have closer defence dealings with Washington.\nPointing to Greenland's EU departure and Brexit, party leader Pele Broberg has said that Greenland could be \"out of the Danish kingdom in three years\".\nNaleraq is fielding the largest number of candidates and has gained momentum by riding the wave of discontent with Denmark.\n\"Naleraq will also be a larger factor too in parliament,\" predicts Mr Breum, who says party candidates have performed well on TV and on social media.\nHowever, the centre-right Demokraatit party believes it is too soon to push for independence.\n\"The economy will have to be much stronger than it is today,\" party candidate Justus Hansen told Reuters.\nGreenland's economy is driven by fishing, and government spending relies on annual subsidies from Denmark.\nTalk of Trump and independence has overshadowed other key issues for voters, says newspaper editor Masaana Egede.\n\"It's an election where we should be talking about healthcare, care of the elderly and social problems. Almost everything is about independence.\"\nAccording to recent polls, almost 80% of Greenlanders back moves towards future statehood.\nAbout 44,000 people are eligible to vote, and given the low numbers and few polls, results are difficult to forecast. \nEven though a majority of Greenlanders favour independence, a survey has shown that half would be less enthusiastic about independence if that meant lower living standards.\nOne poll found that 85% of Greenlanders do not wish to become a part of the United States, and nearly half see Trump's interest as a threat.\nOne fear among some Greenlanders, says Masaana Egede, is how long the Arctic island could remain independent and whether it would break off from Denmark only to have another country \"standing on our coasts and start taking over\".\nExperts say it is this worry that could steer votes towards keeping the status quo.\nAlthough Greenland's right to self-determination is enshrined into law by the 2009 Self-Rule Act, there are several steps to take before the territory could break away from Denmark, including holding a referendum.\nThis means getting full independence could take \"about 10 to 15 years,\" says Kaj Kleist, a veteran Greenlandic politician and civil servant who prepared the Self-Rule Act.\n\"There is lot of preparation and negotiations with the Danish government before you can make that a reality,\" he adds.\nWhatever the election's outcome, experts do not believe Greenland could become independent before Trump's second term is over in 2028.\nThe results are expected in the early hours of Wednesday.",

        "article_text": "Native Americans, English sailors and pirates all came together on Ocracoke Island in North Carolina to create the only American dialect that is not identified as American.\nI'd never been called a \"dingbatter\" until I went to Ocracoke, North Carolina for the first time. I've spent a good part of my life in the state, but I'm still learning how to speak the\u00a0Hoi Toider\u00a0brogue. The people here just have their own way of speaking: it's like someone took Elizabethan English, sprinkled in some Irish tones and 1700s Scottish accents, then mixed it all up with pirate slang. But the Hoi Toider dialect is more than a dialect. It's also a culture, one that's slowly fading away. With each generation, fewer people play meehonkey, cook the traditional foods or know what it is to be \"mommucked\".\nIn an effort to put his \"America first\" stamp on the nation's speech, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order making English the country's official language. It marks the first time in the US's nearly 250-year history that the nation has had an official language. Yet, on this small 9.6-square-mile island surrounded by the swirling waters of the Atlantic, residents still speak what is arguably the most English version of English in the country \u2013 and many Americans don't understand it.\nAs the island's official website proudly proclaims: \"With origins dating back to the 1600s, Ocracoke brogue is about as American as it gets.\"\nLocated 20 miles from the North Carolina mainland, Ocracoke Island is fairly isolated. You can't drive there as there are no bridges, and most people can\u2019t fly either as there are no commercial flights. If you want to go there, it has to be by boat. In the late 1600s and early 1700s, that meant Ocracoke was a perfect spot for pirates to hide, as no soldiers were going to search 16 miles of remote beaches and forests for wanted men.\nWilliam Howard was one of those outlaws, serving as quartermaster on Blackbeard\u2019s ship Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge. Leaving before Blackbeard\u2019s final battle in 1718, Howard made his way to Virginia, eventually taking the general pardon offered by King George I to all pirates. But unlike some, Howard had a plan. For several decades, he dropped out of sight, only to reappear in 1759 when he bought Ocracoke Island for \u00a3105 from a man named Richard Sanderson, a justice and later a General Assembly member in mainland North Carolina.\nHoward settled down along with some other ex-pirates and started building a community with boat pilots who had been stationed on the island to help guide merchant ships around sandbars in the area. A mainland North Carolina Native American tribe also interacted with the early settlers. The Woccon tribe had set up fishing and hunting outposts on the island, which they called Woccocock. Through misspellings and mispronunciations, it became Wokokon, Oakacock and Okercock, before finally arriving at the current version of Ocracoke in the mid-1700s. So at this point, there were Native Americans, English sailors and pirates from a variety of places all in one location. And that isolated community of just under 200 started blending words and dialects, and eventually building its own way of speaking. \u00a0\n\"It's the only American dialect that is not identified as American,\" said Dr Walt Wolfram, a North Carolina State University professor who studied the Ocracoke dialect for more than 20 years and currently works as the director of NC State\u2019s Language and Life Project. \"That's fascinating to me. You can find pronunciation, grammar structures and vocabulary on Ocracoke that are not found anywhere else in North America.\"\nHoward's community lived in near-isolation for almost two centuries. Electricity didn't arrive at the island until 1938 and a ferry service didn't start until 1957, leaving the islanders cut off except for the occasional supply trip to the mainland. Even today, things are a bit different for the island's 676 residents than on mainland North Carolina.\n\"You have to be a certain type of individual to enjoy living here,\" said Chip Stevens, an island resident directly descended from Howard and the former owner of the local hotel Blackbeard's Lodge. \"There isn't a Lowes or a Harris Teeter or any [supermarkets]. Rarely does anyone go off the island without a cooler [to bring back supplies]. You have to be almost a holistic person, capable of dealing with less of a hectic nightlife lifestyle.\"\nYes, mobile phones and laptops still work here, and if you want to sit down and watch some Major League Baseball in a pub, there are plenty of options. But in many other ways, the island is a throwback to a time before internet and television. Instead of cinemas, there are outdoor theatre groups. Local teashops, spice markets and other family-owned stores take the place of chain supermarkets. Cars are allowed on the 16 mile-long island, but most people just park them and walk everywhere. The island's children all attend one school, while residents work as everything from fishermen to brewery owners to woodworkers.\n\"It's amazing how coming across that ferry is almost like going to a different country,\" Stevens said, sitting on the hotel's front porch. \"You feel that separation. It's a really nice feeling, being able to give your kids some freedom. When I was a kid, we'd leave [home] after breakfast, eat lunch at somebody else's house, walk to the beach, take a rowboat out in the water, and our parents never had to worry about us. We've maintained a lot of that.\"\nAnd they've still \u2013 just \u2013 maintained their unique way of speaking.\nWhen older Ocracoke natives, or \"O'cockers\" as they call themselves, speak, the \"I\" sound is an \"oi\", so they say \"hoi\" instead of \"high\". That's where the Hoi Toider name comes from: it's based on how the O'cockers say \"high tide\".\nThen there are the phrases and vocabulary, many of which are also kept over from the original British and Irish settlers. For example, when you're on Ocracoke, someone might \"mommuck a buck before going up the beach\", which means \"to tease a friend before going off the island\".\n\"We have a lot of words that have been morphed to make our own,\" said Amy Howard, another of William Howard's descendants, who runs the Village Craftsmen, a local arts and crafts store. \"[Hoi Toider] is a combination from a whole blend of cultures. A lot of the early settlers were well travelled, so they ran into lots of different types of people. For example, the word \"pizer\" we use comes from [a European] word which means porch. So if you're going to be sitting on your pizer, you're sitting on your porch.\"\nThere's a long list of words in Ocracoke vocabulary that are taken from countries across the globe. \"Quamish\", for example, means sick or nauseated. It comes from the 16th-Century English word \"qualm\". Then there's \"buck\", which means a male friend. You can trace that back to 13th-Century Germany, where it originally meant a male deer, as it does in most English-speaking places today.\nLocals even made up words in some cases. For example, early settler children played a game of hide and seek called meehonkey. Everyone would hide and call out \"meehonkey\" while one person tried to find them. According to island tradition, Amy told me, the kids believed meehonkey was the sound a goose made as it flew by. Then there's \"dingbatter\", which is used for anyone who isn\u2019t a native.\nBut with each generation, the dialect is starting to disappear. The world is coming to the island through television and the internet, as well as with the long line of tourists who show up every summer. There's also more people from the mainland moving in.\n\"What's happening is that some of these small dialects that thrive on isolation are dying because isolation is a thing of the past,\" said Dr Wolfram. \"They still pick up terms and vocabulary, but when a kid from the island retains a strong dialect, that was the norm and now it\u2019s an exception.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The Alabama musuem grappling with the 'Gulf of America'\n\u2022\u00a0How Trump's sweeping new policies could change travel\n\u2022\u00a0The only land disputed between the US and Canada\nIn the past, kids adopted the dialect because that was the only version they heard. Now there are hundreds of dialects and languages that most will encounter before they graduate high school. In fact, as of 2024, on this island of 676 people, fewer than half actually speak with the full Hoi Toider brogue.\n\"Within one to two generations, it'll be gone,\" said Dr Wolfram. \"It's dying out and we can\u2019t stop that.\"\nYet while the dialect may be in danger, the islanders are managing to hold onto their unique culture in other ways. In the beginning, settlers often had to come up with alternatives when they didn't have the right ingredients for a recipe. That same concept holds true today: with limited stores on the island, if you run out of supplies, you can either head to the mainland for what you need or just find a replacement.\n\"Ocracoke is really good at adapting,\" said Amy. \"I joke that we need to make a cookbook for Ocracoke that says what the recipe is and then what you can actually get, because almost inevitably, you get a quirky recipe and you won\u2019t have everything you need.\"\nThat's actually how the fig cake, which is now Ocracoke's signature dish, came to be. The story goes that in 1964, island resident Margaret Garrish was making a date cake and she had all the ingredients mixed in, except one.\n\"She found she didn't have any [dates], so she did what we all do and looked in her cupboard and found a jar of fig preserves,\" Amy said, explaining that figs are a holdover from the original settlers, and you can find fig trees in almost every yard. \"She threw them in the cake, mixed them up and now we have fig cakes.\"\nNow every year in August, the island holds a Fig Festival, complete with a fig cake bake-off, fig tastings, a square dance and traditional games like meehonkey.\nBut while some traditions stand strong, residents do see the island changing.\nNew York native Daphne Bennink\u00a0came to the island 35 years ago and never left. For her, the change, in some ways, reflects the same wealth of experience those original settlers brought.\n\"I see more and more people coming here,\" Bennink said. \"On Ocracoke, you have this kind of patchwork quilt of all people from all walks. It\u2019s a little bit of a melting pot.\"\nAs for what type of culture that melting pot will create? Everyone I talked to pretty much said the same thing: no matter what changes, some things will stay the same on Ocracoke. If someone is sick, the community will pitch in. If one business owner needs help, 14 others will show up to solve the problem. The dialect may change, but the intent behind those words will remain the same.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "For many, constant bad news numbs our reaction to climate disasters. But research suggests that a new type of immersive storytelling about nature told through virtual reality (VR) can both build empathy and inspire us to act.\nI'm crying into a VR headset. I've just watched a VR experience that tells the story of a young pangolin called Chestnut, as she struggles to survive in the Kalahari Desert. A vast, dusty landscape extends around me in all directions, and her armoured body seems vulnerable as she curls up, alone, to sleep. Her story is based on the life of a real pangolin that was tracked by scientists.\nChestnut hasn't found enough to ants to eat, since insect numbers have dwindled due to climate change. Her sunny voice remains optimistic even as exhaustion takes over. In the final scenes, she dies, and I must clumsily lift my headset to dab my eyes.\nVR experiences can be a lot more than just moving or fun, research suggests. Scientists are discovering that nature experiences shown through VR can affect our attitudes and behaviours \u2013\u00a0and that these arresting depictions of nature might nudge us into taking better care of our environment.\nMy powerful VR experience with Chestnut's story was made by HabitatXR, a production studio based in Johannesburg. Founder Ulrico Grech-Cumbo launched the company in 2016, following many trips to the African bush during which he captured its green, dusty landscapes and iconic wildlife on camera. He had experience working in VR, and realised that he could translate his footage into something more immersive.\n\"I thought it would be a hell of a lot of fun being inside a natural history documentary,\" he says.\nHabitatXR is just one of the companies experimenting with VR technology to create nature experiences. Wild Immersion, based in Paris, take their immersive movies of underwater worlds and snowscapes to science centres and aquariums. And UK artist collective Marshmallow Laser Feast have created immersive experiences that show the forest through the eyes of a dragonfly, and take the viewer \"inside\" a tree.\nThe nature experiences developed by HabitatXR are situated in a virtual version of the African savannah. In one, I find myself in a misty landscape dotted with squat, flat-topped acacias. Suddenly a rhinoceros emerges, dangerously close, its enormous horn scything the air as it walks towards me and lowers its head.\nDespite the pixelated graphics, I instinctively look down to where my knee should be \u2013\u00a0to where the rhino's horn ought to have grazed it. The beast lets out a breathy snort and, mercifully, retreats.\nI'm beginning to see how emotionally compelling this kind of storytelling can be. And I'm not alone \u2013 when an environmental NGO took one of HabitatXR's VR experiences to a fundraising gala, Grech-Cumbo saw the powerful effect it had on those who watched it. \"High net worth individuals were strolling around with expensive watches and glasses of champagne,\" he says. \"We'd sit them down in a dark room and put a VR headset on them, and five minutes later, they'd be crying. That's not something I've ever seen a film do [to] 50 people at a time.\"\nGrech-Cumbo's observation is reflected in scientific research, which finds that VR tends to trigger stronger emotions than other media. Engaging in a VR experience about a Syrian refugee elicits more intense emotions than reading an article showing the same images and information, for example.\nThere may be particular benefits to VR content that deals with nature. One nature experience depicting a forest of majestic trees, for example, made people more likely to take action to protect the environment, such as signing a petition on plastic reduction or taking flyers to spread the word about the petition. Another, of a journey through the Amazon rainforest, found that participants who experienced the forest through VR reported feeling more connected to nature and expressed greater commitment to the environment than participants who watched the same rainforest visuals on a standard computer screen.\nVR is particularly good at making us feel a complex and impactful emotion: awe. Psychologists describe awe as the feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends your current understanding of the world. It can make us feel wonder, but also uncertainty. And research suggests that experiencing awe can make us more inclined to make personal sacrifices for the environment. \nHype Metre\nVirtual reality shows potential to spark powerful emotional connections with the natural world. Research suggests nature stories experienced through VR can elicit awe, build empathy and inspire environmental action more effectively than traditional media.\nHowever, VR technology remains relatively inaccessible. Only around 10 million headsets are sold globally each year, and expensive devices such as the Apple Vision Pro (\u00a33,499 in the UK, or $3,499 in the US) limit mainstream adoption. Questions remain about how virtual nature experiences might affect our relationship with our real local environments, and studies indicate VR nature can't boost our mood in the same way real nature does.\nThese recent scientific analyses of awe build on a long history of its exploration in philosophy and the arts. It particularly obsessed certain 18th-Century poets and writers, whose experience of what they called \"the sublime\" was often inspired by nature.\u00a0(Learn more about the power of awe in this article by Richard Fisher about the upsides of feeling small.)\nAlice Chirico, a psychologist at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan, Italy, has studied VR's ability to make us feel awe, and how this might impact people's relationship to the natural world. She has found that VR nature experiences prompt us to feel awe when they induce a sense of vastness \u2013 like huge mountains and tall trees. In another study, she found that these kinds of awe-inspiring virtual nature experiences made people more likely to take social actions geared towards protecting the environment\nAlice Chirico, a psychologist at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan, Italy, has studied VR's ability to make us feel awe, and how this might impact people's relationship to the natural world. She has found that VR nature experiences prompt us to feel awe when they induce a sense of vastness \u2013\u00a0like huge mountains and tall trees. In another study, she found that these kinds of awe-inspiring virtual nature experiences made people more likely to take social actions geared towards protecting the environment.\n\"Awe is able to support positive attitudes towards the environment and also a sense of attachment towards the environment \u2013 a kind of nature connectedness, the feeling of being included within something that is much bigger than us,\" Chirico says.\u00a0\nVR can do this in ways that other media formats can't, she says, because it can drop us into a story and create the illusion that we're part of it. VR \"manipulates the sense of presence\", Chirico says, creating \"the illusion of being really there in that specific place in that specific moment, as if it is reality itself\".\nThe immersive advantage VR may have over other media such as articles or videos could have real world impacts. Researchers have found that people are more inclined to save energy at home when they learn about the need for pro-environmental behaviours through VR, rather than from an article or video. They suggest that the difference is because of what they call the \"presence mechanism\" \u2013 the feeling of truly being inanother world.\nThese experiences typically bring the viewer up close to their subject \u2013 face to face with a gorilla, or inside a migrating wildebeest herd. Feelings of immersion in such scenes might be limited by current technology, however. For me, the horn-swinging rhino was striking, though not visually believable. Researchers suggest that rich, high resolution imagery is important for immersing the viewer in the experience. VR tech likely to improve in the coming years, as accessories heighten the realism of virtual worlds. There is even a glove able to convince its wearer that a spider is crawling across their hand, for example.\nDespite decades of excitement over VR, the technology has struggled to break into the mainstream. Even today, relatively few people have access to VR headsets, with only around 10 million of the devices sold across the globe every year. Reports suggest that Apple's long-awaited Vision Pro headset, for example \u2013 which costs $3,499 in the US and \u00a33,499 in the UK \u2013 has achieved a fraction of its expected sales.\n\"Even though I've been working in this world for 10 years, there's probably a nine out of 10 chance that if I put a headset on a person, it's their first time wearing a VR headset,\" Grech-Cumbo says.\nEven if the technology were more accessible, could dazzling virtual experiences undermine our appreciation for local, everyday nature? It is important, Grech-Cumbo acknowledges, that eye-catching VR nature experiences don't distract us from the real forests, parks and mountain ranges near to where we live.\n\"This is about understanding our own relationship with nature, wherever we are,\" he says.\nWith this in mind, HabitatXR is now working on a project that will bring virtual nature into cities, starting with Johannesburg. Their plans for a VR \"Zoo of the Future\" will include a web of life experience, in which people will be able to virtually pick up individual species \u2013 flowers, grasses, bugs, animals \u2013 from an ecosystem map, and see their ecological links to other species.\n\"[We want to] put an emphasis on the fact that we are all connected \u2013\u00a0whether we believe it or not, whether we like it or not,\" Grech-Cumbo says.\nChirico emphasises that VR's goal should not be to replace reality and nature. There are lots of things virtual nature can't do. Studies suggest it can't boost our mood in the same way real nature can, for instance. However, it could be democratising. \"People don't [always] have full or easy access to nature, so the goal is to provide it in a cheaper way,\" Chirico says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The cement that could turn your house into a giant battery\n\u2022 In Cleveland, mushrooms digest entire houses\n\u2022 How beer sludge is being turned into vegan milk\nIn the US, for example, 100 million people, including 28 million children, reportedly do not have access to parks close to their homes. VR nature experiences might, in such cases, enable people to interact with an unreal yet informative and inspiring version of nature. Plus, adds Chirico, \"There's the fact that you don't have to move from your home, so the emissions are reduced \u2013\u00a0you can explore amazing panoramas that otherwise would require hours and hours of traveling by plane or car.\"\nAs I blinked through tears towards the end of HabitatXR's story about Chestnut the pangolin, some white text floated in front of me before the credits rolled: \"This isn't a story about pangolins. Or ants. Or even climate change. This is a story about us,\" it read \u2013\u00a0a reminder that humans are part of the same ecosystems as plants and other animals.\n\"The overarching message,\" Grech-Cumbo says, \"is that we are a part of nature, not the opposite of nature.\"\n--\nFor timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign up to the Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, Xand Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "About 15 years ago, an Indian rapper of humble origins broke onto the country's then-infertile hip-hop music scene and transformed it forever.\nHe teased, cajoled and vexed his listeners, daring them to explore the \"devilish\" contours of his mind, as he sang rash rhymes about parties, drugs and \"seducing\" women. His songs played in clubs and weddings, blaring from stereos at big parties and roadside tea stalls alike.\nThen, at the peak of his career, he vanished. Seven years later, Yo Yo Honey Singh is back - with a new album and an ongoing music tour, claiming to be a changed man after a prolonged battle with drug abuse and mental health struggles.\nThe 41-year-old singer and producer was once one of India's biggest music stars, a figure who \"moved the cultural gravity of hip-hop music\", says music journalist Bhanuj Kappal in Famous, a recent Netflix documentary on Singh. \nBut he was also deeply controversial - and, by his own admission, an \"aggressive and reckless man\", routinely accused of promoting vulgarity, debauchery and violence through his music.\nMany criticised Singh's lyrics for depicting violence against women and rape, an image that gained further traction in the press after his former wife and childhood sweetheart accused him of domestic violence in her divorce filing. Singh has denied the charge.\nSeven years later, the singer is no longer the defiant hitmaker who once ruled the charts with his provocative, foot-tapping anthems.\nA lot has changed in the intervening years, including Indian hip-hop, which has evolved into a thriving, dynamic space. Artists once inspired by his sound have now surpassed him as the genre's leading voices.\nSingh also seems different. From someone who described himself as \"the all-knowing master of the universe\", he now identifies as a God-fearing man who believes in good energies, the cyclic nature of life and \"scientific astrologers\".\nHe claims his music is now more conscious, moving beyond drugs to something deeper. But loyal fans say it's lost its edge and his latest tracks haven't left a mark.\n\"He has a core audience that will stick with him forever... but his vision is old now. It's outdated,\" Kappal says.\nBut Singh is not ready to be written off, yet.\nInstead of trying to conceal or defend his personal struggles with fame and drugs, he has made it the centrepiece of his comeback.\nSince his return, Singh has candidly admitted his struggles with addiction and mental health. \"Drugs destroyed me completely,\" he told Lallantop, a digital news platform. \"I lost myself to fame, money and women. I was like a devil, completely satanic.\"\nIn interviews, he is witty and relaxed, speaking with the clarity of a tormented artist who, after battling his inner demons, seems to have unlocked a spiritual truth\n\"What goes around comes around, I really believe that,\" he said recently. \"It took a lot of time for me to get out from where I was stuck. But I am back now.\"\nBorn Hridesh Singh in Punjab state, he grew up in a cramped Delhi neighbourhood. Those tough early years shaped his music and still echo in his work today.\n\"This ghetto was my home, my hood, always will be,\" he's often heard saying.\nSingh always knew he wanted a career in music. He started as a college DJ, later moving into production full-time. \"I wanted to make beats and produce music, not sing or write,\" he says. \nBut after years as a small-time producer in Punjab, he realised it wouldn't be enough. \"My sounds were too urban for the place. People didn't understand it. For that, I had to go beyond the state.\"\nSo he went solo. In 2011, Singh released The International Villager, his breakout album. Blending Punjabi folk - its dhol beats and string melodies - with global hip-hop, he created something entirely new.\nFor three months, it seemed the formula had failed. Then everything changed. Overnight, the songs went viral, topped charts, won awards - and catapulted Singh into Bollywood.\nBrown Rang, a song about a brown man's global ambition, became YouTube's most-watched video in 2012. Shot in Dubai on a million-dollar budget, it introduced many Indians to the bling of hip-hop - fast cars, baggy clothes, gem-studded watches and gold chains - set to slick, thumping beats.\nDespite mounting criticism over his misogynistic lyrics, Singh packed stadiums and churned out hits, breaking into Bollywood with songs for stars like Shah Rukh Khan and Akshay Kumar.\n\"A lot of times, my lyrics were trash, even I knew that. But people were still listening to it because the sound was so good and fresh,\" he told Lallantop.\nBut Singh's ascent to fame coincided with his personal downfall.\n\"I was drowning in drugs and alcohol, smoking 12-15 joints and downing bottles. I abandoned my family, lost control. This one time, I got so high I bit a friend on his stomach eight times,\" he told Lallantop.\nIn 2017, Singh broke down mid-tour - a moment that shook him. He quit music and substances, returned to Delhi and began recovery with a global team of doctors and therapists. \"I told my family I was mentally unwell. I can't do anything till I get better.\"\nSingh says he's been sober for seven years, except for the occasional beer.\n\"I have been to hell and back,\" he says in Famous. \"Even now, I wake up hazy because of the medicines.\"\nFans, however, appreciate Singh's raw honesty about his self-destructive tendencies - and his effort to overcome them.\n\"No-one's perfect. But at least Singh tries to be better. He may have left the scene briefly but his music never stopped playing,\" says Nandini Gupta, a Delhi-based  student. \nOthers see his transformation as performative, noting his new music remains problematic. \"Though toned down, he is still objectifying women and talking only about money and fame,\" says listener Bushra Neyazi.\nNo matter how you see it, Singh's redemption feels like another challenge to his audience - pushing them to accept his complicated past and give his music another chance.\n\"I was away for seven years, but I will drive everyone mad again in the next seven,\" he said recently. \n\"I am back and I want the same love I received seven years ago.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Six months ago, a viral TikTok trend made us obsessed with being very demure and very mindful - but now, modesty has taken a back seat among celebrities who have made see-through outfits all the rage on red carpets and catwalks.\nAt the Brit Awards last week, big winner Charli XCX went full brat as she wore a sheer black dress, prompting hundreds of complaints to media watchdog Ofcom.\nShe used one of her acceptance speeches to address the controversy of her outfit. \"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,\" she said. \"I feel like we're in the era of 'free the nipple' though, right?\"\nThe nearly naked look has been a talking point at other award ceremonies - including last Sunday's Oscars and the Grammys in February, when Kanye West's girlfriend Bianca Censori dropped her coat on the red carpet to reveal an almost entirely invisible dress.\nThe love for transparent textiles has continued at London and Paris fashion weeks, with many of the celebrities watching on also getting the memo.\nAt Stella McCartney's Paris show, US actress and Michael Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson wore a translucent black off-the-shoulder maxi dress with only a nude-coloured thong underneath.\nRapper Ice Spice sported a black lace catsuit with a feathered coat at the show.\nNaked dressing was a key trend in some designers' spring/summer collections, and the theme has continued in autumn/winter looks too.\nAs Vogue wrote in January: \"For a period of time, sheerness was few and far between, but nowadays, 'naked dressing' is commonplace every season.\"\nDior's latest collection embraced see-through material and presented it in an ethereal way, with intricate detailing and gender-fluid silhouettes.\nCreative director Maria Grazia Chiuri described her collection as \"demonstrating how clothing is a receptacle that affirms cultural, aesthetic and social codes\".\nThe trend divides opinion but is certainly part of a wider movement - last summer Charli XCX's definition of being a brat included wearing \"a strappy white top with no bra\".\nSheer dressing is a nod to the minimalist looks of the 1990s - think transparent blouses and Kate Moss wearing a thin slip dress - and with our love for nostalgia fashion, it's no wonder it is taking off again.\nThe trend also had a resurgence a decade ago. The \"free the nipple\" movement was everywhere in the early 2010s, with Rihanna stirring up headlines with her sheer crystal-embellished dress at the CFDA awards in 2014.\nCharli XCX's Brits outfit was praised by some on social media. \"Stop policing women's bodies,\" one person wrote, while another said she looked comfortable in her outfit so \"why is society judging?\"\nBut many found it too risque for prime-time TV. Ofcom received 825 complaints  about the Brits ceremony, the majority relating to Charli's outfit and Sabrina Carpenter's eye-opening pre-watershed performance.\n\"Maybe think about putting this on at a time when kids ain't gonna be watching,\" one person wrote on social media.\nFashion stylist and CEO of clothing brand Mermaid Way, Julia Pukhalskaia, calls the choice to wear revealing dresses a \"provocative statement\", but says it's a \"way to reclaim the right to govern one's body\".\nThe controversy around it feeds into a wider dialogue about women's rights and double standards when it comes to dress codes, she adds.\nAbhi Madan, creative director of fashion brand Amarra, believes the trend \"is about embracing freedom and boldness in fashion\". \nThe idea of freeing the nipple \"isn't just about exposure - it's a movement towards body positivity and challenging conventional fashion norms\", he argues.\n\"Designers are now integrating sheer elements not just for shock value but to create a refined and elegant silhouette that empowers wearers.\"\nIt seems many Hollywood stars this year were feeling empowered as chiffon, lace and tulle were in plentiful supply at the Oscars.\nShock value is surely a factor for some, too, though.\nAt Vanity Fair's Oscars afterparty, Julia Fox wore a mesh dress with only long wavy hair to cover some of her modesty.\nThere were other interpretations of the naked dress - Megan Thee Stallion wore a green dress with strategically placed foliage and nipple coverings, while Zoe Kravitz opted to cover up the front but expose the back as a beaded mesh panel revealed her buttocks in her Saint Laurent dress.\n\"This year, naked dressing seemed to particularly thrive at the event,\" the New York Times noted.\nHowever, not everyone is on board. The Times fashion director Anna Murphy wrote that she's over the trend because \"it's only women who do this\".\n\"It is not an equal opportunities endeavour. It is, rather, a manifestation of the kind of thing that keeps this world unequal. That women's bodies are for public consumption and men's, usually, aren't,\" she wrote.\nSome men have been embracing the nearly naked trend, though. In 2022, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet wore striking a backless red top at Venice Film Festival, and at the 2023 Grammys Harry Styles freed the nipple in a plunge harlequin jumpsuit.\nIt's the women who will continue to cause more of a stir on runways and red carpets - and society will still be split on whether it's redefining conventional notions of modesty in fashion, a product of misogyny, or simply seeking attention.",

        "article_text": "Mark Carney has won the race to succeed Justin Trudeau as Canada's prime minister, vowing to win the trade war with the US and President Donald Trump.\nThe former governor of the Canadian central bank and Bank of England beat three rivals in the Liberal Party's leadership contest in a landslide. \nIn much of his victory speech, Carney, 59, attacked Trump, who has imposed tariffs on Canada and said he wants to make the country the 51st US state. \"Americans should make no mistake,\" he said. \"In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.\"  \nCarney is expected to be sworn in the coming days and will lead the Liberals in the next general election, which could be called in the coming weeks.\nCarney, now prime minister-designate, has never served in elected office. \nThe Liberal leadership race began in January after Trudeau resigned following nearly a decade in office. He had faced internal pressure to quit over deep unpopularity with voters, who were frustrated with a housing crisis and the rising cost of living. \nCarney won on the first ballot on Sunday evening, taking 85.9% of the vote to beat his nearest rival, former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland.\nLoud cheers erupted as the results were announced to a crowd of some 1,600 party faithful in Ottawa, Canada's capital.  \nThe party said more than 150,000 people had cast ballots in the race. \nCarney, who will lead a minority government in parliament, could either call a snap general election himself or opposition parties could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month.\nThe governing Liberals have seen a remarkable political turnaround since Trudeau's exit, as Canadians have been galvanised by Donald Trump's trade threats and support for annexing their country\nAt the beginning of the year, they trailed the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, by more than 20 points in election polls.\nThey have since narrowed the gap and some polls show them statistically tied with Poilievre's party.\nMuch of Carney's speech focused on what he called Trump's \"unjustified tariffs\" on Canada, America's largest trading partner. \nThe US imposed levies of 25% on Canadian goods last Tuesday, but rowed back within days to exempt goods compliant with an existing trade agreement.\nCanada responded with retaliatory tariffs of its own as Trudeau accused his US counterpart of trying to collapse the country's economy.\nCarney echoed that in his victory speech, saying Trump was \"attacking Canadian workers, families, and businesses\". \n\"We can't let him succeed,\" he added, as the crowd booed loudly.\nHe said his government would keep tariffs on US imports \"until the Americans show us respect\".\nCanada's economy depends significantly on trade with the US and risks tipping into recession if the sweeping tariffs threatened by Trump are fully imposed.\n\"I know these are dark days,\" Carney said. \"Dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust. \n\"We're getting over the shock, but let us never forget the lessons: we have to look after ourselves and we have to look out for each other. We need to pull together in the tough days ahead.\"\nCarney also pledged to \"secure our borders\" - a key demand of Trump who has accused Canada of failing to control the flow of migrants and fentanyl going south.\nThe US president even got a mention in Carney's attacks on his main opponent, Conservative leader Poilievre.\n\"Pierre Poilievre's plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,\" said Carney. \n\"Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him.\"\nShortly before Carney took to the stage, Trudeau gave an emotional farewell speech, reflecting on his 12 years as Liberal leader.\nHe warned that Canada was facing an \"existential challenge\" from the US under Trump.\nThe Conservatives have had to pivot politically since Trudeau's resignation, and are attacking Carney as not representing change but rather being \"just like Justin\".\nThey accuse the Liberals of a \"sneaky\" plan to win a fourth term by simply substituting their leader.\nPoilievre's party has also accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York. \nCarney said the formal decision by shareholders to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board at the start of this year but a letter emerged showing he had recommended the move in December.\nFederal Public Safety Minister David McGuinty, who endorsed Carney, told the BBC that he \"embodies the kind of quiet determination, but steely determination and competence to deal with some of these big issues\". \n\"I'm really, really excited for what's coming.

        "article_text": "Davina McCall says she will be friends for life with the neurosurgeon who removed her benign brain tumour.\nThe TV presenter, 57, underwent surgery in November after a colloid cyst was found during a health check-up as part of her menopause advocacy work.\nShe said she chose Kevin O'Neill to perform the operation after a recommendation from actress and model Caprice, a participant on TV show The Jump which McCall presented, whose own brain tumour was found during a scan for concussion.\nSpeaking to The Times, McCall said of Mr O'Neill: \"We're going to be friends for the rest of our lives. We are going to go out to dinner with our partners. We are going to do it.\"\nDiscussing their conversation pre-surgery, she said: \"The temptation, of course, was to say to him: 'I've got three children. Please, please keep me alive.'\n\"But that is quite a stress for the surgeon.\n\"It's an immense pressure and what he needs to know is that I have faith in him.\n\"I know that he is the best at his job. I know that he wants to do the best for me.\n\"So I said to him: 'You do whatever you need to do. I put all my faith in you.' He doesn't need me screaming at him to keep me alive.\n\"He needs to be in the calmest and most confident place. I wanted to empower Kevin to do the best job he could.\"\nMr O'Neill, 62, said of the former Big Brother host: \"Davina is a special person.\n\"Some people are so terrified they can't make a decision [about what to do when diagnosed].\"\nDespite his experience, the neurosurgeon said he found the procedure stressful \"because she was high profile and her career rests on her memory\".\nDescribing himself as \"spiritual\", he added: \"I prayed in the run-up. And just before, on holiday in Venice, I dropped my glasses and when I went to pick them up, I bent down and saw a card with my birthday printed on it. I saw it as a good sign.\"\nNon-cancerous brain tumours are more common in people over the age of 50, and symptoms can include headaches, vision problems and drowsiness, according to the NHS website.\nSome can be difficult to remove without damaging surrounding tissue. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy can also be used if the surgery is not successful.\nMother-of-three McCall said that although she was told to expect a good outcome, minor risks of death or losing her short-term memory from the operation meant that she decided to put her affairs in order before the procedure.\n\"I set up my whole life before I went into the operating theatre knowing that, if I didn't make it, the kids would be OK,\" she said.\n\"I needed to go under the anaesthetic knowing I had my ducks in a row.\n\"It was my way of letting go. And I am so grateful for that process, because I realised through all of it that, if I were not around, my children would be on the right path.\n\"If this hadn't happened to me, I'd have stayed in 'mum mode'. I love my kids so much, but I looked at them and thought: 'Would they be OK without me?'

        "article_text": "On his 18th birthday, Raphinha sat alone in his tiny room in Florianopolis, staring at his phone. No messages. No calls. No offers. Injured and out of the Avai U20 team, he was on the verge of giving up. \nFootball had been his escape from the favelas of Brazil's Porto Alegre, but now it felt like a dead end. His dream was slipping away and for the first time - although by no means the last - he wondered if he was chasing something that wasn't meant for him.\nThen came the voice that changed everything. His mother, always his fiercest supporter, refused to let him quit. \"If you stop now,\" she told him, \"you'll have to live with this for the rest of your life. Are you ready for that?\"\nThat moment became his turning point. Fast forward to today, and the same player who nearly walked away from football is now at the heart of Barcelona's revival, delivering goals and defying expectations.\nRaphinha's journey from Porto Alegre to Barcelona's dressing room is a story of resilience, discipline, and continuous self-improvement. His transformation into a top-level performer is not just about talent. It's about mindset, sacrifice, and an unwavering desire to succeed.\nShould Barcelona somehow manage to win this inaugural season of the new-look Champions League, it will also be a personal triumph for the 28-year-old, who as recently as last summer was cast in the role of sacrificial lamb in Barcelona's attempt to bring in Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams.\nPlot the route to Champions League glory - who is your winner?\nPlay BBC Sport's new Champions League game\nRaphinha was raised in the relentless, grinding poverty seen across the sprawling shanty towns that litter the landscape in and around the neighbourhood of Restinga in the city of Porto Alegre.\nIn a neighbourhood where violence and drug trafficking are often a way of life, Raphael Dias Belloli knew from an early age that football was not just a way out - it was the only way out. \nHe has spoken about how he saw talented friends take the wrong path. Unlike them, he had the support of his family, especially his mother and uncle, who encouraged him to keep pushing forward with sport despite financial struggles. \nHis mother worked tirelessly, and his family made sacrifices to buy him football boots and pay for his transport to training sessions.\nHis football education was all about survival; playing barefoot against older opponents in the streets helped him develop endurance and technical skills under pressure. Both would become his most defining traits.\nHe was initially rejected by clubs like Internacional and Gremio because they considered him too thin and lightweight for professional football. \nDespite these setbacks, the rejection fuelled his competitive spirit and obsession with proving people wrong. Eventually he got a chance at Avai, a smaller club with a solid youth system where he learnt to handle the physical side of the game before having to face the first of many crises.\nA serious injury at Avai's U20 team left him sidelined and questioning his footballing future. The turning point came when his mother reminded him in no uncertain terms that giving up would mean having to find a 'proper' job.\nFrom that moment, his commitment to discipline and sacrifice became absolute, he started seeing football not just as a passion but his only way to a better life.\nUnlike many Brazilian stars who first shine at major domestic clubs, Raphinha had to prove himself in Europe from the bottom up.\nIn Portugal, first with Vitoria Guimaraes and then Sporting, he showed his ability to beat defenders and create chances, while at Rennes he proved he could be a game changer.\nHe was catching the eyes of the bigger clubs and, fortunately for him, he attracted the attention of the hardest of taskmasters that is Marcelo Bielsa, who took him to Leeds and rapidly accelerated his development albeit via a harsh, unforgiving regime.\nIt was there that he developed an outstanding physical endurance, which made his explosive playing style sustainable, improved his off-the-ball movement and pressing intensity and learned to move intelligently without the ball.\nHe also caught the attention of Barcelona who signed him on a five-year contract for a reported initial fee of \u00a350m, potentially rising to \u00a355 million in add-ons.\nRaphinha struggled initially playing for an elite club. \nCoach Xavi saw him more as a squad member than as an undisputed starter and even when he started to be a regular in the line up, he rarely played full games.\nBarcelona's inability to buy without selling first due to financial issues put him firmly in the frame as the club's biggest playing asset and the player most likely to be sold - especially while Barcelona were trying to sign Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams last summer.\nFocus was also elsewhere with the precocious and outrageously talented Lamine Yamal the centre of everyone's attention and effectively undroppable.\nIn two seasons at the club, Raphinha was used off the bench 11 times and started just 42 times out of a possible 76.\nThe message coming out of Barcelona was simple. \"We don't want to lose you, but we think you ought to go,\" seemed to be the gist of it.\nRaphinha had other ideas, although it was a close-run thing.\n\"There were several moments, not just one [when I considered leaving],\" he admits now.\n\"There was a lot of self-doubt. I have a nasty habit of criticising myself heavily, so to speak, so that pressure made me think about leaving.\"\n\nHansi Flick was appointed Barcelona head coach in May 2024\nThe dismissal of manager Xavi in May and subsequent appointment of Hansi Flick changed everything.\nThe German coach gave him a bigger role and allowed him to play with confidence. He is now a player reborn.\nFlick focused his work on the importance of making smarter decisions, knowing when to dribble, when to pass. The more direct style suited him too.\nThese days he loses the ball less and is more efficient and composed in front of goal. His current stats are remarkable.\nHe has 24 goals and 18 assists in 39 games and has scored in every match he has played in the Champions League this season.  He has established himself as one of Barcelona's key players and a genuine Ballon d'Or contender.\nHe has also been voted as one of the team captains, receiving the fourth-highest tally of votes behind Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Ronald Araujo and Frenkie de Jong. When they were injured he became the club's outright skipper.\nLamine Yamal has publicly said Raphinha is his main mentor in the squad.\nThat complements well with the fact that with the Brazilian national team he is the undisputed number one leader in the group.\nHis last-minute winner in the club's pulsating 4-5 group stage win in Benfica was a key moment in his and the club's season.\nHis celebration, with Barca's entire bench running towards him in the pouring rain, became a symbolic image of the team's unity and cemented his status as a dressing room leader.\nHe is clearly one of the most-respected voices in the dressing room, not overly vocal, but rather a leader by example, not just in matches but just as importantly in training.\nRaphinha knows just how hard it has been for him to get where he is today, just how fickle footballing fate can be and that it is primarily during your most successful times that you find yourself closest to failure.\nTo that end he leaves nothing to chance. He has spoken openly about how he avoids distractions outside football. \nHe has no interest in nightlife or partying, preferring to spend time at home with his family or focusing on training. It is this discipline that has been key to raising him to his physical and mental peak.\nAnd now he has reached this point, there is no stopping him and if Barcelona go far in the Champions League, nobody should argue his right to be considered one of the top players in the world.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has been in a tricky spot ever since.\nPlay the tournament without India? Indian markets make up a significant portion of the ICC's income, reported to be as much as 80%, external.\nTake away the opportunity for Pakistan to host a first tournament for 29 years at the last minute? Not feasible either.\nThe result was India playing the tournament in one city, remaining in one hotel, as the row over the advantages they held rumbled on throughout.\nNew Zealand covered more than 7,000km travelling to matches, while the nearest an India player got to a plane was Kuldeep Yadav's wide-armed celebration after claiming the crucial wicket of Rachin Ravindra in the final.\nAt every turn, India denied the obvious, until Mohammed Shami said the situation had \"definitely\" helped them after their semi-final. Moments earlier, in the same room, coach Gautam Gambhir suggested anyone that said so needed to \"grow up\".\nOpposition players remained largely quiet, until South Africa's David Miller said he would be supporting New Zealand in the final.\nSpeak to players in private and the power India seemingly hold is simply met with a shrug. This is the path cricket is on.\nIn 2023, there was the controversy of the semi-final pitch switched at the last minute in a move that appeared to suit India's spinners.\nEight months ago, India beat England in the T20 semi-final in Guyana, when again Rohit Sharma was the only captain to know where his side's matches would be played before departure.\nThat fixture was played at 10:30am to suit Indian TV, limiting the local crowd. This time India's last group match was played on a Sunday - when TV viewership in India is highest - and caused the farcical situation of South Africa having to fly to Dubai but return to Pakistan less than 24 hours later.\nHome advantage for a tournament you are hosting is one thing.

The fact they have not had injured star fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah for the Champions Trophy has largely been forgotten.\nBut these ICC men's events - increased in number to include either a Champions Trophy, T20 or 50-over World Cup every year until 2031 - are supposed to be the internationals game's counter to the money-spinning Indian Premier League. \nInstead, they now come so often, follow such a familiar pattern, that indifference is perhaps beginning to set in.\nThere were no written journalists from India's fellow semi-finalists, Australia, South Africa or New Zealand, at the Champions Trophy - hardly the sign of a healthy sport.\nThe fallout from England's dismal exit was loud among the diehards but outside of that? \nYou be the judge about whether this tournament came up in the family WhatsApp group.\nTheir chaotic organisation does not help either, with the schedule for this competition confirmed just 57 days before it began. \nNo English media were able to witness that Guyana semi-final because of the quick turnaround, a lack of flights and the fact it took place in a country US authorities advise against visiting on safety grounds.\nIn cricket, these things are simply waved through.\nThings will not get easier in the next two tournaments - the women's World Cup later this year and the men's T20 version in the spring of 2026.\nBoth will be held in India, in partnership with Sri Lanka in the case of the T20, meaning should Pakistan qualify they will get the treatment their rivals had here.\nPakistan could find themselves with the same advantages India had but uncertainties - two venues needed to be lined up for a final - are not going anywhere.\nIt is not that hope is lost. \nThis tournament has shown, yet again, that the product of international white-ball cricket on the field remains strong, despite two washouts and too many one-sided games.\nAustralia batter Josh Inglis' century against England was an all-timer, Ravindra continued to emerge as one of the next stars of the sport and Afghanistan all-rounder Azmatullah Omarzai should be the want of every Hundred team in Wednesday's draft.\nA dearth in quality is not a threat to international cricket's future.

        "article_text": "Mark Carney has won the race to succeed Justin Trudeau as Canada's prime minister, vowing to win the trade war with the US and President Donald Trump.\nThe former governor of the Canadian central bank and Bank of England beat three rivals in the Liberal Party's leadership contest in a landslide. \nIn much of his victory speech, Carney, 59, attacked Trump, who has imposed tariffs on Canada and said he wants to make the country the 51st US state. \"Americans should make no mistake,\" he said. \"In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.\"  \nCarney is expected to be sworn in the coming days and will lead the Liberals in the next general election, which could be called in the coming weeks.\nCarney, now prime minister-designate, has never served in elected office. \nThe Liberal leadership race began in January after Trudeau resigned following nearly a decade in office. He had faced internal pressure to quit over deep unpopularity with voters, who were frustrated with a housing crisis and the rising cost of living. \nCarney won on the first ballot on Sunday evening, taking 85.9% of the vote to beat his nearest rival, former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland.\nLoud cheers erupted as the results were announced to a crowd of some 1,600 party faithful in Ottawa, Canada's capital.  \nThe party said more than 150,000 people had cast ballots in the race. \nCarney, who will lead a minority government in parliament, could either call a snap general election himself or opposition parties could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month.\nThe governing Liberals have seen a remarkable political turnaround since Trudeau's exit, as Canadians have been galvanised by Donald Trump's trade threats and support for annexing their country\nAt the beginning of the year, they trailed the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, by more than 20 points in election polls.\nThey have since narrowed the gap and some polls show them statistically tied with Poilievre's party.\nMuch of Carney's speech focused on what he called Trump's \"unjustified tariffs\" on Canada, America's largest trading partner. \nThe US imposed levies of 25% on Canadian goods last Tuesday, but rowed back within days to exempt goods compliant with an existing trade agreement.\nCanada responded with retaliatory tariffs of its own as Trudeau accused his US counterpart of trying to collapse the country's economy.\nCarney echoed that in his victory speech, saying Trump was \"attacking Canadian workers, families, and businesses\". \n\"We can't let him succeed,\" he added, as the crowd booed loudly.\nHe said his government would keep tariffs on US imports \"until the Americans show us respect\".\nCanada's economy depends significantly on trade with the US and risks tipping into recession if the sweeping tariffs threatened by Trump are fully imposed.\n\"I know these are dark days,\" Carney said. \"Dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust. \n\"We're getting over the shock, but let us never forget the lessons: we have to look after ourselves and we have to look out for each other. We need to pull together in the tough days ahead.\"\nCarney also pledged to \"secure our borders\" - a key demand of Trump who has accused Canada of failing to control the flow of migrants and fentanyl going south.\nThe US president even got a mention in Carney's attacks on his main opponent, Conservative leader Poilievre.\n\"Pierre Poilievre's plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,\" said Carney. \n\"Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him.\"\nShortly before Carney took to the stage, Trudeau gave an emotional farewell speech, reflecting on his 12 years as Liberal leader.\nHe warned that Canada was facing an \"existential challenge\" from the US under Trump.\nThe Conservatives have had to pivot politically since Trudeau's resignation, and are attacking Carney as not representing change but rather being \"just like Justin\".\nThey accuse the Liberals of a \"sneaky\" plan to win a fourth term by simply substituting their leader.\nPoilievre's party has also accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York. \nCarney said the formal decision by shareholders to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board at the start of this year but a letter emerged showing he had recommended the move in December.\nFederal Public Safety Minister David McGuinty, who endorsed Carney, told the BBC that he \"embodies the kind of quiet determination, but steely determination and competence to deal with some of these big issues\". \n\"I'm really, really excited for what's coming. And frankly, it's time for an election.\" \nThe Liberals will face Poilievre's Conservatives, who are the official opposition with 120 seats in the House of Commons; the Bloc Quebecois, who have 33 seats; and the New Democrats, who have 24, when Canadians next go to the polls. \nThe former central banker has run on a broadly centrist agenda, a shift from Trudeau, who moved the Liberals to the left.\nA major promise is to push forward major energy projects like pipelines, which have faced political roadblocks in recent years.\nHe has promised major investments in housing and clean energy projects, and to liberalise trade within Canada, where barriers remain between provinces, as well as diversifying the economy away from the US.\nDuring the leadership race, Carney promised to cap the size of the federal government, which expanded 40% under Trudeau.",

We have to protect our players. There are means, there are rules. There is some kind of anger.\"\nIreland interim head coach Simon Easterby said the injury to Dupont, who was replaced by Maxime Lucu, came after a \"rugby incident\".\n\"Tadhg [Beirne] cleans out someone in front of Antoine Dupont and he gets hit on the back of it. It happens, unfortunately,\" said Easterby.\n\"We have moved away and players have a real awareness now of clearing out on the lower limb of the player, which can create that type of injury that might have happened today, but that wasn't the case. \n\"He was securing his own ball and not making contact on Dupont. Unfortunately that happens. The guy that Tadhg hit was hit on to Dupont. It's just one of those things unfortunately. It happens in the game.\"\nChampionship leaders France play Scotland in Paris next weekend in what is the concluding game of the tournament, while Ireland will look to bounce back against Italy in Rome.\nThis video can not be played\nDominant France win to end Ireland's Grand Slam hopes",
