        "article_text": "When Cyclone Alfred barrelled over Australia's east coast earlier this month, it also blew the government's election plans off course.\nHoping to capitalise on some rare good news on interest rates, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was on the cusp of announcing an April polling date. Instead he had to pivot and focus on responding to the natural disaster. It was, one Labor Minister told me, a decision taken from him by \"an act of God\".\nYou might say that's been a theme of his government: big plans often derailed by unpleasant surprises \u2013 trying global economic conditions and a cost-of-living crisis which is battering many countries, foreign wars and tricky geopolitics, post-pandemic fallout and rising national divisions, and now giant storms.\n\"Global conditions are real,\" Albanese, who leads the Labor Party, said as he officially announced a 3 May election.\nThough, despite those challenges, he says his party has delivered. \"Landing where we have is like landing a 747 [jet] on a helicopter pad,\" he said, pointing to a recent increase in wage growth and falling inflation. \nBut he wants a second term to reset.\nStanding in his way is Peter Dutton - a conservative who leads the Liberal Party, the dominant member of the so-called Coalition with the National Party of Australia \u2013 who just two years ago polling indicated was deeply unpopular.\nBut the race between them is now so tight and the rise of independents or minor parties such that many are expecting a hung parliament.\nSo how has it unravelled for Prime Minister Albanese?\nHis victory in May 2022 was seen as a fresh start after nine years of conservative rule.\nClimate action was big on the agenda, as was addressing the cost-of-living and restoring stability to the country's leadership.\nBut the legacy he eyed for his government was on Indigenous affairs. He opened his victory speech reiterating a pledge to hold a historic referendum on an Indigenous Voice to Parliament, an advisory body that would inform the government on issues that affect First Nations people.\nAlbanese spent most of 2023 campaigning for a \"Yes\" vote. This was the moment, he hoped, that First Nations people would get constitutional recognition - finally catching up with other former British colonies - and that Australia would begin mending what many see as a very broken relationship with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.\nBut the proposal was decisively rejected, leaving many Indigenous people feeling disappointed and betrayed. Albanese was also left licking his wounds after a damaging campaign.\nSome critics blamed confusion and misinformation for why about 60% of Australians voted \"No\". But while Albanese was campaigning for the \"Yes\" vote, opposition leader Peter Dutton campaigned for \"No\", attacking Albanese for spending money on the referendum while a cost-of-living crisis intensified.\n\"[Dutton] not only won on the referendum, but also he won on positioning Labor as the government that's not completely focused on the issues that matter to Australia,\" says Kos Samaras, political consultant and a former Labor strategist.\nDuring Albanese's tenure, interest rates have been put up 12 times (and cut once, in February), inflation soared post-pandemic, the country's housing crisis deepened, and Australians increasingly felt stretched.\nThough the prime minister would lay the blame for many of those issues at the previous coalition government's feet, voters want to know who is best placed to deal with all of them now.\nIn Anthony Albanese's victory speech in 2022, he said Australia was \"the greatest country on earth\". Australian voters though are increasingly questioning whether that's still true \u2013 and perhaps more importantly, whether politicians from traditional parties are the ones able to fix it.\nSo though many are disillusioned with Labor, this won't necessarily translate as a vote for Dutton's Coalition at the ballot box.\nSupport for minor parties and independents reached record levels at the previous election, and similar is expected this time around. If neither party reaches the magic number of 76 seats in the House of Representatives, which poll after poll paints as unlikely, independent candidates could be the kingmakers of any future government.\nIf that happens, Australia would be another page in a story unfolding all over the world - disenfranchised voters seeking more radical solutions and voting for change. In many places this is a real threat to democracy as people stop trusting the system.\nBut while Australia faces the same challenges as other parts of the world, a few quirks in its electoral system have thus far guarded against more radical swings that we've seen in other countries, like the US, France and Germany.\nExperts all agree that mandatory voting is a key factor in Australia's political stability. In the 2022 elections, just under 90% of the population voted \u2013 much, much higher than the average OECD turnout of 69%. The fine for not voting in a federal election is a mere A$20 but there's a sense of duty here to go out and vote.\nWhat that means is politicians don't have to mobilise their bases \u2013 turnout is a given, it's just about pushing your narrative. Where voting is optional, there's a tendency for special interest groups to become overly influential as those who are less engaged decide not to cast a ballot. Plus, if everyone, no matter their politics, education or their wealth, goes to vote, it tends to pull the result towards a more representative centre.\n\"[Australia's] elections are decided in the middle,\" says the country's chief election analyst Antony Green. \"That means getting your message through those people who aren't paying much attention.\"\nThe other big stabiliser for Australia, say experts, is preferential voting \u2013 where voters effectively number their candidates in order of who they want to win. It's why in recent years the Greens have emerged on the left and One Nation on the right but still, Labor and the Coalition dominate. Experts say preferential voting tempers the effects of polarisation and forces the two major parties to appeal to people who aren't necessarily voting for them first in order to receive their next preferences, which also helps moderate policy.\nWhile the campaign will focus on problems close to home, the candidates would be foolish to ignore the global political headwinds.\nDuring last year's presidential election, few analysts I spoke to seemed to think a Trump White House would massively impact Australia, this comparatively small and distant democracy.\nBut five months feels like a lifetime in today's politics. Not a day goes by without Donald Trump making the headlines and Australians are tuning in to watch.\nWith Trump's obvious disregard for longstanding alliances as well as constant talk of tariffs and trade wars, all this plays a part in Australians' fears about their place in the world \u2013 and importantly, the future of what is arguably its most important diplomatic and military relationship.\nPeter Dutton argues he'd be much better than Albanese at dealing with Trump. But there are doubts that anyone really knows how to handle this new administration \u2013 politicians of all stripes around the globe are feeling their way with how best to manage their relationship with the US.\nWith Albanese firing the starting gun today, Australians have just over a month of intense campaigning to help them determine who they want to lead them through the next three years.\nWhile Labor's handling of the ex-cyclone Alfred has improved its chances \u2013 the Prime Minister's approval ratings have risen to their highest level in 18 months \u2013 polling in recent months has pointed towards a Dutton administration.\nIt's still incredibly close, and the Albanese government faces the unenviable prospect of being the first which fails to win a second term since 1931.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has imposed a range of tariffs - or import taxes - on billions of dollars worth of goods coming into the US from some of its top trading partners.\nThe tariffs apply to steel and aluminium imported to the US, as well as to some other products from Mexico, Canada and China - prompting announcements of counter-measures from the latter two countries and the European Union. \nTrump has also announced tariffs on cars coming into the US which are due to come into effect on 3 April. Tariffs on certain car parts are set to start in May or later.\nEconomists have warned these tariffs - and those introduced in response by other countries - could put prices up for American consumers. \nThat's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, which may choose to pass the cost on to customers, or to reduce imports, meaning fewer products are available.\nSo which things could become more expensive?\nThe US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade.\nMany US car companies also have operations in Mexico and Canada, set up under the terms of the longstanding free trade agreement between them.\nComponent parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.\nThe new tariffs on car parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt for now while US customs and border patrol set up a system to assess the duties.\nAnderson Economic Group has estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by roughly $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle.\nThe cost of the higher taxes is likely to be passed on to customers.\nAndrew Foran from TD Economics has said that disrupting trade flows through tariffs \"would come with significant costs\".\nHe argues that the \"uninterrupted free trade\" which has \"existed for decades\" in the car-making sector has lowered prices for consumers.\nPopular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.\nHowever, it's also possible that firms could decide to bring in less foreign beer.\nModelo became the number one beer brand in the US in 2023, and remains in the top spot, for now. \nThe picture is more complicated when it comes to spirits, which have been largely free of tariffs since the 1990s. \nIndustry bodies from the US, Canada and Mexico issued a joint statement in advance of the tariffs being announced saying they were \"deeply concerned\". \nThey argue that certain brands, such as Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila and Canadian whisky are \"recognized as distinctive products and can only be produced in their designated countries\".\nSo given the production of these drinks cannot simply be moved, supplies might be impacted, leading to price rises. \nThe bodies also highlighted that many companies own different spirit brands in the US, Canada and Mexico.\nThe US imports about a third of its softwood lumber from Canada each year, and that key building material could be hit by Trump's tariffs. \nTrump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".\nHowever, the National Association of Home Builders urged the president to exempt building materials \"because of their harmful effect on housing affordability\".\nThe industry group has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.\n\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.\nImports from the rest of the world could also be affected. \nOn 1 March, Trump ordered an investigation into whether the US should place additional tariffs on most lumber and timber imports, regardless of their country of origin, or create incentives to boost domestic production. \nFindings are due towards the end of 2025.\nThe \"most obvious\" household impact of a trade war with Canada would be on the price of Canadian maple syrup, according to Thomas Sampson from the London School of Economics.\nCanada's billion-dollar industry accounts for 75% of the world's entire maple syrup production.\nThe majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.\n\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" Mr Sampson said.\n\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but [which use] inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.\nCanada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil. \nAccording to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November 2024 came from Canada.\nWhile the US has introduced a 25% tariff on most goods imported from Canada, Canadian energy faces a lower rate of 10%. \nThe US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but its refineries are designed to process so-called \"heavier\" - or thicker - crude oil, which mostly comes from Canada, with some from Mexico.\n\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.\nThat means if Canada decided to reduce crude oil exports in retaliation against US tariffs, it could push up fuel prices. \nAvocados thrive in in the Mexican climate. \nNearly 90% of the avocados consumed in the US come from Mexico.\nThe US Agriculture Department has warned that tariffs on Mexican fruit and vegetables could increase the cost of avocados.\nRelated dishes like guacamole could also become more expensive. \nAdditional reporting by Lucy Acheson",

        "article_text": "Launching on Apple TV+, a new film industry satire co-created by and starring Seth Rogen nails the business \u2013 and features Martin Scorsese, Charlize Theron and others as themselves.\nA film studio head and his team of senior executives eagerly take their seats in a private screening room to watch the new Ron Howard movie for the first time. This is work for them, but they're also beside themselves with anticipation. \"I am so excited about watching this film!\" says the boss. It's going to be \"perfect\".\nMany critics have responded similarly to the series featuring this scene, Apple TV+'s film industry satire The Studio, which has generated major buzz before it even begins this week.\u00a0One reviewer has called it \"2025's best new show to date\". Another said it was\u00a0\"the most entertaining and spot-on depiction of Hollywood since Robert Altman's The Player\", hailing its \"stellar scripts and an ensemble of actors who are having an utter blast\". Yet another praises it as\u00a0\"a love letter to the art of filmmaking\". \nThe 10-part comedy stars Seth Rogen as Matt Remick, the beleaguered head of a struggling film\u00a0studio whose efforts to balance commercial viability with artistic integrity invariably cause problems. The\u00a0Studio\u00a0is sharp, funny, stylishly filmed and Rogen is a major draw in his own right, but another reason for the excitement surrounding the show is its extraordinary array of Hollywood A-listers playing themselves. They include, among others, Martin Scorsese, Ron Howard, Adam Scott, Olivia Wilde, Zo\u00eb Kravitz, Anthony Mackie, Charlize Theron, Steve Buscemi, Ice Cube, Zac Efron and Dave Franco.\nEvan Goldberg, who co-created, co-directed and co-wrote the series with his childhood friend and long-time creative partner Rogen, says in the production notes for the show that, except for two who remain nameless, every actor or director they approached to play themselves was up for it: \"People's only real question was, 'What's my joke?' 'What do I get to do?'.\" The stars taking part do have some excellent jokes and several of these big names are sending themselves up mercilessly. If there was an Emmy for \"best sport\", Kravitz would be a shoo-in for her antics in one episode when she accidentally gets high on drugs.\u00a0\nRogen's Remick is an executive who has worked at the fictional Continental\u00a0Studios for 22 years. He's a movie nerd; the sort of cinephile who will bend your ear about the incredible funeral shot in 1960s political epic Soy Cuba or wax lyrical about the \"magical\" properties of real film stock. He relaxes by watching Goodfellas for the millionth time. He yearns to make the next Annie Hall or Rosemary's Baby. He loves being around actors and directors and is desperate for their approval but as a\u00a0studio\u00a0guy \u2013 a suit, a bean-counter \u2013 the creatives only ever want to keep him at arm's length. Instead of hanging out with Hollywood's coolest, he has to take meetings with the Rubik's Cube people and the Jenga people because Continental is focused on making trashy popcorn movies with \"known brands\".\u00a0\nWhen the Continental head is fired after a string of box office bombs, the unpredictable CEO, Griffin Mill (Bryan Cranston), selects Matt to replace her. Mill has secured the movie rights to Kool-Aid, the soft-drink mix. He reasons that if a Barbie film can make a billion dollars for Warner Bros, Matt should be able to make money from a movie about the Kool Aid man, the drink's animated marketing mascot. Matt sets to work in the belief that prestige films and box office hits are not mutually exclusive but in a world where TikTok trends dictate film-making decisions, he's quickly forced to question that ideal.\nHe has a major problem in that he can't square his admiration for cinema legends with the need to make hard-nosed business decisions. He can't bring himself to tell Ron Howard that the last act of his latest movie sucks. He can't break it to Martin Scorsese that the\u00a0studio\u00a0won't be making his script about cult leader Jim Jones.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0Studio\u00a0is actually exactly the sort of show that a movie nut like Matt would love watching. There are enough easter eggs and in-jokes to delight the most knowledgeable of film fans. For example, the episode about Olivia Wilde making a neo-noir detective film which one character says \"sounds like a rip-off of Chinatown\" features several references to the Roman Polanski classic. The instalment that revolves around director Sarah Polley's attempt to capture an elaborate \"oner\" \u2013 a long, single shot \u2013 is itself cleverly shot to look like one long take; indeed, much of the series is shot in long takes, giving it a fly-on-the-wall feel. Griffin Mill is also the name of the main character in another Hollywood satire, Robert Altman's aforementioned 1992 film The Player.\u00a0\nIt was while rewatching beloved TV series during lockdown that Rogen had the idea for a series similar in tone and style to the hit 90s sitcom The Larry Sanders Show, which was set behind the scenes of a late-night talk show, but about the film industry rather than television. Rogen and Goldberg and the rest of the writing team (Peter Huyck, Alex Gregory and Frida Perez) drew on their own experiences in the business as fuel for the storylines. According to the production notes, key to Matt's character was Rogen and Goldberg's memory of a\u00a0studio\u00a0executive telling them: \"I got into this business because I love movies, and now my job is to ruin them\" \u2013 a line that has made it into the show almost unchanged.\nAnother classic show Rogen rewatched during lockdown was The Sopranos. Matt Remick does not have a huge amount in common with mob boss Tony Soprano but they do share one thing \u2013 a fear that they've arrived at the party too late. In the opening episode of The Sopranos, Tony, who has been suffering from panic attacks, tells his therapist of his \"work\": \"Lately, I've been feeling that I came in at the end. That the best is over.\" Similarly Matt worries that the golden age of cinema has passed. In episode one, he tells the boss he's replaced, Patty (Catherine O'Hara): \"I'm anxious, I'm stressed out, panicking pretty much all the time.\" The Continental office was built as a temple to cinema but, says Matt, \"it feels much more like tomb\". Matt's film-loving assistant Quinn (Chase Sui Wonders) thinks she's \"30 years too late\" to the industry.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a010 of the best TV shows to watch in March\n\u2022\u00a0This new WW2 TV drama is 'stunning'\n\u2022\u00a0How Snow White became 2025's most divisive film\nThe decline of cinema in the form of the old-school film\u00a0studios, as the streaming services become ever more successful, is an underlying theme throughout the series. There's a danger that Continental is going to be bought by Amazon. Ted Sarandos, the co-head of Netflix, has a cameo, stealing the limelight at an awards ceremony. An exasperated Scorsese wants Matt to give him back his script so he can go sell it to Apple \"the way I should have done in the first place\".\nOf course, the demise of Hollywood has been predicted almost since the first\u00a0studio\u00a0opened its doors. Legendary screenwriter Ben Hecht recalled walking around Hollywood in 1951 with David Selznick, the movie mogul who made Gone with the Wind, as Selznick insisted that movies were over and done with. \"Hollywood's like Egypt,\" he told Hecht. \"Full of crumbled pyramids. It'll never come back.\" And yet three quarters of a century later, it's still there. Several of The\u00a0Studio's exterior scenes pointedly frame the iconic Hollywood sign in the background of the shot.\nHecht had been lured to Hollywood from New York by his friend Herman Mankiewicz, the screenwriter of Citizen Kane, who telegraphed him to say: \"Millions are to be grabbed out here and your only competition is idiots.\"\nThe\u00a0Studio\u00a0leans into the notion that idiots are over-represented in Tinseltown. Matt's team \u2013 Quinn,\u00a0studio exec Sal Saperstein (Ike Barinholtz), and marketing maven Maya Mason (Kathryn Hahn) \u2013 are all lovable dolts. Griffin Mill is a lunatic of the first order.\nBut Hollywood has always been happy to poke fun at itself. Barton Fink (1991), The Player and Get Shorty (1995) are among the hits that have sent up Tinseltown. HBO's show Entourage satirised the industry and The\u00a0Studio\u00a0comes hard on the heels of another HBO series, The Franchise, about the making of a Marvel Cinematic Universe-style movie. However, The Franchise, although hilarious, was scathing and it was cancelled after just one season. It's difficult to know exactly why it failed to connect with a large enough audience although one reviewer found the show's \"constant cynicism\" very wearing. In contrast, The\u00a0Studio\u00a0is affectionate. It has us rooting for Matt and Continental and maybe even for film-making as an artistic endeavour.\u00a0\nAfter all, as Patty tells Matt: \"One week you're looking your idol in the eye and breaking his heart and the next week you're writing a blank cheque for some entitled nepo baby in a beanie. But when it all comes together, and you make a good movie\u2026 it's good forever.\" You could say the same for TV shows.\u00a0\nThe Studio begins on Apple TV+ on March 26\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\n\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Most modern structures are built to last 50 years or so, but ingenious ancient engineering has kept this watery city afloat for more than 1,600 years \u2013 using only wood.\nAs any local knows, Venice is an upside-down forest. The city, which turned 1604 years old on March 25, is built on the foundations of millions of short wooden piles, pounded in the ground with their tip facing downwards. These trees \u2013 larch, oak, alder, pine, spruce and elm of a length ranging between 3.5m (11.5ft) to less than 1m (3ft) \u00a0\u2013 have been holding up stone palazzos and tall belltowers for centuries, in a true marvel of engineering leveraging the forces of physics and nature.\nIn most modern structures, reinforced concrete and steel do the work that this inverted forest has been doing for centuries. But despite their strength, few foundations today could last as long as Venice's. \"Concrete or steel piles are designed [with a guarantee to last] 50 years today,\" says Alexander\u00a0Puzrin, professor of geomechanics and geosystems engineering at the ETH university in Zurich, Switzerland. \"Of course, they might last longer, but when we build houses and industrial structures, the standard is 50 years of life.\"\nBuilding to last\nOnly once, early on in his career, Puzrin has been asked to provide a guarantee of 500 years for a construction a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed temple in Israel.\n\"I was kind of shocked because this was unusual,\" he recalls. \"I was really scared, and they wanted me to sign. I called my boss in Tel Aviv, a very experienced, old engineer and I said, 'What are we going to do? They want 500 years.' He answered, '500 years? [pause]. Sign.' None of us is going to be there.\"\nThe Venetian piles technique is fascinating for its geometry, its centuries-old resilience, and for its sheer scale. No-one is exactly sure how many millions of piles there are under the city, but there are 14,000 tightly packed wooden poles in the foundations of the Rialto bridge\u00a0alone, and 10,000 oak trees under the San Marco Basilica, which was built in 832AD.\n\"I was born and raised in Venice,\" says Caterina Francesca Izzo, environmental chemistry and cultural heritage professor at the University of Venice. \"Growing up, like everyone else, I knew that underneath the Venetian buildings, there are the trees of Cadore [the mountain region next to Venice]. But I didn't know how these piles were placed, how they were counted and knocked down, nor the fact that the battipali\u00a0(literally the 'pile hitters') had a very important profession. They even had their own songs. It is fascinating from a technical and technological point of view.\"\u00a0\nThe battipali would hammer down the piles by hand, and they would sing an ancient\u00a0song\u00a0to keep the rhythm \u2013 a haunting and repetitive melody with lyrics that praise Venice, its republican glory, its Catholic faith, and declare death to the enemy of the time, the Turks. On a more lighthearted note, a Venetian expression still in use today, na testa da bater pai (literally 'a head that is good to pound down the piles') is a colourful way of saying that someone is dull or slow-witted.\nThe piles were stuck as deep as possible, until they couldn't be pounded down any further, starting at the outer edge of the structure and moving towards the centre of the foundations, usually driving nine piles per square metre in a spiral shape. The heads were then sawn to obtain a regular surface, which would lay below sea-level.\nTransverse wooden structures \u2013 either zatteroni (boards) or madieri (beams) \u2013 were placed on top. In the case of the bell towers, these beams or boards were up to 50cm (20in) thick. For other buildings, the dimensions were 20cm (8in) or even less. Oak provided the most resilient wood, but it was also the most precious. (Later on, oak would only be used to build ships \u2013 it was too valuable to stick in the mud.) On top of this wooden foundation, workers would place the stone of the building.\nThe Republic of Venice soon began protecting its forests to provide sufficient wood for construction, as well as for ships. \"Venice invented sylviculture,\" explains Nicola Macchioni, research director at the institute for bioeconomy at Italy's National Council for Research, referring to the practice of cultivating trees. \"The first official sylviculture document in Italy is indeed from the Magnificent Community of the Fiemme Valley [to the north-west of Venice], dating from 1111AD. It details rules to exploit the woods without depleting them.\"\nAccording to Macchioni, these conservation practices must have been in use years before they were written down. \"That explains why the Fiemme Valley is still covered by a lush fir forest today.\" Countries such as England, however, were facing wood shortages by the middle of the 16th Century already, he adds.\nVenice is not the only city relying on wooden piles for foundations \u2013 but there are key differences that make it unique. Amsterdam is another city partially built on wooden piles \u2013 here and in many other northern European cities, they go all the way down until they reach the bedrock, and they work like long columns, or like the legs of a table.\n\"Which is fine if the rock is close to the surface,\" says Thomas Leslie, professor of architecture at the University of Illinois. But in many regions, the bedrock is well beyond the reach of a pile. On the shore of Lake Michigan in the US, where Leslie is based, the bedrock could be 100ft (30m) below the surface. \"Finding trees that big is difficult, right? There were stories of Chicago in the 1880s where they tried to drive one tree trunk on top of another, which, as you can imagine ended up not working. Finally, they realised that you could rely on the friction of the soil.\"\nThe principle is based on the idea of reinforcing the soil, by sticking in as many piles as possible, raising substantial friction between piles and soil. \"What's clever about that,\" says Leslie, \"is that you're sort of using the physics\u2026 The beauty of it is that you're using the fluid nature of the soil to provide resistance to hold the buildings up.\" The technical term for this is hydrostatic pressure, which essentially means that the soil \"grips\" the piles if many are inserted densely in one spot, Leslie says.\nIndeed, the Venetian piles work this way \u2013 they are too short to reach bedrock, and instead keep the buildings up thanks to friction. But the history of this way of building goes back further still.\nThe technique was mentioned by 1st-Century Roman engineer and architect Vitruvius; Romans would use submerged piles to build bridges, which again are close to water. Water gates in China were built with friction piles too. The Aztecs used them in Mexico City, until the Spanish came, tore down the ancient city and built their Catholic cathedral on top, Puzrin notes. \"The Aztecs knew how to build in their environment much better than the Spanish later, who have now huge problems with this metropolitan cathedral [where the floor is sinking unevenly].\"\nPuzrin holds a graduate class at ETH that investigates famous geotechnical failures. \"And this is one of these failures. This Mexico City cathedral, and Mexico City in general, is an open-air museum of everything that can go wrong with your foundations.\"\nAfter more than a millennium and a half in the water, Venice's foundations have proved remarkably resilient. They are not, however, immune to damage.\u00a0\nTen years ago, a team from the universities of Padova and Venice (departments ranging from forestry to engineering and cultural heritage) investigated the condition of the city's foundations, starting from the belltower of the Frari Church, built in 1440 on alder piles.\nThe Frari belltower has been sinking 1mm (0.04in) a year since its construction, for a total of 60cm (about 24in). Compared with churches and buildings, belltowers have more weight distributed on a smaller surface and therefore sink deeper and faster, \"like a stiletto heel\", says Macchioni, who was part of the team investigating the city\u2019s foundations.\nCaterina Francesca Izzo was working on the field, core drilling, collecting and analyzing wood samples from underneath churches, belltowers and from the side of the canals, which were being emptied out and cleaned up at the time. She said that they had to be careful while they were working on the bottom of the dry canal, to avoid the wastewater sporadically gushing from the side pipes.\nThe team found that throughout the structures they investigated, the wood was damaged (bad news), but the system of water, mud and wood was keeping it all together (good news).\nThey debunked the common belief that the wood underneath the city doesn't rot because it's in an oxygen-free, or anaerobic, condition \u2013 bacteria do attack wood, even in absence of oxygen. But bacteria action is much slower than the action of fungi and insects, which operate in the presence of oxygen. Furthermore, water fills up the cells that are emptied out by bacteria, allowing wooden piles to maintain their shape. So even if the wooden piles are damaged, the whole system of wood, water and mud is held together under intense pressure, and is kept resilient for centuries.\n\"Is there anything to worry about? Yes and no, but we should still consider continuing this type of research,\" says Izzo. Since the sampling 10 years ago, they hadn't collected new ones, mainly because of the logistics involved.\nIt's not known for how many more hundreds of years the foundations will last, says Macchioni. \"However, [it will last] as long as the environment remains the same. The foundation system works because it is made of wood, soil and water.\" The soil creates an oxygen-free environment, the water both contributes to that and maintains the shape of the cells, and the wood provides friction. Without one of these three elements, the system collapses.\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, wood was completely replaced by cement in foundation construction. In recent years, though, a new trend of building with wood has gained increased interest, including the rise of wooden skyscrapers. \"It's kind of the cool material right now, and for really good reasons,\" comments Leslie. Wood is a carbon sink, it's biodegradable and thanks to its ductility, it's considered among the most earthquake-resistant materials.\n\"We can't of course build entire cities on wood nowadays because we are too many on the planet,\" adds Macchioni, but it's undeniable that without artificial materials and without motors, ancient builders just had to be more ingenious. Venice is not the only city with wooden foundations, but it is \"the only one [where the friction technique was used] en masse that is still surviving today and is so insanely beautiful\", adds Puzrin. \"There were people out there who didn't study soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering, and yet they produced something we can only dream about producing, which lasted so long. They were amazing, intuitive engineers who did exactly the right thing, taking advantage of all these special conditions.\"\u00a0\n* The illustrations in this story are for artistic purposes only and are not a true representation of the timber pile foundations under Venice, which are\u00a0tightly packed and do not have branches.\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.",

Luckily, that didn't come to be,\" he said.\nThree series later and having been Doctor Who's showrunner between 2017 and 2022, Chibnall has used an imagined Dorset as the backdrop for his debut novel, Death at the White Hart.\n\"A landlord is discovered murdered, tied to a chair in the middle of the A35 at 02:00 and he's got deer antlers strapped to his head. The question is who did it and why?\" Chibnall said.\nHe told BBC Radio Solent at West Bay that he still takes inspiration from his adopted county.\n\"The first few years I was living down here, doing that drive between Dorchester and Bridport or Dorchester and Lyme Regis, at that stretch of the A35, if you're doing it at 23:00 or midnight, it's so dark, it's so deserted,\" he said.\n\"It always took me back to Thomas Hardy novels when you think of the coach and horses that would drive along there and the mist and the fog that is along there.\n\"It's incredibly atmospheric, it's incredibly beautiful and terrifying at the same time. That's the sort of atmosphere that I wanted to harness for the novel.\"\nChibnall returned to Bridport Arts Centre on Monday to launch the novel, which ITV has already commissioned for a TV adaptation.\nThe BAFTA-award winning writer said it had always been \"an amazingly supportive community\".\nHe added: \"When Broadchurch was on, people would ask me whoever did it or could they be in it? Could I write a character like them? And I would have to say: 'you know that would be a murder suspect, don't you?'\"\nBut he said writing a book meant he could \"go into the characters' heads a lot more\" than he has been able to in his TV work.\n\"It's so different. Having done TV, you're part of a big operation, a big team,\" Chibnall added.\n\"So if I want to set something in a pub, a location manager has to find that pub and a designer has to dress that pub and I need a cinematographer and a director.\n\"Whereas with the novel, I describe the pub \u2013 we're there as you read it.

        "article_text": "We have all heard of carmaker Ford, but what about its one-time rivals Abbot-Detroit, Acme, Adams and Aerocar?\nNo? Well that is hardly surprising because unlike Ford they all went bust very early on. And they are just some of the failed car companies starting with the letter \"A\".\nWe only remember the winners who went on to dominate the world's motor industry, and the current high-tech sector is much the same.\nA great many investors backed the wrong horseless carriages around a century ago and lost their money. Only a few picked Ford or Chrysler, which is almost exactly what is happening now, only to the tech sector.\nTech shares have been hugely volatile over the past year, as has been widely reported, with share price graphs often looking like rollercoaster rides, even before President Trump's tariffs have caused wider stocks falls.\nA principle reason for this tech sector volatility, according to Elroy Dimson, professor of finance at the University of Cambridge, is that like the once nascent car industry we don't know which tech firms will win in the long run.\n\"If you go back to the beginning of the last century there were an awful lot of motor companies, and it was clear that automobiles were going to make a huge difference,\" says Prof Dimson. \"But almost every company went bankrupt, you didn't know which company you should be buying.\"\nThen, of course, not all high-tech businesses are making money. The measure of the return on an investment in shares uses two factors, the growth in profits or dividends, and the growth in the value of the shares.\nBoring companies might pay reliable dividends and see their shares gradually increase in value. But many high-tech companies are not paying out much if anything in dividends. Instead, they are investing in future growth, and so their share prices fluctuate based on hopes of future profits.\nAs Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at UK financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, puts it: \"Tech shares are more volatile, they have high valuations and their price-earnings ratios are very high, and growth stocks are more sensitive to interest rate movements.\"\nBut also, investors in such shares are, as Ms Streeter puts it, gambling on \"not jam today but jam tomorrow\". They are all trying to pick the next future big winner, not the one paying out profits now, but the one that will eventually pay huge dividends sometime in the future.\nSo, any news or even suggestion that future growth is not going to be as good as previously expected means share values can collapse.\nOn the other hand, any good news boosts share prices even if current profits, or even losses, don't change at all, as investors pile into what they think is the future winner. The shares are more volatile because they are not underwritten by current profits or dividends.\nThat means as Prof Dimson puts it, \"that small changes in growth expectation can lead to large changes in share value\", which can effect a large number of companies at the same time.\n\"You have companies that are reasonably similar, so when growth rates change it is effecting quite a few companies in a similar way,\" he says.\n\"This is not different from the dotcom boom at the beginning of the 2000s. There were companies with huge growth prospects. And when the growth prospects disappeared, these were the companies that disappeared.\"\nAlso, even today there are not that many really large high-tech companies. In America they are colloquially known as the \"magnificent seven\" - Nvidia, a chipmaker, Alphabet, which owns Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, the parent of Facebook, and Tesla.\nSo, it does not take much to spook the market, especially since several of these firms are really quite young, and are dominant in sectors where previous leaders have crashed and burned. Anyone remember Ericsson, Boo or Compaq?\nTechnology, unlike say steel production or food manufacturing, is changing at a very rapid rate, and there is obviously the chance that a new high-tech company will come along and destroy the business model of its most established rivals.\nThere is simply no guarantee that today's \"magnificent seven\" will remain magnificent or even stay as the same seven firms.\nTake Tesla for example, its sales have recently fallen in response to two widely-reported factors. Firstly, some potential customers are opposed to Tesla owner Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's government. And secondly, Chinese electric car firms such as BYD are increasingly strong competitors.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia saw its share price drop sharply at the start of this year following the release of Chinese artificial intelligence chatbot DeepSeek.  This app was reportedly created at a fraction of the cost of its rivals.\nThe instant popularity of DeepSeek has raised questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning. This concerns Nvidia because it is at the forefront of making microchips for AI processing.\nAI is now the biggest tech game in town, and it seems that absolutely everyone is claiming that AI is transforming their industry, their products and their profits. They can't all be right.\nOr as Prof Dimon puts it: \"At least in 1910 you knew what automobiles did, but today with AI companies you have to rely on the wisdom of the crowd, and for AI companies that isn't good enough.\"\nAnd not all AI firms can win, adds Robert Whaley, professor of finance at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. \"AI is certainly contributing to tech volatility. The race is on.\"\nThat means that AI shares are sensitive to predictions. And any sign that a particular firm is lagging in the AI race may mean that lots of investors, most of whom don't understand the subject, abandon it for another that seems to be further ahead.\nThen there are investors who seemingly don't seem to care which companies' shares they buy, so long as they are in the \"booming\" high-tech sector, as they are speculating and spreading their risks.\nIn short, share prices are not always a rational measure of a firm's value, especially in the high-tech sector, or even of its prospects. Instead, they can represent the optimism of investors. And optimism does not always last.\nIt is often short-lived, passing, and faddish. And sometimes optimism comes face to face with reality or just plain fades away. It is, in short, volatile.",

        "article_text": "On 3 May Australians will head to the polls to vote in their first federal election since 2022. \nThe results will determine who the next prime minister will be, as well as the make-up of the nation's parliament.\nAustralia famously has a unique electoral system - and some quirky polling day traditions. Voting is mandatory for all citizens over 18, the country uses preferential voting, and picking up a \"democracy sausage\" is a polling day custom.\nAlmost 18 million people are registered to vote in this election - roughly 98% of those who are eligible. \nUnlike the First Past the Post system - used in the UK and most US states - which elects candidates based on who has received the greatest number of votes in a single count, regardless of whether they've secured an absolute majority - voters in Australia rank candidates in order of preference. \nIf no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote in the first tally, the votes from the least popular candidates are then redistributed, and that process repeated until someone secures a majority.\nIn races for the House of Representatives, voters are required to mark a preference down for every single candidate listed on the ballot. \nHowever, in Senate races, voters only need to mark down a designated number of preferences. \nIt is the leader of the party that receives the most seats in the House who then becomes prime minister. There is no separate leadership ballot. \nAll of the seats in Australia's House of Representatives - that's 150 in this election -will be up for grabs, as will 40 of the 76 seats in the Senate. \nAustralia has two major parties: the left-leaning Australian Labor Party and the conservative Liberal-National coalition. \nOne party needs to win at least 76 seats in the House to form a majority government.\nIf it cannot do that, it must try to win support from minor parties or independent MPs. \nIn both state and federal elections, the vote share for minor parties and independents has been steadily increasing in Australia for decades. \nThat reached record levels in the 2022 federal election, with one in three Australians casting votes for candidates outside the two major parties.\nLabor formed a majority government after winning the 2022 election, which delivered the biggest loss for the Liberal Party since its inception. \nAs it stands, Labor has 78 seats in the House of Representatives, while the coalition has 57, with minor parties and independents splitting the remainder.\nBut with one House seat abolished, if Labor loses just two seats at this election it will be stripped of its majority in parliament.\nIn order to form a government in its own right, the coalition needs to win 19 seats, likely including many of those it lost to independent candidates during the 2022 vote. \nAnthony Albanese has been the prime minister since the last election, and a stalwart of parliament for almost 30 years.\nWhile he enjoyed a period of broad popularity after coming to power in 2022, he has in recent times come under pressure over his handling of divisive topics like housing, Indigenous affairs and both antisemitism and Islamophobia.\nAlbanese is being challenged by Peter Dutton, who became head of the Liberal-National coalition after their 2022 defeat. He is contesting his first election as opposition leader. \nKnown as a staunch conservative, Dutton has years of experience in important ministerial portfolios - like defence and home affairs - but has been a controversial figure at times, particularly on social issues.\nBoth the polling and the political messaging around this year's election indicate that cost of living is the biggest concern for many voters. \nSince the 2022 election, inflation - which is now slowing - has pushed up the prices of everyday essentials such as food and utilities, leaving many households feeling stretched. \nThe Albanese government has implemented a string of policies that it says are aimed at providing relief, such as keeping the cost of medications down, and offering tax cuts, energy rebates and rental assistance to those eligible.  \nHowever, Australia has raised interest rates 12 times since Albanese was elected in May 2022 - something that is done independently of government but seen to reflect their economic management - and that has put additional pressure on borrowers and those with mortgages across the country.\nHousing affordability will also be a key issue this election cycle, with several Australian cities among the most expensive in the world for homebuyers.\nHistorically, Australians are used to getting a result and knowing who will form government on election night. \nHowever, it is usually not the Australian Election Commission - the official body tasked with manually counting the votes - that declares this. \nInstead, the AEC provides what's known as an \"indicative count\" throughout the day, which media commentators, election experts and sometimes even the parties and candidates themselves then base their calls on.\nThe AEC does not formally declare a seat until it is confident the result will not change based on the number of uncounted votes, which can sometimes take days.

        "article_text": "For the past 48 hours, top White House officials have faced questions from lawmakers and the press about how a journalist came to join a sensitive group chat for an upcoming military operation - and why President Donald Trump's national security team was sharing sensitive information in an unsecure manner.\nThe Atlantic first reported details of the group chat on the platform Signal after its editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was added to it. He followed the thread as top Trump administration officials discussed upcoming military strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.\nA National Security Council spokesman later confirmed that the portions of the chat that Mr Goldberg initially shared \"appears to be authentic\".\nThe Atlantic then on Wednesday published the entire text thread that showed the detailed and potentially classified rundown for a March strike on Yemen after Mr Goldberg and the publication faced pushback from the Trump administration. \nWhile the thread appears to have contained sensitive information, there is still much that remains unknown. Here are six lingering questions regarding so-called \"Signal-gate\".\nThe Trump administration maintains the information shared in the chat was not classified.\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told lawmakers during a congressional hearing that the Signal chat was \"candid and sensitive\" but \"no classified information was shared\".\nBut under questioning, she and CIA Director John Ratcliffe appeared uncertain about the classification of the attack plan. They later emphasised that Hegseth had the power to classify and declassify the type of details that were shared. \nHegseth has denied sharing classified material, but experts are sceptical that this type of sensitive information would not carry that kind of designation.\n\"The idea this wasn't classified information at the time is inconceivable,\" Glenn Gerstell, former general counsel of the National Security Agency, told the BBC. \"I don't know if they declassified it afterwards but any imminent military action involving American troops would have been classified at the time.\"\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that \"no war plans\" were discussed on the chat. Instead, she characterised the information shared as  \"sensitive policy discussions\".\nJamil Jaffer, executive director of the National Security Institute at George Mason University, said that Hegseth did not send \"an operational plan for World War Three, or for the Pacific region\".\n\"But at the same time,\" Mr Jaffer said, \"these are operational details that could, if released publicly, put American lives at risk or jeopardise the success of the operation.\"\nIn his original article, Mr Goldberg reports that on 11 March he initially \"received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz\", Trump's national security adviser.\nTwo days later, he writes that he received a notice that he was to be included in a Signal group titled the \"Houthi PC small group.\"\nMr Goldberg reports that the group received a message from Waltz, which also noted one of his deputies was \"pulling together\" a team of top staffers relevant to the discussion. \nOn Tuesday, Trump suggested that a \"lower level\" staffer for Waltz added Mr Goldberg to the chat.\nHowever, Waltz himself told Fox News' Laura Ingraham: \"I take full responsibility. I built the - I built the group.\"\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who was also in the group, said on Wednesday that someone had made a \"mistake\" in adding Mr Goldberg.\nIt remains to be seen whether Congress will launch oversight investigations, which it has the power to pursue.\nTrump is a Republican, and both chambers of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate - are controlled by his party.\nThat means committees who have oversight of the executive branch, military, and intelligence community are run by Republicans.\nRepublican lawmakers have emphatically supported the Trump administration's agenda to this point, so it seems improbable that they would support investigations into the Signal chat.\nDemocrats in the House are reportedly trying to force a vote on a \"Resolution of Inquiry\" that would require the Trump administration to hand over records related to the incident, according to Reuters, but they do not have a majority. \nWhile some Republicans have raised concerns over the leak, few have appeared eager to cross the president. \nDemocratic lawmakers are calling for resignations, but at the moment, none of the officials involved in the Signal chat have stepped down.\nHegseth and Waltz have faced the most calls to resign, and some cabinet officials have said that their process will go under review. \n\"I think there'll be reforms and changes made,\" Rubio told reporters on Wednesday.\nStill, it is unclear if the president will ask any members of his team to step down. So far, the White House has launched a full-court defence of the Signal chat and the officials who participated.\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office that Waltz \"took responsibility\", but has previously maintained that he has not lost confidence in his national security adviser.\nHegseth also appears safe from Trump's ire for now.\n\"Hegseth is doing a great job. He had nothing to do with this,\" the president said. \nThe use of Signal to discuss the Houthi strikes posed broader questions about how Trump's top staffers are sharing and discussing sensitive information.\nGabbard testified on Wednesday that Signal came \"pre-installed on government devices\".\nShe cited guidance from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which mentioned Signal as an example of a messaging service with end-to-end encryption.\nRatcliffe earlier testified to Congress that Signal had been installed on his devices when he took over the CIA.\nBut it remains uncertain if security officials had provided guidance about using Signal for discussing military operations like the strikes against the Houthis.\n\"Whether these circumstances were approved or not is still not clear,\" Mr Jaffer said.\nCBS News, the BBC's US partner, has reported, however, that the US National Security Agency had warned employees against using Signal due to \"a vulnerability\" that they had identified.\n\"The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" warned the NSA bulletin that was shared a month before the Houthi Strike chat. \nThe group chat appears to suggest that the officials' discussion was one that had continued from the White House Situation Room, one of the most secure venues in the US government. \nThis is unusual. Oftentimes further discussion or the inclusion of team members who cannot attend in person is done via secure rooms called sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIFs. \nTop-ranking national security officials have these SCIFs installed in their offices and homes to ensure the protection of sensitive information and discussions. \nThat can add a layer of complexity to planning and coordination, however, which may have led to lax security system standards. \n\"Whatever they have might not be effective enough,\" Mr Jaffer said. \"Or there's so many restrictions on it, that it forces senior officials into workarounds that themselves might create vulnerabilities.\"",

However the obvious thing was to write an anthem which the choir could sing\" he said.\nThe choral and orchestral composition Mr Cohen has created uses the poem Crossing The Bar by Alfred Tennyson - a metaphorical meditation on death. \nIt compares dying to gently crossing the sandbar between coast and the wider sea.\nMr Cohen wanted to incorporate some of the melody of the piece Flowers of the Forest, a Scottish folk tune and work of war poetry.\nFlowers of the Forest is already played on the bagpipes at the end of the annual Lancastria service - it was also played at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II.\nThe finished composition starts with the orchestra before it accompanies the choir singing Tennyson's words, with hints at the Flowers of the Forest tune throughout.\nThe choir rehearses in the chancel of St Katharine Cree, in the light of a beautiful blue and multicoloured stained glass window depicting the tragedy.\nIt was commissioned in the 1960s, and cost around \u00a3750 at the time (about \u00a315,000 today).\nChorister Debbie Sweet explained: \"The top half of the window shows the parable of Christ walking on the water and calming the storm, which obviously is very fitting.\"\nMs Sweet, a member of the choir since 1985, added: \"About two thirds of the way down there is the image of the Lancastria's upturned hull, with smoke coming from it and also a rescue boat rowing away with soldiers in it.\n\"The bottom third of the window was only put in in 2014, and that has the plaque indicating the date.\"\nChoir trustee Jo Staphnill admitted it was \"surprising\" so few people know about what happened to thousands of troops and civilians in this disaster.\n\"I can understand how, perhaps for operational reasons, it was deemed necessary at the time for reports not to happen right away, but it seems so tragic, not only that this happened, but also that is has been largely forgotten.\"\nFor many years survivors and their families came from all over the UK to the church each June, but as time has gone on, fewer people remain.\nMs Staphnill believes this new composition will pay tribute to them and ensure a lasting legacy.\n\"It's an honour to have something written in memory of this tragedy, and hopefully play a part in bringing some comfort to the families of the survivors and people who lost their lives, by sharing some really wonderful music.\"\nThe World Premiere of Lancastria by Jacques Cohen will be performed at St Giles' Cripplegate church on Thursday 27 March at 19:00 GMT as part of Lloyd's Choir spring concert.\nIt will be repeated at St Katharine Cree church in June, where the lives of those lost eight decades ago will be remembered and mourned.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "Brazil were beaten 4-1 by Argentina in their most recent World Cup qualifier\nIn any previous World Cup, there would be genuine fear about Brazil failing to qualify. Not this time.\nIn an expanded competition, with six South American teams making it through automatically, Brazil have a six-point cushion over a Venezuela team who have just registered their first victory in 10 games.\nWith four rounds to go, it is impossible to see Brazil not making the cut. But that is hardly the point.\nFor Brazil, World Cup qualification now serves one purpose - it provides a sequence of competitive matches during which they hope to build a side capable of winning the trophy. And with just over a year to go until 2026, that looks a long way off.\nIt is easy to forget how good Brazil were in the last World Cup, where they lost in the quarter-finals on penalties to a Croatia team whose only shot on goal in the match took a cruel deflection.\nThe Qatar 2022 Brazil side were solid - goalkeeper Alisson could have taken a deckchair out for most of the games - with flashes of brilliance. They could have won that competition. \nSo why have they fallen back so much? How can a team packed with so many good players form such a dismal unit?\nThe team that were thrashed 4-1 by Argentina on Tuesday appeared to have no midfield, and were unable either to attack or defend.\nDorival Junior is under pressure following the heavy defeat by Argentina\nTuesday's prolonged humiliation did not come out of the blue. \nIn game after game the team have looked disjointed, without clear strategies for progressing the ball down the field, and suffering from the possibility of being both outplayed and outnumbered in central midfield. \nIndividual talent has papered over the cracks - like on Thursday, when a stoppage-time Vinicius Jr special gave them a victory over Colombia their play had not really deserved. \nBut it can't happen all the time.\nAnd if the film is bad, especially if the cast is impressive, the director must be to blame. \nThere is a crisis in Brazilian coaching. It is hard to produce coaches when there is no time to train and no job security. That is the reality of domestic Brazilian football, and helps explain why almost all of the successful coaches in the country are now foreign - either Argentine or, especially, Portuguese.\nThe national boss - for now anyway - Dorival Jr is a product of the domestic game, with more than four decades' experience as player and coach. \nBut on the international stage he comes across as a decent man thoroughly out of his depth.\nDid he really think he could travel to Argentina and play two men in central midfield? Why not drop deep and create space for the counter-attack, as he did a year ago against England at Wembley? And when cool heads were required, his team came across as a bag of nerves, all too willing to get involved in cheap spats.\nOf the three duties of the coach - pick the team, determine the strategy and set the emotional tone - Dorival failed dismally, and it is very hard to see how he can keep his job.\nIf he is to be replaced, there would seem to be two options. One is to go foreign - the Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus would be a strong candidate. The other would be to fast-track former Chelsea left-back Filipe Luis - a man of great intelligence who has made an impressive start to his coaching career with Rio giants Flamengo.\nWhoever comes in - or Dorival if he manages to hang on - will have to deal with a simple observation - central midfield is not an optional extra.\nIt is an area where Brazil have had a problem for a while - a consequence of the 1990s trend of splitting the middle of the park into a pair of midfielders who only defend and a duo who mostly attack. It was at this point Brazilian play lost much of its former fluency, instead investing in rapid breaks down the flanks.\nIt is in this context that the problems of Lucas Paqueta are so significant. \nThe West Ham midfielder was on the verge of becoming a big-money Manchester City signing when scandal struck, and his career - now threatened - has not recovered.\nThe evidence of Dorival's first games in charge - a year ago away to England and Spain - was Paqueta had become the most important player in the team, the man capable of filling space in midfield, dictating the rhythm of the game and unleashing the pace of the likes of Vinicius Jr.\nRonaldo quits Brazil federation presidency race\nAlisson returns to Liverpool after 'suspected concussion'\nThe absence of Paqueta almost certainly led to Dorival building his hopes for these international dates around the return of Neymar - which, predictably, turned out to be ludicrously premature.\nAfter so long out injured, it was only to be expected that Neymar would run into muscular problems, and he will need much more time on the field to ease his way back to a level where he can tip the balance.\nAt 33, he is an unknown quantity. But there is a gaping hole in the team for the type of deep-lying playmaker role he could fill. \nRomantics might recall 2002, when Ronaldo looked all washed up only to make a triumphant return from injury and carry a Brazil side that almost failed to qualify all the way to World Cup title number five. \nThey are still waiting for number six. \nIf they can do it next year then, in the wake of Tuesday's humiliation, it will be a candidate for one of football's great comebacks.\nNeymar's absence from the Brazil team was prolonged by a muscular injury",

        "article_text": "Most modern structures are built to last 50 years or so, but ingenious ancient engineering has kept this watery city afloat for more than 1,600 years \u2013 using only wood.\nAs any local knows, Venice is an upside-down forest. The city, which turned 1604 years old on March 25, is built on the foundations of millions of short wooden piles, pounded in the ground with their tip facing downwards. These trees \u2013 larch, oak, alder, pine, spruce and elm of a length ranging between 3.5m (11.5ft) to less than 1m (3ft) \u00a0\u2013 have been holding up stone palazzos and tall belltowers for centuries, in a true marvel of engineering leveraging the forces of physics and nature.\nIn most modern structures, reinforced concrete and steel do the work that this inverted forest has been doing for centuries. But despite their strength, few foundations today could last as long as Venice's. \"Concrete or steel piles are designed [with a guarantee to last] 50 years today,\" says Alexander\u00a0Puzrin, professor of geomechanics and geosystems engineering at the ETH university in Zurich, Switzerland. \"Of course, they might last longer, but when we build houses and industrial structures, the standard is 50 years of life.\"\nBuilding to last\nOnly once, early on in his career, Puzrin has been asked to provide a guarantee of 500 years for a construction a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed temple in Israel.\n\"I was kind of shocked because this was unusual,\" he recalls. \"I was really scared, and they wanted me to sign. I called my boss in Tel Aviv, a very experienced, old engineer and I said, 'What are we going to do? They want 500 years.' He answered, '500 years? [pause]. Sign.' None of us is going to be there.\"\nThe Venetian piles technique is fascinating for its geometry, its centuries-old resilience, and for its sheer scale. No-one is exactly sure how many millions of piles there are under the city, but there are 14,000 tightly packed wooden poles in the foundations of the Rialto bridge\u00a0alone, and 10,000 oak trees under the San Marco Basilica, which was built in 832AD.\n\"I was born and raised in Venice,\" says Caterina Francesca Izzo, environmental chemistry and cultural heritage professor at the University of Venice. \"Growing up, like everyone else, I knew that underneath the Venetian buildings, there are the trees of Cadore [the mountain region next to Venice]. But I didn't know how these piles were placed, how they were counted and knocked down, nor the fact that the battipali\u00a0(literally the 'pile hitters') had a very important profession. They even had their own songs. It is fascinating from a technical and technological point of view.\"\u00a0\nThe battipali would hammer down the piles by hand, and they would sing an ancient\u00a0song\u00a0to keep the rhythm \u2013 a haunting and repetitive melody with lyrics that praise Venice, its republican glory, its Catholic faith, and declare death to the enemy of the time, the Turks. On a more lighthearted note, a Venetian expression still in use today, na testa da bater pai (literally 'a head that is good to pound down the piles') is a colourful way of saying that someone is dull or slow-witted.\nThe piles were stuck as deep as possible, until they couldn't be pounded down any further, starting at the outer edge of the structure and moving towards the centre of the foundations, usually driving nine piles per square metre in a spiral shape. The heads were then sawn to obtain a regular surface, which would lay below sea-level.\nTransverse wooden structures \u2013 either zatteroni (boards) or madieri (beams) \u2013 were placed on top. In the case of the bell towers, these beams or boards were up to 50cm (20in) thick. For other buildings, the dimensions were 20cm (8in) or even less. Oak provided the most resilient wood, but it was also the most precious. (Later on, oak would only be used to build ships \u2013 it was too valuable to stick in the mud.) On top of this wooden foundation, workers would place the stone of the building.\nThe Republic of Venice soon began protecting its forests to provide sufficient wood for construction, as well as for ships. \"Venice invented sylviculture,\" explains Nicola Macchioni, research director at the institute for bioeconomy at Italy's National Council for Research, referring to the practice of cultivating trees. \"The first official sylviculture document in Italy is indeed from the Magnificent Community of the Fiemme Valley [to the north-west of Venice], dating from 1111AD. It details rules to exploit the woods without depleting them.\"\nAccording to Macchioni, these conservation practices must have been in use years before they were written down. \"That explains why the Fiemme Valley is still covered by a lush fir forest today.\" Countries such as England, however, were facing wood shortages by the middle of the 16th Century already, he adds.\nVenice is not the only city relying on wooden piles for foundations \u2013 but there are key differences that make it unique. Amsterdam is another city partially built on wooden piles \u2013 here and in many other northern European cities, they go all the way down until they reach the bedrock, and they work like long columns, or like the legs of a table.\n\"Which is fine if the rock is close to the surface,\" says Thomas Leslie, professor of architecture at the University of Illinois. But in many regions, the bedrock is well beyond the reach of a pile. On the shore of Lake Michigan in the US, where Leslie is based, the bedrock could be 100ft (30m) below the surface. \"Finding trees that big is difficult, right? There were stories of Chicago in the 1880s where they tried to drive one tree trunk on top of another, which, as you can imagine ended up not working. Finally, they realised that you could rely on the friction of the soil.\"\nThe principle is based on the idea of reinforcing the soil, by sticking in as many piles as possible, raising substantial friction between piles and soil. \"What's clever about that,\" says Leslie, \"is that you're sort of using the physics\u2026 The beauty of it is that you're using the fluid nature of the soil to provide resistance to hold the buildings up.\" The technical term for this is hydrostatic pressure, which essentially means that the soil \"grips\" the piles if many are inserted densely in one spot, Leslie says.\nIndeed, the Venetian piles work this way \u2013 they are too short to reach bedrock, and instead keep the buildings up thanks to friction. But the history of this way of building goes back further still.\nThe technique was mentioned by 1st-Century Roman engineer and architect Vitruvius; Romans would use submerged piles to build bridges, which again are close to water. Water gates in China were built with friction piles too. The Aztecs used them in Mexico City, until the Spanish came, tore down the ancient city and built their Catholic cathedral on top, Puzrin notes. \"The Aztecs knew how to build in their environment much better than the Spanish later, who have now huge problems with this metropolitan cathedral [where the floor is sinking unevenly].\"\nPuzrin holds a graduate class at ETH that investigates famous geotechnical failures. \"And this is one of these failures. This Mexico City cathedral, and Mexico City in general, is an open-air museum of everything that can go wrong with your foundations.\"\nAfter more than a millennium and a half in the water, Venice's foundations have proved remarkably resilient. They are not, however, immune to damage.\u00a0\nTen years ago, a team from the universities of Padova and Venice (departments ranging from forestry to engineering and cultural heritage) investigated the condition of the city's foundations, starting from the belltower of the Frari Church, built in 1440 on alder piles.\nThe Frari belltower has been sinking 1mm (0.04in) a year since its construction, for a total of 60cm (about 24in). Compared with churches and buildings, belltowers have more weight distributed on a smaller surface and therefore sink deeper and faster, \"like a stiletto heel\", says Macchioni, who was part of the team investigating the city\u2019s foundations.\nCaterina Francesca Izzo was working on the field, core drilling, collecting and analyzing wood samples from underneath churches, belltowers and from the side of the canals, which were being emptied out and cleaned up at the time. She said that they had to be careful while they were working on the bottom of the dry canal, to avoid the wastewater sporadically gushing from the side pipes.\nThe team found that throughout the structures they investigated, the wood was damaged (bad news), but the system of water, mud and wood was keeping it all together (good news).\nThey debunked the common belief that the wood underneath the city doesn't rot because it's in an oxygen-free, or anaerobic, condition \u2013 bacteria do attack wood, even in absence of oxygen. But bacteria action is much slower than the action of fungi and insects, which operate in the presence of oxygen. Furthermore, water fills up the cells that are emptied out by bacteria, allowing wooden piles to maintain their shape. So even if the wooden piles are damaged, the whole system of wood, water and mud is held together under intense pressure, and is kept resilient for centuries.\n\"Is there anything to worry about? Yes and no, but we should still consider continuing this type of research,\" says Izzo. Since the sampling 10 years ago, they hadn't collected new ones, mainly because of the logistics involved.\nIt's not known for how many more hundreds of years the foundations will last, says Macchioni. \"However, [it will last] as long as the environment remains the same. The foundation system works because it is made of wood, soil and water.\" The soil creates an oxygen-free environment, the water both contributes to that and maintains the shape of the cells, and the wood provides friction. Without one of these three elements, the system collapses.\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, wood was completely replaced by cement in foundation construction. In recent years, though, a new trend of building with wood has gained increased interest, including the rise of wooden skyscrapers. \"It's kind of the cool material right now, and for really good reasons,\" comments Leslie. Wood is a carbon sink, it's biodegradable and thanks to its ductility, it's considered among the most earthquake-resistant materials.\n\"We can't of course build entire cities on wood nowadays because we are too many on the planet,\" adds Macchioni, but it's undeniable that without artificial materials and without motors, ancient builders just had to be more ingenious. Venice is not the only city with wooden foundations, but it is \"the only one [where the friction technique was used] en masse that is still surviving today and is so insanely beautiful\", adds Puzrin. \"There were people out there who didn't study soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering, and yet they produced something we can only dream about producing, which lasted so long. They were amazing, intuitive engineers who did exactly the right thing, taking advantage of all these special conditions.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.",

We were all taken aback but I didn't understand that I was apparently the culprit.\nI got in the car but didn't really understand the extent of it until I got to the arena and online there was a photo of Sandy, who was stripped down with red paint on her. ESPN came in to see me and apparently I'm being blamed for the attack.\nEveryone who knows me, knows that would be out of character for me - it's not my style. I expected her to try to blame me. I was her rival all week but there were also other things going on. \nSandy has already said flyers attacking her were put up around the hotel and city.\nYou can't just point a finger when there is no evidence leading back to me. I was upstairs waiting to walk down for the fight of my life. \nI didn't know what time she was going to be down there or that she was going first. The only people who knew were her team - maybe she should look inside her own circle.\nThe incident took me by surprise but I was in fight mode and it didn't happen to me, so I wasn't flustered.\nIf someone had thrown paint on me I would have slapped paint on the ass of my fight shorts and got on with it.\nI was concerned that she was going to pull out - her team were really getting her going about it.\nThere was a clip of her coach Kay Koroma in the locker room screaming at her to pull out of the fight which I thought was super suspicious. That was weird to me and out of character for him. \nI really don't think it was the paint that threw her off her game but her team, who made it a bigger deal than it had to be.\nObviously I don't want that to happen and I hope it doesn't happen going into this fight. It could have been called off and, after two years of busting my butt to get back in that position, that was the last thing I wanted.\nAs for 'paint-gate' being used to promote the rematch, I was surprised the Top Rank team used the paint on the promotion posters - but this is entertainment. \nI didn't have any say in it. If I had done anything like that, my manager would have had my neck as he tries to keep me professional.\nI didn't know about it until the poster came out and I said, 'do they have red paint on Sandy?'\nI was just as taken aback as anyone else, but it's kind of funny.\nMayer (right) beat Ryan (left) by majority decision with one judge scoring it a draw\nIt's important for women's boxing to have these rivalries and this is definitely up there as one of the top ones.\nI never counted out the rematch and just wanted to see what my other options were. Once I saw the views and how much the fans wanted it - and the excuses - I thought let's do it again and I'll do it even better.\nI didn't get my rematch with Alycia Baumgardner so I understand Sandy might have been frustrated, but I didn't have to give her this rematch. I could have just sat it out, waited for Lauren Price to unify and fought for undisputed or faced someone else. \nThat's not the fighter I am though.\nI pride myself on the fact a lot of the fights I have been in are competitive and people aren't sure who will win. \nMy feud with Alycia will stay number one for a lifetime, but Sandy can come second because of the coaching team situation and the paint situation.\nSandy and her team have tried to gaslight me in a sense where I'm supposed to be making all of this up or I'm being dramatic, but it happened.\nYou're going to see coach Koroma, my coach of eight or nine years since the Olympics, in her corner so they really can't say anything about it. They did what they did and they have to stand by that. \nI'm just protecting myself and I'm the one who had to go out and find a whole new team at this stage of my career which is not easy.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nMeet the man who convinced Nike to take a gamble on Michael Jordan\nThere were 15 seconds left on the clock when a 19-year-old college basketball player launched a 16-foot winning shot that would change sports marketing forever.  \nWatching that day was marketing executive and grassroots promoter Sonny Vaccaro. He was so impressed by what he saw that two years later he would bet his job at sports manufacturer Nike on backing this relatively untested player.\nThat player was Michael Jordan.\nBut not the Jordan we know now. At the point Vaccaro witnessed him score the shot that won the 1982 NCAA championship for North Carolina Tar Heels, Jordan was                 just a freshman.\nWhen, two years later, Vaccaro urged his bosses to spend their whole yearly basketball endorsement budget on him, Jordan was only 21 and had never competed in the NBA. And no-one was talking about his footwear.\nVaccaro says his conviction in the youngster's potential was forged the moment he watched him take that shot at the Louisiana Superdome, New Orleans.\n\"That shot changed the world because of what Michael Jordan became,\" the 85-year-old told BBC Sport. \n\"When he took the shot, it convinced me that he would take any shot in the world.\"\nBut it was Vaccaro who had to take a shot first. \nIn his memoir, Legends and Soles, he describes how he had to convince his bosses to take a chance on an up-and-coming star, while competitors such as Converse were endorsing household names including Earvin 'Magic' Johnson.\nBy that time, Vaccaro had established himself as a basketball insider with an extensive knowledge of young players. In 1964, aged 24, he established The Dapper Dan Roundball Classic - the first national high school all-star basketball game.\nThe tournament ran under different guises until 2007, showcasing future NBA stars including Moses Malone, LeBron James, Kevin Garnett, Kevin Love, Kobe Bryant, Patrick Ewing and Shaquille O'Neal.\nHe also founded the ABCD basketball summer camp in 1984 - an invitational that gathered the country's highest-ranked high school players.\nNevertheless, Vaccaro told BBC Sport former Nike boss Phil Knight was not satisfied with the Jordan proposal \"until the last minute\".\nTheir gamble turned the company's fortunes around, transformed the way basketball was viewed globally and left an indelible print on sneaker culture worldwide. The story was popularised in 2023 film Air, in which Vaccaro is played by Matt Damon.\nIn his book, as well as detailing the Jordan deal, he describes how he was able to spot the potential in future stars including Bryant, Tracy McGrady and James, whom he narrowly missed out on signing to an endorsement in 2003.\nNike's offer to Jordan in 1984 included a guaranteed $250,000 a year for five years, plus a stake in his own line of merchandise. It would make the 21-year-old, who was the third pick in the NBA draft that year, one of the richest athletes in the world.\nAfter signing that deal, Jordan went on to become arguably the greatest NBA player of all time, winning six championships, six Finals MVPs, five regular-season MVPs and a record 10 scoring titles.\nHis partnership with Nike also catapulted the franchise from a company that mainly dealt in running shoes into a global behemoth worth just under $30bn, external (\u00a323bn), with a monopoly over the NBA.\n\"My personal opinion is that if there is no Michael Jordan, you wouldn't even be talking about a Nike shoe company,\" Vaccaro said. \n\"That's the one deal that changed America's view of basketball players and endorsements. He was magnetic.\n\"Other people had endorsements with companies and they'd hold up a shoe and say: 'Wear this, I wear this.' Michael didn't have to hold up the shoe. He took the shot and then wore the shoe.\"\nThe Air Jordan shoe, designed by Peter Moore, first retailed in 1985.

For the next decade, he battled with his former employer for the signatures of the nation's hottest up-and-coming NBA stars.\nOne of the coups Vaccaro managed during his time with the German sportswear company was to sign 18-year-old Bryant to a $5m, five-year deal in 1996, a month before he entered the NBA straight from high school.\nThe marketer first encountered the future five-time NBA champion when he was invited to play at one of Vaccaro's ABCD camps in 1994.\n\"It took Kobe all of a week to blast to the top of my 'gifted' list,\" he writes. \"Competing against the top 160 American players, along with a handful of prospects from places like China, France, Australia, Canada and Russia, Kobe was intimidated by no-one.\"\nWhat left a lasting impression on Vaccaro was the fact Bryant approached him at the end of the week to apologise for not having won the MVP award, despite only being 16.\n\"I knew that this kid had that hidden thing - drive, an ambition and a belief in himself,\" he told BBC Sport. \"He was the most confident, outward person I've ever been around in my life.\"\nBryant returned to Vaccaro's summer camp the following year and won the MVP award.\nIn 1997, Vaccaro signed McGrady, just as he was about to enter the NBA draft from high school as the ninth overall pick by the Toronto Raptors.\nMcGrady, who would go on to become a seven-time NBA All-Star, had made an impression on the sports marketer at the 1996 ABCD camp. However, he almost was not included after his school coach kicked him off the team and advised Vaccaro not to deal with the youngster.\n\"We invited Tracy because of all the backlash,\" Vaccaro said. \"Those five days at camp changed the whole world. He was voted the number one player in camp. No-one knew his name!\"\nThe story of Vaccaro's life seems to hinge on a number of these serendipitous moments.\n\"What if those people in Pittsburgh were to say no to me and the Dapper Dan in 1964?\" he said. \"One no and this life is over. You'd be looking for someone else to interview.\"",

        "article_text": "Brazil were beaten 4-1 by Argentina in their most recent World Cup qualifier\nIn any previous World Cup, there would be genuine fear about Brazil failing to qualify. Not this time.\nIn an expanded competition, with six South American teams making it through automatically, Brazil have a six-point cushion over a Venezuela team who have just registered their first victory in 10 games.\nWith four rounds to go, it is impossible to see Brazil not making the cut. But that is hardly the point.\nFor Brazil, World Cup qualification now serves one purpose - it provides a sequence of competitive matches during which they hope to build a side capable of winning the trophy. And with just over a year to go until 2026, that looks a long way off.\nIt is easy to forget how good Brazil were in the last World Cup, where they lost in the quarter-finals on penalties to a Croatia team whose only shot on goal in the match took a cruel deflection.\nThe Qatar 2022 Brazil side were solid - goalkeeper Alisson could have taken a deckchair out for most of the games - with flashes of brilliance. They could have won that competition. \nSo why have they fallen back so much? How can a team packed with so many good players form such a dismal unit?\nThe team that were thrashed 4-1 by Argentina on Tuesday appeared to have no midfield, and were unable either to attack or defend.\nDorival Junior is under pressure following the heavy defeat by Argentina\nTuesday's prolonged humiliation did not come out of the blue. \nIn game after game the team have looked disjointed, without clear strategies for progressing the ball down the field, and suffering from the possibility of being both outplayed and outnumbered in central midfield. \nIndividual talent has papered over the cracks - like on Thursday, when a stoppage-time Vinicius Jr special gave them a victory over Colombia their play had not really deserved. \nBut it can't happen all the time.\nAnd if the film is bad, especially if the cast is impressive, the director must be to blame. \nThere is a crisis in Brazilian coaching. It is hard to produce coaches when there is no time to train and no job security. That is the reality of domestic Brazilian football, and helps explain why almost all of the successful coaches in the country are now foreign - either Argentine or, especially, Portuguese.\nThe national boss - for now anyway - Dorival Jr is a product of the domestic game, with more than four decades' experience as player and coach. \nBut on the international stage he comes across as a decent man thoroughly out of his depth.\nDid he really think he could travel to Argentina and play two men in central midfield? Why not drop deep and create space for the counter-attack, as he did a year ago against England at Wembley? And when cool heads were required, his team came across as a bag of nerves, all too willing to get involved in cheap spats.\nOf the three duties of the coach - pick the team, determine the strategy and set the emotional tone - Dorival failed dismally, and it is very hard to see how he can keep his job.\nIf he is to be replaced, there would seem to be two options. One is to go foreign - the Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus would be a strong candidate. The other would be to fast-track former Chelsea left-back Filipe Luis - a man of great intelligence who has made an impressive start to his coaching career with Rio giants Flamengo.\nWhoever comes in - or Dorival if he manages to hang on - will have to deal with a simple observation - central midfield is not an optional extra.\nIt is an area where Brazil have had a problem for a while - a consequence of the 1990s trend of splitting the middle of the park into a pair of midfielders who only defend and a duo who mostly attack. It was at this point Brazilian play lost much of its former fluency, instead investing in rapid breaks down the flanks.\nIt is in this context that the problems of Lucas Paqueta are so significant. \nThe West Ham midfielder was on the verge of becoming a big-money Manchester City signing when scandal struck, and his career - now threatened - has not recovered.\nThe evidence of Dorival's first games in charge - a year ago away to England and Spain - was Paqueta had become the most important player in the team, the man capable of filling space in midfield, dictating the rhythm of the game and unleashing the pace of the likes of Vinicius Jr.\nRonaldo quits Brazil federation presidency race\nAlisson returns to Liverpool after 'suspected concussion'\nThe absence of Paqueta almost certainly led to Dorival building his hopes for these international dates around the return of Neymar - which, predictably, turned out to be ludicrously premature.\nAfter so long out injured, it was only to be expected that Neymar would run into muscular problems, and he will need much more time on the field to ease his way back to a level where he can tip the balance.\nAt 33, he is an unknown quantity. But there is a gaping hole in the team for the type of deep-lying playmaker role he could fill. \nRomantics might recall 2002, when Ronaldo looked all washed up only to make a triumphant return from injury and carry a Brazil side that almost failed to qualify all the way to World Cup title number five. \nThey are still waiting for number six. \nIf they can do it next year then, in the wake of Tuesday's humiliation, it will be a candidate for one of football's great comebacks.\nNeymar's absence from the Brazil team was prolonged by a muscular injury",

        "article_text": "Emma Raducanu will move back into the world's top 50 following her Miami Open run\nEmma Raducanu is starting to play like it is 2021.\nThe Briton, who won 10 matches in straight sets to clinch the US Open title, had not been able to win more than three in a row until this week\u2019s Miami Open.\nHer run was ended by world number four Jessica Pegula in the quarter-finals, but on Monday Raducanu will return to the world\u2019s top 50 for the first time since September 2022.\nSuccess has come despite a constantly changing sea of faces in the coaching box and a typically challenging start to the year.\nThe 22-year-old has not had a full-time coach since January, but played with great freedom in Miami.\nSo what kind of support might Raducanu need to be able to produce form like this on a more consistent basis?\nAfter the early promise of two Australian Open wins against higher-ranked opponents, Raducanu lost heavily to Iga Swiatek in January before coach Nick Cavaday informed her his health would prevent him from continuing.\nFebruary's spell in the Middle East ended in distressing fashion, as a man who had been following Raducanu around the circuit was evicted from her second-round match and given a restraining order.\nRaducanu appeared rudderless for much of that period, although she was rarely short of support. Her strength and conditioning coach Yutaka Nakamura has barely left her side since starting in early December.\nRoman Kelecic, a coach from her teenage days, helped out in Abu Dhabi. Jane O'Donoghue, a friend and former LTA coach, was in Doha and Dubai. Tom Welsh was drafted in from the Loughborough Academy as a short-term hire for Indian Wells, only for Vladimir Platenik to usurp him by arriving in California for a hastily arranged trial.\nAfter only two weeks that trial was ended by Raducanu on the eve of her first-round victory in Miami - and a seat offered once again to O\u2019Donoghue and the broadcaster and coach Mark Petchey.\nHow 'free spirit' Raducanu is thriving without coach\nSecond Serve: Your new weekly tennis briefing\nPetchey coached an 18-year-old Andy Murray for 10 months - during which he won his first ATP title - and trained with Raducanu during the pandemic summer of 2020.\nThose weeks at the National Tennis Centre in London appear to have left quite an impression on Raducanu. There is a mutual respect and rapport between the two.\nO'Donoghue has been a regular confidante for Raducanu, and was the LTA\u2019s national women\u2019s coach until 2019, when she left the sport for pastures new.\nRaducanu trusts them and is able to relax in their company, but they both have day jobs.\nPetchey is in broadcasting - most notably with the Tennis Channel - and O\u2019Donoghue in finance. She is currently on a sabbatical, but there is no suggestion she wants to return to the far less secure world of tennis coaching on a permanent basis.\nBoth could offer input but, as things stand, not the type of support Raducanu said she was seeking when speaking to the BBC at Indian Wells.\n\"Once I have a structure in place and I can fall back on the process again I will feel very set,\" she said this month.\n\"In the Middle East it was very difficult for me because I didn't really have any direction or structure or which tournaments to play and it was very difficult doing it all on my own.\n\"I'm that kind of person who needs a plan and needs preparation. That's what I'm building and that's making me feel more comfortable.\"\nJane O'Donoghue (left) was with Emma Raducanu in Miami\nRaducanu is part of the Great Britain team which will compete in the Billie Jean King Cup qualifying round in early April, and will be able to spend the next two weeks working with the LTA coaching team.\nBut she will need a more lasting plan swiftly.\nHer clay-court season could take in Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome before thre French Open, and there will be very little respite in the schedule before the end of October.\nThat plan does not need to revolve around one person.\nMany top players employ more than one coach, usually because it is very hard for any one individual to commit to more than 30 weeks on the road each year.\nJack Draper ended last summer\u2019s partnership with Wayne Ferreira as he preferred the \"one voice\" of James Trotman, but now travels to some events with Alex Ward.\nPerhaps things could have worked out differently with Cavaday if an additional coach had been brought into the team when his health problems first arose in the spring of 2024.\nExposure to different personalities and ways of thinking has always been appealing to Raducanu, but the period with Cavaday offered her stability and calmness.\nThey liked each other, having first established a coaching partnership when Raducanu was a girl. Cavaday was a good sounding board, and there was evidence from her play last spring and summer that the two could flourish in future.\nOther partnerships fizzled out much more quickly.\nPlatenik lasted only two weeks. His coaching acumen is widely admired, but his personality did not seem a good match for Raducanu.\nOne former player compared him to a \"freight train\", saying he was intense and opinionated. Platenik says Raducanu told him she was feeling \u201cstressed\u201d when ending the brief collaboration.\nTorben Beltz looked an excellent choice, given his Grand Slam success with Angelique Kerber, but Raducanu did not feel he had enough to offer.\nDmitry Tursunov ended their partnership because he thought Raducanu needed to listen to just \"one voice\". He referred to \"red flags\" and a feeling there may be further problems down the line.\nHer spell with Sebastian Sachs concluded after operations on both hands and left ankle, which kept her on the sidelines for the second half of 2023.\nThere did not seem much logic in dispensing of the services of Nigel Sears after Wimbledon 2021, but it is hard to argue with the choice of Andrew Richardson, who then steered her to that historic triumph at the US Open.\nHowever, that partnership ended there.\nWould Raducanu go back to a coach she has previously let go? Sears still looks a good bet and has a proven track record of success with Daniela Hantuchova, Ana Ivanovic and Anett Kontaveit.\nHe is no longer working with the Australian Olivia Gadecki, and is a regular at the National Tennis Centre in London, where he works with the LTA's women's team.\nFor all her progress in Miami, Raducanu may have a difficult spring and summer without the right personnel around her.\nDoes she ever throws a covetous glance at Draper's set-up?\nHis team looks a thoroughly professional outfit, and some hard decisions have recently been made.\nPhysio Will Herbert and strength and conditioning coach Steve Kotze are no longer involved. They have been replaced by Shane Annun and Matt Little, who were so integral to Andy Murray's team.\nAnd Trotman remains as head coach.

        "summary": "'Raducanu needs plan quickly to build on Miami progress'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Emma Raducanu will move back into the world's top 50 following her Miami Open runRussell FullerTennis correspondentPublished1 hour agoEmma Raducanu is starting to play like it is 2021.The Briton, who won 10 matches in straight sets to clinch the US Open title, had not been able to win more than three in a row until this week\u2019s Miami Open.Her run was ended by world number four Jessica Pegula in the quarter-finals, but on Monday Raducanu will return to the world\u2019s top 50 for the first time since September 2022.Success has come despite a constantly changing sea of faces in the coaching box and a typically challenging start to the year.The 22-year-old has not had a full-time coach since January, but played with great freedom in Miami.So what kind of support might Raducanu need to be able to produce form like this on a more consistent basis?After the early promise of two Australian Open wins against higher-ranked opponents, Raducanu lost heavily to Iga Swiatek in January before coach Nick Cavaday informed her his health would prevent him from continuing.February's spell in the Middle East ended in distressing fashion, as a man who had been following Raducanu around the circuit was evicted from her second-round match and given a restraining order.Raducanu appeared rudderless for much of that period, although she was rarely short of support. \"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jane O'Donoghue (left) was with Emma Raducanu in MiamiRaducanu is part of the Great Britain team which will compete in the Billie Jean King Cup qualifying round in early April, and will be able to spend the next two weeks working with the LTA coaching team.But she will need a more lasting plan swiftly.Her clay-court season could take in Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome before thre French Open, and there will be very little respite in the schedule before the end of October.That plan does not need to revolve around one person.Many top players employ more than one coach, usually because it is very hard for any one individual to commit to more than 30 weeks on the road each year.Jack Draper ended last summer\u2019s partnership with Wayne Ferreira as he preferred the \"one voice\" of James Trotman, but now travels to some events with Alex Ward.Perhaps things could have worked out differently with Cavaday if an additional coach had been brought into the team when his health problems first arose in the spring of 2024.Exposure to different personalities and ways of thinking has always been appealing to Raducanu, but the period with Cavaday offered her stability and calmness.They liked each other, having first established a coaching partnership when Raducanu was a girl. Tom Welsh was drafted in from the Loughborough Academy as a short-term hire for Indian Wells, only for Vladimir Platenik to usurp him by arriving in California for a hastily arranged trial.After only two weeks that trial was ended by Raducanu on the eve of her first-round victory in Miami - and a seat offered once again to O\u2019Donoghue and the broadcaster and coach Mark Petchey.How 'free spirit' Raducanu is thriving without coachPublished2 days agoSecond Serve: Your new weekly tennis briefingPublished3 days agoPetchey coached an 18-year-old Andy Murray for 10 months - during which he won his first ATP title - and trained with Raducanu during the pandemic summer of 2020.Those weeks at the National Tennis Centre in London appear to have left quite an impression on Raducanu. Sears still looks a good bet and has a proven track record of success with Daniela Hantuchova, Ana Ivanovic and Anett Kontaveit.He is no longer working with the Australian Olivia Gadecki, and is a regular at the National Tennis Centre in London, where he works with the LTA's women's team.For all her progress in Miami, Raducanu may have a difficult spring and summer without the right personnel around her.Does she ever throws a covetous glance at Draper's set-up?His team looks a thoroughly professional outfit, and some hard decisions have recently been made.Physio Will Herbert and strength and conditioning coach Steve Kotze are no longer involved. Platenik says Raducanu told him she was feeling \u201cstressed\u201d when ending the brief collaboration.Torben Beltz looked an excellent choice, given his Grand Slam success with Angelique Kerber, but Raducanu did not feel he had enough to offer.Dmitry Tursunov ended their partnership because he thought Raducanu needed to listen to just \"one voice\".",

        "article_text": "Most modern structures are built to last 50 years or so, but ingenious ancient engineering has kept this watery city afloat for more than 1,600 years \u2013 using only wood.\nAs any local knows, Venice is an upside-down forest. The city, which turned 1604 years old on March 25, is built on the foundations of millions of short wooden piles, pounded in the ground with their tip facing downwards. These trees \u2013 larch, oak, alder, pine, spruce and elm of a length ranging between 3.5m (11.5ft) to less than 1m (3ft) \u00a0\u2013 have been holding up stone palazzos and tall belltowers for centuries, in a true marvel of engineering leveraging the forces of physics and nature.\nIn most modern structures, reinforced concrete and steel do the work that this inverted forest has been doing for centuries. But despite their strength, few foundations today could last as long as Venice's. \"Concrete or steel piles are designed [with a guarantee to last] 50 years today,\" says Alexander\u00a0Puzrin, professor of geomechanics and geosystems engineering at the ETH university in Zurich, Switzerland. \"Of course, they might last longer, but when we build houses and industrial structures, the standard is 50 years of life.\"\nBuilding to last\nOnly once, early on in his career, Puzrin has been asked to provide a guarantee of 500 years for a construction a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed temple in Israel.\n\"I was kind of shocked because this was unusual,\" he recalls. \"I was really scared, and they wanted me to sign. I called my boss in Tel Aviv, a very experienced, old engineer and I said, 'What are we going to do? They want 500 years.' He answered, '500 years? [pause]. Sign.' None of us is going to be there.\"\nThe Venetian piles technique is fascinating for its geometry, its centuries-old resilience, and for its sheer scale. No-one is exactly sure how many millions of piles there are under the city, but there are 14,000 tightly packed wooden poles in the foundations of the Rialto bridge\u00a0alone, and 10,000 oak trees under the San Marco Basilica, which was built in 832AD.\n\"I was born and raised in Venice,\" says Caterina Francesca Izzo, environmental chemistry and cultural heritage professor at the University of Venice. \"Growing up, like everyone else, I knew that underneath the Venetian buildings, there are the trees of Cadore [the mountain region next to Venice]. But I didn't know how these piles were placed, how they were counted and knocked down, nor the fact that the battipali\u00a0(literally the 'pile hitters') had a very important profession. They even had their own songs. It is fascinating from a technical and technological point of view.\"\u00a0\nThe battipali would hammer down the piles by hand, and they would sing an ancient\u00a0song\u00a0to keep the rhythm \u2013 a haunting and repetitive melody with lyrics that praise Venice, its republican glory, its Catholic faith, and declare death to the enemy of the time, the Turks. On a more lighthearted note, a Venetian expression still in use today, na testa da bater pai (literally 'a head that is good to pound down the piles') is a colourful way of saying that someone is dull or slow-witted.\nThe piles were stuck as deep as possible, until they couldn't be pounded down any further, starting at the outer edge of the structure and moving towards the centre of the foundations, usually driving nine piles per square metre in a spiral shape. The heads were then sawn to obtain a regular surface, which would lay below sea-level.\nTransverse wooden structures \u2013 either zatteroni (boards) or madieri (beams) \u2013 were placed on top. In the case of the bell towers, these beams or boards were up to 50cm (20in) thick. For other buildings, the dimensions were 20cm (8in) or even less. Oak provided the most resilient wood, but it was also the most precious. (Later on, oak would only be used to build ships \u2013 it was too valuable to stick in the mud.) On top of this wooden foundation, workers would place the stone of the building.\nThe Republic of Venice soon began protecting its forests to provide sufficient wood for construction, as well as for ships. \"Venice invented sylviculture,\" explains Nicola Macchioni, research director at the institute for bioeconomy at Italy's National Council for Research, referring to the practice of cultivating trees. \"The first official sylviculture document in Italy is indeed from the Magnificent Community of the Fiemme Valley [to the north-west of Venice], dating from 1111AD. It details rules to exploit the woods without depleting them.\"\nAccording to Macchioni, these conservation practices must have been in use years before they were written down. \"That explains why the Fiemme Valley is still covered by a lush fir forest today.\" Countries such as England, however, were facing wood shortages by the middle of the 16th Century already, he adds.\nVenice is not the only city relying on wooden piles for foundations \u2013 but there are key differences that make it unique. Amsterdam is another city partially built on wooden piles \u2013 here and in many other northern European cities, they go all the way down until they reach the bedrock, and they work like long columns, or like the legs of a table.\n\"Which is fine if the rock is close to the surface,\" says Thomas Leslie, professor of architecture at the University of Illinois. But in many regions, the bedrock is well beyond the reach of a pile. On the shore of Lake Michigan in the US, where Leslie is based, the bedrock could be 100ft (30m) below the surface. \"Finding trees that big is difficult, right? There were stories of Chicago in the 1880s where they tried to drive one tree trunk on top of another, which, as you can imagine ended up not working. Finally, they realised that you could rely on the friction of the soil.\"\nThe principle is based on the idea of reinforcing the soil, by sticking in as many piles as possible, raising substantial friction between piles and soil. \"What's clever about that,\" says Leslie, \"is that you're sort of using the physics\u2026 The beauty of it is that you're using the fluid nature of the soil to provide resistance to hold the buildings up.\" The technical term for this is hydrostatic pressure, which essentially means that the soil \"grips\" the piles if many are inserted densely in one spot, Leslie says.\nIndeed, the Venetian piles work this way \u2013 they are too short to reach bedrock, and instead keep the buildings up thanks to friction. But the history of this way of building goes back further still.\nThe technique was mentioned by 1st-Century Roman engineer and architect Vitruvius; Romans would use submerged piles to build bridges, which again are close to water. Water gates in China were built with friction piles too. The Aztecs used them in Mexico City, until the Spanish came, tore down the ancient city and built their Catholic cathedral on top, Puzrin notes. \"The Aztecs knew how to build in their environment much better than the Spanish later, who have now huge problems with this metropolitan cathedral [where the floor is sinking unevenly].\"\nPuzrin holds a graduate class at ETH that investigates famous geotechnical failures. \"And this is one of these failures. This Mexico City cathedral, and Mexico City in general, is an open-air museum of everything that can go wrong with your foundations.\"\nAfter more than a millennium and a half in the water, Venice's foundations have proved remarkably resilient. They are not, however, immune to damage.\u00a0\nTen years ago, a team from the universities of Padova and Venice (departments ranging from forestry to engineering and cultural heritage) investigated the condition of the city's foundations, starting from the belltower of the Frari Church, built in 1440 on alder piles.\nThe Frari belltower has been sinking 1mm (0.04in) a year since its construction, for a total of 60cm (about 24in). Compared with churches and buildings, belltowers have more weight distributed on a smaller surface and therefore sink deeper and faster, \"like a stiletto heel\", says Macchioni, who was part of the team investigating the city\u2019s foundations.\nCaterina Francesca Izzo was working on the field, core drilling, collecting and analyzing wood samples from underneath churches, belltowers and from the side of the canals, which were being emptied out and cleaned up at the time. She said that they had to be careful while they were working on the bottom of the dry canal, to avoid the wastewater sporadically gushing from the side pipes.\nThe team found that throughout the structures they investigated, the wood was damaged (bad news), but the system of water, mud and wood was keeping it all together (good news).\nThey debunked the common belief that the wood underneath the city doesn't rot because it's in an oxygen-free, or anaerobic, condition \u2013 bacteria do attack wood, even in absence of oxygen. But bacteria action is much slower than the action of fungi and insects, which operate in the presence of oxygen. Furthermore, water fills up the cells that are emptied out by bacteria, allowing wooden piles to maintain their shape. So even if the wooden piles are damaged, the whole system of wood, water and mud is held together under intense pressure, and is kept resilient for centuries.\n\"Is there anything to worry about? Yes and no, but we should still consider continuing this type of research,\" says Izzo. Since the sampling 10 years ago, they hadn't collected new ones, mainly because of the logistics involved.\nIt's not known for how many more hundreds of years the foundations will last, says Macchioni. \"However, [it will last] as long as the environment remains the same. The foundation system works because it is made of wood, soil and water.\" The soil creates an oxygen-free environment, the water both contributes to that and maintains the shape of the cells, and the wood provides friction. Without one of these three elements, the system collapses.\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, wood was completely replaced by cement in foundation construction. In recent years, though, a new trend of building with wood has gained increased interest, including the rise of wooden skyscrapers. \"It's kind of the cool material right now, and for really good reasons,\" comments Leslie. Wood is a carbon sink, it's biodegradable and thanks to its ductility, it's considered among the most earthquake-resistant materials.\n\"We can't of course build entire cities on wood nowadays because we are too many on the planet,\" adds Macchioni, but it's undeniable that without artificial materials and without motors, ancient builders just had to be more ingenious. Venice is not the only city with wooden foundations, but it is \"the only one [where the friction technique was used] en masse that is still surviving today and is so insanely beautiful\", adds Puzrin. \"There were people out there who didn't study soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering, and yet they produced something we can only dream about producing, which lasted so long. They were amazing, intuitive engineers who did exactly the right thing, taking advantage of all these special conditions.\"\u00a0\n* The illustrations in this story are for artistic purposes only and are not a true representation of the timber pile foundations under Venice, which are\u00a0tightly packed and do not have branches.\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.",

Tuchel is determined to build on that existing camaraderie.\nIndeed, the England head coach stressed the importance of relationships in his first address to the team on Monday night.\nIn his opening speech, Tuchel reiterated they have just 24 training sessions together before USA 2026 gets under way.\nTo that end, the former Chelsea boss admitted he would not be making drastic changes to the playing style Southgate had developed.\nBased on the opening training sessions, it quickly became apparent that Tuchel would employ a four-man defence - despite conjecture the German would use a three-at-the-back system he relied on successfully at Chelsea.\nThe overriding message of Tuchel's address, though, was one of triumph and history.\n\"He said the goal was to put another star on the jersey,\" divulged Burn last week.\n\nThis video can not be played\nWhy you shouldn't want Tuchel's England peaking now\nWatch The Football News Show on BBC iPlayer\nAn exciting start or lots of work needed?

He followed the thread as top Trump administration officials discussed upcoming military strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.\nThe Atlantic then on Wednesday published the entire text thread that showed the detailed and potentially classified rundown for a March air raids. \nWhile the thread appears to have contained sensitive information, there is still much that remains unknown. Here are four lingering questions regarding so-called \"Signal-gate\".\nThe Trump administration maintains the information shared in the chat was not classified.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that \"no war plans\" were discussed on the chat. Instead, she characterised the information shared as  \"sensitive policy discussions\".\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told lawmakers during a congressional hearing that the Signal chat was \"candid and sensitive\", though \"no classified information was shared\".\nBut under questioning, she and CIA Director John Ratcliffe appeared uncertain about the classification of the attack plan. They later emphasised that Hegseth had the power to classify and declassify the type of details that were shared. \nHegseth has denied sharing classified material, but experts are sceptical that this type of sensitive information would not carry that kind of designation.\nJamil Jaffer, executive director of the National Security Institute at George Mason University, said that Hegseth did not send \"an operational plan for World War Three, or for the Pacific region\".\n\"But at the same time,\" Mr Jaffer said, \"these are operational details that could, if released publicly, put American lives at risk or jeopardise the success of the operation.\"\nIn his original article, Mr Goldberg reports that on 11 March he initially \"received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz\", Trump's national security adviser.\nTwo days later, he writes that he received a notice that he was to be included in a Signal group titled the \"Houthi PC small group.\"\nMr Goldberg reports that the group received a message from Waltz, which also noted one of his deputies was \"pulling together\" a team of top staffers relevant to the discussion. \nOn Tuesday, Trump suggested that a \"lower level\" staffer for Waltz added Mr Goldberg to the chat.\nHowever, Waltz himself told Fox News' Laura Ingraham: \"I take full responsibility. I built the - I built the group.\"\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who was also in the group, said on Wednesday that someone had made a \"mistake\" in adding Mr Goldberg.\nIt remains to be seen whether the Republican-controlled Congress will launch oversight investigations.\nRepublican lawmakers have emphatically supported the Trump administration's agenda to this point, so it seems improbable that they would support investigations into the Signal chat.\nDemocrats in the House are reportedly trying to force a vote on a \"Resolution of Inquiry\" that would require the Trump administration to hand over records related to the incident, according to Reuters, but they do not have a majority. \nWhile some Republicans have raised concerns over the leak, few have appeared eager to cross the president. \nThe use of Signal to discuss the Houthi strikes posed broader questions about how Trump's top staffers are sharing and discussing sensitive information.\nGabbard testified on Wednesday that Signal came \"pre-installed on government devices\".\nShe cited guidance from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which mentioned Signal as an example of a messaging service with end-to-end encryption.\nRatcliffe earlier testified to Congress that Signal had been installed on his devices when he took over the CIA.\nBut it remains uncertain if security officials had provided guidance about using Signal for discussing military operations like the strikes against the Houthis.\n\"Whether these circumstances were approved or not is still not clear,\" Mr Jaffer said.\nCBS News, the BBC's US partner, has reported that the US National Security Agency had warned employees against using Signal due to \"a vulnerability\" that they had identified.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

As a kicking unit we wanted to go there and flash our talent, let the scouts know that we are there for a reason and on merit,\" said McNamee.  \n\"I wasn't overly focused on the numbers but more the process of kicking and making sure we came across well.\"\nThe pair know that being in the international class, they have to work just that little bit harder than their American peers to catch the scouts' eyes.\n\"You're definitely an underdog,\" said Bolger. \n\"There's a low expectation but then there is a really high ceiling.  When you're going kick-for-kick alongside Americans and then are doing better than them, that's when the scouts here are impressed.\"\nJude McAtamney (right) last November became the first Irish-born placekicker to feature in a regular season NFL game since 1985 while Charlie Smyth (left) remains part of the New Orleans practice squad as he also attempts to forge an NFL career\nUnlike McNamee, who went straight from gaelic football into the IPP programme, Bolger has just completed two years' college experience as a kicker and punter with the Idaho State Bengals after his talent was discovered and honed by the Irish kicking coach and mentor Tadhg Leader.\n\"Once I got a full scholarship, that was the time when I really believed I could do it.  I gauged myself against American lads and that gave me the confidence that what Tadhg was saying was right,\" added the Laois man.\n\"And I have great memories \u2013 two years playing college football in the States was a class experience. I played in front of 35,000 against Oregon State in the opening game of last season in a great atmosphere.\"\nAs Pro Day approaches, McNamee says they have taken much inspiration from Smyth and McAtamney's path to the big time this time last year.\n\"It was amazing to see someone could go from playing gaelic football to competing at the NFL Combine. Once I saw that I knew I had a skill that would transfer well if I was given time to prepare,\" the Ballyboden GAA goalkeeper added.\n\"Charlie was the trailblazer for me. He's incredible and confidence just radiates from him. \n\"He was the youngest in the group last year and to be able to come in and compete as well as he did at the Combine and Pro Day and then get signed... it's unbelievable he was able to do it.\"\nAs for making that same transaction from Gaelic to American football, both McNamee and Bolger have worked hard on mastering a different kicking technique, with both likening it to perfecting a golf swing.\n\"The sweet spot in the ball in Gaelic is lower than on a ball in American football,\" McNamee explained.  \n\"Initially, I started kicking the ball too low which meant it was over-rotating and getting no distance.  So it was adjusting my angle and swing and once I'd found where the sweet spot was I was able to introduce power into it and dive a bit deeper into the foot angle, follow through, aim and finish.  \n\"I don't really think about it now \u2013 it's more natural and I kick that ball like I've been doing it for years.  As my technique's improved, I've added distance and there's more to come.\"\nFor Bolger, it's about doing the hard work in the gym away from the field. \n\"Once I was at college I realised there was more to it than biceps curls and looking in the mirror. At Idaho State, I was in the gym with the heavy weights on my back every day. That has helped with my kicking distance.  \n\"A lot of it is mastering technique too, of course. You have to learn to keep swinging your leg the same and keep your technique. You can overthink it sometimes, definitely.\"\n\nNFL fixtures and results\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "What will it take for India's private companies to begin investing in building new factories and firms?\nIt's a question that's confounded policymakers for years. As a share of gross domestic product (GDP), private investment in India has been on the decline since the global financial crisis of 2007, even while the overall economy clocked world-beating growth rates.\nAfter a long hiatus, the investment rate picked up slightly in 2022 and 2023, but latest data from a leading ratings agency shows private sector expenditure as part of the overall investments in India's economy dipped again to a decadal low of 33% this financial year.\nAnalysis from Icra of 4,500 listed companies and 8,000 unlisted companies reveals that while the pace of investments made by listed players moderated, those by unlisted entities actually contracted.\nOver the years, several economists have raised similar concerns about a slowdown in private investments. \nBanking tycoon Uday Kotak is among many who've raised concerns recently about India's fading \"animal spirits\", urging young business owners who had inherited companies to build new businesses rather than sitting tight and managing their existing wealth.\nData from investment advisory firm Value Research shows Indian non-financial businesses were sitting on cash worth 11% of their total assets, corroborating the view that companies are not spending money in making fresh investments. \nSo why are Indian corporate houses choosing to do that?\nWeak domestic consumption in urban areas, muted export demand and an influx of cheap Chinese imports in some sectors were among the factors that \"restricted the capacity expansion plans of Indian corporate houses\", Icra's Chief Rating Officer K Ravichandran said in a note.\nBut beyond the more immediate reasons, private investment impulse has been low because of \"global uncertainties and overcapacity\", India's economic survey pointed out earlier this year.\nSlowing private investments have a direct bearing on India's growth prospects.\nInvestments by companies in assets such as factories, machinery or construction \u2013 also called gross fixed capital formation \u2013 make up around 30% of GDP and are its second largest contributor following private consumption.\nIndia's full-year GDP is expected to close at 6.5%, sharply lower compared to last year's 9.2%. Growth has flagged on account of slower consumption.\nWith all the key levers of growth, including exports, slowing down and US President Donald Trump's tariffs exacerbating global uncertainties, kick-starting private investment will be fundamental for India to hit its long-term growth targets, experts say.\nAccording to the World Bank's latest estimates, India will need to grow by 7.8% on average over the next 22 years to achieve its high-income status ambition by 2047.\nKey to this would be to increase private and public investment to at least 40% of GDP from 33% currently, the bank estimates.\nThe government on its part has significantly increased spending, especially on infrastructure. It also cut corporate tax rates from 30% to 22% and doled out billions of dollars in production-linked subsidies to manufacturers over the years. Availability of bank credit isn't a constraint any longer, and regulation has eased with regulatory restrictions halving between 2003 and 2020.\nBut none of this has prodded corporate India to boost spending.\nAccording to Sajjid Chinoy, JP Morgan India's Chief Economist, the big problem is the lack of demand in the economy to justify putting up additional capacities.\nIndia's post-pandemic recovery has been uneven, with the consumer class not expanding quickly enough. Demand for goods and services has thus been hit, with spending capacity further curtailed by a fall in wages, even though corporate profitability has soared to a 15-year high this year.\n\"Just because companies are financially strong doesn't mean they will automatically invest. Companies will only invest if they expect good returns,\" Chinoy said at an event in Mumbai earlier this year.\nRathin Roy, a former member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC), points to other deeper structural issues arresting investment appetite.\n\"Entrepreneurs have been lacking the energy to produce goods that might generate new demand. A classic example of this is construction - where there's unsold inventory in the urban areas, but an incapacity among builders to go into tier two and tier three towns and tap newer markets,\" Roy told the BBC.\nHe said he also agreed with Mr Kotak's views on the growing trend of business heirs turning wealth managers rather than building businesses ground up.\n\"Business houses discovered during Covid-19 that they don't need to do business to make money. They can just invest and multiply it without building anything new,\" said Roy. And these investments aren't just happening in the domestic stock market. \"A lot of money is just flowing out of India and chasing returns elsewhere,\" he added.\nBut things could be turning a corner, according to Icra.\nInterest rate cuts as well as a $12bn income tax relief provided to individuals in the federal budget \"augurs well for supporting domestic consumption demand\", according to the report.\nIndia's central bank also says more private companies have shown an intention to invest this year compared to last year, although how much of that intent results into actual money deployed remains to be seen. \nThe uncertainties related to global trade tariffs could delay any anticipated investment pick-up, according to Icra.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "summary": "So why are Indian corporate houses choosing to do that?Weak domestic consumption in urban areas, muted export demand and an influx of cheap Chinese imports in some sectors were among the factors that \"restricted the capacity expansion plans of Indian corporate houses\", Icra's Chief Rating Officer K Ravichandran said in a note.But beyond the more immediate reasons, private investment impulse has been low because of \"global uncertainties and overcapacity\", India's economic survey pointed out earlier this year.Getty ImagesInvestments are the second largest contributor to India's GDP following private consumption Slowing private investments have a direct bearing on India's growth prospects.Investments by companies in assets such as factories, machinery or construction \u2013 also called gross fixed capital formation \u2013 make up around 30% of GDP and are its second largest contributor following private consumption.India's full-year GDP is expected to close at 6.5%, sharply lower compared to last year's 9.2%. As a share of gross domestic product (GDP), private investment in India has been on the decline since the global financial crisis of 2007, even while the overall economy clocked world-beating growth rates.After a long hiatus, the investment rate picked up slightly in 2022 and 2023, but latest data from a leading ratings agency shows private sector expenditure as part of the overall investments in India's economy dipped again to a decadal low of 33% this financial year.Analysis from Icra of 4,500 listed companies and 8,000 unlisted companies reveals that while the pace of investments made by listed players moderated, those by unlisted entities actually contracted.Over the years, several economists have raised similar concerns about a slowdown in private investments.

        "article_text": "Countries around the world are braced for Donald Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day in America!!!\" next week.\nThe US president's deadline to impose reciprocal tariffs on trading partners will come just days after he hit foreign carmakers with 25% import taxes.\nVietnam could be particularly vulnerable to Trump's latest salvo of levies. It has a large trade deficit with the US and has been a beneficiary of firms moving factories out of China to avoid measures announced during his first term in office.\nWhile some countries have hit back at Washington, Vietnam's Prime Minister, Pham Minh Chinh, has suggested that he may take a more diplomatic approach.\nSpeaking in January, he said he was willing to visit Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and \"golf all day long\" if it benefits his country, drawing laughter in the room.\nAnd that idea may not be too far-fetched. The Trump Organization is planning to invest billions of dollars in golf courses, hotels and real estate in Vietnam, according to the Reuters news agency.\nThe first project will reportedly be a residential complex with three 18-hole golf courses, which will break ground in May. \nThe BBC has contacted the company and its Vietnamese partner for comment.\nBut could golf diplomacy really work?\nTrump has previously said Vietnam was \"worse than China\" and \"almost the single worst abuser of anybody\". \nBut he has not yet specifically targeted Vietnam with tariffs, even though it has the third largest trade deficit with the US, after China and Mexico. \nAnalysts say Vietnam is doing well at engaging with Washington - but its efforts may still not be enough to avoid most of Trump's tariff plans.\n\"The Vietnam PM seems to be taking a page from the book of [former Japanese PM] Shinzo Abe, who built a close personal relationship with Trump over their shared love of golf,\" said Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator.\n\"I would not however expect any special treatment of Vietnam from a policy point of view. Personal relationships are important to Trump, but in this case, I believe his desire to appear tough on trade will win out.\"\nVietnam has said it doesn't plan to \"restrict trade\" with the US, although it currently taxes some imports from there.\nThe government said this week that it will allow SpaceX, which is owned by close Trump ally Elon Musk, to operate its Starlink satellite internet service in the country on a trial basis.\nSome analysts see this as one of the measures Vietnam has taken to avoid being hit with US tariffs.\nHanoi also said it will lower tariffs on several US imports, including energy and cars, a move aimed at \"improving trade balances\".\nIt came less than two weeks after Vietnamese and US companies signed more than $4bn (\u00a35.4bn) in deals, in areas including oil and gas exploration.\nSteve Norris from the consultancy Control Risks said \"Vietnam is being careful to avoid any moves which would signal any non-cooperation on trade issues\".\nThis strategy is in line with its foreign policy approach - known as \"bamboo diplomacy\". Like shoots of plants that sway with the wind, Vietnam hopes to be adaptable to foreign pressures.\n\"If the US were to increase pressure on Vietnam, the government might respond with offers to facilitate investments in the hospitality and casino industries, undertake advanced machinery purchases, and \u2013 capturing the moment \u2013 consider access to Vietnam's rare earth minerals,\" Mr Norris said.\nOne big factor working against Vietnam is concerns about China's influence.\nVietnam was one of the biggest beneficiaries of US-China tensions during Trump's first term.\nIn 2018, he hit China with tariffs, causing some businesses to rethink where they made their products. Some chose to shift manufacturing to Vietnam. \nThis has led to an increase of exports from Vietnam to the US, with Chinese companies that have moved production there contributing to that figure.\nFormer US trade negotiator Wendy Cutler said Vietnam has emerged as a \"destination for major Chinese investment\".\nWhile the US remains Vietnam's biggest export market, China is its largest supplier of goods, accounting for more than a third of imports, according to the latest official data. \nChinese firms were also behind nearly one in every three new investments in Vietnam last year.\n\"These are huge red flags for Trump. My expectation is that Vietnam will at some point be hit hard by tariffs,\" Mr Olson said.\nHowever, tariffs on Vietnam could impact US businesses such as tech firms Apple and Intel, and sportswear giant Nike, which have moved production lines from China to Vietnam.\nA recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam found that most US manufacturers there expect to lay off staff if tariffs are imposed.\nThe US president believes the levies will boost his country's economy by encouraging more businesses to make goods in the US and bring in billions of dollars of taxes. \nBut many economists have warned that it could force up prices for American consumers and negatively impact global trade.\nWashington is also concerned about so-called \"trans-shipments\" - Chinese goods passing through Vietnam on their way to other countries. \nUS officials have been \"quietly stressing to Vietnam that it must reduce its trade surplus over time and combat the trans-shipment of Chinese goods through the country,\" Mr Norris said.\nVietnam's prime minister has said he is confident that his administration can \"handle the relationship with the US\".\nNow that the South East Asian nation has cut some tariffs on US goods they may be more attractive to Vietnamese consumers, increasing America's share of trade with the country.\nAnd then there is golf - playing a game with Trump had worked for the late Japanese leader Shinzo Abe.\nAbe and Trump established a friendship, which included many golf games over several years. The friendship arguably helped Abe secure tariff exemptions for Japan's critical car industry at the time.\nFor now, it is unclear if Vietnam would really give golf diplomacy a swing.\nThe real test will come next week, when a new slate of Trump's taxes are set to take effect.

        "article_text": "Jay Springett, a tech strategist and podcast host, joined the social media app Butterflies AI out of curiosity, and ended up staying for more than six months.\nThe idea of Butterflies is to allow human and AI personas to interact.\nMr Springett's online persona developed over time, interacting with other artificial characters, and even went as far as to start its own Beanie Babies [a line of soft toys] collection.\nHe said it was like AIs were writing their own soap operas inside a simulation.\n\"I didn't engage with Butterflies in the same way I do with other platforms,\" Mr Springett told BBC.\n\"It felt more like observing than participating. I wouldn't pay for it, but it was interesting enough to keep watching.\"\nA host of social media services, like Butterflies, are trying to expand at a time when there is dissatisfaction with the social media giants.\nAccording to data from Similarweb, a digital market intelligence company, X's daily active users in the UK have dropped by nearly 25% since January 2024.\nAnd it's not just X that has been suffering, mobile and desktop traffic to Facebook has declined over the last few years according to Similarweb.\nA report by the Pew Research Centre found that a third of teens use Facebook and X, compared with three quarters a decade ago.\nBluesky is one of the social media firms gaining ground.\nOver the past year, Bluesky has gained tens of millions of new users, often at the expense of X.\nApart from just timing, though, BlueSky's success can be largely attributed to its novel architecture, which pairs an X-like experience with a high degree of customization.\nUnlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community.\nDon't like the broader discourse on Bluesky? Jump on the \"popular with friends\" feed to see what the people you follow specifically are talking about.\nIt will not be simple for Bluesky to scale up to the size of X and Facebook, says Andy Tattersall, an information specialist at the University of Sheffield.\nHe ways it will have to strike a balance between \"generating revenue, keeping users safe, and moderating content, which is much easier said than done\".\nCelebrity-backed foundation, Free Our Feeds, hopes to do that.\nIt's backed some notable names, including musician Brian Eno and actor Mark Ruffalo, and plans to raise $30m (\u00a323m) over the next three years to support an open social media ecosystem powered by the AT Protocol, the decentralized network powering Bluesky.\n\"Bluesky has created a strong foundation for shared social media infrastructure,\" says Robin Berjonone, one of Free Our Feeds' nine custodians, \"but so long as they are the primary operator of this infrastructure the risk remains that it will stop operating in the public interest\".\nA bigger worry for these emerging platforms, though, is the network barrier. This can be summed up with Metcalfe's Law, explains Evan Prodromou, co-author and current editor of ActivityPub, another open social media architecture, which is behind popular platforms like Meta's Threads.\nThe law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services.\nNon-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe's Law.\nThey hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services. \nInstead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them.\nThreads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance.\nUsing this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms.\nIt's not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol.\nBut there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech.\n\"One thing we've learnt from the past decades is that the last thing the world needs is a one-size-fits all solution for eight billion people,\" says Robin Berjon, one of Free Our Feeds' custodians.\nAt the other end of the spectrum are those that want to carve a niche out for themselves, rather than replace the incumbents.\nIn the last couple of years, a cottage industry of unique, new social apps has cropped.\nOne of those is Mozi, created by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. Mozi doesn't want you to socialise online at all.\nInstead it informs you when you're going to be in the same place (city or event) as someone you know and encourages you to connect with people more often in person.\n\"Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,\" says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson.\nMike McCue, the CEO of Flipboard, is convinced such innovation will result in a new era of social networking, where numerous new, more interesting types of social networks will emerge and offer people more choices.\nHe hopes that Flipboard's app, Surf will help people manage a messy social media ecosystem. It allows users to browse from a centralized feed that can draw posts and content from a variety of platforms, including Threads, Bluesky, and YouTube.\n\"In the end,\" says Mr McCue, \"it's unlikely one service will replace the Facebook or Twitter we once knew, but instead several services will start to take our time away from these old-style single feed experiences, our behaviours will shift with these new choices and new generations will expect more.\"",

        "article_text": "A discussion by high-ranking US security officials about US air strikes on Yemen has been published in full by the Atlantic magazine.\nThe group chat on the Signal app mistakenly included the Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg.\nAfter holding back some excerpts of the chat in an earlier article, he decided on Wednesday to publish almost the entire exchange after senior officials insisted there was no classified information shared in the group. \nThose statements \"have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions\", Goldberg wrote. \nThe messages, however, need some unpicking. Here are three of them with some analysis.\nThese messages provide details of the US military's plan for the Yemen strikes - described as a \"package\", a military term which refers to a set of aircraft, weapons systems and intelligence gathering devices that will participate in an operation. \n\"The idea this wasn't classified information at the time is inconceivable,\" Glenn Gerstell, the former general counsel of the National Security Agency (NSA), told the BBC. \nHe added that it may have been declassified afterwards but any imminent military action involving American troops would have been classified at the time it was shared.\n\nThe messages from Hegseth note what time F-18 fighter aircraft are scheduled to launch, as well as when strikes will take place and in what timeframe \"trigger-based\" attacks could occur. \nIn this context, \"trigger\" refers to a set of parameters that have to be acknowledged before weapons are deployed. It could be a visual reference point, like a mobile phone lighting up. \nThis information is considered highly sensitive. \nPhilip Ingram, a former military intelligence officer with the British Army, told the BBC that similar information \"falls firmly into the bracket of what would have been classified top secret\".\n\"You can practically plot where the aircraft are going to come from,\" he added. \nIn the wake of the chat's revelations, the White House and other US officials have argued that this information does not constitute a \"war plan\". \nIn a post on X, Hegseth said: \"The Atlantic released the so-called 'war plans' and those 'plans' include: No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods.\"\nIn this part of the group chat, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz provides an update on the strike - which in military parlance is called a battle damage assessment, or BDA. \nWaltz notes that the target building has collapsed, and that the US military had earlier had positive identification of the target - a Houthi \"missile guy\" - walking into the building, which was believed to be his girlfriend's residence. \n\nIn his message, Waltz congratulates Pete - referring to Hegseth, as well as the IC, shorthand for \"intelligence community\" and Kurilla, a reference to Michael Kurilla, a US Army General who oversees Central Command, a regional combatant command with responsibility over the Middle East and parts of Central and South Asia. \nThe messages do not reveal how the target's whereabouts or movements were tracked. \nA military expert contacted by the BBC - but who wished to remain nameless - suggested that a combination of aerial platforms, technological tracking capabilities or human intelligence on the ground could have been used, or a combination of various sources. \nAt least 53 people were killed in the initial wave of US airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, which struck more than 30 targets  including training facilities, drone infrastructure, as well as weapons manufacturing and storage sites and command and control centres, including one in which the Pentagon said several unmanned aerial vehicle experts were located. \nIt is unclear which of the targets Waltz was referring to in the group chat. \nAnother potentially sensitive message comes from Joe Kent, a former special operations soldier and failed congressional candidate who was nominated by Trump to be the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center. \nIn his message, Kent refers to Israel carrying out their own strikes. \nThe Israeli military has repeatedly struck Houthi targets in Yemen since the beginning of the war in Gaza, in retaliation for Houthi missile and drone attacks on Israeli targets conducted in support of Hamas. \nThe most recent attacks took place on 19 and 26 December of last year. \nAccording to Kent, the Israeli government would seek to \"replenish\" any weapons stocks used in further raids, although he believes that to be a \"minor factor\". \nA slightly more sensitive message follows from CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who notes that the US is  \"mobilising assets\" to help a strike, but that a delay would \"not negatively impact\" the agency's work in Yemen. \n\"Additional time would be used to identify better starting points for coverage on Houthi leadership,\" he wrote.\nAssets, in this context, could refer to CIA-run spies on the ground in Yemen, or technological means such as surveillance drone flights. \nMick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence and ex-CIA paramilitary officer, said that Ratcliffe's message was very sensitive. \n\"Essentially, we don't want to share where the CIA is focused,\" he added. \nRatcliffe told a House hearing on Wednesday that he did not transmit classified information.\n(With additional reporting from Nomia Iqbal and Ruth Comerford)",

They move up to fifth position in the table to improve their chances of clinching a top eight-place, which would guarantee a spot in the end-of-season knockout stages and qualification for the Champions Cup.\nThe Stormers remain in contention too after picking up bonus points for scoring four tries and being within seven points and with four home games to come to complete their regular league campaign.\nThe Cape Town side took a second-minute lead when back-rower Roos raced away to score after the hosts had been turned over on their own 22, and Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu played him through a gaping hole in the Ulster defence.\nThe visiting fly-half added the extras and soon after executed a drop goal from long range to increase the lead to 10-0.\nThe South African side's superb start continued when Loader broke away to score after Dave McCann's pass in the tackle on halfway fell loose and was latched on to by the wing. Feinberg-Mngomezulu kicked the conversion from the right-hand touchline.\nUlster responded on 11 minutes as Baloucoune marked his return to action after an 11-month absence by going over in the corner after collecting Murphy's 20-yard spin pass.\nThe home side enjoyed the better of the possession and pressure thereafter in the first half and were rewarded when prop Warwick barged over from close range, Cooney adding the additional two points.\nFeinberg-Mngomezulu then steered a penalty from 35 metres wide after the ball fell off the tee - a let-off for Richie Murphy's side.\nThe Stormers number 10 was at the centre of the action again as he received a yellow card for taking out Baloucoune in full flight after the wing had kicked the ball forward into space.\nSoon after, Murphy crossed when the ball was spun to him on the left after Ulster rucked up close to the Stormers' line and he finished the move superbly.\nCentre Stewart Moore scored the last of Ulster's six tries in a high-scoring game\nAfter the sides went in level at the break, Ulster got off to a storming start on the resumption by touching down for his side's bonus-point score.\nUlster opted for a tap and go at a penalty and worked the ball to the left, where Mike Lowry unselfishly passed to Stockdale who cantered over. Cooney was successful with his kick to put two between the sides.\nThe Stormers suffered a further setback when they had captain Fouche sent-off by referee Andrea Pairdi after he consulted with the Television Match Official [TMO].\nThe prop was adjudged to have committed a dangerous challenge to the head of centre Carson, who left the field injured.\nFeinberg-Mngomezulu reduced his team's arrears when he returned to the field after his 10 minutes in the bin, notching a second drop goal, this time firing between the sticks from 40 yards.\nThat proved to be only a brief respite, however, as Ulster scored try number five. Stockdale burst through the midfield before offloading to the right flank to flying replacement Ward, who sprinted over the line. Murphy had the simple task of adding the conversion from in front of the posts.\nThe Stormers were not finished though as substitute Engelbrecht darted in beside the posts, Feinberg-Mngomezulu adding the two points to put just four between the sides.\nUlster's sixth try came on the counter-attack, Lowry scorching down the right flank and passing to Nick Timoney, then Doak, then Moore who dashed over adjacent to the uprights.

Feinberg-Mngomezulu kicked the conversion from the right-hand touchline.Ulster responded on 11 minutes as Baloucoune marked his return to action after an 11-month absence by going over in the corner after collecting Murphy's 20-yard spin pass.The home side enjoyed the better of the possession and pressure thereafter in the first half and were rewarded when prop Warwick barged over from close range, Cooney adding the additional two points.Feinberg-Mngomezulu then steered a penalty from 35 metres wide after the ball fell off the tee - a let-off for Richie Murphy's side.The Stormers number 10 was at the centre of the action again as he received a yellow card for taking out Baloucoune in full flight after the wing had kicked the ball forward into space.Soon after, Murphy crossed when the ball was spun to him on the left after Ulster rucked up close to the Stormers' line and he finished the move superbly.High scoring continuesImage source, InphoImage caption, Centre Stewart Moore scored the last of Ulster's six tries in a high-scoring gameAfter the sides went in level at the break, Ulster got off to a storming start on the resumption by touching down for his side's bonus-point score.Ulster opted for a tap and go at a penalty and worked the ball to the left, where Mike Lowry unselfishly passed to Stockdale who cantered over. Murphy had the simple task of adding the conversion from in front of the posts.The Stormers were not finished though as substitute Engelbrecht darted in beside the posts, Feinberg-Mngomezulu adding the two points to put just four between the sides.Ulster's sixth try came on the counter-attack, Lowry scorching down the right flank and passing to Nick Timoney, then Doak, then Moore who dashed over adjacent to the uprights. Doak's kick extended his side's advantage to 11 points.Again, the Stormers came back strongly as Roos barged over from close range for his second of the night, the conversion bringing their side to within four.Ulster hung on for a crucial win, however, the victory ensuring that the record of no South African side having ever won at the Kingspan Stadium continues.Team line-upsUlster: Michael Lowry, Rob Baloucoune, James Hume, Stuart McCloskey, Jacob Stockdale, Jack Murphy, John Cooney, Andrew Warwick, Rob Herring, Tom O'Toole, Alan O'Connor (capt), Kieran Treadwell, Matty Rea, Nick Timoney, David McCannReplacements: Tom Stewart, Callum Reid, Scott Wilson, Harry Sheridan, James McNabney, Nathan Doak, Ben Carson, Zac WardDHL Stormers: Damian Willemse, Ben Loader, Suleiman Hartzenberg, Dan du Plessis, Leolin Zas, Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu, Dewaldt Duvenage, Ali Vermaak, Joseph Dweba, Neethling Fouche (capt), Connor Evans, Ruben van Heerden, Dave Ewers, Marcel Theunissen, Evan RoosReplacements: Andre-Hugo Venter, Brok Harris, Sazi Sandi, Gary Porter, Willie Engelbrecht, Paul de Wet, Jurie Matthee, Wandisile SimelaneRelated topicsUlsterIrish RugbyNorthern Ireland SportRugby Union They move up to fifth position in the table to improve their chances of clinching a top eight-place, which would guarantee a spot in the end-of-season knockout stages and qualification for the Champions Cup.The Stormers remain in contention too after picking up bonus points for scoring four tries and being within seven points and with four home games to come to complete their regular league campaign.See-saw first halfThe Cape Town side took a second-minute lead when back-rower Roos raced away to score after the hosts had been turned over on their own 22, and Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu played him through a gaping hole in the Ulster defence.The visiting fly-half added the extras and soon after executed a drop goal from long range to increase the lead to 10-0.The South African side's superb start continued when Loader broke away to score after Dave McCann's pass in the tackle on halfway fell loose and was latched on to by the wing.",

        "article_text": "At a secret location away from prying eyes, Ukrainian engineers test a long-range drone called Raybird.  \nThe machine, which looks like a mini plane with wings, is placed on a launchpad, stretched like an arrow on a crossbow and then shot into the air.\nRaybird can fly non-stop for more than 20 hours and cover a distance of more than 1,000km (620 miles). It carries out reconnaissance missions, and can also destroy targets both on the frontline and deep inside Russia.\nAmong their targets are oil refineries and fuel depots.\nBut after Russia and Ukraine reached separate agreements with the US on a partial ceasefire, missions like these should stop.\nAs well as agreeing to a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea following talks this week in Saudi Arabia, the two countries committed to stop attacking each other's energy infrastructure \u2013 something that had theoretically already been agreed.\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine would implement these agreements immediately.\nHowever, Oleksiy from Skyeton, the company that develops the Raybird, doubts that Moscow would adhere to the ceasefire.\n\"[Russians punch you in the face, then the next day they make an agreement but ask to tie up your hands. So the possibility that they will continue fighting remains,\" explains Oleksiy.\nYet, this deal will also bring relief to Russia.\nIt's estimated that this year alone, Ukraine carried out more than 30 attacks on Russia's oil infrastructure using drones and other weapons. \nThey've recently hit some of the country's largest oil facilities, like the Ufa oil refinery about 1,500km (932 miles) from the front line and Tuapse plant in Krasnodar region.\nRussia's oil refining capacity has dropped by about 10% as a result of drone attacks, according to Reuters.\nAnd Moscow's recent decision to extend the ban on petroleum exports shows that they're feeling the pain.\nUkraine's arsenal to carry out deep strikes is only growing. President Zelensky recently announced that Ukrainian engineers have designed a drone that has a range of 3,000 km (1,860 miles). That means it could reach not only Moscow, but even locations in Siberia.\nKyiv also claims that it has developed turbojet powered \"missile-drones\". They fly at a much higher speed and so are harder to intercept.\nZelensky said Ukraine has successfully tested its first domestically made ballistic weapon and upgraded its cruise missile Neptune to hit ground as well as naval targets. This missile was reportedly used to attack the Russian air base in the southern city of Engels last week, although Ukrainian officials neither confirm nor deny these reports.\nThe energy ceasefire deal is certainly good news for Ukraine too. Russia has been relentlessly targeting its power plants and stations across the country. At one point last year, Ukraine's energy generation capacity dropped to a third of its pre-war level.\nLast month, when temperatures dropped below zero, Russian drones hit a thermal power plant in Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine. A few days later, another massive aerial attack left more than 250,000 residents of Odesa without power and heating.\nAnd lately, there has been a growing number of attacks on Ukraine's gas infrastructure. Among regular targets are underground gas storage facilities in western Ukraine and production facilities in the central and eastern parts of the country.\nMoscow's aim is to reduce gas production in Ukraine, which is key to the country's energy security, says Artem Petrenko, executive director of the Association of Gas Producers of Ukraine.\nAt the end of March, Gas storage facilities in Ukraine were only around 4% full, according to one monitoring group.\nAnd if Russia continues its strikes, filling up those storage facilities will be extremely challenging, potentially leading to massive problems next winter.\nBack at the testing ground, after several laps, the Raybird opens its parachutes and successfully lands in the field. \nOleksiy is satisfied with the results. He says that although it's good to have a ceasefire, they still cannot afford to pause their work and the development of new weapons.\n\"Our enemy just wants to have a break, gather its strength and attack again,\" he says. \"We must be ready for that.\"",

        "article_text": "F1 cars, such as Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari, use 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrid engines\nChristian Horner's phone rang. It was Bernie Ecclestone. Red Bull's team principal picked up, switched to speakerphone and placed it on the table in front of the assembled Formula 1 bosses.\nWe're in the F1 Commission, Horner told Ecclestone. Is there anything you want to say to the room?\nF1's former impresario, addressing the group that decides the sport's rules, said they should go back to V10 engines. Then he hung up.\nThat phone call - described to BBC Sport by several sources in the room at the time - took place in the morning of the day of F1's season launch at the O2 Arena in London in February, where both Horner and governing body the FIA were booed by the 15,000-strong crowd.\nTwo days later, FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem - a man whose three-year tenure has been beset by controversy - posted a message on Instagram.\nBen Sulayem said he \"looked forward\" to the new chassis and engine rules that are  to be introduced in 2026, but that the FIA \"must also lead the way on future technological motorsport trends.\n\"We should consider a range of directions, including the roaring sound of the V10 running on sustainable fuel.\"\nThese developments have kick-started a debate inside F1 about engines. The ground is shifting fast, so what's going on?\nNext year, F1 is going through the biggest regulation change in the sport's history, introducing new rules for both cars and engines.\nOn engines, F1 is sticking with 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids, the basic architecture that has been in place since 2014, but changing the balance between electric and combustion power.\nThe amount of total power provided by the hybrid is going up to about 50% from about 20% now. In addition, F1 is introducing sustainable fuels - abandoning fossil fuels in favour of synthetic fuel created from biomass and industrial processes.\nThis is all part of the sport's pledge to become net-zero carbon by 2030.\nThis video can not be played\nF1 in 10 Years: Lando Norris\nEver since hybrid engines were introduced in 2014, some have bemoaned the loss of the louder, more dramatic sound produced by the naturally aspirated engines that preceded them - especially the 3.0-litre V10s last raced in F1 in 2005.\nIn an unavoidable parallel with Ben Sulayem's actions now, Ecclestone was the first person to bring this up, even before the 2014 engines first raced.\nA certain romanticism about the V10 sound has sustained, as has the idea that those engines - with their ear-splitting shriek that could be heard some distance from the track - are more popular with the fanbase than the current hybrids.\nWithin F1, there is no question that some people agree. Lewis Hamilton said at the Chinese Grand Prix last weekend: \"It is no secret that the V6 has never sounded great.\n\"I remember the first time I came to an F1 race in 1996 in Spa and arriving and Michael (Schumacher) coming through Turn One and my rib cage just vibrated. I was so hooked. It was the most amazing thing I felt and heard.\n\"Over the years we've lost that. If we are able to move back to those amazing sounding engines and still able to see the sustainable goals, why not?\"\nFernando Alonso took his 2005 title-winning Renault R25 - with V10 engine - for a demonstration run on track before the 2020 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix\nIt's not that long since Ben Sulayem was trumpeting his involvement in the introduction of the 2026 engine rules.\nThese were fundamentally settled under the previous FIA president Jean Todt, but there was inevitable wrangling and it got over the line only after Ben Sulayem took office.\nTwo years ago, he said the new engines were \"at the forefront of technological innovation, making the future of F1 more sustainable while maintaining the spectacular racing\".\nSo why the U-turn?\nBen Sulayem has asked his F1 single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis to look into the matter.\nTombazis said that the advent of\u00a0sustainable fuels could allow F1 to make the engines simpler and cheaper.\n\"That's why the president made the comments about V10 engines in '28 - or '29 or whatever - and so on,\" Tombazis said. \"And that is something we are evaluating with the manufacturers.\"\nSenior figures within F1 and the car manufacturers involved in the sport see many problems with the FIA's position.\nOn a macro level, the climate crisis is very real, and the global road-car industry is heading in the direction of electrification - even if Donald Trump's election at the head of a government of climate deniers has given pause for thought in the US.\nManufacturers take part in F1 fundamentally for marketing reasons, and the sport has been made more appealing by the introduction of a budget cap for cars and engines.\nAudi, Ford and General Motors are all entering F1 in 2026 - and Honda are staying rather than withdrawing - specifically because of the new engine rules.\nAudi has already released a statement in response to the latest developments, saying that the new rules \"were a key factor in Audi's decision to enter Formula 1\".\nMercedes says it is open to discussions but would need a hybrid element to be part of any new engine formula for it to remain interested.\nThen there is the micro level.\nWhy a V10? No major road-car manufacturer uses them any more.\nMercedes says a V8 would make more sense if a change was to be made, as at least they are still being developed for road use.\nAnd why abandon turbochargers, when many performance road cars - from Audi RS6s or Mercedes AMG C63s to McLaren and Ferrari hypercars - use them for very good reasons?\nCost? Yes, a V10 might be cheaper than a hybrid. But the manufacturers have already spent an estimated collective $400m on the new engines. They are not about to throw that away.\nAnd a new V10 would require developing, to the tune of hundreds of millions more.\nWeight? Yes, the hybrid engines make the cars heavier, largely because of the batteries needed. But the majority of the weight increase from 550kg or so in 2005 to about 800kg now is accounted for by advances in safety, such as the halo head-protection device.\nOn top of that, in 2013, cars started races with about 160kg of fuel. Now, it's about 100kg and it's expected to be about the same next year. Returning to naturally aspirated engines would mean a huge increase in fuel capacity - and weight.\nSustainability? The new fuels being introduced next year are not net-zero carbon. According to scientific standards, sustainable fuels reduce carbon emissions by a little above 80%.\nThat's a lot. But doubling the amount of fuel used by abandoning hybrid engines would mean a doubling of the carbon emissions produced by fuel.\nThe emissions from the cars themselves are minuscule in the big picture - F1's transport around the world is much more significant. Still, the symbolism matters.\nRed Bull boss Christian Horner and FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem are both said to be interested in a return to V10 engines\nIn F1, politics are always involved.\nIt has escaped the attention of few that Ben Sulayem's intervention came after the crowd at the O2 booed when the FIA logo was shown.\nThis is an election year at the FIA, and some believe Ben Sulayem may have raised the idea of V10s because he thinks it will be popular with certain demographics who support him.\nSo far, no candidate has put themselves forwards to oppose him, but there are whispers that there is a credible opponent in the wings.\nAt the same time, word is creeping out in F1 about the progress the various manufacturers are making with their 2026 engines. And it seems that Mercedes are leading the way.\nPeople are already beginning to say that a team will only win in 2026 if it has a Mercedes engine.\nOf course, there is no proof of this, but the whispers are emerging in exactly the same way as similar ones did in 2013 - and they were proved exactly right when the hybrid engines made their debut the following year.\nThe V10 proposal is seen by rival teams as very much a Horner-Ben Sulayem agenda, even if it is said to have some support from Ferrari.\nEven Horner, while saying that \"the concept of a V10 would be very exciting for the sport\" acknowledges that abandoning the rules would be \"a massive departure from what is being worked on very hard for 2026\".\nA U-turn for 2026 now would need support from the teams and manufacturers - and there is not a chance that enough of them would support that to get it through.\nA leading team boss told BBC Sport on condition of anonymity that there have been \"zero discussions\" of this idea in the group of F1 stakeholders.\nIt takes time - years - to agree engine rules.\nIt would probably be two years before a full agreement could be reached. Then the manufacturers would need the same time again to develop and build the engines. Which would take F1 to the end of 2029. Which is only a year before the new rules are due to expire anyway.\nAs one team boss puts it: \"I think this will all peter out, and it will just end up becoming: 'What will 2031 look like?'\"\nThe FIA says: \"There needs to be a consultation between all stakeholders to agree on a way forward, before we fully explore different scenarios.\n\"Whichever direction is chosen, we must support the teams and manufacturers in ensuring cost control on R&D expenditure and take account of environmental and sustainability considerations.\"\nAnd the chances of the end result being a naturally aspirated V10, in the context of all the above?

As a share of gross domestic product (GDP), private investment in India has been on the decline since the global financial crisis of 2007, even while the overall economy clocked world-beating growth rates.\nAfter a long hiatus, the investment rate picked up slightly in 2022 and 2023, but latest data from a leading ratings agency shows private sector expenditure as part of the overall investments in India's economy dipped again to a decadal low of 33% this financial year.\nAnalysis from Icra of 4,500 listed companies and 8,000 unlisted companies reveals that while the pace of investments made by listed players moderated, those by unlisted entities actually contracted.\nOver the years, several economists have raised similar concerns about a slowdown in private investments. \nBanking tycoon Uday Kotak is among many who've raised concerns recently about India's fading \"animal spirits\", urging young business owners who had inherited companies to build new businesses rather than sitting tight and managing their existing wealth.\nData from investment advisory firm Value Research shows Indian non-financial businesses were sitting on cash worth 11% of their total assets, corroborating the view that companies are not spending money in making fresh investments. \nSo why are Indian corporate houses choosing to do that?\nWeak domestic consumption in urban areas, muted export demand and an influx of cheap Chinese imports in some sectors were among the factors that \"restricted the capacity expansion plans of Indian corporate houses\", Icra's Chief Rating Officer K Ravichandran said in a note.\nBut beyond the more immediate reasons, private investment impulse has been low because of \"global uncertainties and overcapacity\", India's economic survey pointed out earlier this year.\nSlowing private investments have a direct bearing on India's growth prospects.\nInvestments by companies in assets such as factories, machinery or construction \u2013 also called gross fixed capital formation \u2013 make up around 30% of GDP and are its second largest contributor following private consumption.\nIndia's full-year GDP is expected to close at 6.5%, sharply lower compared to last year's 9.2%. Growth has flagged on account of slower consumption.\nWith all the key levers of growth, including exports, slowing down and US President Donald Trump's tariffs exacerbating global uncertainties, kick-starting private investment will be fundamental for India to hit its long-term growth targets, experts say.\nAccording to the World Bank's latest estimates, India will need to grow by 7.8% on average over the next 22 years to achieve its high-income status ambition by 2047.\nKey to this would be to increase private and public investment to at least 40% of GDP from 33% currently, the bank estimates.\nThe government on its part has significantly increased spending, especially on infrastructure. It also cut corporate tax rates from 30% to 22% and doled out billions of dollars in production-linked subsidies to manufacturers over the years. Availability of bank credit isn't a constraint any longer, and regulation has eased with regulatory restrictions halving between 2003 and 2020.\nBut none of this has prodded corporate India to boost spending.\nAccording to Sajjid Chinoy, JP Morgan India's Chief Economist, the big problem is the lack of demand in the economy to justify putting up additional capacities.\nIndia's post-pandemic recovery has been uneven, with the consumer class not expanding quickly enough. Demand for goods and services has thus been hit, with spending capacity further curtailed by a fall in wages, even though corporate profitability has soared to a 15-year high this year.\n\"Just because companies are financially strong doesn't mean they will automatically invest. Companies will only invest if they expect good returns,\" Chinoy said at an event in Mumbai earlier this year.\nRathin Roy, a former member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC), points to other deeper structural issues arresting investment appetite.\n\"Entrepreneurs have been lacking the energy to produce goods that might generate new demand. A classic example of this is construction - where there's unsold inventory in the urban areas, but an incapacity among builders to go into tier two and tier three towns and tap newer markets,\" Roy told the BBC.\nHe said he also agreed with Mr Kotak's views on the growing trend of business heirs turning wealth managers rather than building businesses ground up.\n\"Business houses discovered during Covid-19 that they don't need to do business to make money. They can just invest and multiply it without building anything new,\" said Roy. And these investments aren't just happening in the domestic stock market. \"A lot of money is just flowing out of India and chasing returns elsewhere,\" he added.\nBut things could be turning a corner, according to Icra.\nInterest rate cuts as well as a $12bn income tax relief provided to individuals in the federal budget \"augurs well for supporting domestic consumption demand\", according to the report.\nIndia's central bank also says more private companies have shown an intention to invest this year compared to last year, although how much of that intent results into actual money deployed remains to be seen. \nThe uncertainties related to global trade tariffs could delay any anticipated investment pick-up, according to Icra.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "The detention of South Sudan's First Vice-President Riek Machar has effectively collapsed the 2018 peace deal that ended the country's five-year civil war, his party has said. \nAn armed convoy led by top security officials, including the defence minister, entered Machar's residence in the capital, Juba, and disarmed his bodyguards late on Wednesday, said the Sudan People's Liberation Movement In Opposition (SPLM/IO). \nMachar was detained alongside his wife Angelina Teny, who is also the country's interior minister, the party added. \nThe US has urged the authorities to free Machar, while the UN, African Union and neighbouring countries have all expressed their concern.\n\nThe UN Mission in South Sudan, Unmiss, warned that the world's newest nation risked losing the \"hard-won gains of the past seven years\" if it returned to \"a state of war\". \n\"Tonight, the country's leaders stand on the brink of relapsing into widespread conflict,\" the mission said in a statement on Wednesday. \nThe government is yet to comment on Machar's reported house-arrest.\nBut addressing religious leaders on Wednesday, President Salva Kiir said \"he will never return the country to war\". \nTensions have been building between Machar and the president for several weeks. \nThe two leaders agreed in August 2018 to end the civil war between their forces that killed nearly 400,000 people. But over the last seven years their relationship has become increasingly strained amid ethnic tensions and sporadic violence.\nEarlier this week, the UN said that barrel bombs believed to contain a highly flammable liquid had been used in airstrikes during fighting between the army and a rebel group previously linked to Machar.\n\"The arrest and detention of H.E. Dr Riek Machar effectively brings the [peace] agreement to a collapse,\" SPLM/IO deputy leader Oyet Nathaniel Pierino told journalists on Thursday.\n\"The prospect for peace and stability in South Sudan has now been put into serious jeopardy,\" he added.\nA similar warning was issued by the UN mission in the country, which said the country's leaders \"stand on the brink of relapsing into widespread conflict\". \nThe situation has been exacerbated by the deployment of Ugandan troops and their battle tanks into South Sudan, following a request by the country's president, according to the UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan chair Yasmin Sooka.\nShe says this raises serious concerns over potential violations of the UN arms embargo and the growing partisan role of foreign forces, which further endangers civilians and risks regional escalation.\nTension remains high in Juba with a heavy military presence reported around Machar's home.\n\"The public are in a panic,\" civil society leader Edmund Yakani told the AFP news agency.\n\"There is a high chance of full-scale war but it will be more deadly and more violent because of [the need] for revenge,\" he added.\nPierino called on SPLM/IO members and the public to remain calm as diplomatic efforts continue to resolve the situation.\nThe BBC understands that the African Union and the regional body, Igad, are expected to send high-level delegations to Juba on Friday, to help curb the escalating crisis.\nReath Muoch Tang, chairman of the party's foreign relations committee, said Machar was under house-arrest, but that security officials initially tried to take him away.\n\"An arrest warrant was delivered to him under unclear charges,\" Tang said in a statement, calling the action a \"blatant violation of the constitution and the Revitalized Peace Agreement\".\nThe UN mission warned that violations of the 2018 peace deal \"will not only devastate South Sudan but also affect the entire region\". \nThe British and US embassies have scaled down their diplomatic staff and urged their citizens to leave the country while the Norwegian and German embassies have closed their operations in Juba. \nThe US has called on President Kiir to free his rival from the reported house-arrest, urging the two leaders to show commitment to peace.\n\"We urge President Kiir to reverse this action & prevent further escalation of the situation,\" the US Bureau of African Affairs wrote on X. \nThe escalating tensions come amid renewed clashes between forces loyal to the two rivals in the northern town of Nasir in the oil-rich Upper Nile State.\nAdditional reporting by Nichola Mandil in Juba\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

Who has the tougher run-in? What do the pundits and managers think?\nThere have been no signs of teething problems for Chelsea this season under new boss Bompastor, and the Blues' dominance of the league - established under predecessor Emma Hayes - has continued.\nUnbeaten in the WSL this season, Chelsea have won 47 points from a possible 51 and they are eight clear of closest challengers Arsenal and Manchester United.\nWith a maximum 15 points available from the remaining five games, the highest Arsenal and United could finish with is 54 points.\nThat means Chelsea could win the league, at the earliest, on 27 April when they take on United at Leigh Sports Village.\nThe Women's Champions League format is changing from 2025-26, with the number of teams earning direct qualification expanding from four teams to nine.\nThe winners of the WSL will directly qualify, along with the champions from the other five top-ranked national associations.\nThe runners-up of the two top-ranked associations will also be guaranteed direct qualification, along with the previous season's winners.\nThe WSL is currently ranked second, external, so as it stands the top two teams will automatically enter the 18-team league format, with the team in third going into the qualifying rounds.\nManchester City, who challenged Chelsea until the final day last season, are all-but out of the title race, while their chances of European football next season are hanging by a thread.\nThey sit seven points behind rivals United in third. Eight points from the remaining five games would be enough for United to pip their city rivals to European qualification.\nAfter winning the Championship last season, Crystal Palace have struggled to adapt during their first season in England's top division.\nThe club looked destined to go straight back down, but a 3-1 win over fellow strugglers Villa earlier this month has given Leif Smerud's side a fighting chance.\nVilla, billed to break into the top four just 18 months ago, have struggled since Carla Ward's departure and they sit one point above Palace in the danger zone.\n\"At the moment it's a concentration thing, it's mentality, it's fight. I don't even think it's about performance at the moment - it's about who wants to stay in the league the most,\" former Lionesses striker Ellen White said.\n\"You don't want to see anybody get relegated but this is just going to be phenomenal to watch these last five games.\"\nLeicester, meanwhile, will need to be cautious for the remainder of the season, but they will hope their six-point cushion is enough to see them through and need 10 points from their remaining five games to secure safety.\nMarc Skinner's Manchester United face three of the top four teams as they look to pile pressure on Chelsea and keep their Champions League place.\nThe Manchester derby on the penultimate day of the season could prove key in the race for Europe.\nThe fixture list has given City interim boss Nick Cushing cause for optimism.\n\"As the coach you have to analyse where we can potentially make up that ground,\" he said. \"It starts with us having to win. We have to be in distance with those [final] three games.\n\"We know the finish Manchester United have so there is an opportunity, in my opinion. Marc is doing an incredible job, but if we are in distance, we have to play them as well, there is an opportunity there.\"\nIt's a tough run-in for bottom-placed Crystal Palace, who will meet Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City before the season is over.\nVilla, meanwhile, only face one top-four side in their five remaining games, while they will have the added bonus of a home crowd for their last game at Villa Park.\nFormer Arsenal and Manchester City defender Jen Beattie said she is \"more worried\" for Palace than Villa.\n\"Based on who they're about to play, they're about to play the top teams higher up, whereas Aston Villa, I think they can get more out of their results,\" Beattie said.\nHowever, Palace manager Leif Smerud is confident his side can turn things around, despite a difficult fixture list.\n\"This is not a defeated group. This is not a team that's given up,\" he said.\n\"I think football is the biggest sport in the world because the underdog always has a chance.\"\nOpta's 'supercomputer' prediction model has Chelsea as nailed-on favourites to lift the WSL trophy, with the Blues projected as champions in 99.4% of simulations.\nArsenal, meanwhile, have been given a slither of hope, with Opta giving them a 0.5% chance of winning the title.\nManchester City's bid for European football does not look favourable either, with Cushing's side predicted to finish outside of the top three in 75.5% of simulations.\nAccording to Opta's predictions, Amandine Miquel's Leicester have all but confirmed their stay in the WSL for another season, with only a 0.5% chance of relegation.\nThe stats also favour Aston Villa and tell a worrying tale for Crystal Palace as they suggest the Eagles have a 76.8% chance of sitting bottom of the table on 10 May.",

Relegation and the race for Europe - what's to play for in WSL?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The WSL season ends on 10 MayPublished6 hours agoWith just five games of the Women's Super League season remaining, Chelsea are in the driving seat for a sixth successive title.The Blues, looking to win their first league title under Sonia Bompastor, find themselves eight points clear at the top.At the other end of the table, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa are locked in an intense relegation fight.Meanwhile, Manchester City face an uphill battle to claim the final Champions League spot.How are things shaping up for the remaining games? \"Leicester, meanwhile, will need to be cautious for the remainder of the season, but they will hope their six-point cushion is enough to see them through and need 10 points from their remaining five games to secure safety.What are the remaining fixtures?Marc Skinner's Manchester United face three of the top four teams as they look to pile pressure on Chelsea and keep their Champions League place.The Manchester derby on the penultimate day of the season could prove key in the race for Europe.The fixture list has given City interim boss Nick Cushing cause for optimism. \"It's a tough run-in for bottom-placed Crystal Palace, who will meet Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City before the season is over.Villa, meanwhile, only face one top-four side in their five remaining games, while they will have the added bonus of a home crowd for their last game at Villa Park.Former Arsenal and Manchester City defender Jen Beattie said she is \"more worried\" for Palace than Villa. Eight points from the remaining five games would be enough for United to pip their city rivals to European qualification.Who is at risk of relegation?After winning the Championship last season, Crystal Palace have struggled to adapt during their first season in England's top division.The club looked destined to go straight back down, but a 3-1 win over fellow strugglers Villa earlier this month has given Leif Smerud's side a fighting chance.Villa, billed to break into the top four just 18 months ago, have struggled since Carla Ward's departure and they sit one point above Palace in the danger zone.",

But fewer are aware of the Windscale fire.\nIt was one of the world's first - and remains the UK's worst - nuclear accident.\nA nuclear reactor at the site in Cumbria caught fire on 10 October 1957 and burned for three days, releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere.\nMany details of the event were kept quiet for decades, and it is far less famous than some of the more recent examples.\nBut a new video game has brought the disaster, and the area where it happened, back into the spotlight.\nAtomfall is the latest release from Oxford-based Rebellion, best known for its long-running Sniper Elite series.\nCEO Jason Kingsley tells BBC Newsbeat he was walking in the Lake District when the idea of using the real-life Windscale story \"as a trigger point for a fictionalised version of the disaster\" began to take shape.\nAtomfall is a survival action game set in the rolling green landscapes of the beauty spot, but on an alternative sci-fi inspired timeline where the area surrounding the plant has become a quarantine zone.\n\"It went pretty wrong in real life, but it was controlled,\" says Jason. \n\"It was a proper disaster, but it didn't cause strange glowing plants or mutants or dangerous cults to emerge.\"\nAlthough the Windscale fire was \"very serious\", Jason says it's not something that is especially well-remembered, even among locals.\nIt was previously estimated about 240 cases of thyroid cancer were caused by the radioactive leak, but more recent research has suggested this was unlikely.\nScientists suggested a decision to destroy all milk produced within 310 square miles (800 square km) of the site for a month after the fire helped to prevent exposure.\nWindscale was eventually renamed Sellafield and produced nuclear power until 2003. It still employs about 10,000 people in the local area.\nWhen Newsbeat visits Cumbria, most young people we speak to say they haven't heard of the disaster.\nAnd indie game developers Hannah Roberts and Harry Howson say that they became more aware of it once the game was announced.\nFor two people like them, who hope to break into the games industry, they're excited to see a game set in the place where they live.\nHannah, 26, says it's evident Atomfall's makers have done their research. \n\"The actual environments are spot on, they've got fantastic Morris dancing stuff going on - it really tickled me when I saw that,\" she says. \nHannah says other small details - like black and white Cumbrian signposts - were also pleasing to see.\nAtomfall's setting and its inspiration have made it an anticipated title since it was first revealed last year, and Harry, 23, says that's been encouraging for him. \n\"Seeing that such a small space like Cumbria can be taken by the games industry and built upon and people are receptive to that, it's exciting for the future and I look forward to seeing what's next for me,\" he says.\nIt's fairly unusual for high-profile games set in the UK to be set outside London. \nWhile indie games - such as the Shropshire-set Everybody's Gone to the Rapture and last year's Barnsley-based laughfest Thank Goodness You're Here! - have ventured further north, bigger games haven't tended to stray beyond the M25.\nJason says the US is about 40% of the video games market, so it's important to appeal to players there, and there's a \"natural tendency\" to follow the norms.\nBeing an independent company, he feels, allows Rebellion to do things differently, and Britain offers lots of inspiration for new settings - if you're prepared to look for them.\n\"The UK, I think, to understand certain aspects of our culture, you've got to dig into it a little bit because we tend to understate things quite a lot.\"\nRebellion's Head of Design Ben Fisher says the goal was to create a \"slightly theme parkish\" version of the Lake District with accurate details.\n\"There are things that, as locals, it's easy for us to forget are unique to Britain, that are unusual,\" he says.\nThe team that worked on the game has members from various countries, Ben says, which helped to highlight things the UK natives might have missed.\n\"The lead artist on the project is from Seattle and was mystified by dry stone walls,\"  says Ben.\nHe adds the team spent time recreating the structures - which are constructed without the use of mortar - to \"capture those local details\".\nFeaturing a local area in a film or TV show can expose a new audience to that place.\n\"Ultimately, what's incredibly rewarding about this industry is you can put your ideas down and they can be played by people across the globe,\" Jason says.\n\"And you know, how wonderful is it to sort of talk about the Lake District to people that live in Africa or Southeast Asia or Canada or wherever it might be. \n\"That's a kind of form of soft power that very few types of media have.\"\nOliver Hodgson, 21, can see Sellafield from his bedroom window.\nHe hopes that the local area will benefit from some of the soft power Jason describes.\n\"I think it's just an incredibly powerful thing for young people in west Cumbria,\" he says. \n\"I think it's really positive to see such a big gaming developer set a story in Cumbria, which is normally just known for its lakes and mountains,\" he says.\nOliver who runs his own PR firm, is working with the creators of a project to create a \u00a34m gaming hub in Whitehaven aimed at boosting digital skills in the area.\nOliver says he's glad the game has taken its inspiration from Windscale and is drawing attention to the area, as well as switching locals on to their history.\n\"I think we should own it,\u201d he says. \n\u201cThe story of the Windscale disaster obviously isn't a positive one but we can't rewrite history. \n\"So acknowledging what happened and teaching and letting young people learn about that history, if this is what brings it into the classroom or on to young people's phones or their social media, then so be it.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "article_text": "The White House reacted furiously on Wednesday after The Atlantic magazine published messages between national security officials in a Signal group chat in their entirety.\nPresident Donald Trump called the reporting \"all a witch hunt\" and declared the publication a \"failed magazine\".\nJeffrey Goldberg, the journalist who was inadvertently included in the chat among senior cabinet leaders, shared texts in which US defence secretary Pete Hegseth provided sensitive information such as detailed timetables and unit information ahead of a US strike in Yemen. \nGoldberg said he decided to publish the information after the Trump administration accused him of lying that classified information was shared.\nOfficials continued to maintain that position after the new messages were published.\nBut some senior officials began to acknowledge the episode was a mistake, including Trump himself.\nWhen asked by reporters who was to blame for allowing a journalist to view the Signal communications, Trump suggested his national security adviser.\n \"Mike Waltz, I guess he claimed responsibly,\" Trump said during an Oval Office press conference. \"I was told it was Mike.\"\nHe added that Waltz \"took responsibility\".\nTrump backed his Defence secretary, who posted a detailed run-down of the impending military operation to the group chat.\n\"Hegseth is doing a great job,\" Trump said. \"He had nothing to do with this.\"\nTrump also said that the Signal leak \"doesn't bother me\", but added the app \"isn't very good\". \nHe also referred to Mr Goldberg as a \"total sleazebag\".\nIn an interview with the BBC, Mr Goldberg said the Trump administration had sought to place the blame on a reporter rather than \"actually acknowledging that they have a massive national security breach, and that they should just go fix it\".\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who participated in the group chat, acknowledged during a visit to Jamaica on Wednesday that, \"Obviously, someone made a mistake....a big mistake, and added a journalist.\"\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, also a chat participant, told the House Intelligence Committee that an \"in-depth review\" would be conducted by the National Security Council to determine how the reporter was added.\nShe also acknowledged it was a mistake, even as she insisted the no classified information was shared. \nPresident Trump described the episode as \"not a big deal\", while National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who set up the group, said on Tuesday night that he took \"full responsibility\" for it.\nDemocrats meanwhile called for Hegseth to resign, saying that the information he shared inadvertently with a journalist could have risked American servicemembers' lives if they had been obtained by a US adversary.\nGoldberg shocked Washington earlier this week when he published an initial article recounting how he had found himself added to the chat group on Signal, an encrypted messaging app.\nAt the time he said he was holding back some details of messages he had seen because they contained classified information about US intelligence agents and military strikes targeting Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nWhile the White House quickly acknowledged the exchanges were real, senior officials including Hegseth sought to discredit the magazine editor.\nIn his new article published on Wednesday, Goldberg said he had decided to publish the messages discussing Yemen attack plans so that Americans could \"reach their own conclusions\". \n\"There is a clear public interest in disclosing the sort of information that Trump advisers included in non-secure communications channels, especially because senior administration figures are attempting to downplay the significance of the messages that were shared,\" Goldberg and co-author Shane Harris wrote on Wednesday. \nAt the White House news briefing, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt attacked Goldberg directly, accusing him of being an \"anti-Trump hater\"  and \"propagandists in the media\" of pushing a \"Signal hoax\". \n\"The real story here is the overwhelming success of decisive military action against Houthi terrorists,\" Leavitt continued\nThe messages released in full by the Atlantic include details of the US military's strike \"package\" for the Yemen strikes - a military term which refers to a set of aircraft or weapons systems that will participate in an operation. \nOther messages refer to damage assessments taken after the strike, as well as CIA operations in Yemen and anticipated Israeli strikes on the Houthis. \nHegseth continued to defend himself on Wednesday.\n\"They know it's not war plans,\" he told reporters in Hawaii. \"There's no units, no locations, no routes, no flight paths, no sources, no methods, no classified information.\" \nHegseth added that his job is to \"provide updates in real time\". \n\"That's what I did,\" he added. \nBut several military experts and veterans of the intelligence community said that the information was highly sensitive and should never have been shared in a commercial messaging app.\n\"War plans are generally the plan to conduct an entire conflict,\" Mick Mulroy, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence (DASD) for the Middle East and a retired CIA paramilitary officer, told the BBC. \"Attack plans stem from that and go down to the individual unit level\".\n\"Both are classified and highly sensitive,\" he added. \"One could actually make the argument that attack plans are more sensitive because they are more detailed and specific on time, place and manner\".

        "summary": "President Trump described the episode as \"not a big deal\", while National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who set up the group, said on Tuesday night that he took \"full responsibility\" for it.Democrats meanwhile called for Hegseth to resign, saying that the information he shared inadvertently with a journalist could have risked American servicemembers' lives if they had been obtained by a US adversary.Goldberg shocked Washington earlier this week when he published an initial article recounting how he had found himself added to the chat group on Signal, an encrypted messaging app.At the time he said he was holding back some details of messages he had seen because they contained classified information about US intelligence agents and military strikes targeting Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.While the White House quickly acknowledged the exchanges were real, senior officials including Hegseth sought to discredit the magazine editor.In his new article published on Wednesday, Goldberg said he had decided to publish the messages discussing Yemen attack plans so that Americans could \"reach their own conclusions\". The White House reacted furiously on Wednesday after The Atlantic magazine published messages between national security officials in a Signal group chat in their entirety.President Donald Trump called the reporting \"all a witch hunt\" and declared the publication a \"failed magazine\".Jeffrey Goldberg, the journalist who was inadvertently included in the chat among senior cabinet leaders, shared texts in which US defence secretary Pete Hegseth provided sensitive information such as detailed timetables and unit information ahead of a US strike in Yemen. Goldberg said he decided to publish the information after the Trump administration accused him of lying that classified information was shared.Officials continued to maintain that position after the new messages were published.But some senior officials began to acknowledge the episode was a mistake, including Trump himself.When asked by reporters who was to blame for allowing a journalist to view the Signal communications, Trump suggested his national security adviser. \"Trump also said that the Signal leak \"doesn't bother me\", but added the app \"isn't very good\". \"Both are classified and highly sensitive,\" he added.",

The one with the highest revenue, or the greatest social media following? The biggest stadium, or the best average league position? Or perhaps it's a happy medium of all those things.\nMost importantly, it's a debate nobody can win, one we all have a different take on and will all be offended by no matter how convincing someone's argument may be.\nTo bring the most unserious of serious topics to life, BBC Sport recently asked about 250 of its staff across the UK to take on the unanswerable question.\nThere were a lot of arguments. And a lot of unhappy people.\nBut at the end we averaged out the lists and came up with a top 10 below.\nAgree with it? Of course you don't.\nNo doubt many of you will feel enraged at where your club has ended up.

        "article_text": "The daring, radical Pompidou Centre was derided by many when its design was first unveiled \u2013 yet it has continued to influence the architecture of public buildings ever since. As the building approaches a major renovation, its co-creator Renzo Piano recalls the furore.\nThis summer, the Centre Pompidou will close for five years, as Paris's popular polychrome landmark undergoes changes necessitated by current requirements in terms of health, safety and energy efficiency. French studio Moreau Kusunoki Architects, Mexican practice Frida Escobedo Studio and French engineer AIA Life Designers will undertake a major overhaul of the six-storey arts centre, containing Europe's largest museum of modern art. Its renovation will add usable floor space, remove asbestos from all facades, improve fire safety and accessibility for people with reduced mobility, and optimise energy efficiency.\nAs far as possible, the original building will be conserved as it was before. To do otherwise might be considered cultural sacrilege \u2013 after all the Pompidou's identity is indivisible from its original architects, Renzo Piano, and the late Richard Rogers. The duo set up their practice, Rogers + Piano, in 1970, and submitted a design to a prestigious competition instigated in 1971 by Georges Pompidou, France\u2019s President from 1969 until 1974. Its jury was headed up by Jean Prouv\u00e9, a metalworker and self-taught architect, and included such stellar architects as Philip Johnson and Oscar Niemeyer. Piano and Rogers' design was chosen from 681 competition entries.\nThe result caught the duo, then unknowns in their 30s \"with Beatles haircuts\", as Piano puts it, by surprise: \"We didn't think we'd win, we entered the competition for pleasure,\" the Italian architect, now 87, tells the BBC. \"We never planned to create a revolutionary building. Our idea was a museum that would inspire curiosity, not intimidate people, and that would open up culture to all.\"\nIn fact, the duo's insouciance may help to explain the building's uninhibited boldness, flamboyance and ludic quality. Its structural elements and services were placed on its facades, allowing it to maximise its internal, open-plan spaces \u2013 and prompting the futuristic structure to be dubbed the world\u2019s first \"inside-out\" building. Its exoskeleton of tubes and periscope-like pipes were playfully colour-coded: blue for air-conditioning, yellow for electricity, green for water and red for pedestrian circulation. Visitors streamed up escalators \u2013 encased in transparent tubing affording panoramic views \u2013 that were designed to reinforce the museum's connection to the city.\n\"Our idea was for the building to take up only half the site, allowing for a welcoming outdoor place \u2013 a piazza \u2013 where people could meet,\" says Piano, whose other projects include the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco (rebuilt in 2008), the Shard (2012) in London, and the recently completed Paddington Square, also in the UK capital, a mixed-use building and public square. \"Our credo was a place for all people \u2013 for the poor and rich, the young and old.\"\nCulture Shifters\nCulture Shifters is an interview series in which high-profile creatives reflect on a work of theirs which made a big impact on the world. Read more articles from the series\u00a0here.\nThe Pompidou's transparency, accessibility and adjacent piazza chimed with new ideas about democratising culture. \"Street theatre and concerts in public spaces were rising in popularity at the time,\" says Piano.\nInside the building, visitors had access to the Biblioth\u00e8que Publique d'Information \u2013 Paris's first free public library \u2013 the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne and the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/ Musique (IRCAM), dedicated to research of music and sound.\u00a0\nPiano and Rogers' winning entry provoked consternation and fury when it was announced at a press conference: \"The room was packed,\" remembers Piano. \"Richard and I were standing in the middle of the room being heckled. We felt elated yet terrible at the same time,\" says the architect. \"Some people were shouting, 'Why have you designed something so horrible?' 'Why are you are destroying Paris's historic centre?'\"\nAlthough surprised to have won the contest, Genoa-born Piano grew up feeling architecture was his destiny \u2013 aged 18, he told his father he wanted to be an architect. However in conversation his manner is humble, not entitled. Born into a family of builders in Genoa, he loved watching his father's work take shape. Perhaps his childhood experience of seeing buildings materialise successfully made him feel that architecture is open to all possibilities. \"Building is a beautiful gesture,\" he once told The Financial Times. \"It's the opposite of destruction\u2026 especially when you are creating buildings for people because they are civically important.\"\u00a0In 1981, Piano founded the Renzo Piano Building Workshop (RPBW), with offices in Genoa and Paris, led today by 11 partners (in the spirit of a collective). In 1998, he won the Pritzker Architecture Prize. \u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The swinging 60s icon who revolutionised style\n\u2022 The star tidying guru who transformed our homes\n\u2022 How to transform your home with art\nThe Plateau Beaubourg in central Paris \u2013 a stretch of wasteland occupied by a car park \u2013 was the site chosen for the new Mus\u00e9e Nationale d'Art Moderne (formerly housed in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris's haut-bourgeois 16th arrondissement). \"It was a place waiting for something to happen,\" says Piano.\nFrance's social and political climate at the time, still rebellious following the tumultuous events of May 1968, was conducive to the creation of a building as disruptive as the Centre Pompidou, acknowledges Piano: \"In Britain, society was being revolutionised by [designer] Mary Quant and the Beatles. The same was happening in Paris.\" The Centre Pompidou was partly inspired by the ultra-pop architecture of experimental London-based architecture collective Archigram.\n\"The idea that France should have a 'Maison de la Culture', bringing together art, cinema, music and literature in cities was first invented by Andr\u00e9 Malraux [novelist, art theorist and France's first Minister of Cultural Affairs].\u00a0Pompidou was very supportive, too. I really believe that major shifts in architecture are only possible if you have a good client. George's wife, Claude, too, was an excellent lady.\"\nPompidou, like Claude, was passionate about contemporary art and design.\u00a0In 1972, they invited Pierre Paulin, a designer known for his space-age era furniture, to create new interiors for the private apartment of the Elys\u00e9e Palace, the French presidents' official residence. The results were radically modern \u2013\u00a0the walls of the living room, dining room and smoking room were lined to cocooning effect with wool and polyester panels that obscured the residence's neo-classical splendour. Walls were hung with paintings by Robert Delaunay and other modernist artists.\nOne impetus behind these efforts to provide Paris with a prestigious museum was that France had lost its reputation as the world's pre-eminent centre of avant-garde art. \"It is my passionate wish for Paris to have a cultural centre like the ones they've been creating in the US,\" Pompidou told Le Monde newspaper in 1972. \"It will be both a museum and centre of creation, where the visual arts take up residence with music, film, books and audiovisual research.\"\nRENZO PIANO'S FIVE CULTURE SHIFTERS\nJorge Luis Borges \u2013 The Aleph and Other Stories (1949)\n In particular the short story called Story of the Warrior and the Captive.\nFilippo Brunelleschi \u2013 The dome of Florence Cathedral (1420-1436)\nItalo Calvino \u2013 The Baron in the Trees\u00a0 (1957)\n I love this novel for its lightness of being.\nHal Ashby \u2013 Being There (1979) \n This film is extraordinary for the irony with which it explores such an important topic as politics, and the gardener's metaphors, which are interpreted as wise practical guidance.\nPontus Hult\u00e9n \u2013 The\u00a0Paris-Moscow exhibition at the Pompidou Centre (1979)\n Because it was an exhibition about two worlds that did not know each other, but shared the same artistic and expressive urgencies.\nInitially, reactions to the Centre Pompidou, frequently compared to an alien spaceship, were often extremely negative. \"Taxi drivers used to say to me: 'Regardez!' before launching into a tirade against the building. With so much hostility, I had to keep a low profile among strangers,\" says Piano. The building, derisively likened by many to an \"oil refinery\", was the target of countless lawsuits. \"We were sued so often \u2013 once on the grounds that Prouv\u00e9 wasn't a qualified architect,\" he recalls. The French press initially lambasted the building. \"Paris has its own monster, just like the one in Loch Ness,\" scoffed Le Figaro.\n\"One day Richard and I were outside the building, as yet unfinished. We saw a woman struggling with an umbrella that had turned inside out in the wind and Richard rushed over to help fix it. When he mentioned that he was one of the building's architects, she jokily mimicked hitting him with the umbrella as if to suggest he was a naughty scoundrel.\"\nYet after the building's opening in 1977, Parisians soon began to appreciate the museum \u2013 now one of Paris's most visited public institutions, that ranks behind only the Louvre and Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in terms of visitor numbers.\nIt also inspires architects today. \"The Centre Pompidou, radical on completion, has continued to influence the design of public buildings ever since,\" says Hugh Broughton, founder of London-based Hugh Broughton Architects, who finds qualities in it other than its famously high-tech idiom. \"It's an amazingly brave, generous building whose large public space promotes congregation, street theatre and the highest quality people-watching. Its core concept \u2013 open-plan floor plates supported by peripheral structure and services \u2013 draws upon medieval principles of castle structures, and combines this with an Arts and Crafts approach that makes a virtue of construction as an aesthetic medium. The result is a building which is dynamic, inviting, egalitarian, transparent and has awesome views \u2013 all the best attributes of great architecture. It changed the way a whole generation of architects think about buildings \u2013 placing their users at centre stage.\"\nPiano is also known for harnessing light in his projects to ethereal effect, as is the case with the Shard, which can seem to disappear in certain light conditions due to its glass skin. Architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff has said of his works as a whole: \"The serenity of Renzo Piano's best buildings can almost make you believe we live in a civilised world.\"\u00a0\nFor Piano, what is the main architectural legacy of the Pompidou Centre? \"The building is proof that culture doesn't suffer from being more public. It's a place where people gather primarily. It brings together art, life and culture \u2013 not culture with a big C but culture with a small c. When it opened, it brought culture to all, and made the city a better place for it.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Brazil were beaten 4-1 by Argentina in their most recent World Cup qualifier\nIn any previous World Cup, there would be genuine fear about Brazil failing to qualify. Not this time.\nIn an expanded competition, with six South American teams making it through automatically, Brazil have a six-point cushion over a Venezuela team who have just registered their first victory in 10 games.\nWith four rounds to go, it is impossible to see Brazil not making the cut. But that is hardly the point.\nFor Brazil, World Cup qualification now serves one purpose - it provides a sequence of competitive matches during which they hope to build a side capable of winning the trophy. And with just over a year to go until 2026, that looks a long way off.\nIt is easy to forget how good Brazil were in the last World Cup, where they lost in the quarter-finals on penalties to a Croatia team whose only shot on goal in the match took a cruel deflection.\nThe Qatar 2022 Brazil side were solid - goalkeeper Alisson could have taken a deckchair out for most of the games - with flashes of brilliance. They could have won that competition. \nSo why have they fallen back so much? How can a team packed with so many good players form such a dismal unit?\nThe team that were thrashed 4-1 by Argentina on Tuesday appeared to have no midfield, and were unable either to attack or defend.\nDorival Junior is under pressure following the heavy defeat by Argentina\nTuesday's prolonged humiliation did not come out of the blue. \nIn game after game the team have looked disjointed, without clear strategies for progressing the ball down the field, and suffering from the possibility of being both outplayed and outnumbered in central midfield. \nIndividual talent has papered over the cracks - like on Thursday, when a stoppage-time Vinicius Jr special gave them a victory over Colombia their play had not really deserved. \nBut it can't happen all the time.\nAnd if the film is bad, especially if the cast is impressive, the director must be to blame. \nThere is a crisis in Brazilian coaching. It is hard to produce coaches when there is no time to train and no job security. That is the reality of domestic Brazilian football, and helps explain why almost all of the successful coaches in the country are now foreign - either Argentine or, especially, Portuguese.\nThe national boss - for now anyway - Dorival Jr is a product of the domestic game, with more than four decades' experience as player and coach. \nBut on the international stage he comes across as a decent man thoroughly out of his depth.\nDid he really think he could travel to Argentina and play two men in central midfield? Why not drop deep and create space for the counter-attack, as he did a year ago against England at Wembley? And when cool heads were required, his team came across as a bag of nerves, all too willing to get involved in cheap spats.\nOf the three duties of the coach - pick the team, determine the strategy and set the emotional tone - Dorival failed dismally, and it is very hard to see how he can keep his job.\nIf he is to be replaced, there would seem to be two options. One is to go foreign - the Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus would be a strong candidate. The other would be to fast-track former Chelsea left-back Filipe Luis - a man of great intelligence who has made an impressive start to his coaching career with Rio giants Flamengo.\nWhoever comes in - or Dorival if he manages to hang on - will have to deal with a simple observation - central midfield is not an optional extra.\nIt is an area where Brazil have had a problem for a while - a consequence of the 1990s trend of splitting the middle of the park into a pair of midfielders who only defend and a duo who mostly attack. It was at this point Brazilian play lost much of its former fluency, instead investing in rapid breaks down the flanks.\nIt is in this context that the problems of Lucas Paqueta are so significant. \nThe West Ham midfielder was on the verge of becoming a big-money Manchester City signing when scandal struck, and his career - now threatened - has not recovered.\nThe evidence of Dorival's first games in charge - a year ago away to England and Spain - was Paqueta had become the most important player in the team, the man capable of filling space in midfield, dictating the rhythm of the game and unleashing the pace of the likes of Vinicius Jr.\nRonaldo quits Brazil federation presidency race\nAlisson returns to Liverpool after 'suspected concussion'\nThe absence of Paqueta almost certainly led to Dorival building his hopes for these international dates around the return of Neymar - which, predictably, turned out to be ludicrously premature.\nAfter so long out injured, it was only to be expected that Neymar would run into muscular problems, and he will need much more time on the field to ease his way back to a level where he can tip the balance.\nAt 33, he is an unknown quantity. But there is a gaping hole in the team for the type of deep-lying playmaker role he could fill. \nRomantics might recall 2002, when Ronaldo looked all washed up only to make a triumphant return from injury and carry a Brazil side that almost failed to qualify all the way to World Cup title number five. \nThey are still waiting for number six. \nIf they can do it next year then, in the wake of Tuesday's humiliation, it will be a candidate for one of football's great comebacks.\nNeymar's absence from the Brazil team was prolonged by a muscular injury",

Unfortunately, it's a system fault that we have in our network which mixes rainwater and wastewater. Nobody wants to see any spill of sewage in our waterways.\"\nEngland, like much of the world, has a combined sewage system meaning that rainwater and sewage share the same pipes. In some instances, when there is too much rain, treatment works can be overwhelmed, and sewage is spilled via overflow points into the country's rivers, lakes and seas to prevent a back up to the system.\nThis practice is legal. But previous investigations by the BBC and Environment Agency have revealed that sewage has also been spilled by water companies under dry conditions in breach of their permits.\nWater companies collectively oversee more than 15,000 of these overflow sites and this was the first year where all sites were monitored, revealing for the first time the extent of spilling.\nSewage was spilt for 3.614 million hours in 2024 compared to 3.606 million hours in 2023. \nCEO of River Action, James Wallace, said: \"A year on from last year's catastrophic pollution figures, the true scale of the UK's water crisis is only now coming to light. The figures have barely budged, testament to the deepening sewage scandal.\"\nIn 2022, Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical office for the UK, outlined the serious health risks sewage spills can pose for those using the country's waterways. Chief amongst them is bacteria from human faeces which he said can \"increase the risk of significant infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria\".\nSewage also poses significant environmental risks \u2013 it increases nutrients in the water leading to algal blooms which then eventually denies other wildlife \u2013 like fish - oxygen. These spills also have been shown to introduce microplastics, drugs and sanitary products into rivers and seas.\nThe River Ver in St Albans is one such location - the banks are littered with condoms, tampon applicators and wet wipes likely from sewage releases from nearby Markyate sewage treatment works owned by Thames Water. This rare chalk stream \u2013 one of around 200 worldwide \u2013 which supports important wildlife like water voles, saw more than 3,300 hours of spills in 2024.\nOf the spills a Thames Water spokesperson said: \"The Markyate area experienced one of the wettest years on record in 2024 which has caused excessive amounts of groundwater which has infiltrated into the network. This has resulted in the system being overwhelmed which has led to discharges into the river.\"\nLiberal Democrats Leader Ed Davey said the scale of spilling showed that the sector regulator, Ofwat, was not up to the task.\n\"This has to be the final nail in the coffin for Ofwat, a regulator that has time and again proven it is completely inadequate to protect customers and our beautiful environment,\" he said.\nIn October, the government launched an Independent Water Commission, chaired by former deputy Bank of England governor Sir Jon Cunliffe, to look into the sector - including the effectiveness of Ofwat.\nAn Ofwat spokesperson said: \"Where companies miss their targets, they will be penalised and money will be returned to customers. In parallel, companies will be held to account for past failures through our ongoing enforcement work into the operation and maintenance of sewage works and networks.\"\nThe Markyate site is one of a number across the country that is due an upgrade as part of a five-year \u00a3104bn investment programme by water companies \u2013 with \u00a324bn going specifically to improving infrastructure.\nThese upgrades will be paid largely through bill rises \u2013 which are due to take effect from 1 April \u2013 and will see the average annual bill hit \u00a3603. This has angered consumer groups and environmental charities who argue that the burden of upgrades should be carried by shareholders not households.\nProf Ewan McGaughey, Professor of Law at Kings College London, said: \"The water companies have paid over \u00a385bn out to shareholders since privatisation and that means they haven't been able to put the money into infrastructure.\"\nOfwat and the industry have previously denied the figure\u2013 which comes from University of Greenwich research \u2013 is as high, but there is agreement that significant investment is required.\nPhillip Clisham, specialist adviser to the Institution of Civil Engineers on water and sanitation, has worked in the industry for more than three decades, and said the challenge of fixing the issue has been \"underestimated\".\nHe said the two main solutions are building bigger storm tanks \u2013 which produce a huge amount of planet warming emissions in their construction \u2013 or to reduce excess rainwater by increasing green areas and the use of sustainable urban drainage systems.\nIt is this second solution that is preferable for the environment, he said, but it requires coordination between government, planning officers and housing developers \u2013 and takes longer to implement.\n\"A lot of this work is not as easy as it might seem from the outside in reality.\n\"I think it would be preferable for me to go a bit slower, get it right. But politically there's an awful lot of pressure to fix things now, and I do worry about the next 5 years,\" he said.\nAdditional reporting by Becky Dale, Rob England and Erwan Rivault",

But do we think they have got it right, no we don't.\"\nHe said the biggest sticking point is the 0.7 mile (1.1km) distance between the proposed drop-off point and the village's shops and attractions, particularly for older customers.\n\"We've got a higher-end age demographic, certainly when it comes to UK domestic coach passengers,\" he said.\n\"And for them to have a 15 to 20-minute walk, laden with shopping bags, with the British weather as unpredictable as it is, it just wouldn't work.\"\n\"They vote with their feet,\" he added. \"If there is any problems with walking distance or not having weatherproof facilities, they won't book that trip.\"\nMr Edwards, from South Wales, also runs his own coach tour business which offers tours to the Cotswolds. \n\"We dropped Bourton-on-the-Water completely,\" he said. \"We went to Stow-on-the-Wold and other areas around the Cotswolds.\n\"We wouldn't want to expose our customers to areas that aren't coach-friendly or welcoming.

Until there is a  solution that works for the customer and coach operators, we have made the decision not to return to Bourton-on-the-Water.\"\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Gloucestershire County Council said the trial will give coaches a \"dedicated area\" to drop off and pick up customers which is a \"short walk\" from the centre of the village.\n\"The parish council would welcome feedback on the scheme from residents, visitors and coach operators,\" they added.\n\"The county council will be able to make changes to the scheme during the trial to ensure the best possible results.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "President Volodymyr Zelensky was in a buoyant mood when I met him in Paris with a panel of three other European journalists. He had interrupted a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace and went back there for what he called a \"t\u00eate \u00e0 t\u00eate dinner\" after the interview. \nMacron had not just rolled out the red carpet for him. The Eiffel Tower, behind Zelensky in a picture window as we talked in one of Paris's great museums, was lit up in yellow and blue, the colours of the Ukrainian national flag.\nThe French wanted him to feel as if he was among friends. Zelensky had come to Paris to meet leaders and diplomats from 30 other countries who are working out what they can contribute to the \"coalition of the willing\", the group that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron are trying to organise to offer Ukraine security guarantees if there is a long-term ceasefire.\nZelensky's welcome in Paris was a clear contrast to the dressing down he was given by US President Donald Trump and his vice president JD Vance when he visited the White House last month. \nAfter their verbal attack, Zelensky was unceremoniously turfed out of the White House and not long afterwards Trump ordered the suspension of American military aid and intelligence to Ukraine.\nIt was restored after Zelensky, advised by the British, the French and other European allies, went out of his way to mend his fences with Trump and his administration. \nHe switched to the kind of flattering language Trump demands and agreed to an American plan for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.  He dropped his insistence on US security guarantees first, to underpin any ceasefire.\nBut even though US military and intelligence assistance is flowing, Trump's ruthless suspension of it, which cost Ukrainian lives, has left a deep sense of unease in Ukraine and among its European allies. \nThe evidence is piling up that Trump's United States is not a reliable ally. It is getting easier to sketch out scenarios in which it might not be an ally at all. \nMost European leaders still try to act publicly as if the 80-year-old alliance with the US is healthy. But the gathering of 30 countries in Paris shows they realise they can no longer rely on the benevolence of the United States. \nAmerican presidents going back to Dwight D. Eisenhower in the late 1950s have complained, with good reason, about Europeans getting a free ride from the US security blanket over Europe. Trump has finally pulled it away.\nDuring the interview, Zelensky praised the array of plans that are being formulated in western Europe \u2013 led by the UK, France and Germany \u2013 to spend more on defence. \nHe suggested that in three to five years, \"if everything goes as it is now\", Europe might even catch up with the United States. \nAt best, that is a highly optimistic estimate, less an accurate forecast and more a gesture of appreciation for European allies who unlike the Americans attach very few conditions and strings to support for Ukraine.\nEurope, Zelensky said, \"has discipline and no chaos\". That might be seen as an oblique and unflattering comparison with the twists and turns coming out of the Trump White House.\n\nI asked him about the conditions Russia's President Vladimir Putin has attached to the latest small step in the Trump peace initiative, which is a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea. \nAfter Ukraine and Russia held separate meetings with the Americans in Saudi Arabia, the Kremlin issued a statement that required concessions as Russia's price for a ceasefire. \nThe most significant demand was for a state-owned Russian bank to be readmitted to the Swift system for international payments. That would open a door back into mainstream global commerce for Russia. \nThat decision does not depend on Trump, as Swift is based in Belgium. \nThe European Union foreign affairs spokeswoman responded with a statement saying one of the \"main preconditions\" for lifting or amending sanctions on Russia was \"the end of the Russian unprovoked and unjustified aggression in Ukraine and the unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces from the entire territory of Ukraine\".\nEven Trump, reluctant to criticise Putin, suggested that Russia might be \"dragging its feet\" in the negotiations with the US. It reminded him of his own business career. \nHe told the US cable channel Newsmax that \"I've done it over the years\u2026 I don't want to sign a contract. I want to sort of stay in the game.\"\n\nI asked Zelensky where the push for a ceasefire stood, given Russia's demands. He called for a resolute response from the Americans.\n\"If America is going to stand strong and not bend to the conditions of the Russians - we stand on our land. \n\"We are defending it; we have shown our resilience to everyone\u2026 And now it's very important that our partners would be resilient and strong, at least at the minimum, as we are.\"\nI asked whether he believed the Americans would, as he put it, stay strong.\n\"I hope so. I hope so. God bless they will. But we'll see.\"\nZelensky has no choice about stating his faith in Trump's America, even though he must have grave doubts. \nTrump's decision to punish Ukraine by cutting off military intelligence about Russia missile launches had an immediate and deadly impact, and Zelensky had to work hard to get Trump to relent. He does not want it to happen again.\nHe was open about why he had to try to stay close to Trump, even as the US president seemed to be prioritising the restoration of relations with Moscow as he repeated Russian propaganda points, not least the lie that Ukraine started the war.\n\"We needed to unblock the aid from the US. For us, the exchange of intelligence is very important.\"\n\nThat did not stop Zelensky rebuking comments made by Steve Witkoff, Trump's super envoy, a real estate billionaire turned diplomat who deals with the Middle East as well as the Russian-Ukraine war. \nIn an interview last week with Tucker Carlson, a right-wing podcaster in the United States, Witkoff disparaged the drive by the UK's Starmer and France's Macron to create the \"coalition of the willing\" to support Ukraine. \nThe American said it was a posture and pose, \"a simplistic desire\" to sound like Winston Churchill. His words fit squarely into what seems now to be a settled view in the Trump Administration that their erstwhile allies in Europe are a parasitical burden on the United States. \nWhat if Witkoff was right? Strip away the insults and recognise that Europe's richest nations have chosen, for decades, to spend most of their considerable wealth on matters they consider more pressing than their militaries.\nZelensky said Witkoff and others in the Trump administration, had fallen for Russian propaganda.\n\"I think that Witkoff often quotes the Kremlin narratives\u2026 I can't be ungrateful to the Americans for everything they did, but they are often, unfortunately, under the influence of Russian narratives. And we cannot agree with these narratives.\"\nZelensky suggested that Witkoff was better at his old job, developing real estate in Manhattan.\n\"He doesn't look like a military man.

His goal, he said, was for his children to be able \"to walk down the street and not have to hide.\" And how did he think he'd be remembered; as the man who saved Ukraine, or tried to and failed? Zelensky grimaced slightly. Better, he said, than Putin, who was getting old and feared his own people.\n\"He will die soon. It is a fact. His reign could end before he finishes his historically insignificant and unsuccessful life. This is what he fears.\"\nZelensky laughed.\n\"And I will do everything I can to defend Ukraine as much as I can. And I am definitely younger than Putin.\"\nTrump might be hoping for a deal by Easter. Zelensky is still looking to the long haul.",

        "article_text": "F1 cars, such as Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari, use 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrid engines\nChristian Horner's phone rang. It was Bernie Ecclestone. Red Bull's team principal picked up, switched to speakerphone and placed it on the table in front of the assembled Formula 1 bosses.\nWe're in the F1 Commission, Horner told Ecclestone. Is there anything you want to say to the room?\nF1's former impresario, addressing the group that decides the sport's rules, said they should go back to V10 engines. Then he hung up.\nThat phone call - described to BBC Sport by several sources in the room at the time - took place in the morning of the day of F1's season launch at the O2 Arena in London in February, where both Horner and governing body the FIA were booed by the 15,000-strong crowd.\nTwo days later, FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem - a man whose three-year tenure has been beset by controversy - posted a message on Instagram.\nBen Sulayem said he \"looked forward\" to the new chassis and engine rules that are  to be introduced in 2026, but that the FIA \"must also lead the way on future technological motorsport trends.\n\"We should consider a range of directions, including the roaring sound of the V10 running on sustainable fuel.\"\nThese developments have kick-started a debate inside F1 about engines. The ground is shifting fast, so what's going on?\nNext year, F1 is going through the biggest regulation change in the sport's history, introducing new rules for both cars and engines.\nOn engines, F1 is sticking with 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids, the basic architecture that has been in place since 2014, but changing the balance between electric and combustion power.\nThe amount of total power provided by the hybrid is going up to about 50% from about 20% now. In addition, F1 is introducing sustainable fuels - abandoning fossil fuels in favour of synthetic fuel created from biomass and industrial processes.\nThis is all part of the sport's pledge to become net-zero carbon by 2030.\nThis video can not be played\nF1 in 10 Years: Lando Norris\nEver since hybrid engines were introduced in 2014, some have bemoaned the loss of the louder, more dramatic sound produced by the naturally aspirated engines that preceded them - especially the 3.0-litre V10s last raced in F1 in 2005.\nIn an unavoidable parallel with Ben Sulayem's actions now, Ecclestone was the first person to bring this up, even before the 2014 engines first raced.\nA certain romanticism about the V10 sound has sustained, as has the idea that those engines - with their ear-splitting shriek that could be heard some distance from the track - are more popular with the fanbase than the current hybrids.\nWithin F1, there is no question that some people agree. Lewis Hamilton said at the Chinese Grand Prix last weekend: \"It is no secret that the V6 has never sounded great.\n\"I remember the first time I came to an F1 race in 1996 in Spa and arriving and Michael (Schumacher) coming through Turn One and my rib cage just vibrated. I was so hooked. It was the most amazing thing I felt and heard.\n\"Over the years we've lost that. If we are able to move back to those amazing sounding engines and still able to see the sustainable goals, why not?\"\nFernando Alonso took his 2005 title-winning Renault R25 - with V10 engine - for a demonstration run on track before the 2020 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix\nIt's not that long since Ben Sulayem was trumpeting his involvement in the introduction of the 2026 engine rules.\nThese were fundamentally settled under the previous FIA president Jean Todt, but there was inevitable wrangling and it got over the line only after Ben Sulayem took office.\nTwo years ago, he said the new engines were \"at the forefront of technological innovation, making the future of F1 more sustainable while maintaining the spectacular racing\".\nSo why the U-turn?\nBen Sulayem has asked his F1 single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis to look into the matter.\nTombazis said that the advent of\u00a0sustainable fuels could allow F1 to make the engines simpler and cheaper.\n\"That's why the president made the comments about V10 engines in '28 - or '29 or whatever - and so on,\" Tombazis said. \"And that is something we are evaluating with the manufacturers.\"\nSenior figures within F1 and the car manufacturers involved in the sport see many problems with the FIA's position.\nOn a macro level, the climate crisis is very real, and the global road-car industry is heading in the direction of electrification - even if Donald Trump's election at the head of a government of climate deniers has given pause for thought in the US.\nManufacturers take part in F1 fundamentally for marketing reasons, and the sport has been made more appealing by the introduction of a budget cap for cars and engines.\nAudi, Ford and General Motors are all entering F1 in 2026 - and Honda are staying rather than withdrawing - specifically because of the new engine rules.\nAudi has already released a statement in response to the latest developments, saying that the new rules \"were a key factor in Audi's decision to enter Formula 1\".\nMercedes says it is open to discussions but would need a hybrid element to be part of any new engine formula for it to remain interested.\nThen there is the micro level.\nWhy a V10? No major road-car manufacturer uses them any more.\nMercedes says a V8 would make more sense if a change was to be made, as at least they are still being developed for road use.\nAnd why abandon turbochargers, when many performance road cars - from Audi RS6s or Mercedes AMG C63s to McLaren and Ferrari hypercars - use them for very good reasons?\nCost? Yes, a V10 might be cheaper than a hybrid. But the manufacturers have already spent an estimated collective $400m on the new engines. They are not about to throw that away.\nAnd a new V10 would require developing, to the tune of hundreds of millions more.\nWeight? Yes, the hybrid engines make the cars heavier, largely because of the batteries needed. But the majority of the weight increase from 550kg or so in 2005 to about 800kg now is accounted for by advances in safety, such as the halo head-protection device.\nOn top of that, in 2013, cars started races with about 160kg of fuel. Now, it's about 100kg and it's expected to be about the same next year. Returning to naturally aspirated engines would mean a huge increase in fuel capacity - and weight.\nSustainability? The new fuels being introduced next year are not net-zero carbon. According to scientific standards, sustainable fuels reduce carbon emissions by a little above 80%.\nThat's a lot. But doubling the amount of fuel used by abandoning hybrid engines would mean a doubling of the carbon emissions produced by fuel.\nThe emissions from the cars themselves are minuscule in the big picture - F1's transport around the world is much more significant. Still, the symbolism matters.\nRed Bull boss Christian Horner and FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem are both said to be interested in a return to V10 engines\nIn F1, politics are always involved.\nIt has escaped the attention of few that Ben Sulayem's intervention came after the crowd at the O2 booed when the FIA logo was shown.\nThis is an election year at the FIA, and some believe Ben Sulayem may have raised the idea of V10s because he thinks it will be popular with certain demographics who support him.\nSo far, no candidate has put themselves forwards to oppose him, but there are whispers that there is a credible opponent in the wings.\nAt the same time, word is creeping out in F1 about the progress the various manufacturers are making with their 2026 engines. And it seems that Mercedes are leading the way.\nPeople are already beginning to say that a team will only win in 2026 if it has a Mercedes engine.\nOf course, there is no proof of this, but the whispers are emerging in exactly the same way as similar ones did in 2013 - and they were proved exactly right when the hybrid engines made their debut the following year.\nThe V10 proposal is seen by rival teams as very much a Horner-Ben Sulayem agenda, even if it is said to have some support from Ferrari.\nEven Horner, while saying that \"the concept of a V10 would be very exciting for the sport\" acknowledges that abandoning the rules would be \"a massive departure from what is being worked on very hard for 2026\".\nA U-turn for 2026 now would need support from the teams and manufacturers - and there is not a chance that enough of them would support that to get it through.\nA leading team boss told BBC Sport on condition of anonymity that there have been \"zero discussions\" of this idea in the group of F1 stakeholders.\nIt takes time - years - to agree engine rules.\nIt would probably be two years before a full agreement could be reached. Then the manufacturers would need the same time again to develop and build the engines. Which would take F1 to the end of 2029. Which is only a year before the new rules are due to expire anyway.\nAs one team boss puts it: \"I think this will all peter out, and it will just end up becoming: 'What will 2031 look like?'\"\nThe FIA says: \"There needs to be a consultation between all stakeholders to agree on a way forward, before we fully explore different scenarios.\n\"Whichever direction is chosen, we must support the teams and manufacturers in ensuring cost control on R&D expenditure and take account of environmental and sustainability considerations.\"\nAnd the chances of the end result being a naturally aspirated V10, in the context of all the above?

        "article_text": "We have all heard of carmaker Ford, but what about its one-time rivals Abbot-Detroit, Acme, Adams and Aerocar?\nNo? Well that is hardly surprising because unlike Ford they all went bust very early on. And they are just some of the failed car companies starting with the letter \"A\".\nWe only remember the winners who went on to dominate the world's motor industry, and the current high-tech sector is much the same.\nA great many investors backed the wrong horseless carriages around a century ago and lost their money. Only a few picked Ford or Chrysler, which is almost exactly what is happening now, only to the tech sector.\nTech shares have been hugely volatile over the past year, as has been widely reported, with share price graphs often looking like rollercoaster rides, even before President Trump's tariffs have caused wider stocks falls.\nA principle reason for this tech sector volatility, according to Elroy Dimson, professor of finance at the University of Cambridge, is that like the once nascent car industry we don't know which tech firms will win in the long run.\n\"If you go back to the beginning of the last century there were an awful lot of motor companies, and it was clear that automobiles were going to make a huge difference,\" says Prof Dimson. \"But almost every company went bankrupt, you didn't know which company you should be buying.\"\nThen, of course, not all high-tech businesses are making money. The measure of the return on an investment in shares uses two factors, the growth in profits or dividends, and the growth in the value of the shares.\nBoring companies might pay reliable dividends and see their shares gradually increase in value. But many high-tech companies are not paying out much if anything in dividends. Instead, they are investing in future growth, and so their share prices fluctuate based on hopes of future profits.\nAs Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at UK financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, puts it: \"Tech shares are more volatile, they have high valuations and their price-earnings ratios are very high, and growth stocks are more sensitive to interest rate movements.\"\nBut also, investors in such shares are, as Ms Streeter puts it, gambling on \"not jam today but jam tomorrow\". They are all trying to pick the next future big winner, not the one paying out profits now, but the one that will eventually pay huge dividends sometime in the future.\nSo, any news or even suggestion that future growth is not going to be as good as previously expected means share values can collapse.\nOn the other hand, any good news boosts share prices even if current profits, or even losses, don't change at all, as investors pile into what they think is the future winner. The shares are more volatile because they are not underwritten by current profits or dividends.\nThat means as Prof Dimson puts it, \"that small changes in growth expectation can lead to large changes in share value\", which can effect a large number of companies at the same time.\n\"You have companies that are reasonably similar, so when growth rates change it is effecting quite a few companies in a similar way,\" he says.\n\"This is not different from the dotcom boom at the beginning of the 2000s. There were companies with huge growth prospects. And when the growth prospects disappeared, these were the companies that disappeared.\"\nAlso, even today there are not that many really large high-tech companies. In America they are colloquially known as the \"magnificent seven\" - Nvidia, a chipmaker, Alphabet, which owns Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, the parent of Facebook, and Tesla.\nSo, it does not take much to spook the market, especially since several of these firms are really quite young, and are dominant in sectors where previous leaders have crashed and burned. Anyone remember Ericsson, Boo or Compaq?\nTechnology, unlike say steel production or food manufacturing, is changing at a very rapid rate, and there is obviously the chance that a new high-tech company will come along and destroy the business model of its most established rivals.\nThere is simply no guarantee that today's \"magnificent seven\" will remain magnificent or even stay as the same seven firms.\nTake Tesla for example, its sales have recently fallen in response to two widely-reported factors. Firstly, some potential customers are opposed to Tesla owner Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's government. And secondly, Chinese electric car firms such as BYD are increasingly strong competitors.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia saw its share price drop sharply at the start of this year following the release of Chinese artificial intelligence chatbot DeepSeek.  This app was reportedly created at a fraction of the cost of its rivals.\nThe instant popularity of DeepSeek has raised questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning. This concerns Nvidia because it is at the forefront of making microchips for AI processing.\nAI is now the biggest tech game in town, and it seems that absolutely everyone is claiming that AI is transforming their industry, their products and their profits. They can't all be right.\nOr as Prof Dimon puts it: \"At least in 1910 you knew what automobiles did, but today with AI companies you have to rely on the wisdom of the crowd, and for AI companies that isn't good enough.\"\nAnd not all AI firms can win, adds Robert Whaley, professor of finance at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. \"AI is certainly contributing to tech volatility. The race is on.\"\nThat means that AI shares are sensitive to predictions. And any sign that a particular firm is lagging in the AI race may mean that lots of investors, most of whom don't understand the subject, abandon it for another that seems to be further ahead.\nThen there are investors who seemingly don't seem to care which companies' shares they buy, so long as they are in the \"booming\" high-tech sector, as they are speculating and spreading their risks.\nIn short, share prices are not always a rational measure of a firm's value, especially in the high-tech sector, or even of its prospects. Instead, they can represent the optimism of investors. And optimism does not always last.\nIt is often short-lived, passing, and faddish. And sometimes optimism comes face to face with reality or just plain fades away. It is, in short, volatile.",

And any sign that a particular firm is lagging in the AI race may mean that lots of investors, most of whom don't understand the subject, abandon it for another that seems to be further ahead.Then there are investors who seemingly don't seem to care which companies' shares they buy, so long as they are in the \"booming\" high-tech sector, as they are speculating and spreading their risks.In short, share prices are not always a rational measure of a firm's value, especially in the high-tech sector, or even of its prospects. There were companies with huge growth prospects. They are all trying to pick the next future big winner, not the one paying out profits now, but the one that will eventually pay huge dividends sometime in the future.So, any news or even suggestion that future growth is not going to be as good as previously expected means share values can collapse.Susannah StreeterSusannah Streeter says that tech stocks are always a gamble for investorsOn the other hand, any good news boosts share prices even if current profits, or even losses, don't change at all, as investors pile into what they think is the future winner. The shares are more volatile because they are not underwritten by current profits or dividends.That means as Prof Dimson puts it, \"that small changes in growth expectation can lead to large changes in share value\", which can effect a large number of companies at the same time.",

I'm very happy with the result and we're going into the semi-finals.\"\nAlessia Russo was the star on a magical night at Emirates Stadium as she scored twice and had a further two goals ruled out for offside.\nEngland team-mate Chloe Kelly grabbed two assists, with Spain forward Mariona Caldentey joining Russo on the scoresheet during a ruthless second-half display which saw the Gunners score three times in 13 minutes.\nIt was only the second time a club has overturned a two-goal first-leg deficit in the quarter-finals of the competition, with Arsenal having done so against Torres in 2004, losing 2-0 away before a 4-1 home success.\n\"Without a doubt, that Arsenal team ran all over Real Madrid,\" said former England captain Steph Houghton on BBC Radio 5 Live. \n\"In those 13 minutes, where they scored three goals, they were absolutely relentless and that's what you have to be at this level. They were outstanding.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page\nOnly Lyon have scored more goals in the Women's Champions League this season\nFans were on their feet at full-time, singing and waving scarves as the players walked around the pitch receiving their deserved plaudits.\nIt had been a complete performance from the Gunners - a total turnaround from their placid display in Spain a week before when they lost 2-0.\nThey pressed with intensity, tested Real Madrid's defence with Kelly's teasing balls and could rely on Russo's sharpness in front of goal. \n\"It was electric - a masterful gameplan from Renee Slegers and well executed by the Arsenal players,\" said ex-England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley on 5 Live. \"They had to go for it.\n\"They had so many opportunities in the first half and managed to capitalise in the second half and that's what counts. Real Madrid had nothing left.\"\nArsenal have had their fair share of success stories at Emirates Stadium. But in a rollercoaster campaign, this was a wonderful high, and a result that will stand out as they booked an eighth semi-final appearance in the competition. \nSlegers' first victory in charge as interim manager, a day after Eidevall resigned, was in this competition when Arsenal overcame Valerenga 4-1. \nIt felt a stretch then to consider them as European semi-finalists but now, having booked their spot in the last four, Slegers admitted this was \"probably the clearest\" example of their character to fight back.\n\"We have done really good things before, coming back from setbacks and good performances against top teams,\" she added. \n\"But this is definitely one of the clearest ones where you play an opponent away, the game looks like it does, the result is what it is, then you have to put this performance and result in.\"\nThis video can not be played\nI have massive belief in our team - Russo\nHaving come so close to a first Arsenal hat-trick, Russo could have been forgiven for feeling frustrated at full-time.\nTwo video assistant referee (VAR) interventions meant she had two goals chalked off for offside, either side of a wasted opportunity when one-on-one with visiting goalkeeper Misa Rodriguez.\nBut the England forward celebrated at the final whistle and said the thought of being in the last four had \"not sunk in yet\".\n\"It was just amazing - the result, the fans, playing at the Emirates... it just doesn't get old,\" Russo told BBC Sport.\n\"When we went to Madrid we were disappointed, but we knew we had the belief and we knew what we needed to do. There was disappointment and it turned into fire quite quickly.\"\nHer contribution, alongside that of team-mate Kelly, played a key role in Arsenal's courageous comeback and Houghton said it showed Russo's \"maturity\".\nShe is now the joint-top scorer in the Champions League with six goals and has 17 in all competitions for her best goalscoring season to date.\n\"She got a lot of criticism at the beginning of the season and was probably doing too much work for the team - not being selfish enough as a striker,\" added Houghton.\n\"She showed a real maturity about her display [against Real Madrid]. Almost everything she touched went in the back of the net. \n\"She's got the goals that have sent Arsenal into a semi-final of the Champions League.\"\nAlessia Russo is the joint-top goalscorer in the Women's Champions League this season with six goals - level with Pernille Harder",

Secretary of State Rubio has defended revoking student visas for those who \"cause chaos\" on college campuses.\nUS-South Africa relations have deteriorated sharply since Trump returned to power in mid-January. \nSince taking office, Trump and his ally, South-Africa born Elon Musk, have singled out South Africa for special criticism, in particular over its land reform policies.\nTrump has cut all aid to the country, and despite his hard-line stance on most refugees and asylum seekers he says that members of South Africa's white, Afrikaner community would be granted refugee status in the US, because of the persecution he said they faced at home. \nSouth Africa's government says it is trying to correct the country's racial and economic imbalances following decades of white-minority rule, by passing measures to help the country's black majority.\nRasool denied that the Afrikaner population was facing discrimination.\n\"It is an unadulterated lie because it tries to besmirch the very DNA of a new South Africa that was born under the leadership of someone like Nelson Mandela,\" he told the BBC World Service in one of his first interviews since arriving back in South Africa.\nWhen questioned whether his language was undiplomatic, Mr Rasool said: \"It's not as if being a good boy warded off any punishment. It was that at some point South Africa's dignity is also at stake \u2013 you can't smile through too many untruths being told about your country.\"\nAfter returning home to a hero's welcome on Sunday, Rasool said he had no regrets about his remarks. \nAsked by the BBC on Friday whether he was surprised by the reaction to his utterances, Rasool said the surprise for him was the \"thinness of the skin\" of the US administration and its \"ability to dish out and not to accept an intellectual dissecting of what is [said]\".\n\"We've smiled through a lie about white genocide, we've smiled through the punishment of cutting all aid... we've smiled through all of that. \n\"We've tried all the conventional ways to get [to] them until you hit a brick wall and you begin to say: This is not the normal phenomenon of diplomacy.\"\nWhile he accepted that his role as a diplomat was to try and \"maintain a line of communication\" and integrity, Rasool said: \"Diplomacy is not to flatter your host into into liking you. Diplomacy is not lying along and making as if lies are truth. \n\"I think what I did was to the best of my intellectual capacity to describe a phenomenon back home in order for me to alert them that it cannot be business as usual.\"\nRelations between the US and South African, characterised by ups and downs over the years, hit rock bottom earlier this year when Trump cut aid to the country citing the new Expropriation Law, which allows the government to confiscate land without compensation in certain circumstances.\nAnother bone of contention for the US has been the case lodged by South Africa against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in December 2023.\nSouth Africa has accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians living in Gaza, an allegation Israel denies.\nRasool returned to the US last year after having previously served as US ambassador from 2010 to 2015, when Barack Obama was president.\n\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "A professor has published details of a rare \"inside-out, legless, headless wonder\" fossil from 444 million years ago, which belonged to a previously undiscovered species.\nProf Sarah Gabbott has been studying the arthropod fossil for 25 years after she found it in a small quarry in South Africa. \nHer findings, published on Thursday, reveal the discovery is very rare, as most fossils are of an animal's external features, whereas the internal organs are preserved in this case. \nProf Gabbott uncovered the fossil, which she has named Sue after her mother, at the start of her career. She had hoped to find another example in the years which followed, but had no joy. \nThe University of Leicester academic said she had decided to finally make her findings public after her mum said if she intended to name the fossil after her, she ought to \"get on and do it before she becomes a fossil herself\".\nSue was found in the Soom Shale, a band of silt and clay at a location 250 miles north of Cape Town, which was laid on the seafloor more than 440 million years ago after a devastating glaciation had wiped out about 85% of Earth's species.\nIt is believed the marine basin where the arthropod swam was somehow protected from the worst of the freezing conditions. \nThe sediments where Sue came to rest were also toxic, with no oxygen and hydrogen sulphide dissolved in the water, which the researchers suspect might have led to her unusual inside-out preservation.\nIt is, however, difficult to compare her to other fossils from the same era due to the unique way Sue was preserved. \nProf Gabbott, who is based at the university's school of geography, geology and the environment, added: \"Sue is an inside-out, legless, headless wonder. \n\"Remarkably her insides are a mineralised time-capsule: muscles, sinews, tendons and even guts all preserved in unimaginable detail. \n\"And yet her durable carapace, legs and head are missing \u2013 lost to decay over 440 million years ago.\n\"We are now sure she was a primitive marine arthropod but her precise evolutionary relationships remain frustratingly elusive.\"\nThe small quarry where the fossil was found has now virtually disappeared, which means another example is unlikely to be discovered. \nProf Gabbott said: \"This has been an ultramarathon of a research effort. In a large part because this fossil is just so beautifully preserved, there's so much anatomy there that needs interpreting. Layer upon layer of exquisite detail and complexity. \n\"I'd always hoped to find new specimens but it seems after 25 years of searching, this fossil is vanishingly rare \u2013 so I can hang on no longer. \n\"Recently my mum said to me, 'Sarah, if you are going to name this fossil after me, you'd better get on and do it before I am in the ground and fossilised myself'.\n\"I tell my mum in jest that I named the fossil Sue after her because she is a well-preserved specimen.\n\"But, in truth, I named her Sue because my mum always said I should follow a career that makes me happy \u2013 whatever that may be. \n\"For me, that is digging rocks, finding fossils and then trying to figure out how they lived and what they tell us about ancient life and evolution on Earth.\"\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

        "article_text": "From the Yorkshire Moors in England to the South African wilderness, star bathing is emerging as a transformative wellness trend \u2013 offering awe, calm and a cosmic reset.\nI lie in an empty Victorian bathtub on heather moorland in the Yorkshire Moors in England's north. Above me, more and more stars appear as the sky slowly darkens from blue to violet to navy. Beside me, in her own bathtub, my star-bathing guide Gemma leads a meditation.\n\"Allow yourself to be awed by the incredible sky view that you're witnessing,\" she says softly. \"Appreciate that we are here, right now, on this beautiful evening. Focus gently on the sky\u2026 and your breath. Just be.\"\u00a0\nI feel cold and self-conscious. I am trying to suspend the part of me that is deeply sceptical because I desperately want an escape from the anxiety that has plagued the past three years of my life. A search for relief has led me to wild swimming, drumming, yoga and now to star-bathing \u2013 an emerging wellness practice that is being offered in hotels and retreats around the world.\nStar bathing is not about identifying constellations, it's about losing yourself in the night sky; and a growing body of research suggests that it can help calm the nervous system, increase happiness and foster a sense of perspective.\nSo here I am, wrapped in blankets, on a weekend of stargazing run by Broughton Sanctuary, a 16th-Century historic house and collection of cottages located at the foothills of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, a designated International Dark Sky Reserve. There is a strong focus on the healing power of nature here \u2013 the 3,000-acre grounds are home to one of the UK's largest rewilding projects \u2013 and star bathing is just one of many activities designed to bring guests closer to the natural world.\nThe meditation ends and silence falls on the moors, broken by the distant hoot of an owl. I look up, trying not to think about the stressful week I've had. As the sky continues to darken, new stars appear as though by magic. My breathing slows. Suddenly I feel something shift. I realise that I am not just looking up at the universe, I am part of the universe. It is impossible not to feel awed by the vastness and beauty of the night sky above me.\nThe psychological benefits of experiencing awe are well documented \u2013 it has been proven to lower heart rate, increase the presence of oxytocin and reduce inflammation \u2013 and it's one of the reasons that stargazing is so good for our mental health.\n\"Experiencing awe regularly is deeply beneficial for our mental wellbeing because it helps us to feel connected to something bigger than ourselves,\" says Mark Westmoquette, an astrophysicist and yoga and meditation teacher who runs mindful stargazing retreats across the UK and Europe. \"As we look up at the night sky and become aware of our place within it, that sense of wonder and awe can really shift our perspective around who and what we are.\"\nWhile the mental health benefits of being in nature are well documented, it's only recently that researchers have begun to study the effects of being in a nocturnal natural environment.\nIn February 2024, a new Night Sky Connectedness Index was published in the\u00a0Journal of Environmental Psychology. It showed that a greater connection to the night sky is positively related to a person's mental health and happiness. The Office of Astronomy for Development, a joint project of the International Astronomical Union and the South African National Research Foundation, is currently researching the potential of using astronomy as a tool to improve vulnerable people's mental wellbeing, with encouraging results.\nAt the end of our star-bathing session, Gemma, me and the other two participants drink hot chocolate and then make our way down the hillside. We can't take our eyes off the sky, which becomes more and more dazzling the longer we look at it.\nWell World\nBBC Travel's\u00a0Well World is a global take on wellness that explores different ways that cultures the world over strive for a healthy lifestyle.\nThe following night, after a day spent exploring the grounds, relaxing in the spa and wild swimming in a freezing cold former reservoir on the estate, I take part in a stargazing session that is part of the annual Dark Skies Festival. After eating a two-course vegetarian meal around a bonfire in the \"fire temple\" \u2013 a sheltered wooden structure set in pretty woodland \u2013 a group of about 20 of us walk to Broughton's kitchen garden where astronomer Chris Higgins is waiting with a powerful telescope.\nHiggins talks us through various constellations and planets, and we take it in turns to look at them through the telescope. I am awestruck by the sight of Venus, which appears like a crescent moon, as well Jupiter with its four moons and its light and dark bands.\nThe group bonds quickly \u2013 our natural reserve seems to disappear as we ooh and aah at the cosmos. It's a freezing night, but no one wants to go inside. It feels like a gift \u2013 this clear, beautiful night \u2013 and we can't stop staring at the sky. After a while, I let go of trying to understand the science and just gaze up, letting the cool light of the stars calm me. I love the idea that while almost everything on our planet has changed since the beginning of humanity, the beauty of the night sky has remained the same. I am staring up at the same view my ancestors marvelled at, and there is something deeply grounding about that.\nI am hooked. When I return home, I start searching for star-bathing retreats. At the top of my wish-list is luxury off-grid retreat centre Bliss & Stars, located two hours from the nearest village in South Africa's Cederberg Wilderness Area. Launched in 2019 by Daria and Heine Rasmussen, it offers three-night star-bathing retreats, featuring guided stargazing sessions, nature immersion, mindfulness, breathwork under the stars and night hikes.\u00a0\nDaria tells me that many visitors have profound experiences gazing at the night sky. \"One guest, numbed by years of trauma, experienced a breakthrough while observing Saturn's rings, describing it as 'awe as exorcism' that rebooted his capacity for joy,\" she says. \"Another guest, a grieving mother, found solace in our wilderness night ventures and naked-eye stargazing, saying: 'It felt like the universe was mourning with me.'\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The seven travel trends that will shape 2025\n\u2022\u00a0Five extraordinary night-time experiences around the world\n\u2022\u00a0Swede dreams: How Sweden is embracing its sleepy side\u00a0\u00a0\nAlso high on my bucket list is Chile's Atacama Desert, which features the world's darkest, clearest skies. Elqui Domos Hotel has been designed specifically for appreciating these pristine night skies \u2013 it features geodesic rooms with retractable roofs to allow guests to look straight up from their bed. Hotel Ranga in Iceland, meanwhile, features a state-of-the-art observatory, and offers the chance to take part in mindful stargazing from outdoor hot tubs fed by geothermally heated water.\nIn the Scottish Highlands, Cairngorm Excursions runs star-bathing parties, bringing people together for a night of stargazing far from any light pollution, with hot drinks, traditional stovies (a Scottish dish made from meat and potatoes), blankets and log seating. This being Scotland, the evenings also feature a gin, whisky and rum sampling experience put on by a local distillery.\nAboriginal Australians are thought to be the world's first astronomers, and a growing number of experiences offer visitors a chance to learn about Indigenous astronomy. Aboriginal-owned Ngurrangga Tours offers an overnight trip in Western Australia's Millstream Chichester National Park with an evening of camping, exploring the wilderness and learning about Indigenous star stories. In Sydney, Fantasea Cruising offers an Aboriginal Sky Dreaming Cruise on the harbour, with an Aboriginal astronomer sharing stories of the Sun, Moon and stars that have been passed down by ancestors.\u00a0\nFor now, I go out into my Bristol garden on clear nights and lie down on a blanket. The sky is nowhere near as dark as it was in Yorkshire, and light pollution obscures many of the stars, but I find that I can still slip into that now familiar sense of peace.\nPerhaps it doesn't matter how many stars I can see. As Westmoquette says: \"Even if you can only see one star \u2013 that light's been travelling across the universe for hundreds and hundreds of years to hit your eyeball at that precise moment. Against all the odds, you're seeing that ray of light. That means something.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "summary": "It is impossible not to feel awed by the vastness and beauty of the night sky above me.Experiencing awe regularly is deeply beneficial for our mental wellbeing because it helps us to feel connected to something bigger than ourselves \u2013 Mark WestmoquetteThe psychological benefits of experiencing awe are well documented \u2013 it has been proven to lower heart rate, increase the presence of oxytocin and reduce inflammation \u2013 and it's one of the reasons that stargazing is so good for our mental health. \"Experiencing awe regularly is deeply beneficial for our mental wellbeing because it helps us to feel connected to something bigger than ourselves,\" says Mark Westmoquette, an astrophysicist and yoga and meditation teacher who runs mindful stargazing retreats across the UK and Europe. A search for relief has led me to wild swimming, drumming, yoga and now to star-bathing \u2013 an emerging wellness practice that is being offered in hotels and retreats around the world.Star bathing is not about identifying constellations, it's about losing yourself in the night sky; and a growing body of research suggests that it can help calm the nervous system, increase happiness and foster a sense of perspective.So here I am, wrapped in blankets, on a weekend of stargazing run by Broughton Sanctuary, a 16th-Century historic house and collection of cottages located at the foothills of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, a designated International Dark Sky Reserve.

        "article_text": "What will it take for India's private companies to begin investing in building new factories and firms?\nIt's a question that's confounded policymakers for years. As a share of gross domestic product (GDP), private investment in India has been on the decline since the global financial crisis of 2007, even while the overall economy clocked world-beating growth rates.\nAfter a long hiatus, the investment rate picked up slightly in 2022 and 2023, but latest data from a leading ratings agency shows private sector expenditure as part of the overall investments in India's economy dipped again to a decadal low of 33% this financial year.\nAnalysis from Icra of 4,500 listed companies and 8,000 unlisted companies reveals that while the pace of investments made by listed players moderated, those by unlisted entities actually contracted.\nOver the years, several economists have raised similar concerns about a slowdown in private investments. \nBanking tycoon Uday Kotak is among many who've raised concerns recently about India's fading \"animal spirits\", urging young business owners who had inherited companies to build new businesses rather than sitting tight and managing their existing wealth.\nData from investment advisory firm Value Research shows Indian non-financial businesses were sitting on cash worth 11% of their total assets, corroborating the view that companies are not spending money in making fresh investments. \nSo why are Indian corporate houses choosing to do that?\nWeak domestic consumption in urban areas, muted export demand and an influx of cheap Chinese imports in some sectors were among the factors that \"restricted the capacity expansion plans of Indian corporate houses\", Icra's Chief Rating Officer K Ravichandran said in a note.\nBut beyond the more immediate reasons, private investment impulse has been low because of \"global uncertainties and overcapacity\", India's economic survey pointed out earlier this year.\nSlowing private investments have a direct bearing on India's growth prospects.\nInvestments by companies in assets such as factories, machinery or construction \u2013 also called gross fixed capital formation \u2013 make up around 30% of GDP and are its second largest contributor following private consumption.\nIndia's full-year GDP is expected to close at 6.5%, sharply lower compared to last year's 9.2%. Growth has flagged on account of slower consumption.\nWith all the key levers of growth, including exports, slowing down and US President Donald Trump's tariffs exacerbating global uncertainties, kick-starting private investment will be fundamental for India to hit its long-term growth targets, experts say.\nAccording to the World Bank's latest estimates, India will need to grow by 7.8% on average over the next 22 years to achieve its high-income status ambition by 2047.\nKey to this would be to increase private and public investment to at least 40% of GDP from 33% currently, the bank estimates.\nThe government on its part has significantly increased spending, especially on infrastructure. It also cut corporate tax rates from 30% to 22% and doled out billions of dollars in production-linked subsidies to manufacturers over the years. Availability of bank credit isn't a constraint any longer, and regulation has eased with regulatory restrictions halving between 2003 and 2020.\nBut none of this has prodded corporate India to boost spending.\nAccording to Sajjid Chinoy, JP Morgan India's Chief Economist, the big problem is the lack of demand in the economy to justify putting up additional capacities.\nIndia's post-pandemic recovery has been uneven, with the consumer class not expanding quickly enough. Demand for goods and services has thus been hit, with spending capacity further curtailed by a fall in wages, even though corporate profitability has soared to a 15-year high this year.\n\"Just because companies are financially strong doesn't mean they will automatically invest. Companies will only invest if they expect good returns,\" Chinoy said at an event in Mumbai earlier this year.\nRathin Roy, a former member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC), points to other deeper structural issues arresting investment appetite.\n\"Entrepreneurs have been lacking the energy to produce goods that might generate new demand. A classic example of this is construction - where there's unsold inventory in the urban areas, but an incapacity among builders to go into tier two and tier three towns and tap newer markets,\" Roy told the BBC.\nHe said he also agreed with Mr Kotak's views on the growing trend of business heirs turning wealth managers rather than building businesses ground up.\n\"Business houses discovered during Covid-19 that they don't need to do business to make money. They can just invest and multiply it without building anything new,\" said Roy. And these investments aren't just happening in the domestic stock market. \"A lot of money is just flowing out of India and chasing returns elsewhere,\" he added.\nBut things could be turning a corner, according to Icra.\nInterest rate cuts as well as a $12bn income tax relief provided to individuals in the federal budget \"augurs well for supporting domestic consumption demand\", according to the report.\nIndia's central bank also says more private companies have shown an intention to invest this year compared to last year, although how much of that intent results into actual money deployed remains to be seen. \nThe uncertainties related to global trade tariffs could delay any anticipated investment pick-up, according to Icra.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Brazil were beaten 4-1 by Argentina in their most recent World Cup qualifier\nIn any previous World Cup, there would be genuine fear about Brazil failing to qualify. Not this time.\nIn an expanded competition, with six South American teams making it through automatically, Brazil have a six-point cushion over a Venezuela team who have just registered their first victory in 10 games.\nWith four rounds to go, it is impossible to see Brazil not making the cut. But that is hardly the point.\nFor Brazil, World Cup qualification now serves one purpose - it provides a sequence of competitive matches during which they hope to build a side capable of winning the trophy. And with just over a year to go until 2026, that looks a long way off.\nIt is easy to forget how good Brazil were in the last World Cup, where they lost in the quarter-finals on penalties to a Croatia team whose only shot on goal in the match took a cruel deflection.\nThe Qatar 2022 Brazil side were solid - goalkeeper Alisson could have taken a deckchair out for most of the games - with flashes of brilliance. They could have won that competition. \nSo why have they fallen back so much? How can a team packed with so many good players form such a dismal unit?\nThe team that were thrashed 4-1 by Argentina on Tuesday appeared to have no midfield, and were unable either to attack or defend.\nDorival Junior is under pressure following the heavy defeat by Argentina\nTuesday's prolonged humiliation did not come out of the blue. \nIn game after game the team have looked disjointed, without clear strategies for progressing the ball down the field, and suffering from the possibility of being both outplayed and outnumbered in central midfield. \nIndividual talent has papered over the cracks - like on Thursday, when a stoppage-time Vinicius Jr special gave them a victory over Colombia their play had not really deserved. \nBut it can't happen all the time.\nAnd if the film is bad, especially if the cast is impressive, the director must be to blame. \nThere is a crisis in Brazilian coaching. It is hard to produce coaches when there is no time to train and no job security. That is the reality of domestic Brazilian football, and helps explain why almost all of the successful coaches in the country are now foreign - either Argentine or, especially, Portuguese.\nThe national boss - for now anyway - Dorival Jr is a product of the domestic game, with more than four decades' experience as player and coach. \nBut on the international stage he comes across as a decent man thoroughly out of his depth.\nDid he really think he could travel to Argentina and play two men in central midfield? Why not drop deep and create space for the counter-attack, as he did a year ago against England at Wembley? And when cool heads were required, his team came across as a bag of nerves, all too willing to get involved in cheap spats.\nOf the three duties of the coach - pick the team, determine the strategy and set the emotional tone - Dorival failed dismally, and it is very hard to see how he can keep his job.\nIf he is to be replaced, there would seem to be two options. One is to go foreign - the Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus would be a strong candidate. The other would be to fast-track former Chelsea left-back Filipe Luis - a man of great intelligence who has made an impressive start to his coaching career with Rio giants Flamengo.\nWhoever comes in - or Dorival if he manages to hang on - will have to deal with a simple observation - central midfield is not an optional extra.\nIt is an area where Brazil have had a problem for a while - a consequence of the 1990s trend of splitting the middle of the park into a pair of midfielders who only defend and a duo who mostly attack. It was at this point Brazilian play lost much of its former fluency, instead investing in rapid breaks down the flanks.\nIt is in this context that the problems of Lucas Paqueta are so significant. \nThe West Ham midfielder was on the verge of becoming a big-money Manchester City signing when scandal struck, and his career - now threatened - has not recovered.\nThe evidence of Dorival's first games in charge - a year ago away to England and Spain - was Paqueta had become the most important player in the team, the man capable of filling space in midfield, dictating the rhythm of the game and unleashing the pace of the likes of Vinicius Jr.\nRonaldo quits Brazil federation presidency race\nAlisson returns to Liverpool after 'suspected concussion'\nThe absence of Paqueta almost certainly led to Dorival building his hopes for these international dates around the return of Neymar - which, predictably, turned out to be ludicrously premature.\nAfter so long out injured, it was only to be expected that Neymar would run into muscular problems, and he will need much more time on the field to ease his way back to a level where he can tip the balance.\nAt 33, he is an unknown quantity. But there is a gaping hole in the team for the type of deep-lying playmaker role he could fill. \nRomantics might recall 2002, when Ronaldo looked all washed up only to make a triumphant return from injury and carry a Brazil side that almost failed to qualify all the way to World Cup title number five. \nThey are still waiting for number six. \nIf they can do it next year then, in the wake of Tuesday's humiliation, it will be a candidate for one of football's great comebacks.\nNeymar's absence from the Brazil team was prolonged by a muscular injury",

We were all taken aback but I didn't understand that I was apparently the culprit.\nI got in the car but didn't really understand the extent of it until I got to the arena and online there was a photo of Sandy, who was stripped down with red paint on her. ESPN came in to see me and apparently I'm being blamed for the attack.\nEveryone who knows me, knows that would be out of character for me - it's not my style. I expected her to try to blame me. I was her rival all week but there were also other things going on. \nSandy has already said flyers attacking her were put up around the hotel and city.\nYou can't just point a finger when there is no evidence leading back to me. I was upstairs waiting to walk down for the fight of my life. \nI didn't know what time she was going to be down there or that she was going first. The only people who knew were her team - maybe she should look inside her own circle.\nThe incident took me by surprise but I was in fight mode and it didn't happen to me, so I wasn't flustered.\nIf someone had thrown paint on me I would have slapped paint on the ass of my fight shorts and got on with it.\nI was concerned that she was going to pull out - her team were really getting her going about it.\nThere was a clip of her coach Kay Koroma in the locker room screaming at her to pull out of the fight which I thought was super suspicious. That was weird to me and out of character for him. \nI really don't think it was the paint that threw her off her game but her team, who made it a bigger deal than it had to be.\nObviously I don't want that to happen and I hope it doesn't happen going into this fight. It could have been called off and, after two years of busting my butt to get back in that position, that was the last thing I wanted.\nAs for 'paint-gate' being used to promote the rematch, I was surprised the Top Rank team used the paint on the promotion posters - but this is entertainment. \nI didn't have any say in it. If I had done anything like that, my manager would have had my neck as he tries to keep me professional.\nI didn't know about it until the poster came out and I said, 'do they have red paint on Sandy?'\nI was just as taken aback as anyone else, but it's kind of funny.\nMayer (right) beat Ryan (left) by majority decision with one judge scoring it a draw\nIt's important for women's boxing to have these rivalries and this is definitely up there as one of the top ones.\nI never counted out the rematch and just wanted to see what my other options were. Once I saw the views and how much the fans wanted it - and the excuses - I thought let's do it again and I'll do it even better.\nI didn't get my rematch with Alycia Baumgardner so I understand Sandy might have been frustrated, but I didn't have to give her this rematch. I could have just sat it out, waited for Lauren Price to unify and fought for undisputed or faced someone else. \nThat's not the fighter I am though.\nI pride myself on the fact a lot of the fights I have been in are competitive and people aren't sure who will win. \nMy feud with Alycia will stay number one for a lifetime, but Sandy can come second because of the coaching team situation and the paint situation.\nSandy and her team have tried to gaslight me in a sense where I'm supposed to be making all of this up or I'm being dramatic, but it happened.\nYou're going to see coach Koroma, my coach of eight or nine years since the Olympics, in her corner so they really can't say anything about it. They did what they did and they have to stand by that. \nI'm just protecting myself and I'm the one who had to go out and find a whole new team at this stage of my career which is not easy.

        "article_text": "A carpet of flowers has been growing outside Wigan Athletic's stadium in tribute to Darren Orme\nDarren Orme was a familiar figure cycling through the streets to work, the supporter known as 'Mr Wigan Athletic' because of a devotion to his beloved Latics stretching back more than 40 years.\nHe was nearly always first on the supporters' coach travelling to away games, happy to wait in the early hours for the ticket office to open for big occasions such as the club's greatest day - the 2013 FA Cup final win over Manchester City at Wembley.\nWhen he was reported missing on 5 March, supporters, the town and its respective football and rugby league clubs rallied in the search for the 54-year-old amid a huge public response.\nSadly, his body was discovered a fortnight later in the shadow of the Brick Community Stadium where he always took his seat in the East Stand.\nIt is a story both heartbreaking and heartwarming, as it enabled the people of Wigan to prove that the powerful concept of football as an extension of family still exists.\nThe life of this much-loved supporter will be commemorated and celebrated at Wigan Athletic's home game against Barnsley on Saturday (15:00 GMT), when a minute's applause will be held, while a shirt emblazoned with 'Darren 1 Of Our Own' and a scarf will be placed on his seat.\nSince the news of Darren's death a carpet of flowers has grown around the stadium's statue of former Wigan chairman and owner Dave Whelan, while a book of condolence has been opened.\nAmid the sadness, the response from Wigan supporters, and the town as a whole, has shone a light on the pivotal role a football club can play in its community - and how regarding your club as an extension of family is not an emotional exaggeration.\nMick Wimsey, chairman of the club's Travel and Supporters Club, organised a search for Darren in the days following his disappearance, also driving around in the early hours while taking time off work in an attempt to find the friend who had followed Wigan Athletic with him for more than four decades.\n\"We live in a bad world,\" he told BBC Sport. \"But the amount of goodness that's come out of this is amazing. When there was no word on Darren after a few days, we organised a search on the Sunday after he went missing.\n\"I was only expecting a few people to turn up but we had more than 100. All those people searched for Darren from 10am to 4.30pm - then some went back out afterwards after they had a break.\n\"On that Sunday morning, there were people who don't even watch football, but had seen him going to work on his bike and felt compelled to come and look for him. It was heartbreaking, but there was good in it as well.\"\nHe added: \"Football clubs are like your family. He was part of our family at Latics. Once you saw him you'd never forget him. His smile was infectious. If you could bottle what Darren had, Armani would make millions out of it.\n\"Sometimes you saw more of him than you did members of your own family. He was one of my best friends. I've been watching Wigan for 46 seasons and running the supporters' club for 44. I've known Darren for so long. I met him at a game against Walsall when we were both kids about 14 years of age.\n\"I was asked to write a tribute to him in the local paper. It just poured out of me and I found myself with tears streaming down my face. Everyone loved Darren - although he was definitely the worst raffle-ticket seller I ever knew.\"\nThe official Wigan Athletic Supporters Club paid an emotional tribute to \"a recognisable and loved character\" who \"lived and breathed blue and white\". It will pay posthumous tribute with a fan of the month award - a framed certificate passed to Darren's family before Saturday's game.\nIt added: \"He had numerous nominations for our fan of the month, including 'for being the loudest singer in any stadium' and for bringing back programmes from away matches for fans who couldn't attend themselves. Darren was kind-hearted and caring.\"\nThe body of popular Wigan Athletic supporter Darren Orme was found on Monday\nWhen he was reported missing, posters were placed in shop windows around Wigan, while new manager Ryan Lowe made a public appeal. There was also a banner on display at Wigan's training headquarters.\nJamie Allen, head of media marketing and communications at Wigan, said: \"Latics has had its issues on and off the pitch over the last few years. It's been a rollercoaster ride at Wigan Athletic, but this showed what this club and town has at its heart.\n\"This was not the outcome anyone wanted and is devastating, but it united a town and a sporting family across two clubs - Wigan Athletic and Wigan Warriors. The community and clubs come together in times of need and, like families, this is what happened here.\n\"This is a very sad outcome but there is a heartwarming side to this in what it says about our town and the people in it, and how much a football club and its supporters - and of course the rugby league club - can mean.\"\nSaturday will be an emotional day in Wigan when they face Barnsley, but Wimsey says: \"Football supporters are a community regardless of who you support. Bolton Wanderers fans, our big rivals, were sending love and their thoughts.\n\"It will change next Tuesday when we play each other, but for this period of time we were all like one big family. This is what football is -  it is grassroots, working class and the word 'family' is right.\"\nWigan, of course, are not the first club or community to have proved amid tragedy that football has a life and impact stretching beyond 90 minutes.\nWhen six-year-old Bradley Lowery died after a long illness - he was only 18 months when diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a rare type of cancer - he had become known to the whole football community. \nThe Sunderland fan became \"best mates\" with his hero, striker Jermain Defoe, as well as gaining worldwide recognition following an appeal in which he received 250,000 Christmas cards from around the globe.\nHe met then England manager Gareth Southgate and former striker Gary Lineker at BBC Sports Personality of the Year, and won Match of the Day's goal of the month award after he took a penalty before a Sunderland game against Chelsea.\nMeanwhile, earlier this month, Rangers captain James Tavernier, goalkeeper Jack Butland and former Scotland international Robert Snodgrass all contributed to a fundraiser for a fan killed in Turkey after being hit by two cars while crossing a road in Istanbul before the Glasgow side's Europa League match with Fenerbahce.\nOxford United are another club touched by tragedy, when former winger Joey Beauchamp, regarded by many as their greatest player, took his own life aged 50 in February 2022.\nHis younger brother Luke has set up a foundation in his name to help those battling mental health and depression to support their families.\nPaul Peros, chairman of OXVOX, the Independent Supporters Trust for Oxford United, said: \"Fundamentally, as much as everyone wants wins and promotions, we want to feel connected to the club we love, along with the fans who share the experience.\n\"In a slightly different way, when Joey passed away it did feel almost like a member of a family, because in a broader sense football is absolutely a family, especially at your own club.\n\"You spend as much time with those you regularly go to the match with as you do a lot of your family. You build those bonds. The story of the Wigan supporter is so sad but has also shown how football does go beyond the pitch and into the community.\n\"There are people that you may not know, but have just seen around at away games or whatever. You have shared experiences, like members of a family.

        "summary": "Sad story of 'Mr Wigan Athletic' proves football family still existsImage source, WiganImage caption, A carpet of flowers has been growing outside Wigan Athletic's stadium in tribute to Darren OrmePhil McNultyChief football writerPublished3 hours agoDarren Orme was a familiar figure cycling through the streets to work, the supporter known as 'Mr Wigan Athletic' because of a devotion to his beloved Latics stretching back more than 40 years.He was nearly always first on the supporters' coach travelling to away games, happy to wait in the early hours for the ticket office to open for big occasions such as the club's greatest day - the 2013 FA Cup final win over Manchester City at Wembley.When he was reported missing on 5 March, supporters, the town and its respective football and rugby league clubs rallied in the search for the 54-year-old amid a huge public response.Sadly, his body was discovered a fortnight later in the shadow of the Brick Community Stadium where he always took his seat in the East Stand.It is a story both heartbreaking and heartwarming, as it enabled the people of Wigan to prove that the powerful concept of football as an extension of family still exists.The life of this much-loved supporter will be commemorated and celebrated at Wigan Athletic's home game against Barnsley on Saturday (15:00 GMT), when a minute's applause will be held, while a shirt emblazoned with 'Darren 1 Of Our Own' and a scarf will be placed on his seat.Since the news of Darren's death a carpet of flowers has grown around the stadium's statue of former Wigan chairman and owner Dave Whelan, while a book of condolence has been opened.Amid the sadness, the response from Wigan supporters, and the town as a whole, has shone a light on the pivotal role a football club can play in its community - and how regarding your club as an extension of family is not an emotional exaggeration.Mick Wimsey, chairman of the club's Travel and Supporters Club, organised a search for Darren in the days following his disappearance, also driving around in the early hours while taking time off work in an attempt to find the friend who had followed Wigan Athletic with him for more than four decades. \"He added: \"Football clubs are like your family. \"This is a very sad outcome but there is a heartwarming side to this in what it says about our town and the people in it, and how much a football club and its supporters - and of course the rugby league club - can mean. \"In a slightly different way, when Joey passed away it did feel almost like a member of a family, because in a broader sense football is absolutely a family, especially at your own club. \"Saturday will be an emotional day in Wigan when they face Barnsley, but Wimsey says: \"Football supporters are a community regardless of who you support.",

        "article_text": "What will it take for India's private companies to begin investing in building new factories and firms?\nIt's a question that's confounded policymakers for years. As a share of gross domestic product (GDP), private investment in India has been on the decline since the global financial crisis of 2007, even while the overall economy clocked world-beating growth rates.\nAfter a long hiatus, the investment rate picked up slightly in 2022 and 2023, but latest data from a leading ratings agency shows private sector expenditure as part of the overall investments in India's economy dipped again to a decadal low of 33% this financial year.\nAnalysis from Icra of 4,500 listed companies and 8,000 unlisted companies reveals that while the pace of investments made by listed players moderated, those by unlisted entities actually contracted.\nOver the years, several economists have raised similar concerns about a slowdown in private investments. \nBanking tycoon Uday Kotak is among many who've raised concerns recently about India's fading \"animal spirits\", urging young business owners who had inherited companies to build new businesses rather than sitting tight and managing their existing wealth.\nData from investment advisory firm Value Research shows Indian non-financial businesses were sitting on cash worth 11% of their total assets, corroborating the view that companies are not spending money in making fresh investments. \nSo why are Indian corporate houses choosing to do that?\nWeak domestic consumption in urban areas, muted export demand and an influx of cheap Chinese imports in some sectors were among the factors that \"restricted the capacity expansion plans of Indian corporate houses\", Icra's Chief Rating Officer K Ravichandran said in a note.\nBut beyond the more immediate reasons, private investment impulse has been low because of \"global uncertainties and overcapacity\", India's economic survey pointed out earlier this year.\nSlowing private investments have a direct bearing on India's growth prospects.\nInvestments by companies in assets such as factories, machinery or construction \u2013 also called gross fixed capital formation \u2013 make up around 30% of GDP and are its second largest contributor following private consumption.\nIndia's full-year GDP is expected to close at 6.5%, sharply lower compared to last year's 9.2%. Growth has flagged on account of slower consumption.\nWith all the key levers of growth, including exports, slowing down and US President Donald Trump's tariffs exacerbating global uncertainties, kick-starting private investment will be fundamental for India to hit its long-term growth targets, experts say.\nAccording to the World Bank's latest estimates, India will need to grow by 7.8% on average over the next 22 years to achieve its high-income status ambition by 2047.\nKey to this would be to increase private and public investment to at least 40% of GDP from 33% currently, the bank estimates.\nThe government on its part has significantly increased spending, especially on infrastructure. It also cut corporate tax rates from 30% to 22% and doled out billions of dollars in production-linked subsidies to manufacturers over the years. Availability of bank credit isn't a constraint any longer, and regulation has eased with regulatory restrictions halving between 2003 and 2020.\nBut none of this has prodded corporate India to boost spending.\nAccording to Sajjid Chinoy, JP Morgan India's Chief Economist, the big problem is the lack of demand in the economy to justify putting up additional capacities.\nIndia's post-pandemic recovery has been uneven, with the consumer class not expanding quickly enough. Demand for goods and services has thus been hit, with spending capacity further curtailed by a fall in wages, even though corporate profitability has soared to a 15-year high this year.\n\"Just because companies are financially strong doesn't mean they will automatically invest. Companies will only invest if they expect good returns,\" Chinoy said at an event in Mumbai earlier this year.\nRathin Roy, a former member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC), points to other deeper structural issues arresting investment appetite.\n\"Entrepreneurs have been lacking the energy to produce goods that might generate new demand. A classic example of this is construction - where there's unsold inventory in the urban areas, but an incapacity among builders to go into tier two and tier three towns and tap newer markets,\" Roy told the BBC.\nHe said he also agreed with Mr Kotak's views on the growing trend of business heirs turning wealth managers rather than building businesses ground up.\n\"Business houses discovered during Covid-19 that they don't need to do business to make money. They can just invest and multiply it without building anything new,\" said Roy. And these investments aren't just happening in the domestic stock market. \"A lot of money is just flowing out of India and chasing returns elsewhere,\" he added.\nBut things could be turning a corner, according to Icra.\nInterest rate cuts as well as a $12bn income tax relief provided to individuals in the federal budget \"augurs well for supporting domestic consumption demand\", according to the report.\nIndia's central bank also says more private companies have shown an intention to invest this year compared to last year, although how much of that intent results into actual money deployed remains to be seen. \nThe uncertainties related to global trade tariffs could delay any anticipated investment pick-up, according to Icra.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

We were all taken aback but I didn't understand that I was apparently the culprit.\nI got in the car but didn't really understand the extent of it until I got to the arena and online there was a photo of Sandy, who was stripped down with red paint on her. ESPN came in to see me and apparently I'm being blamed for the attack.\nEveryone who knows me, knows that would be out of character for me - it's not my style. I expected her to try to blame me. I was her rival all week but there were also other things going on. \nSandy has already said flyers attacking her were put up around the hotel and city.\nYou can't just point a finger when there is no evidence leading back to me. I was upstairs waiting to walk down for the fight of my life. \nI didn't know what time she was going to be down there or that she was going first. The only people who knew were her team - maybe she should look inside her own circle.\nThe incident took me by surprise but I was in fight mode and it didn't happen to me, so I wasn't flustered.\nIf someone had thrown paint on me I would have slapped paint on the ass of my fight shorts and got on with it.\nI was concerned that she was going to pull out - her team were really getting her going about it.\nThere was a clip of her coach Kay Koroma in the locker room screaming at her to pull out of the fight which I thought was super suspicious. That was weird to me and out of character for him. \nI really don't think it was the paint that threw her off her game but her team, who made it a bigger deal than it had to be.\nObviously I don't want that to happen and I hope it doesn't happen going into this fight. It could have been called off and, after two years of busting my butt to get back in that position, that was the last thing I wanted.\nAs for 'paint-gate' being used to promote the rematch, I was surprised the Top Rank team used the paint on the promotion posters - but this is entertainment. \nI didn't have any say in it. If I had done anything like that, my manager would have had my neck as he tries to keep me professional.\nI didn't know about it until the poster came out and I said, 'do they have red paint on Sandy?'\nI was just as taken aback as anyone else, but it's kind of funny.\nMayer (right) beat Ryan (left) by majority decision with one judge scoring it a draw\nIt's important for women's boxing to have these rivalries and this is definitely up there as one of the top ones.\nI never counted out the rematch and just wanted to see what my other options were. Once I saw the views and how much the fans wanted it - and the excuses - I thought let's do it again and I'll do it even better.\nI didn't get my rematch with Alycia Baumgardner so I understand Sandy might have been frustrated, but I didn't have to give her this rematch. I could have just sat it out, waited for Lauren Price to unify and fought for undisputed or faced someone else. \nThat's not the fighter I am though.\nI pride myself on the fact a lot of the fights I have been in are competitive and people aren't sure who will win. \nMy feud with Alycia will stay number one for a lifetime, but Sandy can come second because of the coaching team situation and the paint situation.\nSandy and her team have tried to gaslight me in a sense where I'm supposed to be making all of this up or I'm being dramatic, but it happened.\nYou're going to see coach Koroma, my coach of eight or nine years since the Olympics, in her corner so they really can't say anything about it. They did what they did and they have to stand by that. \nI'm just protecting myself and I'm the one who had to go out and find a whole new team at this stage of my career which is not easy. I have truth on my side.\nMikaela Mayer was speaking to BBC Sport's Bobbie Jackson.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "Get your protective eclipse glasses ready - weather permitting you'll be able to see the Moon take a 'bite' out of the Sun on Saturday morning.\nThe partial solar eclipse will be visible across the UK. People will have the chance to see the Moon cover about 30 to 50% of the Sun at its peak, with the best chance of clear skies in south-east England, East Anglia and the Midlands.\nThe eclipse won't be total anywhere in the world, but northeastern regions of Canada will see up to 92% of the Sun covered.\nYou must not ever look at the Sun directly, as it can severely damage your eyes, so you will need those special eclipse glasses if you're going to take a peek.\nThis partial eclipse will be visible across Europe, Northwestern Africa, Greenland, Iceland, and parts of the northeastern US and eastern Canada, with varying levels of visibility.\nIt will begin at 10:07 in the UK and will end at midday.\nSome parts of the UK will see more of the Sun covered than others. If you are in the Outer Hebrides, for example, you'll see up to 47% of the Sun obscured, while Dover in southeast England will only see about 28% of it covered.\nEclipse times will vary slightly depending on where you are, so use Time and Date to check exact times in your location.\n\"This is an excellent chance to go out, look \u2013 safely \u2013 and to be able to see the movement of the solar system for yourself,\" said said Anna Gammon-Ross, Senior Planetarium Astronomer at Royal Museums Greenwich.\n\"It's such a wonderful way to just connect to everything happening and, and see it all in action.\"\n\nA solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Sun and Earth, blocking some or all the Sun's light.\nThere are di\ufb00erent types of solar eclipses, depending on how much of the Sun is obscured.\nSkywatchers in the UK will be treated to another partial solar eclipse on August 12, 2026, when the Arctic, eastern Greenland, Iceland, and northern Spain will experience a rarer total eclipse.\nThe UK won't witness another full solar eclipse for another 65 years, until September 23, 2090, according to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich.\nThe UK's last total solar eclipse took place in 1999, with Cornwall being the only location in the country to experience the event in its totality, drawing thousands of people to the region.\nIt's important to ensure you're taking the proper precautions to view this event safely.\nEven during a partial eclipse, it is never safe to look directly at the Sun with the naked eye as it can cause eye damage, including blindness.\nSolar eclipse glasses are specifically designed to filter out harmful UV rays and reduce the intense brightness of the Sun, making it safe to look directly at the eclipse.\nNormal sunglasses won't work because they don't block enough light to protect your eyes from the Sun's extreme intensity.\n\"If you blocked as much sunlight with your sunglasses as eclipse glasses do, you wouldn't be able to see where you were going!\" said Miss Gammon-Ross.\nIf you don't have access to eclipse glasses, you can create a simple pinhole camera with just two sheets of cardboard or even use a colander to project the Sun's image safely onto the ground.\nLocal astronomical societies may host eclipse events with telescopes fitted with solar filters.\nThe Royal Observatory in Greenwich will be hosting a live stream of the March 2025 solar eclipse, allowing viewers across the UK to experience the event online in real-time.\nLooking at the Sun without protection can cause permanent retinal damage and blindness, even after just a few seconds of exposure.\nThe weather on Saturday morning could be a little tricky for some and the chances of seeing the eclipse vary markedly depending on where in the UK you are.\nThe best of the clear skies are likely to be found in south-east England, East Anglia and the Midlands. A little high cloud is possible but this should not spoil the view too much.\nIn Wales, as well as northern and western parts of England, the chances are a little lower.

        "summary": "\"What Is a solar eclipse?A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Sun and Earth, blocking some or all the Sun's light.There are di\ufb00erent types of solar eclipses, depending on how much of the Sun is obscured.Partial solar eclipse \u2013 The Moon partially covers the Sun, leaving a crescent-shaped section of the Sun visible.Annular solar eclipse \u2013 The Moon is directly in front of the Sun but appears smaller, leaving a thin, bright ring of sunlight around its edges.Total solar eclipse \u2013 The Moon completely covers the Sun, revealing a glowing outer atmosphere called the corona.When and where is the next solar eclipse?Skywatchers in the UK will be treated to another partial solar eclipse on August 12, 2026, when the Arctic, eastern Greenland, Iceland, and northern Spain will experience a rarer total eclipse.The UK won't witness another full solar eclipse for another 65 years, until September 23, 2090, according to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich.The UK's last total solar eclipse took place in 1999, with Cornwall being the only location in the country to experience the event in its totality, drawing thousands of people to the region.How to watch a solar eclipse safely Getty ImagesWarning: Never look directly at the Sun, this can cause serious eye damage or even blindness.It's important to ensure you're taking the proper precautions to view this event safely.Even during a partial eclipse, it is never safe to look directly at the Sun with the naked eye as it can cause eye damage, including blindness.Solar eclipse glasses are specifically designed to filter out harmful UV rays and reduce the intense brightness of the Sun, making it safe to look directly at the eclipse.Normal sunglasses won't work because they don't block enough light to protect your eyes from the Sun's extreme intensity. People will have the chance to see the Moon cover about 30 to 50% of the Sun at its peak, with the best chance of clear skies in south-east England, East Anglia and the Midlands.The eclipse won't be total anywhere in the world, but northeastern regions of Canada will see up to 92% of the Sun covered.You must not ever look at the Sun directly, as it can severely damage your eyes, so you will need those special eclipse glasses if you're going to take a peek.When and where will the partial eclipse be seen?This partial eclipse will be visible across Europe, Northwestern Africa, Greenland, Iceland, and parts of the northeastern US and eastern Canada, with varying levels of visibility.It will begin at 10:07 in the UK and will end at midday.Some parts of the UK will see more of the Sun covered than others. said Miss Gammon-Ross.If you don't have access to eclipse glasses, you can create a simple pinhole camera with just two sheets of cardboard or even use a colander to project the Sun's image safely onto the ground.Local astronomical societies may host eclipse events with telescopes fitted with solar filters.The Royal Observatory in Greenwich will be hosting a live stream of the March 2025 solar eclipse, allowing viewers across the UK to experience the event online in real-time.Looking at the Sun without protection can cause permanent retinal damage and blindness, even after just a few seconds of exposure.Will the skies be clear enough to see it?The weather on Saturday morning could be a little tricky for some and the chances of seeing the eclipse vary markedly depending on where in the UK you are.The best of the clear skies are likely to be found in south-east England, East Anglia and the Midlands. How to watch Saturday's partial solar eclipse 11 hours agoShareSaveMaddie MolloyBBC Climate & ScienceShareSaveGetty ImagesGet your protective eclipse glasses ready - weather permitting you'll be able to see the Moon take a 'bite' out of the Sun on Saturday morning.The partial solar eclipse will be visible across the UK. \"If you blocked as much sunlight with your sunglasses as eclipse glasses do, you wouldn't be able to see where you were going!\"",

        "article_text": "People will be far more open-minded than you realise if you adopt these simple conversational techniques.\n\"The growth of knowledge depends entirely upon disagreement,\" claimed the philosopher Karl Popper. He was writing about the dangers of dogma in science \u2013 but his words could equally apply to anyone's worldview. And if you want a disagreement to end by changing someone's mind, you have to do it in the right way.\nAs I found in my recent book on social connection, new psychological research can help us to have more constructive conversations about controversial issues.\u00a0\nSome of the strategies surprised me. While some social media users are keen to remind us that \"facts don't care about your feelings\", studies suggest that people are considerably more likely to listen to our arguments if we talk about our personal experiences of the issues under discussion.\nOne of the main drivers of serious disagreement was apparent in the recent Friendship Study, which comprised a questionnaire I devised with psychologist Ian MacRae, offered to BBC.com readers in July and August of last year.\nIn one section, participants were asked to imagine a discussion with someone who disagreed with them about certain political or social issues. Afterwards, each participant was asked about their intentions \u2013 whether they aimed to persuade the other person, learn from them, or argue with them \u2013 and also their impression of the other person's intentions. Overall, the 1,912 participants overestimated how much other people wanted to persuade them of their point of view, and how much they were looking for an argument. At the same time, they underestimated how much the other person wanted to learn and understand the different opinions.\nThis is worth remembering whenever we find ourselves in a conflict: the other person may be more open to a good-faith discussion than we think, and we should treat them with the respect that entails.\nGiven that our conversation partner might underestimate our curiosity about their views, we should also make more effort to express our interest in their views. By demonstrating our good intentions to learn and understand, we will encourage them to lower their defences so that they are more open to an honest exchange of ideas.\nOften it is as simple as asking the right question. In the late 2000s, Frances Chen and colleagues at Stanford University invited students to engage in an online debate about whether the university should introduce a new set of exams. Unsurprisingly, many students were dead set against the idea. Crucially, they thought they were chatting to their peers, but their debating partners were really the experimenters themselves \u2013 who followed very rigid scripts that varied depending on whether the participant was in the experimental group or the control group.\nIn half of the conversations, the experimenters asked the students to elaborate on their views. For example, they might listen to a student's argument and respond: \"I was interested in what you're saying. Can you tell me more about how come you think that?\" For the other trials, the conversation did not include any request for more information on the participants' beliefs.\nIt was a tiny change in the script, but the addition of the single question changed the whole tone of the debate by provoking a considerably more open-minded response from the participants. They were more willing to continue the conversation and to receive further information on the other person's arguments, for instance.\nWe might be a little sceptical of the results from a single experiment, but Guy Itzchakov at the University of Haifa in Israel and his colleagues came to very similar conclusions in a series of studies involving hundreds of participants. Actively asking questions about people's beliefs and the reasons they hold those views leads them to lower their defences, so that they are considerably more receptive to alternative opinions.\u00a0\nAfter these kinds of conversations, participants were considerably more likely to agree with statements such as \"I feel that I ought to re-evaluate the event now, after the conversation\" \u2013 suggesting that they had become more thoughtful about the issues that they had discussed.\nWhile exchanging opinions, you shouldn't be afraid of sharing your first-hand experience of the issue at hand; indeed, it may just strengthen your argument.\nThis fact does not seem to be widely recognised. When Emily Kubin at the University of North Carolina and colleagues asked 251 participants to describe the best ways to present their opinion on an issue such as same-sex marriage or abortion, 56% chose the presentation of facts and evidence, while just 21% selected the expression of personal experience.\u00a0 \u00a0\nWe saw similar patterns within our Friendship Study. When we asked people to rate seven persuasion strategies, \"civility\" was number one, followed by \"logic and reason\". \"Personal experience\" came in at number five.\nKubin's experiments, however, suggest that it can be a potent tool of persuasion. Her team asked 177 participants to read about three people's opinions on topics like taxation, coal mining or gun control, before rating their respect for each person, and that person's rationality. No matter what their initial stance, the participants gave considerably higher ratings if they knew that the person had personal experience of the issue at hand.\nReading short texts online may seem a far cry from real-life encounters, but Kubin has also tested the principle in face-to-face dialogues on gun control, using a further sample of 153 local people who lived near the university. Once again, someone using a personal experience to portray their views commanded more respect from their conversation partner and was perceived to be more rational in their views.\nThere are, of course, good reasons to be wary of purely subjective accounts if they are not accompanied by any statistics, and an overreliance on an emotional appeal could raise the other person's suspicions. But the two approaches do not have to be mutually exclusive, and your point of view may be better received if you combine the two.\nConsider a recent examination of the 2018 midterm elections demonstrated. The study measured the progress of 230 canvassers, conversing on a range of political issues with 6,869 voters across seven US locations. Some were asked to make their case using purely statistical arguments \u2013 concerning, for instance, the common fear that immigration increases crime \u2013 while others were asked to exchange personal stories, in addition to presenting factual evidence.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Friendship in divided times: People don't want to argue with you as much as you think\n\u2022\u00a0Why do I feel so lonely even though I'm surrounded by people?\n\u2022\u00a0Seven ways to improve your sleep according to science\nEach of the voters took opinion polls before and after they met the canvassers. The researchers found that the mutually respectful exchange of experiences was more likely to shift opinion than conversations that focused more on impersonal facts and statistics.\nWhile the overall effects were small \u2013 resulting in a five-percentage-point shift in views on immigration, for example \u2013 this should be taken in context. On average, the conversations lasted just 11 minutes in total, yet a significant number of people started to change strongly held views.\u00a0\nThroughout your conversations, you should make sure that you maintain a basic level of civility \u2013 not only to your discussion partner, but also when you are talking about anyone else who may be involved in the debate, including public figures.\u00a0\nResearch by Jeremy Frimer at the University of Winnipeg and Linda Skitka at the University of Illinois at Chicago has shown that rude behaviour is far more likely to alienate the person you wish to persuade than change their opinion, and it may even disaffect people who were already coming around to your point of view. They describe this as the Montagu Principle, named after the 18th-Century English aristocrat Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who declared that \"civility costs nothing and buys everything\".\nBy demonstrating genuine curiosity, sharing your personal experiences, and maintaining a civil attitude, you may be surprised by your potential to connect \u2013 and gain a wiser worldview in the process.\n* David Robson is an award-winning science writer and author.

        "article_text": "From the Yorkshire Moors in England to the South African wilderness, star bathing is emerging as a transformative wellness trend \u2013 offering awe, calm and a cosmic reset.\nI lie in an empty Victorian bathtub on heather moorland in the Yorkshire Moors in England's north. Above me, more and more stars appear as the sky slowly darkens from blue to violet to navy. Beside me, in her own bathtub, my star-bathing guide Gemma leads a meditation.\n\"Allow yourself to be awed by the incredible sky view that you're witnessing,\" she says softly. \"Appreciate that we are here, right now, on this beautiful evening. Focus gently on the sky\u2026 and your breath. Just be.\"\u00a0\nI feel cold and self-conscious. I am trying to suspend the part of me that is deeply sceptical because I desperately want an escape from the anxiety that has plagued the past three years of my life. A search for relief has led me to wild swimming, drumming, yoga and now to star-bathing \u2013 an emerging wellness practice that is being offered in hotels and retreats around the world.\nStar bathing is not about identifying constellations, it's about losing yourself in the night sky; and a growing body of research suggests that it can help calm the nervous system, increase happiness and foster a sense of perspective.\nSo here I am, wrapped in blankets, on a weekend of stargazing run by Broughton Sanctuary, a 16th-Century historic house and collection of cottages located at the foothills of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, a designated International Dark Sky Reserve. There is a strong focus on the healing power of nature here \u2013 the 3,000-acre grounds are home to one of the UK's largest rewilding projects \u2013 and star bathing is just one of many activities designed to bring guests closer to the natural world.\nThe meditation ends and silence falls on the moors, broken by the distant hoot of an owl. I look up, trying not to think about the stressful week I've had. As the sky continues to darken, new stars appear as though by magic. My breathing slows. Suddenly I feel something shift. I realise that I am not just looking up at the universe, I am part of the universe. It is impossible not to feel awed by the vastness and beauty of the night sky above me.\nThe psychological benefits of experiencing awe are well documented \u2013 it has been proven to lower heart rate, increase the presence of oxytocin and reduce inflammation \u2013 and it's one of the reasons that stargazing is so good for our mental health.\n\"Experiencing awe regularly is deeply beneficial for our mental wellbeing because it helps us to feel connected to something bigger than ourselves,\" says Mark Westmoquette, an astrophysicist and yoga and meditation teacher who runs mindful stargazing retreats across the UK and Europe. \"As we look up at the night sky and become aware of our place within it, that sense of wonder and awe can really shift our perspective around who and what we are.\"\nWhile the mental health benefits of being in nature are well documented, it's only recently that researchers have begun to study the effects of being in a nocturnal natural environment.\nIn February 2024, a new Night Sky Connectedness Index was published in the\u00a0Journal of Environmental Psychology. It showed that a greater connection to the night sky is positively related to a person's mental health and happiness. The Office of Astronomy for Development, a joint project of the International Astronomical Union and the South African National Research Foundation, is currently researching the potential of using astronomy as a tool to improve vulnerable people's mental wellbeing, with encouraging results.\nAt the end of our star-bathing session, Gemma, me and the other two participants drink hot chocolate and then make our way down the hillside. We can't take our eyes off the sky, which becomes more and more dazzling the longer we look at it.\nWell World\nBBC Travel's\u00a0Well World is a global take on wellness that explores different ways that cultures the world over strive for a healthy lifestyle.\nThe following night, after a day spent exploring the grounds, relaxing in the spa and wild swimming in a freezing cold former reservoir on the estate, I take part in a stargazing session that is part of the annual Dark Skies Festival. After eating a two-course vegetarian meal around a bonfire in the \"fire temple\" \u2013 a sheltered wooden structure set in pretty woodland \u2013 a group of about 20 of us walk to Broughton's kitchen garden where astronomer Chris Higgins is waiting with a powerful telescope.\nHiggins talks us through various constellations and planets, and we take it in turns to look at them through the telescope. I am awestruck by the sight of Venus, which appears like a crescent moon, as well Jupiter with its four moons and its light and dark bands.\nThe group bonds quickly \u2013 our natural reserve seems to disappear as we ooh and aah at the cosmos. It's a freezing night, but no one wants to go inside. It feels like a gift \u2013 this clear, beautiful night \u2013 and we can't stop staring at the sky. After a while, I let go of trying to understand the science and just gaze up, letting the cool light of the stars calm me. I love the idea that while almost everything on our planet has changed since the beginning of humanity, the beauty of the night sky has remained the same. I am staring up at the same view my ancestors marvelled at, and there is something deeply grounding about that.\nI am hooked. When I return home, I start searching for star-bathing retreats. At the top of my wish-list is luxury off-grid retreat centre Bliss & Stars, located two hours from the nearest village in South Africa's Cederberg Wilderness Area. Launched in 2019 by Daria and Heine Rasmussen, it offers three-night star-bathing retreats, featuring guided stargazing sessions, nature immersion, mindfulness, breathwork under the stars and night hikes.\u00a0\nDaria tells me that many visitors have profound experiences gazing at the night sky. \"One guest, numbed by years of trauma, experienced a breakthrough while observing Saturn's rings, describing it as 'awe as exorcism' that rebooted his capacity for joy,\" she says. \"Another guest, a grieving mother, found solace in our wilderness night ventures and naked-eye stargazing, saying: 'It felt like the universe was mourning with me.'\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The seven travel trends that will shape 2025\n\u2022\u00a0Five extraordinary night-time experiences around the world\n\u2022\u00a0Swede dreams: How Sweden is embracing its sleepy side\u00a0\u00a0\nAlso high on my bucket list is Chile's Atacama Desert, which features the world's darkest, clearest skies. Elqui Domos Hotel has been designed specifically for appreciating these pristine night skies \u2013 it features geodesic rooms with retractable roofs to allow guests to look straight up from their bed. Hotel Ranga in Iceland, meanwhile, features a state-of-the-art observatory, and offers the chance to take part in mindful stargazing from outdoor hot tubs fed by geothermally heated water.\nIn the Scottish Highlands, Cairngorm Excursions runs star-bathing parties, bringing people together for a night of stargazing far from any light pollution, with hot drinks, traditional stovies (a Scottish dish made from meat and potatoes), blankets and log seating. This being Scotland, the evenings also feature a gin, whisky and rum sampling experience put on by a local distillery.\nAboriginal Australians are thought to be the world's first astronomers, and a growing number of experiences offer visitors a chance to learn about Indigenous astronomy. Aboriginal-owned Ngurrangga Tours offers an overnight trip in Western Australia's Millstream Chichester National Park with an evening of camping, exploring the wilderness and learning about Indigenous star stories. In Sydney, Fantasea Cruising offers an Aboriginal Sky Dreaming Cruise on the harbour, with an Aboriginal astronomer sharing stories of the Sun, Moon and stars that have been passed down by ancestors.\u00a0\nFor now, I go out into my Bristol garden on clear nights and lie down on a blanket. The sky is nowhere near as dark as it was in Yorkshire, and light pollution obscures many of the stars, but I find that I can still slip into that now familiar sense of peace.\nPerhaps it doesn't matter how many stars I can see. As Westmoquette says: \"Even if you can only see one star \u2013 that light's been travelling across the universe for hundreds and hundreds of years to hit your eyeball at that precise moment. Against all the odds, you're seeing that ray of light. That means something.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

She was playing so well, she was pretty dominant in her performance, especially in and around breakdown stuff. \n\"So it was unfortunate to lose her for a week, but Jade does have that experience that we can call on.

        "article_text": "How has Thomas Tuchel changed things with England?\nChanging training times, more direct forms of communication and encouraging a swagger - Thomas Tuchel has already started doing things his way.\nThe Three Lions' new German boss guided England to routine victories over Albania and Latvia in World Cup qualifying as life after Gareth Southgate began successfully.\nBut what changes from the Southgate era have been implemented, and are now at the heart of shaping what Tuchel hopes is England's journey to World Cup glory?\nHere we explore some of these changes inside the England camp.\n'We will get there' - who were winners & losers for Tuchel's England?\n'England show Tuchel's search for thrills will be no quick fix'\nTraining has been moved to late afternoon in a key technical diversion from Southgate's regime.\nUnder Southgate, who was England manager for eight years, players would generally train after breakfast but Tuchel is scheduling his sessions for post-lunch, with training held towards late afternoon.\nThe hope is the change in approach will allow England's players and staff to have a longer period during the day to prepare for their sessions.\nLater training is a concept coaches have utilised with increasing regularity in recent years, with a view to improving performance amid a view that holding sessions closer to matchday kick-off times can benefit players during the actual 90 minutes.\nThere are also said to be benefits to training intensity linked to body temperature, oxygen consumption and sleep recovery with later sessions.\nCertain sessions ran into early evening, meaning training under portable floodlights.\nThis video can not be played\nIt's a good start - with room to improve - Tuchel\nTuchel has been maintaining communication with players outside of the international window.\nSouthgate also used to stay within earshot of his players, but by all accounts Tuchel's dedication to staying connected has gone above and beyond his predecessor.\nHe also kept in touch with players who ultimately didn't make his squad, to explain the reasons why and what was required moving forward for them to earn a recall.\nIt's the sort of transparency players have appreciated, although such honesty can often be difficult for certain footballers to hear.\nIt is understood Tuchel has even offered certain players career advice for the summer transfer window, as to whether a fresh start at a new club would benefit their international hopes.\nWhere Southgate, certainly towards the end of his reign, would break the news to new or unexpected call-ups on the day of a squad announcement, Tuchel confirmed with some players that they would be called up the evening before the big reveal.\nAll players who were on Tuchel's radar received a text in the days leading up to the squad announcement informing them that they could be called up.\nMost of the 26 players actually confirmed in Tuchel's squad all received messages at about 07:30 GMT, before the 09:00 announcement on 14 March.\nClubs would usually be told hours in advance if their players had been selected.

Tuchel is determined to build on that existing camaraderie.\nIndeed, the England head coach stressed the importance of relationships in his first address to the team on Monday night.\nIn his opening speech, Tuchel reiterated they have just 24 training sessions together before USA 2026 gets under way.\nTo that end, the former Chelsea boss admitted he would not be making drastic changes to the playing style Southgate had developed.\nBased on the opening training sessions, it quickly became apparent that Tuchel would employ a four-man defence - despite conjecture the German would use a three-at-the-back system he relied on successfully at Chelsea.\nThe overriding message of Tuchel's address, though, was one of triumph and history.\n\"He said the goal was to put another star on the jersey,\" divulged Burn last week.\n\nThis video can not be played\nWhy you shouldn't want Tuchel's England peaking now\nWatch The Football News Show on BBC iPlayer\nAn exciting start or lots of work needed?

Similarly, the England players have been split on the merits of Tuchel's remarks.\nTime will tell whether Tuchel can fulfil his mission by lifting the World Cup in 16 months' time.\nIf he does, he will be doing it his way.",

'Tuchel wants swagger' - what has changed under new England bossImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, How has Thomas Tuchel changed things with England?Sami MokbelSenior football correspondentPublished25 March 2025568 CommentsChanging training times, more direct forms of communication and encouraging a swagger - Thomas Tuchel has already started doing things his way.The Three Lions' new German boss guided England to routine victories over Albania and Latvia in World Cup qualifying as life after Gareth Southgate began successfully.But what changes from the Southgate era have been implemented, and are now at the heart of shaping what Tuchel hopes is England's journey to World Cup glory?Here we explore some of these changes inside the England camp. For example, Morgan Rogers and Anthony Gordon featured heavily in shape training the day before the Albania game, causing many in camp to believe the pair would start the game.Yet both started on the bench - though Rogers was named in the XI against Latvia.Not that the uncertainty over team selection appears to have hindered the players.Six points, five goals and two clean sheets represents an encouraging start for Tuchel.An opening speech on 'triumph and history'Jordan Henderson and Dan Burn, two of Tuchel's most unexpected selections, were among the first through the door when the squad convened last Monday afternoon.The players arrived to a flurry of broadcast activity, which has proved so popular with England's social media output.At the club's Hilton hotel base at St George's Park, Tuchel has placed a keen emphasis on having various communal areas for his players to relax together.Playing video games, of which Rice is said to be the squad standard-bearer, remains a popular pastime.Southgate put a major emphasis on his players building a bond.

        "article_text": "We are down to the last eight teams in this season's FA Cup, but which of them will lift the famous old trophy at Wembley in May?\nApart from defending Premier League champions Manchester City, none of the quarter-finalists have won any major silverware since the turn of the millennium, and four of them have never won the FA Cup at all.\n\"We all saw how much winning the Carabao Cup meant to Newcastle fans after their long wait for a trophy,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\"Liverpool and Arsenal are out, and City are clearly not the force they were, so this feels like a big chance for the other teams left in it to get some glory - I just hope they try to take it.\"\nSutton has made his predictions for all four sixth-round ties and for this weekend's matches he is up against Brit-nominated DJ and producer Nathan Dawe, who is an Aston Villa fan.\nDawe's new single featuring vocalist Abi Flynn, Here In Your Arms, is out now.\nDo you agree with their predictions? You can choose who you think will win each tie, below.\nDawe has had three UK top-10 singles and another four have reached the top 40. He made a surprise appearance on last month's Love Island All Stars final, playing Here In Your Arms at a pool party for the remaining couples\nVilla have not won a major trophy since the 1996 League Cup but are chasing silverware on two fronts this season and are into the last eight of the Champions League [where they play Paris St-Germain] as well as the FA Cup.\n\"I'm still in dreamland,\" Nathan told BBC Sport. \"I still can't believe I am going to Paris in a couple of weeks to watch us in a Champions League quarter-final.\n\"Honestly, it has not sunk in. I only ever used to hear about these glory days from my dad, but now we are actually able to experience it together. It's just unbelievable.\n\"What Unai Emery has done since taking charge in 2022 is just astronomical, and the players and fans are fully on board with what he is doing.\n\"Even when things are not going so well, it is clear that the team still has full confidence in the manager to have a Plan B or C to turn games around, and we have seen that happen on multiple occasions this season.\"\nAllow TikTok content?\nThis article contains content provided by TikTok.

It means so much to Villa fans because hardly any of us are alive who have seen us win it.\n\"Even my dad wasn't born the last time we won it [in 1957] and winning at Wembley would be very special. \n\"I've been lucky enough to go there a few times with Villa but other than our play-off win when we got promoted in 2019,  it has always ended up in misery.\"\nChris Sutton and Nathan Dawe were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\nGap = league places between the two teams\nCraven Cottage, 12:15 GMT\n8th in Premier League v 12th in Premier League\nGap = 4\nLast major trophy? Fulham: Never. Palace: Never\nBest FA Cup run? Fulham: runners-up in 1975. Palace: runners-up in 1990 & 2016\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.\nCrystal Palace won at Craven Cottage at the end of February and it is a ground where they have a decent record - they haven't lost there in their past six visits, since 2005.\nIt's a boost for Palace that Jean-Philippe Mateta is available to lead their attack - he can play wearing a special mask to protect his ear after his injury against Millwall in the fifth round - but we will have to see how much he has been affected by such a horrific challenge.\nThis video can not be played\nMillwall's Roberts sent off for 'dangerous' tackle on Mateta\nThe Eagles are a well-balanced team who seem to be improving all the time under Oliver Glasner - they have lost only two of their past 14 games in all competitions.\nI've found Fulham hard to predict this season because they've been less reliable than usual at home, but they are still having a strong campaign - they are in the mix for the Champions League places, and are only three points behind fifth-placed City.\nPalace are very strong on the road but they have not played for the past three weeks - their game against Newcastle before the international break was postponed because of the Carabao Cup final.\nWe often talk about teams needing a rest, but my concern is how that break has affected their momentum.\nThis is going to be a close game, but I actually fancy Fulham to edge it. Marco Silva's side have got goals in them, and my gut feeling is that they will get through in 90 minutes.\nI just hope both managers go for it properly, and don't prioritise next week's midweek Premier League games [Fulham are at Arsenal on Tuesday and Palace travel to Southampton on Wednesday] instead of this tie.\nFulham and Palace have shown this season they have got enough quality in their strongest starting XIs to go all the way in the FA Cup, especially this year when the competition appears so open. \nThey are both in a great position to finally win a major trophy, so why not try to make history and give their fans something to celebrate?\nPalace's only previous cup success was winning the Zenith Data Systems Cup in 1991. \nI can imagine their fans enjoyed that day a lot, but lifting the FA Cup would be on a different planet, and the same goes for Fulham, who have not even been in an FA Cup semi-final since 2002.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nNathan's prediction: It feels like Palace always turn into world-beaters in the last couple of months of the season, and I can see them winning this. 1-2\nAmex Stadium, 17:15 GMT\n7th in Premier League v 3rd in Premier League\nGap = 4\nLast major trophy? Brighton: Never. Forest: 1990 League Cup\nBest FA Cup run? Brighton: runners-up in 1983. Forest: winners in 1898 & 1959\nWatch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.\nBrighton will see this as the chance to get revenge for their 7-0 defeat at the City Ground at the start of February.\nI am sure some people felt the wheels had come off for Seagulls boss Fabian Hurzeler after that result, but instead his side have bounced back and gone on a great run of six wins and one draw in all competitions.\nSometimes getting thrashed like that can have a positive effect on a team, and clear the air. \nI remember losing 7-1 at Blackburn Rovers in October 1992, when I was a centre-half for Norwich City, but we had a crate of beer on the coach home to put things right and we were still top of the  Premier League table at Christmas. I did get moved up front after that though.\nAs for Nottingham Forest, they are the only team left in the FA Cup where I could understand it if they rested players this weekend, because of their league position.\nThey play Manchester United on Tuesday and the finish line is in sight for my boyhood team to finish third and secure Champions League football.\nThat's why it's disappointing to hear about Chris Wood getting injured while playing for New Zealand this week.\nHopefully it is not serious, but it is a blow for Forest if they are without their main number nine for any length of time.\nTheir game plan won't change without Wood - they will sit deep and attack on the break, it is just a question on whether it is their A team who face Brighton or not, and my hunch is that Nuno Espirito Santo will make a few changes.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nNathan's prediction: Forest are in such a good position in the league, I have a feeling they are going to be super-focused on that. For that reason, I am going with Brighton. 2-0\nDeepdale, 13:30 BST\n14th in Championship v 9th in Premier League\nGap = 25\nLast major trophy? Preston: 1938 FA Cup. Villa: 1996 League Cup\nBest FA Cup run? Preston: winners 1889 & 1938. Villa: winners x7 between 1887 & 1957\nWatch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.\nPreston are hard to beat at home and have not lost at Deepdale since 2 November, a run of 15 games.\nI've seen quite a bit of Paul Heckingbottom's team this season and they will defend deep, set up in a 3-5-2 shape and make themselves hard to break down.\nIt's an old football cliche, but in this case it is very true that the first goal will be extremely important.\nAston Villa have got some brilliant attacking players, but I also always feel like teams can score against them.\nIf they go behind, they could have problems but I do feel their quality should see them through - depending on Unai Emery's team selection of course, with a big league game coming up at Brighton on Wednesday.\nVilla have got their eyes on numerous prizes and there probably hasn't been excitement levels like this at the club since Martin O'Neill signed me in 2006.\nI'm still backing them here, but it is going to be a cagey game, and they might have to wait to make the breakthrough before a couple of late goals get the job done.\nI'm going for Emi Martinez to keep a clean sheet, too. His keepie-uppie antics, external to wind up Brazil while playing for Argentina this week were another reminder of why he is the best goalkeeper in the world. Anyone who can produce moments like that in a game of that magnitude deserves all the accolades you can get.\nSutton's prediction: 0-2\nNathan's prediction: The FA Cup has opened up for us this season, and it feels like we are the favourites now. I just really hope our schedule doesn't take too much toll on the players and we fall short because of that, but I am looking forward to the rest of the season for sure. \nBrighton will be tough on Wednesday so what do we prioritise, even with a quality squad like ours? That part is down to Emery, and he will probably rest a couple of first-choice players on Sunday, but I would love us to go to Preston, put out a strong team and win comfortably. I am not super-convinced that is going to happen anyway though, even if we don't make lots of changes, because Preston will throw everything at us. \nIt won't be as easy as people might think, but I do expect us to go through.  0-1\nVitality Stadium, 16:30 BST\n10th in Premier League v 5th in Premier League\nGap = 5\nLast major trophy? Bournemouth: never. City: 2024 Premier League\nBest FA Cup run? Bournemouth: quarter-finals 1957 & 2021. City: winners x7 between 1904 & 2023\nThis is such a difficult tie to call.\nBournemouth were the team who started the rot for Manchester City when they deservedly beat them in November, for what was the defending champions' first league defeat of the season.\nBack then, they were still 'mighty City', the team who were dominating English football, who hardly ever slipped up. \nWho would have imagined that, five months on, they would have lost eight of their next 19 league games and be in the position they are now, with just the FA Cup left as the only thing they can win?\nThis competition is huge for City now, because it feels so crucial for boss Pep Guardiola to finish such a difficult season with a piece of silverware.\nSo, it helps him that the Cherries are not in great form, with only one point from their past four league games, and also that they are without two key defenders here; Milos Kerkez and Dean Huijsen, who are both suspended.\nCity are still far from convincing at the moment, however, and it is hard to know what their strongest line-up is.\nPhil Foden's struggles for England last week were a reminder of how last season's PFA and FWA Player of the Year has been a shadow of his usual self all campaign, but he is not the only City player to have been well below his best.\nStill, there is no chance of Pep saving anyone for Wednesday's league game against Leicester, even though City have got a real fight on their hands to finish in the top five.\nPep always takes the FA Cup seriously anyway, and he has shown that by reaching the semi-finals for each of the past six seasons - something no other team had done before.\nWill City make it to the last four again? Yes... but only just.\nBournemouth are so good with their press that they won't allow City to easily play out from the back - there are going to be plenty of goals, and I can see it being settled in extra-time.\nSutton's prediction: 2-3 after extra-time\nNathan's prediction: Bournemouth are having a good season but I am still backing City to get through. 1-3\nThere were eight Premier League games played in week 29, the last set of fixtures before the international break.\nSo far, Chris and his guest, Divorce singer Felix, have both got four correct results, with one exact score, giving them both 70 points.\nFor now, it goes down as a win for the BBC readers - using the most popular scoreline from your predictions for each game, you got five correct results, with one exact score, leaving you on 80 points.\nThe remaining two games were rearranged because of the Carabao Cup final. \nNo-one picked up any points from Liverpool's draw with Aston Villa, which was moved forward to 19 February, so the weekly winner will be decided when Newcastle host Crystal Palace on 16 April - Felix has gone for a 2-1 Palace win.\nChris and Felix also made a prediction for the Carabao Cup final, and they both wrongly picked Liverpool to win it. \nThey were not alone, because the majority BBC readers also went for a Reds victory - out of almost 38,000 predictions, 73% of you thought Arne Slot's side would prevail.",

        "article_text": "The daring, radical Pompidou Centre was derided by many when its design was first unveiled \u2013 yet it has continued to influence the architecture of public buildings ever since. As the building approaches a major renovation, its co-creator Renzo Piano recalls the furore.\nThis summer, the Centre Pompidou will close for five years, as Paris's popular polychrome landmark undergoes changes necessitated by current requirements in terms of health, safety and energy efficiency. French studio Moreau Kusunoki Architects, Mexican practice Frida Escobedo Studio and French engineer AIA Life Designers will undertake a major overhaul of the six-storey arts centre, containing Europe's largest museum of modern art. Its renovation will add usable floor space, remove asbestos from all facades, improve fire safety and accessibility for people with reduced mobility, and optimise energy efficiency.\nAs far as possible, the original building will be conserved as it was before. To do otherwise might be considered cultural sacrilege \u2013 after all the Pompidou's identity is indivisible from its original architects, Renzo Piano, and the late Richard Rogers. The duo set up their practice, Rogers + Piano, in 1970, and submitted a design to a prestigious competition instigated in 1971 by Georges Pompidou, France\u2019s President from 1969 until 1974. Its jury was headed up by Jean Prouv\u00e9, a metalworker and self-taught architect, and included such stellar architects as Philip Johnson and Oscar Niemeyer. Piano and Rogers' design was chosen from 681 competition entries.\nThe result caught the duo, then unknowns in their 30s \"with Beatles haircuts\", as Piano puts it, by surprise: \"We didn't think we'd win, we entered the competition for pleasure,\" the Italian architect, now 87, tells the BBC. \"We never planned to create a revolutionary building. Our idea was a museum that would inspire curiosity, not intimidate people, and that would open up culture to all.\"\nIn fact, the duo's insouciance may help to explain the building's uninhibited boldness, flamboyance and ludic quality. Its structural elements and services were placed on its facades, allowing it to maximise its internal, open-plan spaces \u2013 and prompting the futuristic structure to be dubbed the world\u2019s first \"inside-out\" building. Its exoskeleton of tubes and periscope-like pipes were playfully colour-coded: blue for air-conditioning, yellow for electricity, green for water and red for pedestrian circulation. Visitors streamed up escalators \u2013 encased in transparent tubing affording panoramic views \u2013 that were designed to reinforce the museum's connection to the city.\n\"Our idea was for the building to take up only half the site, allowing for a welcoming outdoor place \u2013 a piazza \u2013 where people could meet,\" says Piano, whose other projects include the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco (rebuilt in 2008), the Shard (2012) in London, and the recently completed Paddington Square, also in the UK capital, a mixed-use building and public square. \"Our credo was a place for all people \u2013 for the poor and rich, the young and old.\"\nCulture Shifters\nCulture Shifters is an interview series in which high-profile creatives reflect on a work of theirs which made a big impact on the world. Read more articles from the series\u00a0here.\nThe Pompidou's transparency, accessibility and adjacent piazza chimed with new ideas about democratising culture. \"Street theatre and concerts in public spaces were rising in popularity at the time,\" says Piano.\nInside the building, visitors had access to the Biblioth\u00e8que Publique d'Information \u2013 Paris's first free public library \u2013 the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne and the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/ Musique (IRCAM), dedicated to research of music and sound.\u00a0\nPiano and Rogers' winning entry provoked consternation and fury when it was announced at a press conference: \"The room was packed,\" remembers Piano. \"Richard and I were standing in the middle of the room being heckled. We felt elated yet terrible at the same time,\" says the architect. \"Some people were shouting, 'Why have you designed something so horrible?' 'Why are you are destroying Paris's historic centre?'\"\nAlthough surprised to have won the contest, Genoa-born Piano grew up feeling architecture was his destiny \u2013 aged 18, he told his father he wanted to be an architect. However in conversation his manner is humble, not entitled. Born into a family of builders in Genoa, he loved watching his father's work take shape. Perhaps his childhood experience of seeing buildings materialise successfully made him feel that architecture is open to all possibilities. \"Building is a beautiful gesture,\" he once told The Financial Times. \"It's the opposite of destruction\u2026 especially when you are creating buildings for people because they are civically important.\"\u00a0In 1981, Piano founded the Renzo Piano Building Workshop (RPBW), with offices in Genoa and Paris, led today by 11 partners (in the spirit of a collective). In 1998, he won the Pritzker Architecture Prize. \u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The swinging 60s icon who revolutionised style\n\u2022 The star tidying guru who transformed our homes\n\u2022 How to transform your home with art\nThe Plateau Beaubourg in central Paris \u2013 a stretch of wasteland occupied by a car park \u2013 was the site chosen for the new Mus\u00e9e Nationale d'Art Moderne (formerly housed in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris's haut-bourgeois 16th arrondissement). \"It was a place waiting for something to happen,\" says Piano.\nFrance's social and political climate at the time, still rebellious following the tumultuous events of May 1968, was conducive to the creation of a building as disruptive as the Centre Pompidou, acknowledges Piano: \"In Britain, society was being revolutionised by [designer] Mary Quant and the Beatles. The same was happening in Paris.\" The Centre Pompidou was partly inspired by the ultra-pop architecture of experimental London-based architecture collective Archigram.\n\"The idea that France should have a 'Maison de la Culture', bringing together art, cinema, music and literature in cities was first invented by Andr\u00e9 Malraux [novelist, art theorist and France's first Minister of Cultural Affairs].\u00a0Pompidou was very supportive, too. I really believe that major shifts in architecture are only possible if you have a good client. George's wife, Claude, too, was an excellent lady.\"\nPompidou, like Claude, was passionate about contemporary art and design.\u00a0In 1972, they invited Pierre Paulin, a designer known for his space-age era furniture, to create new interiors for the private apartment of the Elys\u00e9e Palace, the French presidents' official residence. The results were radically modern \u2013\u00a0the walls of the living room, dining room and smoking room were lined to cocooning effect with wool and polyester panels that obscured the residence's neo-classical splendour. Walls were hung with paintings by Robert Delaunay and other modernist artists.\nOne impetus behind these efforts to provide Paris with a prestigious museum was that France had lost its reputation as the world's pre-eminent centre of avant-garde art. \"It is my passionate wish for Paris to have a cultural centre like the ones they've been creating in the US,\" Pompidou told Le Monde newspaper in 1972. \"It will be both a museum and centre of creation, where the visual arts take up residence with music, film, books and audiovisual research.\"\nInitially, reactions to the Centre Pompidou, frequently compared to an alien spaceship, were often extremely negative. \"Taxi drivers used to say to me: 'Regardez!' before launching into a tirade against the building. With so much hostility, I had to keep a low profile among strangers,\" says Piano. The building, derisively likened by many to an \"oil refinery\", was the target of countless lawsuits. \"We were sued so often \u2013 once on the grounds that Prouv\u00e9 wasn't a qualified architect,\" he recalls. The French press initially lambasted the building. \"Paris has its own monster, just like the one in Loch Ness,\" scoffed Le Figaro.\n\"One day Richard and I were outside the building, as yet unfinished. We saw a woman struggling with an umbrella that had turned inside out in the wind and Richard rushed over to help fix it. When he mentioned that he was one of the building's architects, she jokily mimicked hitting him with the umbrella as if to suggest he was a naughty scoundrel.\"\nYet after the building's opening in 1977, Parisians soon began to appreciate the museum \u2013 now one of Paris's most visited public institutions, that ranks behind only the Louvre and Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in terms of visitor numbers.\nIt also inspires architects today. \"The Centre Pompidou, radical on completion, has continued to influence the design of public buildings ever since,\" says Hugh Broughton, founder of London-based Hugh Broughton Architects, who finds qualities in it other than its famously high-tech idiom. \"It's an amazingly brave, generous building whose large public space promotes congregation, street theatre and the highest quality people-watching. Its core concept \u2013 open-plan floor plates supported by peripheral structure and services \u2013 draws upon medieval principles of castle structures, and combines this with an Arts and Crafts approach that makes a virtue of construction as an aesthetic medium. The result is a building which is dynamic, inviting, egalitarian, transparent and has awesome views \u2013 all the best attributes of great architecture. It changed the way a whole generation of architects think about buildings \u2013 placing their users at centre stage.\"\nPiano is also known for harnessing light in his projects to ethereal effect, as is the case with the Shard, which can seem to disappear in certain light conditions due to its glass skin. Architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff has said of his works as a whole: \"The serenity of Renzo Piano's best buildings can almost make you believe we live in a civilised world.\"\u00a0\nFor Piano, what is the main architectural legacy of the Pompidou Centre? \"The building is proof that culture doesn't suffer from being more public. It's a place where people gather primarily. It brings together art, life and culture \u2013 not culture with a big C but culture with a small c. When it opened, it brought culture to all, and made the city a better place for it.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

He has been convicted of all four deaths and is serving a life sentence.\nHarris and Myran were identified earlier this month after being found in the Prairie Green Landfill, north of Winnipeg.

        "article_text": "Once considered a nuisance, herds of semi-wild horses roaming the countryside in Bosnia-Herzegovina are now drawing tourists.\nThe rock-strewn valleys and rugged mountains of western Bosnia and Herzegovina conceal an elusive and extraordinary sight: herds of semi-wild horses roaming freely across the landscape. \u00a0\nCurrently totalling around 1,000 horses, these herds wander the Cincar Mountains and other areas between the towns of Livno, whose stone-built homes and mosques at the base of Mount Krug are a testament to 400 years of Ottoman rule, and Kupres, the highest city in the country. They're Bosnian Mountain Horses, descendants of domesticated horses that were released into the wild due to various reasons, from war to industrialisation, and have since been saved from extinction.\n\"Horses like this were once the backbone of the agricultural industry here,\" BBC Travel Show host Rajan Datar said in a recent episode on the region. \"But once tractors and modern machinery arrived, many farmers set their horses free to fend for themselves in the wild.\"\nBecause of their domesticated roots, the horses are less wary of humans than true wild horses, which has made them a draw for tourists but also\u00a0a source of tension. In winter, they can often be found licking salt from roads in the winter, becoming a danger both to drivers and themselves. They have also been known to raid local farms for food, destroying crops and stealing water from livestock. Many locals see them as a nuisance, and some farmers have even gone so far as to kill horses found on their land. A 2009 decision to protect the herds was rescinded in 2017 due to the overwhelming cost of the damage claims.\nYet, in recent years, attitudes have begun to shift. As tourism to the country has increased in the past two decades, so has visitor interest in the animals. Their nomadic nature means that local guides are necessary to view the horses, and a host of local tourism businesses have cropped up to meet this demand, creating a significant economic impact in this rural region.\nLocal community organisations, such as the Environmental Association of Borova Glava, have also stepped in to help care for the animals and mitigate conflicts. For volunteers like Zeljko Kristo, a spokesperson for the organisation, the horses also serve as a symbol of how the country has healed from the war, which raged from 1992 to 1995 following the breakup of Yugoslavia.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Will you be going on holiday to\u2026 Greenland next year?\n\u2022 Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers\n\u2022 Are you really helping when you join an 'expedition tour'?\n\"Besides humans, horses also found themselves in an awkward situation because [of the war],\" he explained. \"Looking back, years have passed, and we managed to save them \u2013 but at the same time, we saved ourselves.\"\nFor travellers interested in seeing the horses, Livno is the best place to start. The animals are commonly found roaming the hills and valleys around this part of the country, but their movements can be unpredictable. To increase the chance of seeing them, it's highly recommended that visitors hire a guide, who will be more knowledgeable about the horses' movements and habits. Local tour companies also provide transportation from town to the more remote areas where the herds can be found. What's more, many of these businesses donate some of the proceeds from their tours to the care of the animals, ensuring they can continue to roam these wild landscapes for years to come.\n\u00a0--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

Here are her top local picks, from brunch at Toast to people watching at the Beltline.\nAtlanta \u2013 the state capital of Georgia and the unofficial capital of the American South \u2013 started its life as a railroad terminus in 1837 and has served as a hub for American culture ever since.\nThe SpeciaList\nKandi Burruss is an Atlanta born-and-based musician, producer, actor, business owner and reality TV star. She has worked with celebrities like Ariana Grande and Ed Sheeran, and her work on the single No Scrubs earned her a Grammy Award in 1999. She is the owner of Bedroom\u00a0Kandi, a line of sex toys; Kandi Koated cosmetics; and hosts a podcast called The Business of Pleasure. In addition to appearing on The Real Housewives of Atlanta for 14 seasons, Burruss recently starred in Showtime's The Chi and Hulu's Reasonable Doubt. In 2021, the Atlanta suburb South Fulton declared 18 December Kandi Burruss Tucker Day.\nRanking among the top cities for US tourism, Atlanta consistently draws visitors with its dynamic contemporary art scene and iconic soul food, as well as its abundance of greenery and sprawling historic estates. One of the main epicentres of the hip hop industry, it has also secured its place in music history, nurturing a long line of homegrown talent \u2013 like Kandi Burruss, the Atlanta-born singer, songwriter, producer and star of The Real Housewives of Atlanta.\nThe future songstress was raised in the Atlanta suburb of East Point, where she attended Tri-Cities High School of Visual and Performing Arts and met the other members of R&B girl group Xscape; later going on to co-write the 1993 hit No Scrubs for TLC. Burruss joined the Real Housewives of Atlanta cast for its sophomore season in 2010, becoming a fan favourite and one of the longest-tenured housewives before leaving the show in 2024. Her latest venture takes her to New York City as she and her husband, Todd Tucker, co-produce the new Broadway production of Othello at the Barrymore Theatre, starring Academy Award winners Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal.\nBut Burruss is an Atlanta girl through and through.\u00a0\"I was born and raised in Atlanta, so I am Atlanta,\" she says. \"This is home base for me.\"\nHer time on Real Housewives allowed her to celebrate her Atlanta roots, and chronicled meeting her husband and the birth of her son, Ace. \"It's been kind of cool to say I can go back and watch 14 years of my life,\" she says. \"It was a great experience.\"\nCameras followed Burruss and her co-stars as they crisscrossed the city to attend fashion shows; local restaurants, like 80-year-old Mary Mac's Tea Room; and major landmarks like the Georgia Aquarium, which set the scene for one of the show's beloved end-of-season reunions.\nBurruss owns various enterprises in town, including two restaurants and her business camp The Kandi Factory HQ (\"You have to have an invite,\" she says), which put her at the heart of Atlanta's often over-the-top social scene.\u00a0\n\"Atlanta is a vibe,\" she declares. \"It\u2019s a great place for work, fun, and the weather hits all four seasons; it\u2019s such a place to be.\"\nHere are Burruss's favourite ways to experience her hometown of Atlanta.\nIf visitors are looking to drop some major coin, Burruss isn't against hitting up some of the most recognisable spots in Atlanta.\n\"People always go to Lenox [Square] or Phipps [Plaza] if they want to shop,\" she says.\nBoth malls are in the city's upscale Buckhead neighbourhood and include the designer labels that Burruss and her co-stars wear on the show, like Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Dior. The Waldorf Astoria Atlanta Buckhead and the InterContinental Buckhead Altanta hotels, both located nearby, played host to the Real Housewives of Atlanta for various events, like Nene Leakes's wedding in 2013.\nWebsite: https://www.simon.com/mall/lenox-square/\nAddress: 3393 Peachtree Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30326\nPhone: +14042336767\nInstagram: @lenoxsqmall\nWebsite: https://www.simon.com/mall/phipps-plaza\nAddress: 3500 Peachtree Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30326\nPhone: +14042620992\nInstagram: @shopphippsplaza\nAtlanta has 53 restaurants listed in the Michelin Guide (and eateries like Fishmonger and Staplehouse have taken top spots on Bon App\u00e9tit's Best New Restaurants listings in recent years), but diners can also enjoy the city's iconic Southern dishes like fried chicken at The Busy Bee Cafe and peach cobbler at Ms Ruby's Peach Cobbler Caf\u00e9 in Buckhead.\nAnyone looking to refuel after a late night or keep the party going after a big celebration can opt for brunch; another reality TV standby. While Burruss famously doesn't imbibe, she's happy to recommend her favourite spot.\n\"If I wanted to get up and go to brunch, it's a place called Toast. They have a great brunch,\" Burruss says of the trendy eatery, found just outside of Atlanta's Buckhead neighbourhood. \"The food is really good.\"\nVisitors can feast on \"New American Brunch\" dishes like strawberry-shortcake French toast or fried catfish and grits, while fans of Real Housewives will recognise the restaurant as the spot where Burruss feuded with her co-star Marlo Hampton at Shere\u00e9 Whitfield's Keepin' it Gucci brunch in 2023.\nWebsite: https://www.toastonlenoxatl.com/\nAddress: 2770 Lenox Rd Suite B-1, Atlanta, GA 30324\nPhone: +14047484594\nInstagram: @toastonlenox\nAs Burruss knows, getting a group of girlfriends together is no easy feat. So she looks for venues with good vibes and good music to accompany any tea that might get spilled (gossip) when she and her girls get together.\n\"My friend Rasheeda owns a place called Frost Bistro. We might hang out there, because they play good music,\" Burruss says. Fans of reality TV may also remember the restaurant from VH1's Love & Hip Hop Atlanta. Rasheeda and Kirk Frost, who have headlined the show since 2012, opened the casual Southern-style bistro back in 2020, offering a breakfast and brunch menu full of inventive cocktails and modern, stick-to-your-ribs Georgia-style dishes.\u00a0\n\"I like the oxtail and grits, the snapper and the French toast,\" says Burruss.\nWebsite: https://frostbistro.com/\nAddress: 281 Peters St SW, Atlanta, GA 30313\nPhone: +14049635495\nInstagram: @frostbistro\n\nAtlantic Station is a favourite for locals and tourists, thanks to its views, restaurants and family-friendly attractions.\nWhen to come\n\"The summer is fun,\" says Burruss. \"It\u2019s never just one event; it\u2019s a ton of events. People are out all summer long. It's consistent. That's what I love about Atlanta \u2013 there\u2019s always multiple things happening.\"\nThe building was once a steel mill and has since been transformed into a collection of boutiques, eateries and apartments. Its location between Atlanta's West Side, Home Park and South Buckhead makes it easy for visitors to get to no matter where they're coming from.\n\"You want to go to Atlantic Station. They always have a lot of kids hanging out and playing,\" Burruss says. \"I just took my son and his friends to Skyline Park at Ponce City Market. [They] have great restaurants in that building and on the rooftop is where Skyline Park is. So, you get an amazing view of the city.\"\nJust 15 minutes from Atlantic Station,\u00a0Skyline Park includes a miniature golf course, a three-storey slide, and Heege Tower, which gives riders a 360-degree view of Bucktown, Midtown and downtown Atlanta.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://atlanticstation.com/\nAddress: 1380\u00a0Atlantic Dr NW,\u00a0Atlanta,\u00a0GA\u00a030363\nPhone: +14049007900\nInstagram: @atlanticstation \nIn a past life, Atlanta's Beltline was a rail corridor that circled the city. Now, it's a pedestrian-friendly path where Burruss goes to soak up the sun. The star notes that it attracts people from all over the city, making it prime for people-watching. Its trails extend more than 11 miles and notable stops include the Atlanta Beltline Arboretum, The Beacon and Krog Street Market. Public art is on display, too, including rotating exhibitions of sculptures, murals and performances throughout the year.\n\"Especially when the weather is good,\" Burrus says. \"That's a fun time, because I like to just walk and people-watch. There's stops along the way where you can eat. In the summer, I like to ride my bike on the Beltline. I think that's kind of cool and fun.\"\nWebsite: https://beltline.org/\nAddress: 619 Edgewood Ave SE, Atlanta, GA 30312\nPhone: +14044773003\nInstagram: @atlantabeltline \n\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Billy Horschel made a birdie putt on the penultimate hole as Atlanta Drive GC beat New York GC to claim the inaugural TGL title in Florida\nAs Billy Horschel's golf ball disappeared into the hole, the American celebrated by sprinting, leaping, swearing and chucking his club. \nIt was an electrifying and animated move that became the signature moment of TGL's debut season.\nThat downhill, snaking and ultimately successful putt helped land Horschel and his Atlanta Drive team-mates Patrick Cantlay and Justin Thomas victory against the franchise known as New York Golf Club.\nThis was in the second of the best of three final series. The victors came from 3-0 down (a point is awarded for each hole won) to triumph 4-3 to take an unassailable 2-0 position.\nSuch a dramatic finish was exactly what the Tech-infused Golf League needed - the sort of climax envisaged by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy when they bought into the idea of a raucous indoor simulator version of the game.\nThe decisive putt, which involved a number of dramatic breaks, could be seen as a metaphor for an opening season that was far from straightforward.\nThere were technical glitches, blowout matches, necessary rule changes and a mixture of reactions from golf fans. But somehow the TGL eventually hit its target.\nIt yielded respectable television audiences, helped reveal players' personalities and engaged a somewhat younger audience. The median age for ESPN's viewership was 51 years old compared with the usual 63 for PGA Tour and LIV events.\nAtlanta Drive fight back to win inaugural TGL title\nAtlanta beat New York in opening match of TGL Final\nPlayed largely on Monday and Tuesday evenings, this was all about attracting viewers. It began promisingly with more than 900,000 in the US tuning in for the initial match in January, but audiences tapered off to eventually average around the half-million mark.\nThe early contests lacked a competitive edge. The players seemed to struggle with the concept - there was an awkwardness between a competition worth $21m in prize money and an environment that made it seem a hit-and-giggle event.\nIn one match Woods misunderstood a distance instruction by 100 yards and laughed it off. Imagine that in a tour event. It wouldn't happen. TGL's competitive credibility undoubtedly took a hit with that moment.\nThe tactic of playing the 'hammer' to make a hole worth double points did not work initially but became a more effective tool once the rules were adjusted to allow for three 'hammers'.\nThis dimension ultimately became a crucial factor in deciding the title and brought a welcome edge to proceedings.\nTGL created the sort of buzz that has been the target of the breakaway LIV tour.  The Saudi-based circuit, now in its fourth season, has only enjoyed limited success in that regard - most notably with their Adelaide tournament.\nHorschel's histrionics were straight out of the LIV playbook but did not seem out of place once TGL reached its play-off stage. The unalterably dead-pan Cantlay was a constant reminder that there was underlying serious business afoot.\nIt was Cantlay's chip against Cameron Young one hole after Horschel's dramatic putt that sealed Atlanta Drive's victory.\n\"It would be great for golf if this were to succeed,\" LIV's Phil Mickelson observed on social media. \n\"The golf fan is the most loyal fan in sports - buy a ticket, walk miles and see a fraction of the action. But this could allow the golf fan to buy a ticket, sit down and watch all of the action just like other sports. \n\"It could really be good for the game if it's compelling.\"\nLIV players are not currently eligible for TGL because it is backed by the PGA Tour.  That could change if a deal is done between the two rival tours and LIV's Brooks Koepka attended the match between Jupiter and The Bay on 25 February.\nThe start of the first of the two deciding matches on Monday was delayed by an overrunning Women's NCAA basketball game on ESPN2, which tells us of TGL's standing in the bigger sporting picture.\nNevertheless, it will return. Investment is deep for a project that boasts 11 of the world's top 15 golfers. The 1500 seat 250,000 square feet Sofi Centre venue on the Palm Beach State College campus cost $50m to build.\nAnd there are already thoughts of adding a second venue on America's west coast, although that would likely be years down the line.\n\"We're in the middle of an expansion process now,\" said Mike McCarley, the TMRW executive who co-founded the project with Woods and McIlroy.\n\"When exactly we make that decision - there's no timeline on it necessarily,\" McCarley added to the Palm Beach Post.\n\"We've had potential expansion team owners at every single match this season coming to visit us. Some of them, multiple times. Some of them have a lot of questions, a lot of feedback.\"\nTGL already has the backing of leading American sports investors, who are behind the six teams that competed.\nThey include the Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank (Atlanta Drive), John Henry and the Fenway Sports Group (Boston Common), New York Mets owner Steve Cohen (New York Golf Club), former Milwaukee Bucks owner Marc Lasry (The Bay Golf Club) and David Blitzer, who joined Woods' group that owns Jupiter Links.\n\"We really like those team owners that are operators of other sports teams and other professional leagues in their communities,\" McCarley said.\n\"But we got a lot of really interesting diverse people domestically and internationally. They can kind of take a look and see what it looks like going forward.\"\nFormer tennis great Serena Williams is co-owner of the Los Angeles team and her involvement prompts consideration over whether TGL missed a trick by not including some of the LPGA's top stars, such as Nelly Korda and Lydia Ko.\nLike LIV, TGL may struggle to win over traditional die-hard golf fans with its raucous environment, which is in stark contrast to the more genteel way golf is usually played.\nBut the new league was not brought in for the benefit of that constituency. It is there to broaden golf's base.\nSignificantly, the players seem to have enjoyed it and deem it worth incorporating into their early season schedules.\n\"Obviously it is a little bit of a challenge with everything we've got going through the year with our own schedules, but I don't think anyone has ever walked away and said 'this felt like a burden',\" Horschel stated after collecting his share of the $9m winners' spoils.\n\"I could never imagine what this was going to be,\" the reigning BMW PGA champion added. \"I remember coming into the arena in November and walking out and I was just in awe. I couldn't imagine what I was seeing.\n\"I described it like a football player walking into Mercedes-Benz Stadium right about to play, a basketball player walking out - Steph Curry walking out at Oracle Arena, stuff like that.\n\"Never imagined we'd be playing golf in an arena with a big simulator and people and music and chanting. It has been really cool and has sort of exceeded all of our expectations.\"",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has announced new import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts coming into the US.\nTrump said the latest tariffs would come into effect on 2 April, with charges on businesses importing vehicles starting the next day.

The neighbouring countries see goods worth billions cross borders each day.\nAhead of the announcement on Wednesday, shares in General Motors slid roughly 3%, while Stellantis - the owner of Jeep and Chrysler - fell 3.6%.\nIn a post on X, Elon Musk said Tesla would be affected by the measures. \"The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" he said.\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.\nThe companies that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government. Firms may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers.\nTrump's plan for car tariffs is his latest in his wider drive to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing within the US. \nBut while the measures can protect domestic businesses, they also raise costs for businesses reliant on parts from abroad.\nAnalysts have estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle, according to the Anderson Economic Group.\nTrump told reporters the tariffs would be \"permanent\" and reiterated his reasoning that: \"If you build your car in the United States there is no tariff.\"\nThe prime minister of Japan, the world's second largest exporter of cars, said it would put \"all options on the table\" in response to the tariffs. \nShares in Japanese carmakers - including Toyota, Nissan, Honda - all fell on Thursday.\nThese new tariffs are expected to come in on the same day as other countries are set to impose penalties on the US in retaliation against previously announced taxes.\nIt is not clear how the car tariffs might affect those plans.\nThe US was the top sales market for British-based Jaguar Land Rover last year, exceeding sales in the UK and China.\nUK Chancellor Rachel Reeves told the BBC the new tariffs would be \"bad for the UK, and bad for the US as well\", adding the UK was involved in \"extensive\" talks to avoid them being imposed in Britain.\nFor the UK, the US is the second largest car export market after the EU, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).\nIts chief executive Mike Hawes urged the UK and US governments to \"come together immediately and strike a deal that works for all\".\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called Trump's announcement a \"direct attack\" on his country and its car industry. \nEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc would consider the measures before any potential response.\nEarly on Thursday, Trump threatened \"far larger\" tariffs if the European Union and Canada worked together to do what he described as \"economic harm\" to the US.\nThe car industry is already grappling with the expanded tariffs on steel and aluminium.\nFord and General Motors among other major car firms have urged Trump to exempt the industry from any further duties.\nA 2024 study by the US International Trade Commission predicted that a 25% tariff on imports would reduce imports by almost 75%, while increasing average prices in the US by about 5%.\nWhite House officials said it wanted US workers make more parts, not simply assemble them, and have maintained their action is pushing firms to relocate. \nA day before the latest tariffs, South Korea's Hyundai announced it would invest $21bn (\u00a316.3bn) in the US and build a new steel plant in Louisiana.\nTrump hailed the investment as a \"clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work\".\nUnited Autoworkers union leader Shawn Fain, who had opposed Trump in the election, said the president was \"stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working class communities for decades\".\nElsewhere, head of trade group the American Automotive Policy Council, Matt Blunt, said car makers were \"committed\" to Trump's vision of \"increasing automotive production and jobs in the US\".

Researchers have finally been able to reveal it with cutting-edge techniques.\nIt is the only surviving fragment of a lost medieval manuscript telling the tale of Merlin and the early heroic years of King Arthur's court.\nIn it, the magician becomes a blind harpist who later vanishes into thin air. He will then reappear as a balding child who issues edicts to King Arthur wearing no underwear.\nThe shape-shifting Merlin \u2013 whose powers apparently stem from being the son of a woman impregnated by the devil \u2013 asks to bear Arthur's standard (a flag bearing his coat of arms) on the battlefield. The king agrees \u2013 a good decision it turns out \u2013 for Merlin is destined to turn up with a handy secret weapon: a magic, fire-breathing dragon.\u00a0\nFor over 400 years, this fragile remnant of a celebrated medieval story lay undisturbed and unnoticed, repurposed as a book cover by Elizabethans to help protect an archival register of property deeds.\nNow, the 700-year-old fragment of Suite Vulgate du Merlin \u2013 an Old French manuscript so rare there are less than 40 surviving copies in the world \u2013 has been discovered by an archivist in Cambridge University Library, folded and stitched into the binding of the 16th-Century register.\nUsing groundbreaking new technology, researchers at the library were able to digitally capture the most inaccessible parts of the fragile parchment without unfolding or unstitching it. This preserved the manuscript in situ and avoided irreparable damage \u2013 while simultaneously allowing the heavily faded fragment to be virtually unfolded, digitally enhanced and read for the first time in centuries.\nPreviously, it was catalogued as the story of Gawain. \"It wasn't properly inventoried,\" says Irene Fabry-Tehranchi, the French specialist at the library. \"No one had even recorded that it was in French.\"\nWhen she and her colleagues realised the fragment told a story about Merlin and his ability to change shape \"we were really excited,\" she says.\nThe Suite Vulgate du Merlin was originally written around 1230, a time when Arthurian romances were particularly popular among noblewomen, although the fragment is from a lost copy dated to around 1300. \"We don't know who wrote the text,\" says Fabry-Tehranchi. \"We think it was probably a collaborative exercise.\"\nIt is positioned as a sequel to an earlier text, written around 1200, in which Merlin is born a child prodigy gifted with foresight and casts a spell to facilitate the birth of King Arthur, who proves his divine right to rule by pulling the sword from the stone.\n\"The Suite Vulgate du Merlin tells us about Arthur's early reign, his relationship with the knights of the round table and his heroic fight with the Saxons. It really shows Arthur in a positive light \u2013 he's this young hero who marries Guinevere, invents the Round Table and has a good relationship with Merlin, his advisor,\" says Fabry-Tehranchi.\nIt is thanks to the sequel, she says, that the story of the Holy Grail \u2013 and Merlin's place in that story \u2013 could be retold in a coherent way from beginning to end. \"If the sequel was written to facilitate that, it was successful. That became the main way the story was transmitted.\"\nStylistic evidence in the text indicates the fragment was written by an unknown scribe in a northern French dialect understood by English aristocrats. \"These are Celtic and English legends, which had circulated orally across the British Isles. But the language used when they are written down is Old French, because of the Norman Conquest.\"\nBy the 16th Century, however, Old French had fallen out of favour in England. \"There was a linguistic shift to English among readers of Arthurian literature,\" says Fabry-Tehranchi. This may be why the fragment ended up as the book binding of an archival register: \"The text had lost its appeal, so they wanted to reuse it.\"\nThe library wanted to preserve the register, which was created in 1580 to record the property of Huntingfield Manor in Suffolk, as evidence of 16th-Century archival binding practices in England.\nPreviously, it would have been necessary to cut this binding to access the parts of the folded fragment, and the heavily faded areas of the texts would have remained illegible.\nToday, multispectral imaging (MSI), CT scanning and 3D modelling has enabled scholars to not only read the faded and hidden texts of the fragment, but to understand exactly how it was folded and sewn into the register. The Cultural Heritage Imaging Laboratory team at Cambridge University Library has even been able to analyse the different threads used by the Elizabethan bookbinders and the different decoration pigments used by the medieval illuminator,\u00a0 whose job it was to \"illuminate\" manuscripts with decorative illustrations and rich colours.\nDown in the basement of the library, in a small photographic studio dominated by a multispectral camera that cost over \u00a3100,000 ($125,000), the lab's chief photographic technician Am\u00e9lie Deblauwe says: \"The specialist imaging techniques that were employed on the Merlin fragment revealed details that would not be visible to the naked eye.\"\nThe camera takes 49 images of each page using different combinations of light panels emitting different wavelengths of light into both sides of the paper. Starting with invisible ultraviolet light, it moves right through the visible spectrum \u2013 \"all the colours of the rainbow\" \u2013 to invisible infrared light, she says. \"All of these are measured in nanometres. So we very accurately know what we are doing to the page with these lights, we are really in control of what we're bombarding it with.\"\nUsing a range of light colour bands meant that even the tiniest residue of ink, which had chemically degraded over time, could be made to stand out clearly in images. Technicians made the writing more legible by processing the image data using geospatial and open source software. \"That's because different inks and different papers react differently to different lights,\" Deblauwe says. While some lights are absorbed by the parchment and the ink, others are deflected, illuminating different details.\u00a0\nThe camera can even reveal tiny scratches on the parchment by sending light towards the paper at different angles, creating \"surface shadows\". \"We call it 'raking light',\" says Deblauwe.\nAn unexpected discovery came when the images revealed that the parchment was significantly lighter in the middle. \"That was an amazing moment for me,\" says Deblauwe. \"It was a little bit noticeable in the colour image, but it became really apparent in the MSI.\"\nAfter she saw these images, she realised the parchment was also shinier in the middle and had a waxier feel to it. This indicates that a leather strap had probably once been tied around the middle of the book to hold it together more firmly and, over time, rubbed some of the parchment's fibres away. \"Sometimes you have a bit of a lightbulb moment, and that gives you a greater understanding of the history of the item,\" says Deblauwe. \"This is next level study of manuscript material.\"\nOne of the \"trickiest\" challenges the team faced was how to access the text hidden by folds,\u00a0 says Fabry-Tehranchi. The solution was for conservators to carefully handle the parchment while technicians inserted a \"very narrow\" macro probe lens into the darkest crevices of the hidden areas via any part of the parchment that was still accessible.\u00a0\n\"The lens can get very close to an object,\" says chief photographic technician B\u0142a\u017cej W\u0142adys\u0142aw Miku\u0142a. \"We take multiple shots, and we stitch the images together.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The book with 1,300-year-old doodles\n\u2022 A map of the ocean may be in reach\n\u2022 The Shakespeare play lost since 1603\nThe result was hundreds of images of Old French words and letters \u2013 all handwritten by a medieval scribe \u2013 which needed to be put together like a jigsaw. To add a further layer of complexity, some of the images were taken using mirrors to reflect otherwise inaccessible areas of the text, so the images were curved or needed to be rotated or flipped.\nFiguring out where a particular image belonged was a painstaking process, but it was ultimately very satisfying, says Fabry-Tehranchi. Only a few square centimetres of the text remain unseen, due to the placement of the thread, but otherwise the fragment has been forced to give up all its secrets.\u00a0\nUsing a CT scanner, which can distinguish between different materials, the team was even able to digitally remove the thread from the spine of the book in a new process which allowed the stitches and materials used by the Elizabethan bookbinders to be analysed. \"We never knew that we would obtain such a good quality image of the structure of the binding,\" says Fabry-Tehranchi. \"It's amazing.\"\nMiku\u0142a sometimes wonders what these Elizabethans would have made of all his efforts to analyse the fragment. \"They saw it as a piece of rubbish. It could never have crossed their minds what we would do to it.\" He suspects there may be other such manuscripts out there. \"This library is full of treasure that needs to be discovered.\"\n* Digitisation, analysis and edition of the medieval French fragment of the story of Merlin re-discovered at Cambridge University Library, a free talk by Ir\u00e8ne Fabry-Tehranchi, Am\u00e9lie Deblauwe and B\u0142a\u017cej W\u0142adys\u0142aw Miku\u0142a, will take place at 5pm on 26 March during the Cambridge Festival.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

Tamim says he was 'lucky' after cardiac arrestImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Tamim Iqbal played 70 Tests, 243 ODIs and 78 T20 internationals for BangladeshPublished25 March 2025Former Bangladesh captain Tamim Iqbal has thanked doctors for their \"amazing\" care after he posted on social media for the first time since he suffered a cardiac arrest.The 36-year-old required medical attention during a domestic T20 game in Dhaka and is currently recovering in hospital.Tamim, Bangladesh's record run-scorer in one-day internationals, complained of chest pains after taking to the field for Mohammedan Sporting Club in their Dhaka Premier League fixture against Shinepukur on Monday.Plans to transport him in a helicopter were abandoned as his condition deteriorated and he was instead taken for emergency treatment at a closer facility, the KPJ Specialized Hospital.Tamim is set remain in hospital for another 48 to 72 hours for observation having been given angioplasty to relieve a blockage of the arteries.

        "article_text": "We are down to the last eight teams in this season's FA Cup, but which of them will lift the famous old trophy at Wembley in May?\nApart from defending Premier League champions Manchester City, none of the quarter-finalists have won any major silverware since the turn of the millennium, and four of them have never won the FA Cup at all.\n\"We all saw how much winning the Carabao Cup meant to Newcastle fans after their long wait for a trophy,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\"Liverpool and Arsenal are out, and City are clearly not the force they were, so this feels like a big chance for the other teams left in it to get some glory - I just hope they try to take it.\"\nSutton has made his predictions for all four sixth-round ties and for this weekend's matches he is up against Brit-nominated DJ and producer Nathan Dawe, who is an Aston Villa fan.\nDawe's new single featuring vocalist Abi Flynn, Here In Your Arms, is out now.\nDo you agree with their predictions? You can choose who you think will win each tie, below.\nDawe has had three UK top-10 singles and another four have reached the top 40. He made a surprise appearance on last month's Love Island All Stars final, playing Here In Your Arms at a pool party for the remaining couples\nVilla have not won a major trophy since the 1996 League Cup but are chasing silverware on two fronts this season and are into the last eight of the Champions League [where they play Paris St-Germain] as well as the FA Cup.\n\"I'm still in dreamland,\" Nathan told BBC Sport. \"I still can't believe I am going to Paris in a couple of weeks to watch us in a Champions League quarter-final.\n\"Honestly, it has not sunk in. I only ever used to hear about these glory days from my dad, but now we are actually able to experience it together. It's just unbelievable.\n\"What Unai Emery has done since taking charge in 2022 is just astronomical, and the players and fans are fully on board with what he is doing.\n\"Even when things are not going so well, it is clear that the team still has full confidence in the manager to have a Plan B or C to turn games around, and we have seen that happen on multiple occasions this season.\"\nAllow TikTok content?\nThis article contains content provided by TikTok.

It means so much to Villa fans because hardly any of us are alive who have seen us win it.\n\"Even my dad wasn't born the last time we won it [in 1957] and winning at Wembley would be very special. \n\"I've been lucky enough to go there a few times with Villa but other than our play-off win when we got promoted in 2019,  it has always ended up in misery.\"\nChris Sutton and Nathan Dawe were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\nGap = league places between the two teams\nCraven Cottage, 12:15 GMT\n8th in Premier League v 12th in Premier League\nGap = 4\nLast major trophy? Fulham: Never. Palace: Never\nBest FA Cup run? Fulham: runners-up in 1975. Palace: runners-up in 1990 & 2016\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.\nCrystal Palace won at Craven Cottage at the end of February and it is a ground where they have a decent record - they haven't lost there in their past six visits, since 2005.\nIt's a boost for Palace that Jean-Philippe Mateta is available to lead their attack - he can play wearing a special mask to protect his ear after his injury against Millwall in the fifth round - but we will have to see how much he has been affected by such a horrific challenge.\nThis video can not be played\nMillwall's Roberts sent off for 'dangerous' tackle on Mateta\nThe Eagles are a well-balanced team who seem to be improving all the time under Oliver Glasner - they have lost only two of their past 14 games in all competitions.\nI've found Fulham hard to predict this season because they've been less reliable than usual at home, but they are still having a strong campaign - they are in the mix for the Champions League places, and are only three points behind fifth-placed City.\nPalace are very strong on the road but they have not played for the past three weeks - their game against Newcastle before the international break was postponed because of the Carabao Cup final.\nWe often talk about teams needing a rest, but my concern is how that break has affected their momentum.\nThis is going to be a close game, but I actually fancy Fulham to edge it. Marco Silva's side have got goals in them, and my gut feeling is that they will get through in 90 minutes.\nI just hope both managers go for it properly, and don't prioritise next week's midweek Premier League games [Fulham are at Arsenal on Tuesday and Palace travel to Southampton on Wednesday] instead of this tie.\nFulham and Palace have shown this season they have got enough quality in their strongest starting XIs to go all the way in the FA Cup, especially this year when the competition appears so open. \nThey are both in a great position to finally win a major trophy, so why not try to make history and give their fans something to celebrate?\nPalace's only previous cup success was winning the Zenith Data Systems Cup in 1991. \nI can imagine their fans enjoyed that day a lot, but lifting the FA Cup would be on a different planet, and the same goes for Fulham, who have not even been in an FA Cup semi-final since 2002.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nNathan's prediction: It feels like Palace always turn into world-beaters in the last couple of months of the season, and I can see them winning this. 1-2\nAmex Stadium, 17:15 GMT\n7th in Premier League v 3rd in Premier League\nGap = 4\nLast major trophy? Brighton: Never. Forest: 1990 League Cup\nBest FA Cup run? Brighton: runners-up in 1983. Forest: winners in 1898 & 1959\nWatch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.\nBrighton will see this as the chance to get revenge for their 7-0 defeat at the City Ground at the start of February.\nI am sure some people felt the wheels had come off for Seagulls boss Fabian Hurzeler after that result, but instead his side have bounced back and gone on a great run of six wins and one draw in all competitions.\nSometimes getting thrashed like that can have a positive effect on a team, and clear the air. \nI remember losing 7-1 at Blackburn Rovers in October 1992, when I was a centre-half for Norwich City, but we had a crate of beer on the coach home to put things right and we were still top of the  Premier League table at Christmas. I did get moved up front after that though.\nAs for Nottingham Forest, they are the only team left in the FA Cup where I could understand it if they rested players this weekend, because of their league position.\nThey play Manchester United on Tuesday and the finish line is in sight for my boyhood team to finish third and secure Champions League football.\nThat's why it's disappointing to hear about Chris Wood getting injured while playing for New Zealand this week.\nHopefully it is not serious, but it is a blow for Forest if they are without their main number nine for any length of time.\nTheir game plan won't change without Wood - they will sit deep and attack on the break, it is just a question on whether it is their A team who face Brighton or not, and my hunch is that Nuno Espirito Santo will make a few changes.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nNathan's prediction: Forest are in such a good position in the league, I have a feeling they are going to be super-focused on that. For that reason, I am going with Brighton. 2-0\nDeepdale, 13:30 BST\n14th in Championship v 9th in Premier League\nGap = 25\nLast major trophy? Preston: 1938 FA Cup. Villa: 1996 League Cup\nBest FA Cup run? Preston: winners 1889 & 1938. Villa: winners x7 between 1887 & 1957\nWatch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.\nPreston are hard to beat at home and have not lost at Deepdale since 2 November, a run of 15 games.\nI've seen quite a bit of Paul Heckingbottom's team this season and they will defend deep, set up in a 3-5-2 shape and make themselves hard to break down.\nIt's an old football cliche, but in this case it is very true that the first goal will be extremely important.\nAston Villa have got some brilliant attacking players, but I also always feel like teams can score against them.\nIf they go behind, they could have problems but I do feel their quality should see them through - depending on Unai Emery's team selection of course, with a big league game coming up at Brighton on Wednesday.\nVilla have got their eyes on numerous prizes and there probably hasn't been excitement levels like this at the club since Martin O'Neill signed me in 2006.\nI'm still backing them here, but it is going to be a cagey game, and they might have to wait to make the breakthrough before a couple of late goals get the job done.\nI'm going for Emi Martinez to keep a clean sheet, too. His keepie-uppie antics, external to wind up Brazil while playing for Argentina this week were another reminder of why he is the best goalkeeper in the world. Anyone who can produce moments like that in a game of that magnitude deserves all the accolades you can get.\nSutton's prediction: 0-2\nNathan's prediction: The FA Cup has opened up for us this season, and it feels like we are the favourites now. I just really hope our schedule doesn't take too much toll on the players and we fall short because of that, but I am looking forward to the rest of the season for sure. \nBrighton will be tough on Wednesday so what do we prioritise, even with a quality squad like ours? That part is down to Emery, and he will probably rest a couple of first-choice players on Sunday, but I would love us to go to Preston, put out a strong team and win comfortably. I am not super-convinced that is going to happen anyway though, even if we don't make lots of changes, because Preston will throw everything at us. \nIt won't be as easy as people might think, but I do expect us to go through.  0-1\nVitality Stadium, 16:30 BST\n10th in Premier League v 5th in Premier League\nGap = 5\nLast major trophy? Bournemouth: never. City: 2024 Premier League\nBest FA Cup run? Bournemouth: quarter-finals 1957 & 2021. City: winners x7 between 1904 & 2023\nThis is such a difficult tie to call.\nBournemouth were the team who started the rot for Manchester City when they deservedly beat them in November, for what was the defending champions' first league defeat of the season.\nBack then, they were still 'mighty City', the team who were dominating English football, who hardly ever slipped up. \nWho would have imagined that, five months on, they would have lost eight of their next 19 league games and be in the position they are now, with just the FA Cup left as the only thing they can win?\nThis competition is huge for City now, because it feels so crucial for boss Pep Guardiola to finish such a difficult season with a piece of silverware.\nSo, it helps him that the Cherries are not in great form, with only one point from their past four league games, and also that they are without two key defenders here; Milos Kerkez and Dean Huijsen, who are both suspended.\nCity are still far from convincing at the moment, however, and it is hard to know what their strongest line-up is.\nPhil Foden's struggles for England last week were a reminder of how last season's PFA and FWA Player of the Year has been a shadow of his usual self all campaign, but he is not the only City player to have been well below his best.\nStill, there is no chance of Pep saving anyone for Wednesday's league game against Leicester, even though City have got a real fight on their hands to finish in the top five.\nPep always takes the FA Cup seriously anyway, and he has shown that by reaching the semi-finals for each of the past six seasons - something no other team had done before.\nWill City make it to the last four again? Yes... but only just.\nBournemouth are so good with their press that they won't allow City to easily play out from the back - there are going to be plenty of goals, and I can see it being settled in extra-time.\nSutton's prediction: 2-3 after extra-time\nNathan's prediction: Bournemouth are having a good season but I am still backing City to get through. 1-3\nThere were eight Premier League games played in week 29, the last set of fixtures before the international break.\nSo far, Chris and his guest, Divorce singer Felix, have both got four correct results, with one exact score, giving them both 70 points.\nFor now, it goes down as a win for the BBC readers - using the most popular scoreline from your predictions for each game, you got five correct results, with one exact score, leaving you on 80 points.\nThe remaining two games were rearranged because of the Carabao Cup final. \nNo-one picked up any points from Liverpool's draw with Aston Villa, which was moved forward to 19 February, so the weekly winner will be decided when Newcastle host Crystal Palace on 16 April - Felix has gone for a 2-1 Palace win.\nChris and Felix also made a prediction for the Carabao Cup final, and they both wrongly picked Liverpool to win it. \nThey were not alone, because the majority BBC readers also went for a Reds victory - out of almost 38,000 predictions, 73% of you thought Arne Slot's side would prevail.",

        "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/90b5/live/c53bd140-0adc-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.jpg",
        "article_text": "When Jeffrey Goldberg published a bombshell story outlining how some of the most senior US officials had mistakenly shared sensitive information with him, he obtained the biggest scoop of the year. The Atlantic editor also became the prime target for every senior Trump administration official in Washington.\nIn the last couple of days, he's been called a \"loser\" and a \"sleazebag\" by President Trump, as well as a liar and \"scum\" by US National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, who appeared to have mistakenly added Goldberg to a group chat earlier this month.\nBefore he became a political lightning rod, however, Goldberg watched on his phone as cabinet officials - including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, CIA director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard - discussed the sensitive details, timings and targets of an upcoming military operation in Yemen. They did not seem to notice his presence.\nIn an interview with the BBC on Wednesday, he told me it all began when he got a message on his phone, via the publicly available Signal messaging app, which allows users to send each other encrypted messages. It's popular among journalists and government officials. An account under Waltz's name had messaged him, which he assumed was a hoax.\n\"I wish there was a Le Carr\u00e9 quality here, you know,\" he said, referring to the late British spy novelist. \"But he asked me to talk. I said yes. And next thing I know, I'm in this very strange chat group with the national security leadership of the United States.\"\n\nAs the fall-out of the episode has engulfed Washington, Waltz has taken responsibility for mistakenly adding Goldberg to the group chat, suggesting that he meant to invite somebody else.\nHe has insisted that he has never met the editor, saying: \"I wouldn't know him if I bumped into him, if I saw him in a police lineup\". \nBy Goldberg's account, the two have actually met several times, though he declined to go into detail about their relationship.\n\"He can say obviously whatever he wants, but I'm not commenting on my relationship or non-relationship,\" Goldberg told me. \"As a reporter, I'm just not comfortable talking publicly about relationships that I may or may not have with people who are news makers.\"\nStill, one thing is clear: you must already have someone's contact information to reach them on Signal, and so Waltz had Goldberg's phone number. The top security adviser has said he has asked Elon Musk, tech billionaire and the White House's government efficiency czar, to investigate how the mistake happened - a move that was ridiculed by Goldberg.\n\"Really, you're going to put Elon Musk onto the question of how somebody's phone number ends up in someone's phone? I mean you know, most 8-year-olds could figure it out,\" he said.\nThe bigger question? \"Should you, as national security officials, be doing this on Signal on your phone?\" Goldberg said.\nIn his Monday Atlantic story - the first to report his access to the chat - Goldberg withheld the precise details that were shared around the bombing mission that attacked Houthi rebel targets in Yemen on 14 March. But Trump administration officials downplayed the report, calling him a liar and challenging his claims that classified information was shared.\nAnd so two days later, the magazine printed the full text messages, including several from Hegseth that included operational specifics. I asked him if that was a tough decision to make.\n\"Once Donald Trump said there was nothing to see here, essentially, and once Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe said there was no sensitive information, no classified information, et cetera - we felt like, hm, we disagree,\" he said. \"They're saying that, and we're the ones who have the texts, so maybe people should see them.\"\nThere are text messages in the group chat - sent before the first wave of strikes - detailing exactly when F-18 fighter jets would take off, when the first bombs would drop on Houthi targets and when Tomahawk missiles were going be fired. Hegseth has pushed back, saying they were clearly not \"war plans\" and none of it was classified information.\nPresident Trump expressed his support for Hegseth on Wednesday, saying he was \"doing a great job\" and describing Goldberg as a \"sleazebag\". The White House has also attempted to argue that the information shared was not technically war planning. \nGoldberg did not appear swayed by their insults and claims. \n\"If Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, is texting me, telling me the attack was about to be launched on Yemen - telling me what kind of aircraft are going to be used, what kind of weapons are going to be used, and when the bombs are going to fall two hours after the text is received - that seems sensitive information, war-planning information to me,\" he said.\nThis isn't the first time that the veteran editor has been on the receiving end of Trump's ire: in 2020 he published a piece in The Atlantic where senior military officials quoted Trump as having referred to fallen American soldiers as \"suckers\" and \"losers\", something the president and his administration have vigorously denied.\nI asked him how he felt about the vitriolic personal attacks against him, coming from the very highest levels of the government.\n\"This is their move. You never defend, just attack,\" Goldberg said. \"So I'm sitting there, minding my own business. They invite me into this Signal chat and now they're attacking me as a sleaze bag, I don't even get it.\"\n\nTrump has, so far, been defending his national security team and doesn't seem inclined to sack anyone over what he is calling a press \"witch-hunt\". But Goldberg says there's a widespread feeling in the White House that Waltz made a serious error, as well as deeper concern about how the incident is being handled.\n\"If you're a Air Force captain, currently working with the CIA and the State Department, and you mishandled sensitive information the way that they've obviously mishandled sensitive information? You'd be fired, you'd be prosecuted,\" Goldberg said. \nHe said there is now some \"buzz\" among the ranks around the apparently differing accountability standards for leaders in the Trump administration.\nGoldberg didn't stick around in the chat for the fallout. He decided the responsible thing to do was to leave the group. Some journalists have expressed incredulity that he would voluntarily exit. \nBut what happens next will play out in the White House and Congress, where Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have demanded an investigation.\n\"There's a part of me that would love to see what else is happening in there. But there's a lot of different issues here related to law and ethics and all kinds of other issues that I really can't go into, \" Goldberg said. \"Believe me when I say that I made that decision with good advice from various parties.\"\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "F1 cars, such as Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari, use 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrid engines\nChristian Horner's phone rang. It was Bernie Ecclestone. Red Bull's team principal picked up, switched to speakerphone and placed it on the table in front of the assembled Formula 1 bosses.\nWe're in the F1 Commission, Horner told Ecclestone. Is there anything you want to say to the room?\nF1's former impresario, addressing the group that decides the sport's rules, said they should go back to V10 engines. Then he hung up.\nThat phone call - described to BBC Sport by several sources in the room at the time - took place in the morning of the day of F1's season launch at the O2 Arena in London in February, where both Horner and governing body the FIA were booed by the 15,000-strong crowd.\nTwo days later, FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem - a man whose three-year tenure has been beset by controversy - posted a message on Instagram.\nBen Sulayem said he \"looked forward\" to the new chassis and engine rules that are  to be introduced in 2026, but that the FIA \"must also lead the way on future technological motorsport trends.\n\"We should consider a range of directions, including the roaring sound of the V10 running on sustainable fuel.\"\nThese developments have kick-started a debate inside F1 about engines. The ground is shifting fast, so what's going on?\nNext year, F1 is going through the biggest regulation change in the sport's history, introducing new rules for both cars and engines.\nOn engines, F1 is sticking with 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids, the basic architecture that has been in place since 2014, but changing the balance between electric and combustion power.\nThe amount of total power provided by the hybrid is going up to about 50% from about 20% now. In addition, F1 is introducing sustainable fuels - abandoning fossil fuels in favour of synthetic fuel created from biomass and industrial processes.\nThis is all part of the sport's pledge to become net-zero carbon by 2030.\nThis video can not be played\nF1 in 10 Years: Lando Norris\nEver since hybrid engines were introduced in 2014, some have bemoaned the loss of the louder, more dramatic sound produced by the naturally aspirated engines that preceded them - especially the 3.0-litre V10s last raced in F1 in 2005.\nIn an unavoidable parallel with Ben Sulayem's actions now, Ecclestone was the first person to bring this up, even before the 2014 engines first raced.\nA certain romanticism about the V10 sound has sustained, as has the idea that those engines - with their ear-splitting shriek that could be heard some distance from the track - are more popular with the fanbase than the current hybrids.\nWithin F1, there is no question that some people agree. Lewis Hamilton said at the Chinese Grand Prix last weekend: \"It is no secret that the V6 has never sounded great.\n\"I remember the first time I came to an F1 race in 1996 in Spa and arriving and Michael (Schumacher) coming through Turn One and my rib cage just vibrated. I was so hooked. It was the most amazing thing I felt and heard.\n\"Over the years we've lost that. If we are able to move back to those amazing sounding engines and still able to see the sustainable goals, why not?\"\nFernando Alonso took his 2005 title-winning Renault R25 - with V10 engine - for a demonstration run on track before the 2020 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix\nIt's not that long since Ben Sulayem was trumpeting his involvement in the introduction of the 2026 engine rules.\nThese were fundamentally settled under the previous FIA president Jean Todt, but there was inevitable wrangling and it got over the line only after Ben Sulayem took office.\nTwo years ago, he said the new engines were \"at the forefront of technological innovation, making the future of F1 more sustainable while maintaining the spectacular racing\".\nSo why the U-turn?\nBen Sulayem has asked his F1 single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis to look into the matter.\nTombazis said that the advent of\u00a0sustainable fuels could allow F1 to make the engines simpler and cheaper.\n\"That's why the president made the comments about V10 engines in '28 - or '29 or whatever - and so on,\" Tombazis said. \"And that is something we are evaluating with the manufacturers.\"\nSenior figures within F1 and the car manufacturers involved in the sport see many problems with the FIA's position.\nOn a macro level, the climate crisis is very real, and the global road-car industry is heading in the direction of electrification - even if Donald Trump's election at the head of a government of climate deniers has given pause for thought in the US.\nManufacturers take part in F1 fundamentally for marketing reasons, and the sport has been made more appealing by the introduction of a budget cap for cars and engines.\nAudi, Ford and General Motors are all entering F1 in 2026 - and Honda are staying rather than withdrawing - specifically because of the new engine rules.\nAudi has already released a statement in response to the latest developments, saying that the new rules \"were a key factor in Audi's decision to enter Formula 1\".\nMercedes says it is open to discussions but would need a hybrid element to be part of any new engine formula for it to remain interested.\nThen there is the micro level.\nWhy a V10? No major road-car manufacturer uses them any more.\nMercedes says a V8 would make more sense if a change was to be made, as at least they are still being developed for road use.\nAnd why abandon turbochargers, when many performance road cars - from Audi RS6s or Mercedes AMG C63s to McLaren and Ferrari hypercars - use them for very good reasons?\nCost? Yes, a V10 might be cheaper than a hybrid. But the manufacturers have already spent an estimated collective $400m on the new engines. They are not about to throw that away.\nAnd a new V10 would require developing, to the tune of hundreds of millions more.\nWeight? Yes, the hybrid engines make the cars heavier, largely because of the batteries needed. But the majority of the weight increase from 550kg or so in 2005 to about 800kg now is accounted for by advances in safety, such as the halo head-protection device.\nOn top of that, in 2013, cars started races with about 160kg of fuel. Now, it's about 100kg and it's expected to be about the same next year. Returning to naturally aspirated engines would mean a huge increase in fuel capacity - and weight.\nSustainability? The new fuels being introduced next year are not net-zero carbon. According to scientific standards, sustainable fuels reduce carbon emissions by a little above 80%.\nThat's a lot. But doubling the amount of fuel used by abandoning hybrid engines would mean a doubling of the carbon emissions produced by fuel.\nThe emissions from the cars themselves are minuscule in the big picture - F1's transport around the world is much more significant. Still, the symbolism matters.\nRed Bull boss Christian Horner and FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem are both said to be interested in a return to V10 engines\nIn F1, politics are always involved.\nIt has escaped the attention of few that Ben Sulayem's intervention came after the crowd at the O2 booed when the FIA logo was shown.\nThis is an election year at the FIA, and some believe Ben Sulayem may have raised the idea of V10s because he thinks it will be popular with certain demographics who support him.\nSo far, no candidate has put themselves forwards to oppose him, but there are whispers that there is a credible opponent in the wings.\nAt the same time, word is creeping out in F1 about the progress the various manufacturers are making with their 2026 engines. And it seems that Mercedes are leading the way.\nPeople are already beginning to say that a team will only win in 2026 if it has a Mercedes engine.\nOf course, there is no proof of this, but the whispers are emerging in exactly the same way as similar ones did in 2013 - and they were proved exactly right when the hybrid engines made their debut the following year.\nThe V10 proposal is seen by rival teams as very much a Horner-Ben Sulayem agenda, even if it is said to have some support from Ferrari.\nEven Horner, while saying that \"the concept of a V10 would be very exciting for the sport\" acknowledges that abandoning the rules would be \"a massive departure from what is being worked on very hard for 2026\".\nA U-turn for 2026 now would need support from the teams and manufacturers - and there is not a chance that enough of them would support that to get it through.\nA leading team boss told BBC Sport on condition of anonymity that there have been \"zero discussions\" of this idea in the group of F1 stakeholders.\nIt takes time - years - to agree engine rules.\nIt would probably be two years before a full agreement could be reached. Then the manufacturers would need the same time again to develop and build the engines. Which would take F1 to the end of 2029. Which is only a year before the new rules are due to expire anyway.\nAs one team boss puts it: \"I think this will all peter out, and it will just end up becoming: 'What will 2031 look like?'\"\nThe FIA says: \"There needs to be a consultation between all stakeholders to agree on a way forward, before we fully explore different scenarios.\n\"Whichever direction is chosen, we must support the teams and manufacturers in ensuring cost control on R&D expenditure and take account of environmental and sustainability considerations.\"\nAnd the chances of the end result being a naturally aspirated V10, in the context of all the above?

        "article_text": "Callum Hudson-Odoi made the last of his three England appearances in 2019 but is returning to the form that could see him win more\nCallum Hudson-Odoi feels he is almost back at the beginning of his career.\nThe winger's mindset now, as then, is going into every game feeling he can score or assist, being part of the conversation around the England senior team, and once again trying to impress Thomas Tuchel.\nNow 24, the three-cap England international has been a key part of a Nottingham Forest side that has maintained their Premier League form to close in on Champions League qualification. Forest also face a trip to Brighton in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup on Saturday.\nSix years ago, Hudson-Odoi was one of the most exciting prospects in English football. He had been the Chelsea academy golden boy, with the club knocking back bids to sign him in the January 2019 transfer window from Bayern Munich. \nHe made his England debut under Gareth Southgate in March, coming on as a substitute in a 5-0 win over the Czech Republic in a Euro 2020 qualifier. He was 18 and became the youngest to play for England in a competitive international match, breaking Duncan Edwards' 64-year-old record. \nBut in April 2019, he ruptured his Achilles tendon in a match against Burnley. The tendon completely detached from the bone and his seven months out of the game was followed by further setbacks.\n\"I had been playing games week in, week out, got my first call up for England and I step off and boom, everything collapses,\" he told BBC Sport. \"It was tough, it was very tough.\n\"At the time, I was just thinking am I going to be the same player I was? Will I be able to sprint or kick a ball again?\"\nMaurizio Sarri was Chelsea's manager at the time of the injury, followed by Frank Lampard. But it was Tuchel who gave Hudson-Odoi his most minutes on the pitch while at Stamford Bridge. \nHowever, it was not all straightforward. Tuchel, now the England manager, gave him a dose of \"tough love\".\nIn a 1-1 draw with Southampton in February 2021, Hudson-Odoi came on at half-time but was then substituted off 31 minutes later, with the German coach telling journalists he was \"not happy with his attitude, energy and counter-pressing\".\n\"Maybe it is even unfair, but it was my feeling,\" Tuchel said.\n\"I took him off. We demand 100%. I feel he is not in the right shape to help us.\n\"He knows what I demand from him and when he doesn't reach this level, it's a hard decision.\"\nFast forward to this season and Hudson-Odoi's form for Forest - he has five goals and two assists - led to speculation about him making Tuchel's first England squad and a return to the national set-up after making his third and, so far, last appearance in November 2019 in a 4-0 win over Kosovo.\nHe missed out on the 26-man squad but speaking before the international break about playing under Tuchel, he said: \"We had our differences at times and that is normal. Every player and coach has their differences.\n\"Like [when Tuchel had me] playing wing-back and I am like why am I here? \n\"But it was to benefit the team and it benefits myself, helping me work on my defensive game. \n\"It's good that we had that moment and we have talked about it. He is an amazing manager and he knows how to get the best out of players. \n\"If the possibility and chance [for England] comes \u2013 I will have to go there and prove myself all over again.\n\"I just control what I can control. It's about enjoying my football once again, smiling and being positive.\"\nHudson-Odoi says he is \"more mature\" having lived through so much since making his professional debut at the age of 17.\nHe insists, though, his motivation about returning to the level which made him the most coveted youngster in the country, comes from within.\n\"I don't want to prove anything to anybody,\" he said. \"It is about proving to myself that I can still be that player I was \u2013 to go back to a level where I knew I was going to score or assist \u2013 and be that confident where I know I am going to impact in every game.\"\nHudson-Odoi is also dreaming of success under Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo. \n\"This season everything has just changed \u2013 from mentality to determination,\" he said.\n\"It's just a big drive from us and we are trying to push each other every day.

        "article_text": "Mikaela Mayer (left) is a two-weight world champion having also held titles at super-featherweight\nWBO welterweight champion Mikaela Mayer faces Briton Sandy Ryan in a Las Vegas rematch on Saturday. \nIn her BBC Sport column, American Mayer talks about the events leading up to victory in last September's first fight in New York when Ryan was hit by a can of red paint before leaving for the venue.\nOn Friday, Ryan will address the controversy and rivalry between the pair.\nI was in my room and we were starting to walk to the elevator, waiting for the go-ahead from the team to say we could go down because we were at the same hotel as Sandy Ryan. \nSandy was out there first waiting for her car so we stood by the elevator and my nutritionist said to wait because she hasn't got in the car yet.\nMy nutritionist was looking at her phone and was like, 'oh my god, someone just threw paint on Sandy'. We were all taken aback but I didn't understand that I was apparently the culprit.\nI got in the car but didn't really understand the extent of it until I got to the arena and online there was a photo of Sandy, who was stripped down with red paint on her. ESPN came in to see me and apparently I'm being blamed for the attack.\nEveryone who knows me, knows that would be out of character for me - it's not my style. I expected her to try to blame me. I was her rival all week but there were also other things going on. \nSandy has already said flyers attacking her were put up around the hotel and city.\nYou can't just point a finger when there is no evidence leading back to me. I was upstairs waiting to walk down for the fight of my life. \nI didn't know what time she was going to be down there or that she was going first. The only people who knew were her team - maybe she should look inside her own circle.\nThe incident took me by surprise but I was in fight mode and it didn't happen to me, so I wasn't flustered.\nIf someone had thrown paint on me I would have slapped paint on the ass of my fight shorts and got on with it.\nI was concerned that she was going to pull out - her team were really getting her going about it.\nThere was a clip of her coach Kay Koroma in the locker room screaming at her to pull out of the fight which I thought was super suspicious. That was weird to me and out of character for him. \nI really don't think it was the paint that threw her off her game but her team, who made it a bigger deal than it had to be.\nObviously I don't want that to happen and I hope it doesn't happen going into this fight. It could have been called off and, after two years of busting my butt to get back in that position, that was the last thing I wanted.\nAs for 'paint-gate' being used to promote the rematch, I was surprised the Top Rank team used the paint on the promotion posters - but this is entertainment. \nI didn't have any say in it. If I had done anything like that, my manager would have had my neck as he tries to keep me professional.\nI didn't know about it until the poster came out and I said, 'do they have red paint on Sandy?'\nI was just as taken aback as anyone else, but it's kind of funny.\nMayer (right) beat Ryan (left) by majority decision with one judge scoring it a draw\nIt's important for women's boxing to have these rivalries and this is definitely up there as one of the top ones.\nI never counted out the rematch and just wanted to see what my other options were. Once I saw the views and how much the fans wanted it - and the excuses - I thought let's do it again and I'll do it even better.\nI didn't get my rematch with Alycia Baumgardner so I understand Sandy might have been frustrated, but I didn't have to give her this rematch. I could have just sat it out, waited for Lauren Price to unify and fought for undisputed or faced someone else. \nThat's not the fighter I am though.\nI pride myself on the fact a lot of the fights I have been in are competitive and people aren't sure who will win. \nMy feud with Alycia will stay number one for a lifetime, but Sandy can come second because of the coaching team situation and the paint situation.\nSandy and her team have tried to gaslight me in a sense where I'm supposed to be making all of this up or I'm being dramatic, but it happened.\nYou're going to see coach Koroma, my coach of eight or nine years since the Olympics, in her corner so they really can't say anything about it. They did what they did and they have to stand by that. \nI'm just protecting myself and I'm the one who had to go out and find a whole new team at this stage of my career which is not easy. I have truth on my side.\nMikaela Mayer was speaking to BBC Sport's Bobbie Jackson.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty was called \"a gold digger\" and \"a murderer\". She was slut-shamed and spent 27 days in prison after a hate-filled vicious media campaign in 2020 alleged she had been involved in the death of her actor boyfriend Sushant Singh Rajput.\nNow, India's federal investigators have told a court that Rajput, a rising star in India's popular Hindi film industry, died by suicide and that neither Chakraborty nor her family had a role in his death.\nIn a statement shared with the BBC, senior lawyer Satish Maneshinde, who fought Chakraborty's case, said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had \"thoroughly investigated every aspect of the case from all angles and closed it\". \nThe findings have been presented in a special court in Mumbai, which will now decide whether to close the case or to order further investigation.\nMr Maneshinde said Chakraborty went through \"untold miseries\" and was jailed \"for no fault of hers\".\n\"The false narrative in the social media and electronic media was totally uncalled for,\" he said, calling on media bosses to \"reflect upon what they did\". \n\"Innocent people were hounded and paraded before the media and investigative authorities. I hope this does not repeat in any case.\"\nFeminist lawyer Payal Chawla, meanwhile, described the \"misogynistic narrative surrounding Chakraborty\" as \"deeply troubling\" and said the case \"should serve as a cautionary reminder of the perils of being judgmental\". \nChakraborty herself has offered no comment since news of CBI wanting to close the case broke at the weekend. On Monday, she was seen visiting a temple along with her brother and father - who were also named in a police complaint filed over Rajput's death. \nPerhaps the only sign that the family feel vindicated comes from her brother Showik - who spent three months in prison before being freed on bail. He shared a photo with Rhea and the caption \"Satyamev Jayate\" - Sanskrit for \"truth alone prevails\".\nRajput was found dead in his Mumbai apartment on 14 June 2020. Mumbai police said the 34-year-old had mental health issues, for which he was under treatment, and appeared to have taken his own life.\nChakraborty, who had been dating Rajput for a year and was living with him, had gone to live with her parents a few days before his death. \n\"Still struggling to face my emotions... an irreparable numbness in my heart\u2026 I will never come to terms with you not being here anymore,\" she later wrote on social media about her grief. \nBut within weeks, the actress found herself at the centre of a firestorm after Rajput's father lodged a police complaint, accusing Chakraborty of stealing his son's money and contributing to his suicide. He also denied that his son had any mental health issues. \nThe Rajput family has not commented on the latest developments regarding his death. \nChakraborty, who consistently denied all the allegations against her, appealed to the government to order a fair probe into the death. \nHowever, the tragedy - which came in the midst of a lockdown while India was struggling with the coronavirus pandemic - became the biggest prime-time story for a nation glued to their television sets. \nAnd Chakraborty became the subject of misogynistic abuse, with trolls calling her a \"witch\", a \"fortune huntress\", a \"mafia moll\" and \"sex bait to trap rich men\". She received rape and death threats.\nSome of India's most high-profile television hosts dedicated their entire shows to discussing the case, describing her as a \"manipulative\" woman who \"performed black magic\" and \"drove Sushant to suicide\". \nA video that went viral at the time showed a prominent news anchor hysterically gesticulating and accusing Chakraborty of being \"a druggie\". Another channel had a female anchor walk in on the live set, claiming she had \"a bagful of documents\" that could prove the actress's guilt. \nThe vicious hate campaign continued until Chakraborty was arrested three months after Rajput's death.\nShe was released a month later and has since tried her hand at motivational speaking and has now reinvented herself as a businesswoman who has launched a clothing line and her own podcast with celebrity interviews. She is also doing a reality TV show.\nChakraborty has also spoken about her ordeal, including how the name-calling and character assassination cost her work and how her family were also hounded. \n\"I tried contacting people in the [Hindi film] industry, asking for roles, any roles. But then I realised that people won't cast you because of all that had happened,\" she told Humans of Bombay last year. \n\"I was very angry for a long time. But it gave me acidity and I suffered from gut issues. So, it became important for me to forgive,\" she said, adding \" I have not forgiven everyone. Some people are on my hit list.\nIt is not clear what action she is contemplating against those who vilified her, but many are now suggesting on social media that she sue them for damages.\nWhile neither the actress or her lawyer have not yet said what they intend to do, columnist Namita Bhandare points out that seeking compensation in India, with its overburdened judiciary and millions of pending court cases, is anything but easy.\n\"A defamation case can go on for a decade and she would possibly get an apology at the end of it. So would she even bother to do that?\"\nAccording to Ms Bhandare, Chakraborty \"became expendable in the pursuit of a juicy story\" since she \"was not a big name and had no powerful people backing her in the film industry\".\nWhat happened, the columnist continued, \"was in keeping with the traditional Indian thinking\" to blame the female partner left behind, and also highlighted the \"dark side of social media, which tends to find a villain and then sets about demolishing their reputation\". \nSome of the videos of prominent news anchors making slanderous comments against Chakraborty have now resurfaced, and are being shared extensively on social media. Many people, including some of the actress's Bollywood colleagues, are demanding that the presenters apologise to her.\n\"You went on a witch-hunt. You caused deep anguish and harassment just for TRPs [a metric used to gauge advertising reach]. Apologise. That's the very least you can do,\" Bollywood actress Dia Mirza said on Instagram.\nJournalist Rohini Singh named specific TV channels and asked if they would apologise to Chakraborty. \n\"If they have any shame, any shred of human decency they should issue a grovelling apology for slandering her, telling outrageous lies, getting her imprisoned only because they were determined to run an agenda,\" she posted on X.\nThe issue was also raised in parliament on Tuesday. Journalist-turned-MP Sagarika Ghosh questioned the character assassination Chakraborty was subjected to.\n\"News channels ran motivated campaigns against her. Today she's proven innocent. But who will give those years back to her when she endured such humiliation at the hand of media?\" she asked.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook",

After periods of introspection and self-analysis, Bellamy the coach is a different person, one who prides himself on his composure and analytical eye.\nPlayers have talked of his considered team talks and detailed tactical presentations; his interviews with the media have been measured, thoughtful and wide-ranging.\nBut in North Macedonia on Tuesday night, when Wales bundled in an added-time equaliser after a conclusion of stupefying drama, that cool veneer disappeared in an instant.\nAs David Brooks' shot crept over the line, an ecstatic Bellamy leapt in the air and roared with delight. His feet had barely touched the ground when he was asked to summarise his feelings.\n\"My main reaction? Probably shock, still,\" he said.\n\"Calm? Not at all. Even now, I'm not. I thought it would have been difficult to accept losing today. But you have to accept certain things as much as you don't want to.\n\"As a coach you try to teach the players. I hope they learn from me but, I always feel as a coach, you learn from the players. Today's given me so much, like the character.\"\nThis video can not be played\n2026 World Cup qualification: David Brooks nets late equaliser for Wales\nThe injury-time chaos warped the narrative arc of the game.\nWales had dominated for 90 minutes but looked to have fallen for a sucker punch when substitute Joe Allen's backpass was picked off by Bojan Miovski, whose goal had sparked jubilant celebrations among the home players and fans.\nThen came the bedlam as Wales disposed with Bellamy's modus operandi of patient build-up play and launched the ball to big Kieffer Moore, who nodded the ball down for fellow substitute David Brooks to force the ball over the line from close range.\nFor all the unfiltered joy of that moment, however, Bellamy could not hide his frustration.\n\"To watch it happen was like 'Wow' but, at the same time, to come away with a point actually leaves me disappointed, I have to be honest, due to the performance,\" he said.\n\"In the manner, then we have to take it of course. If I look at the game, we were in control but football can find a cruel way sometimes.\n\"Maybe because I haven't suffered defeat in a short reign but I still felt there was something more.\"\nThis was Bellamy's eighth game in charge of Wales and he still hasn't lost yet, with four wins and four draws leading to Nations League promotion and a solid start to World Cup qualifying.\nHis frustration was understandable in Skopje. North Macedonia offered very little, while Wales could not convert their possessional domination into the three points it warranted.\nOnce the elation of the celebrations subsides, Bellamy will ensure that Wales know this was an opportunity missed.\nWales are second in Group J, behind early leaders North Macedonia on goal difference, but greater challenges await with top seeds Belgium yet to play.\n\"It could have been a very precious one [point]. I feel probably on the performance, I think the way I looked at the game today, I think we needed three. It could turn out to be an important point but time will tell,\" Bellamy added.\n\"We know in international football, chances can be limited at times but we had our big chances as well. On reflection of the game, maybe we needed to take three.\"",

        "article_text": "\"Horrific to see in black and white. But hardly surprising,\" is how a top European diplomat reacted to what comes across as deep, heartfelt disdain for European allies, revealed late on Monday, European time, in an online group chat between top US security officials.\nSeemingly by accident, Atlantic magazine editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was also invited to the chat, which discussed planned strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen aimed at unblocking trade routes on the Suez Canal. He subsequently made the frank exchange public.\nIn the chat, Vice-President JD Vance notes that only 3% of US trade runs through the canal, as opposed to 40% of European trade, after which he and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth complain of European \"free-loading\".\nThe monumental security breach is causing a ruckus at home, with Democrats calling for Hegseth's resignation as a result.\nAcross the pond - aka the Atlantic - Europe's leaders and policy-makers felt \"sick to their stomach\", as an EU official put it to me.\nOfficials quoted here are speaking on condition of anonymity in order to comment freely on what are volatile times in US-European relations. You won't see comments in the public domain, so as not to rock the transatlantic boat any further.\nVance first stunned European officials with his speech at last month's Security Conference in Munich condemning the continent for having misplaced values such as protecting abortion clinics and censoring speech in the media and online. \"The enemy from within,\" he called it.\nMonday's Signal chat strikes at the heart of a slew of tensions, discomfort and plain old fear in Europe right now, that the Trump administration can no longer be relied on as the continent's greatest ally. At a time when Europe is facing off against a resurgent Russia.\nWestern Europe has looked to the US to have its back in terms of security and defence since World War Two.\nBut it is precisely that fact that so riles the Trump administration and has cemented Europe in its mind as \"freeloaders\".\nWhile the US commits 3.7% of its colossal GDP to defence, it's taken the majority of European partners in the transatlantic defence alliance Nato until recently to cough up even 2% of GDP. Some, like big economies Spain and Italy, aren't even there yet, though they say they plan to be soon.\nEurope relies heavily on the US, amongst other things, for intelligence, for aerial defence capabilities and for its nuclear umbrella.\nWith the phasing out of conscription in most European countries, the continent also relies on the around 100,000 battle-ready US troops stationed in Europe to help act as a deterrent against potential aggressors.\nEuropeans have focused more on investing in welfare and social services than defence - collective or otherwise - since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. Why on earth should the US pick up the slack, asks the Trump administration.\nOn the leaked group chat, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz laments the state of Europe's naval forces. \"It will have to be the United States that reopens these [Suez] shipping lanes.\"\nThe chat then debates how to ensure that Europe remunerates the US for its actions.\n\"If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return,\" states a message from someone called SM - presumed to be deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller.\nEurope is now loudly and publicly discussing spending a lot more on its own defence - hoping to keep Donald Trump onside and an aggressive Russia at bay after Ukraine.\nBut Trump's irritation with Europe is nothing new.\nHe displayed his displeasure during his first term in office: furious about Europe's low defence spending; incandescent over the EU's trade surplus with the US.\nThe United States had been long been taken for a ride and that must stop, seemed to be his sentiment.\nImposing trade tariffs was one of Trump's first responses. Then as now.\nEarlier this month, when Trump threatened eye-watering 200% tariffs on European alcohol in an ongoing trade tit-for-tat, he lambasted the EU as \"abusive\" and \"hostile\" for allegedly taking advantage of the US at any opportunity.\nCoinciding uncomfortably with the leaked Signal chat and its Euro-bashing, the EU's trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic, along with the head of cabinet of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, arrived in Washington on Tuesday hoping to launch a charm offensive to try to stave off a new tariff onslaught.\nOn defence, Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened that the US wouldn't protect countries that \"didn't pay\".\nHis candidate to be the next US ambassador to Nato says that means Europeans spending 5% of GDP.\nThe UK currently spends 2.3% of GDP on defence, aiming for 2.6% by 2027. France scrapes 2.1% of GDP on military spending annually.\nDuring the Cold War, the common enemy was the Soviet Union, which included swathes of Eastern Europe.\nThe US wanted to keep western Europe close, and for it to stay militarily dependent.\nSince then, there has been growing apathy towards Nato and Europe. Particularly after the 9/11 twin tower attacks in the US.\nAttention in Washington turned to Iraq and Afghanistan. To China.\nPresident Obama was clear he wanted Asia to be his top foreign policy priority.\nTrump is far from the first US president to harrumph at Europe's reluctance to do more for, as well as spend more on, its own defence.\nBut with Trump, there is also a deep ideological split.\nOn social values, as JD Vance alluded to in Munich.\nBut also - and this is key - Trump demonstrates not only an antipathy for Europe and an impatience to get the war in Ukraine \"done and over\", he also displays an affinity for Russia's Vladimir Putin, at a time when Europe considers him an immediate threat to the security and well-being of the whole continent.",

        "article_text": "This is the gravest crisis for Western security since the end of World War Two, and a lasting one. As one expert puts it, \"Trumpism will outlast his presidency\". But which nations are equipped to step to the fore as the US stands back?\nAt 09.00 one morning in February 1947, the UK ambassador in Washington, Lord Inverchapel, walked into the State Department to hand the US Secretary of State, George Marshall, two diplomatic messages printed on blue paper to emphasise their importance: one on Greece, the other on Turkey.\nExhausted, broke and heavily in debt to the United States, Britain told the US that it could no longer continue its support for the Greek government forces that were fighting an armed Communist insurgency. Britain had already announced plans to pull out of Palestine and India and to wind down its presence in Egypt.\nThe United States saw immediately that there was now a real danger that Greece would fall to the Communists and, by extension, to Soviet control. And if Greece went, the United States feared that Turkey could be next, giving Moscow control of the Eastern Mediterranean including, potentially, the Suez Canal, a vital global trade route.\nAlmost overnight, the United States stepped into the vacuum left by the departing British.\n\"It must be a policy of the United States,\" President Harry Truman announced, \"to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressure.\"\nIt was the start of what became known as the Truman Doctrine. At its heart was the idea that helping to defend democracy abroad was vital to the United States' national interests.\nThere followed two major US initiatives: the Marshall Plan, a massive package of assistance to rebuild the shattered economies of Europe, and the creation of Nato in 1949, which was designed to defend democracies from a Soviet Union that had now extended its control over the eastern part of Europe.\nIt is easy to see this as the moment that leadership of the western world passed from Britain to the United States. More accurately it is the moment that revealed that it already had. \nThe United States, traditionally isolationist and safely sheltered by two vast oceans, had emerged from World War Two as the leader of the free world. As America projected its power around the globe, it spent the post-war decades remaking much of the world in its own image. \nThe baby boomer generation grew up in a world that looked, sounded and behaved more like the United States than ever before. And it became the western world's cultural, economic and military hegemon.\nYet the fundamental assumptions on which the United States has based its geostrategic ambitions now look set to change.\nDonald Trump is the first US President since World War Two to challenge the role that his country set for itself many decades ago. And he is doing this in such a way that, to many, the old world order appears to be over - and the new world order has yet to take shape.\nThe question is, which nations will step forward? And, with the security of Europe under greater strain than at any time almost in living memory, can its leaders, who are currently scrabbling around, find an adequate response?\nPresident Trump's critique of the post-1945 international order dates back decades. Nearly 40 years ago he took out full-page advertisements in three US newspapers to criticise the United States' commitment to the defence of the world's democracies.\n\"For decades, Japan and other nations have been taking advantage of the United States,\" he wrote in 1987. \"Why are these nations not paying the United States for the human lives and billions of dollars we are losing to protect their interests?\n\"The world is laughing at America's politicians as we protect ships we don't own, carrying oil we don't need, destined for allies who won't help.\"\nIt's a position he has repeated since his second inauguration. \nAnd the fury felt by some in his administration for what they perceive as European reliance on the United States was apparently shown in the leaked messages about air strikes on Houthis in Yemen that emerged this week.\nIn the messages, an account named Vice-President JD Vance wrote that European countries might benefit from the strikes. It said: \"I just hate bailing Europe out again.\"\nAnother account, identified as Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, responded three minutes later: \"VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.\"\nTrump's own position appears to go beyond criticising those he says are taking advantage of the United State's generosity. At the start of his second presidency, he seemed to embrace Russian President Vladimir Putin, telling Russia that Ukraine would not be granted Nato membership and that it should not expect to get back the territory it has lost to Russia. \nMany saw this as giving away two major bargaining chips before talks had even started. He apparently asked Russia for nothing in return.\nOn the flipside, certain Trump supporters see in Putin a strong leader who embodies many of the conservative values they themselves share. \nTo some, Putin is an ally in a \"war on woke\".\nThe United States' foreign policy is now driven, in part at least, by the imperatives of its culture wars. The security of Europe has become entangled in the battle between two polarised and mutually antagonistic visions of what the United States stands for. \nSome think the division is about more than Trump's particular views and that Europe can not just sit tight waiting for his term in office to end. \n\"The US is becoming divorced from European values,\" argues Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London. \"That's difficult [for Europeans] to swallow because it means that it's structural, cultural and potentially long-term. \"\n\"I think the current trajectory of the US will outlast Trump, as a person. I think Trumpism will outlast his presidency.\"\nThe Trump White House has said it will no longer be the primary guarantor of European security, and that European nations should be responsible for their own defence and pay for it.\n\"If [Nato countries] don't pay, I'm not going to defend them. No, I'm not going to defend them,\" the president said earlier this month.\nFor almost 80 years, the cornerstone of European security has been embedded in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which states that an attack on one member state of the alliance is an attack on all. \nIn Downing Street last month, just before his visit to the White House, the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told me during an interview that he was satisfied that the United States remained the leading member of Nato and that Trump personally remained committed to Article 5.\nOthers are less sure.\nBen Wallace, who was defence secretary in the last Conservative government, told me earlier this month: \"I think Article 5 is on life support. \n\"If Europe, including the United Kingdom, doesn't step up to the plate, invest a lot on defence and take it seriously, it's potentially the end of the Nato that we know and it'll be the end of Article 5.\n\"Right now, I wouldn't bet my house that Article 5 would be able to be triggered in the event of a Russian attack\u2026 I certainly wouldn't take for granted that the United States would ride to the rescue.\"\nAccording to polling by the French company Institut Elabe, nearly three quarters of French people now think that the United States is not an ally of France. A majority in Britain and a very large majority in Denmark, both historically pro-American countries, now have unfavourable views of the United States as well.\n\"The damage Trump has done to Nato is probably irreparable,\" argues Robert Kagan, a conservative commentator, author and senior fellow at the Brookings Institute in Washington DC who has been a long time critic of Trump.\n\"The alliance relied on an American guarantee that is no longer reliable, to say the least\".\nAnd yet Trump is by no means the first US president to tell Europe to get its defence spending in order. In 2016 Barack Obama urged Nato allies to increase theirs, saying: \"Europe has sometimes been complacent about its own defence.\"\nAll of this is great news for Putin. \"The entire system of Euro-Atlantic security is crumbling before our eyes,\" he said last year. \"Europe is being marginalised in global economic development, plunged into the chaos of challenges such as migration, and losing international agency and cultural identity.\"\nIn early March, three days after Volodymyr Zelensky's disastrous meeting with Trump and Vance in the White House, a Kremlin spokesman declared \"the fragmentation of the West has begun\".\n\"Look at Russia's objectives in Europe,\" says Armida van Rij, head of the Europe programme at Chatham House. \"Its objectives are to destabilise Europe. It is to weaken Nato, and get the Americans to withdraw their troops from here.\n\"And at the moment you could go 'tick, tick and almost tick'. Because it is destabilising Europe. It is weakening Nato. It hasn't gone as far as to get the US to withdraw troops from Europe, but in a few months time, who knows where we'll be?\"\nOne of the great challenges Europe, in particular, faces from here is the question of how to arm itself adequately. Eighty years of reliance on the might of the United States has left many European democracies exposed. \nBritain, for example, has cut military spending by nearly 70% since the height of the Cold War. (At the end of the Cold War, in the early 1990s, Europe allowed itself a peace dividend and began a decades-long process of reducing defence spending.)\n\"We had a big budget [during the Cold War] and we took a peace dividend,\" says Wallace. \"Now, you could argue that that was warranted.\n\"The problem is we went from a peace dividend to corporate raiding. [Defence] just became the go-to department to take money from. And that is where we just forgot the lessons of our history.\"\nThe prime minister told parliament last month that Britain would increase defence spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027. But is that enough?\n\"It isn't enough just to stand still,\" argues Wallace. \"It wouldn't be enough to fix the things we need to make ourselves more deployable, and to plug the gaps if the Americans left.\"\nThen there is the wider question of military recruitment. \"The West is in freefall in its military recruiting, it's not just Britain,\" argues Wallace.\n\"At the moment, young people aren't joining the military. And that's a problem.\"\nBut Germany's new Chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, has said Europe must make itself independent of the United States. And \"Europeanising\" NATO will require the build up of an indigenous European military-industrial complex capable of delivering capabilities that currently only the United States has.\nOthers share the view that Europe must become more self reliant militarily - but some are concerned that not all of Europe is on board with this.\n\"Where we are at the moment is that the East Europeans by and large, don't need to get the memo,\" says Ian Bond, deputy director, Centre for European Reform. \"The further west you go, the more problematic it becomes until you get to Spain and Italy.\"\nMr Arnold agrees: \"The view in Europe now is this isn't really a debate anymore, it's a debate of how we do it and maybe how quickly we do it, but we need to do this now.\"\nThere is a short list of \"very important things\" that only the United States currently provides, according to historian Timothy Garton Ash. \n\"These are the so-called strategic enablers,\" he says. \"The satellites, the intelligence, the Patriot air defence batteries, which are the only ones that can take down Russian ballistic missiles. And within three to five years we [countries other than the US] should aim to have our own version of these.\n\"And in this process of transition, from the American-led Nato [the idea is] you will have a Nato that is so Europeanised that its forces, together with national forces and EU capacities, are capable of defending Europe - even if an American president says 'leave us out of this'.\"\nThe question is how to achieve this.\nMs van Rij stresses that, in her view, Europe does need to build a Europe-owned European defence industrial base - but she foresees difficulties.\n\"What's really difficult are the divisions within Europe on how to actually do this and whether to actually do this.\"\nThe European Commission and experts have been trying to figure out how this defence may work for several decades. \"It has traditionally been very difficult because of vested national interests... So this is not going to be easy.\"\nIn the meantime, Trump appears ready to turn the page on the post-Cold War rules-based international order of sovereign states that are free to choose their own destinies and alliances.\nWhat he seems to share with Vladimir Putin is a desire for a world in which the major powers, unconstrained by internationally agreed laws, are free to impose their will on smaller, weaker nations, as Russia has traditionally done in both its Tsarist and Soviet Empires. That would mean a return to the \"spheres of interest\" system that prevailed for 40 years after the Second World War.\nWe don't know exactly what Donald Trump would do were a Nato country to be attacked. But the point is that the guarantee of US help can no longer be taken for granted. That means Europe has to react. Its challenge appears to be to stay united, finally make good on funding its own defence, and avoid being drawn into the \"sphere of influence\" of any of the big powers.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

At its heart was the idea that helping to defend democracy abroad was vital to the United States' national interests.There followed two major US initiatives: the Marshall Plan, a massive package of assistance to rebuild the shattered economies of Europe, and the creation of Nato in 1949, which was designed to defend democracies from a Soviet Union that had now extended its control over the eastern part of Europe.It is easy to see this as the moment that leadership of the western world passed from Britain to the United States. \"Nato Article 5 'is on life support'The Trump White House has said it will no longer be the primary guarantor of European security, and that European nations should be responsible for their own defence and pay for it. \"The alliance relied on an American guarantee that is no longer reliable, to say the least\".And yet Trump is by no means the first US president to tell Europe to get its defence spending in order.

I'd never seen anything like it. I turned to my dad and said: \"That's who I want to be.\" It was Peter Lever.\nThere was something about the way he bowled. The energy, the run-up. It lit a spark under me and, from that moment on, I was Peter Lever. My dad wanted me to be an off-spinner, like him, but there was no chance after I'd seen Peter bowl. I copied his action and he was everywhere in my life as I grew up.\nWhen I was about 15 I went to stay with my grandmother in Cheshire and paid to have some coaching in the Lancashire nets at Old Trafford. Because I was reasonably quick, I got promoted to bowl to the first team. I was so nervous. Peter was in the net next door. It was like a dream come true.\nI followed him religiously. For a fast bowler, he was an incredibly gentle character.\nIn 1965, when South Africa visited England and played against Lancashire in a tour match, Peter refused to play against them because of apartheid.\nThen, in the first Test against New Zealand in Auckland in 1975, he had the horrendous experience of hitting the home number 11 Ewen Chatfield with a bouncer. Chatfield almost died. It nearly destroyed Peter.\nA few years later, in a famous game between Derbyshire and Lancashire at Buxton, it snowed and left the pitch as something of a lottery. Peter refused to bowl because he thought it was too dangerous.\nThe bond forged between his former England captain Raymond Illingworth and Peter continued after their playing days. When Raymond was in charge of the England team as the supremo head coach and selector, he made Peter the bowling coach.\nPeter moved with his wife Ros to Devon, immersing himself in the local community. He coached at Lewdown Cricket Club and planted wild flowers around the village.\nIn 2017, Andrew Strauss arranged a 'Club England' dinner at Lord's for everyone, men and women, who had ever played for England. I was asked to host the evening and accepted only on the condition I could sit next to Peter. We were all given special caps to recognise our time playing for England. I presented Peter's to him and he presented mine to me. It was a lovely moment.\nHe had a massive influence on my cricketing life. They say you should never meet your heroes.

        "article_text": "From the Yorkshire Moors in England to the South African wilderness, star bathing is emerging as a transformative wellness trend \u2013 offering awe, calm and a cosmic reset.\nI lie in an empty Victorian bathtub on heather moorland in the Yorkshire Moors in England's north. Above me, more and more stars appear as the sky slowly darkens from blue to violet to navy. Beside me, in her own bathtub, my star-bathing guide Gemma leads a meditation.\n\"Allow yourself to be awed by the incredible sky view that you're witnessing,\" she says softly. \"Appreciate that we are here, right now, on this beautiful evening. Focus gently on the sky\u2026 and your breath. Just be.\"\u00a0\nI feel cold and self-conscious. I am trying to suspend the part of me that is deeply sceptical because I desperately want an escape from the anxiety that has plagued the past three years of my life. A search for relief has led me to wild swimming, drumming, yoga and now to star-bathing \u2013 an emerging wellness practice that is being offered in hotels and retreats around the world.\nStar bathing is not about identifying constellations, it's about losing yourself in the night sky; and a growing body of research suggests that it can help calm the nervous system, increase happiness and foster a sense of perspective.\nSo here I am, wrapped in blankets, on a weekend of stargazing run by Broughton Sanctuary, a 16th-Century historic house and collection of cottages located at the foothills of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, a designated International Dark Sky Reserve. There is a strong focus on the healing power of nature here \u2013 the 3,000-acre grounds are home to one of the UK's largest rewilding projects \u2013 and star bathing is just one of many activities designed to bring guests closer to the natural world.\nThe meditation ends and silence falls on the moors, broken by the distant hoot of an owl. I look up, trying not to think about the stressful week I've had. As the sky continues to darken, new stars appear as though by magic. My breathing slows. Suddenly I feel something shift. I realise that I am not just looking up at the universe, I am part of the universe. It is impossible not to feel awed by the vastness and beauty of the night sky above me.\nThe psychological benefits of experiencing awe are well documented \u2013 it has been proven to lower heart rate, increase the presence of oxytocin and reduce inflammation \u2013 and it's one of the reasons that stargazing is so good for our mental health.\n\"Experiencing awe regularly is deeply beneficial for our mental wellbeing because it helps us to feel connected to something bigger than ourselves,\" says Mark Westmoquette, an astrophysicist and yoga and meditation teacher who runs mindful stargazing retreats across the UK and Europe. \"As we look up at the night sky and become aware of our place within it, that sense of wonder and awe can really shift our perspective around who and what we are.\"\nWhile the mental health benefits of being in nature are well documented, it's only recently that researchers have begun to study the effects of being in a nocturnal natural environment.\nIn February 2024, a new Night Sky Connectedness Index was published in the\u00a0Journal of Environmental Psychology. It showed that a greater connection to the night sky is positively related to a person's mental health and happiness. The Office of Astronomy for Development, a joint project of the International Astronomical Union and the South African National Research Foundation, is currently researching the potential of using astronomy as a tool to improve vulnerable people's mental wellbeing, with encouraging results.\nAt the end of our star-bathing session, Gemma, me and the other two participants drink hot chocolate and then make our way down the hillside. We can't take our eyes off the sky, which becomes more and more dazzling the longer we look at it.\nWell World\nBBC Travel's\u00a0Well World is a global take on wellness that explores different ways that cultures the world over strive for a healthy lifestyle.\nThe following night, after a day spent exploring the grounds, relaxing in the spa and wild swimming in a freezing cold former reservoir on the estate, I take part in a stargazing session that is part of the annual Dark Skies Festival. After eating a two-course vegetarian meal around a bonfire in the \"fire temple\" \u2013 a sheltered wooden structure set in pretty woodland \u2013 a group of about 20 of us walk to Broughton's kitchen garden where astronomer Chris Higgins is waiting with a powerful telescope.\nHiggins talks us through various constellations and planets, and we take it in turns to look at them through the telescope. I am awestruck by the sight of Venus, which appears like a crescent moon, as well Jupiter with its four moons and its light and dark bands.\nThe group bonds quickly \u2013 our natural reserve seems to disappear as we ooh and aah at the cosmos. It's a freezing night, but no one wants to go inside. It feels like a gift \u2013 this clear, beautiful night \u2013 and we can't stop staring at the sky. After a while, I let go of trying to understand the science and just gaze up, letting the cool light of the stars calm me. I love the idea that while almost everything on our planet has changed since the beginning of humanity, the beauty of the night sky has remained the same. I am staring up at the same view my ancestors marvelled at, and there is something deeply grounding about that.\nI am hooked. When I return home, I start searching for star-bathing retreats. At the top of my wish-list is luxury off-grid retreat centre Bliss & Stars, located two hours from the nearest village in South Africa's Cederberg Wilderness Area. Launched in 2019 by Daria and Heine Rasmussen, it offers three-night star-bathing retreats, featuring guided stargazing sessions, nature immersion, mindfulness, breathwork under the stars and night hikes.\u00a0\nDaria tells me that many visitors have profound experiences gazing at the night sky. \"One guest, numbed by years of trauma, experienced a breakthrough while observing Saturn's rings, describing it as 'awe as exorcism' that rebooted his capacity for joy,\" she says. \"Another guest, a grieving mother, found solace in our wilderness night ventures and naked-eye stargazing, saying: 'It felt like the universe was mourning with me.'\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The seven travel trends that will shape 2025\n\u2022\u00a0Five extraordinary night-time experiences around the world\n\u2022\u00a0Swede dreams: How Sweden is embracing its sleepy side\u00a0\u00a0\nAlso high on my bucket list is Chile's Atacama Desert, which features the world's darkest, clearest skies. Elqui Domos Hotel has been designed specifically for appreciating these pristine night skies \u2013 it features geodesic rooms with retractable roofs to allow guests to look straight up from their bed. Hotel Ranga in Iceland, meanwhile, features a state-of-the-art observatory, and offers the chance to take part in mindful stargazing from outdoor hot tubs fed by geothermally heated water.\nIn the Scottish Highlands, Cairngorm Excursions runs star-bathing parties, bringing people together for a night of stargazing far from any light pollution, with hot drinks, traditional stovies (a Scottish dish made from meat and potatoes), blankets and log seating. This being Scotland, the evenings also feature a gin, whisky and rum sampling experience put on by a local distillery.\nAboriginal Australians are thought to be the world's first astronomers, and a growing number of experiences offer visitors a chance to learn about Indigenous astronomy. Aboriginal-owned Ngurrangga Tours offers an overnight trip in Western Australia's Millstream Chichester National Park with an evening of camping, exploring the wilderness and learning about Indigenous star stories. In Sydney, Fantasea Cruising offers an Aboriginal Sky Dreaming Cruise on the harbour, with an Aboriginal astronomer sharing stories of the Sun, Moon and stars that have been passed down by ancestors.\u00a0\nFor now, I go out into my Bristol garden on clear nights and lie down on a blanket. The sky is nowhere near as dark as it was in Yorkshire, and light pollution obscures many of the stars, but I find that I can still slip into that now familiar sense of peace.\nPerhaps it doesn't matter how many stars I can see. As Westmoquette says: \"Even if you can only see one star \u2013 that light's been travelling across the universe for hundreds and hundreds of years to hit your eyeball at that precise moment. Against all the odds, you're seeing that ray of light. That means something.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "How street-style photography has evolved from the Edwardian era to today. Now it is exploding \u2013 and turning fashion upside down.\nJessica Chastain, Daisy Edgar-Jones and Parker Posey were among the stars attending the recent autumn/winter 2025 Gucci fashion show, but the photographers weren't chasing them down outside. Instead, they jammed the ancient, moss-cracked alleys of Milan shouting, \"Chloe!\" \"Chloe!\".\n\"It still makes me nervous,\" says the Chloe in question, a Boston-born stylist and retail director named Chloe King who has become the fashion industry's version of a reality star: a street-style star. \"It's not an easy job,\" King tells the BBC. \"But I think street style really is the best part of fashion, because it's people living and breathing it, and customising their outfits to their personalities, not just what they're shown on a runway.\"\n\"People got very obsessed with street style outside of fashion shows about 10 years ago,\" says Vogue photographer Acielle Tanbetova, known online as Style Du Monde. \"It kind of dawned on everyone that putting on your own clothes could be more exciting than copying what's on a runway. And that's really revolutionised the industry.\"\nToday, mass-market brands like Gap and J Crew shoot campaigns that mimic street-style shots, while luxury labels like Tod's and LaPointe stage catwalk shows created to look like casual strolls through Milan and Manhattan. \"People see themselves reflected in street style a lot more,\" says King, noting that street style allows women of all sizes to participate in fashion's dreamworld, even as casting of plus-size runway models is on the decline. \"You need all of these voices and points of view to accurately reflect what's going on in fashion \u2013 you need a really diverse group of photographers outside the shows, because they each bring a unique eye.\"\u00a0\nThat sense of inclusion is a throughline from today's street-style photographers back to the genre's early pioneers. Before street style became fashion's favourite way to translate trends in real life, it was a rare point of entry for women seeking to enter the world of photography.\nFirst seen in women's magazines in the early 1900s, early street-style photography centred on aristocrats at French racetracks and seaside retreats. Most iconic: the graphic black-and-white striped dresses by French photographer Jacques-Henri Lartigue, which ran in the fashion publication Les Modesin 1912, and served as inspiration for Cecil Beaton's My Fair Lady costumes in 1964.\u00a0\nWhile Lartigue was shooting the gowns of socialites at the Auteuil racecourse, Scottish photographer Christina Broom was photographing a broader spectrum of women's fashion across the British Isles. That included the all-white suffragette skirts of women's rights marchers, the cinched-waist jackets of London's first female police brigade and the tartan wraps of Labour politicians like Barbara Ayrton-Gould. (She wore the giant accessory in 1909 while supporting worker's rights for fishermen. Today, Grazia global editor Joseph Errico says, \"She looks like she's in a Burberry ad.\")\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The Indigenous American supermodel bringing change\n\u2022\u00a0How Scandinavian dressing can make us happier\n\u2022\u00a0The style guru behind the red-carpet looks\nTen years later, the photographer Marianne Breslauer captured young sunbathers lounging in Germany and smoking cigarettes in Paris, documenting the nascent freedoms of twenty-something women that would soon be snuffed out by the Nazi regime. In doing so, she captured the emerging styles of the era \u2013 skin-tight bathing costumes made, for the first time, from synthetic fibres instead of wool; exaggerated wide-leg pants in the boyish style of Katharine Hepburn \u2013 before they hit mainstream fashion publications.\u00a0\nIn 1951, a French-American photographer named Vivian Meier began photographing people on the streets of New York City, and later, Chicago. While working as a nanny, she created a darkroom and developed film from a Rolleiflex camera, with subjects including telephone operators en route to work, Park Avenue matriarchs shopping for veiled hats, and teenage girls chatting in Cadillacs, wearing breezy gingham dresses. Though kept in her private collection until after her death, Meier's negatives were discovered at a storage locker auction in 2007, and published on the photo-sharing site Flickr, to great critical acclaim.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat same year, Tanbetova launched Style du Monde, one of the first street-style blogs created by a female photographer. \"People got very obsessed around 10 years ago,\" Tanbetova tells the BBC. The Soviet-born, Belgian-raised photographer was studying at London fashion school Central Saint Martins when she began photographing her fellow design students outside school buildings and, later, as their careers grew, outside fashion shows.\u00a0\nThe Changing Room\nThe Changing Room\u00a0is a column from the BBC that spotlights the fashion and style innovators on the frontlines of a progressive evolution.\n\"You started seeing these tribes emerge,\" she explains, ones not unlike high-school cafeteria cliques. There were the Chanel tsarinas with their pink tweed coats and pastel ballet slippers, often topped with quilted leather bows. The goth California coven of Rick Owens, with their black shredded jeans and elegant, witchy velvet capes and blazers. The bookish head girls who stormed Prada with logo-covered leather satchels slung over vintage wool kilts. \"It's a bit like people who follow sports teams,\" Tanbetova says. \"You're all rooting for something that's bigger than you are.\" But instead of a football jersey, fashion fans wear a jersey-knit dress by Dior.\u00a0\nAs one of the only women on the street-style photography scene, Tanbetova is aware her perspective is distinctive \u2013 though she insists her colleagues, including fellow Vogue photographer Phil Oh and Tommy Ton, are just as innovative. \"I guess for me, I knew how I wanted to dress, and I understood the commitment it took for these other women to find exactly the right pieces and wear them in such unique ways, even if they weren't 'trendy' or usual.\" She admits that in the beginning, it was hard to get people to pose for a street-style shot. \"It was more unusual in 2007, 2008,\" she says. \"I would have to say, 'Oh, I love your shoes. Oh, I love those colours together. I think you could inspire other people with your style.' That last one always got them!\" she laughs.\n\"What I understood with street style is how hungry my audience was to see real people doing real things,\" says Garance Dor\u00e9, a French photographer from the southern island of Corsica. \"Fashion had been confined to the pages of magazines for so long, and now it was about how people would wear these clothes in their real life.\" Like Tanbetova, Dor\u00e9 began her blog in the early 2000s, first as a fashion illustrator and then as a photographer and stylist. Working alongside other street-style photographers \"taught me a lot about connecting with others\", says Dor\u00e9, whose cohort on the early street-style circuit included Tanbetova, Tamu McPherson of All the Pretty Birds, and photojournalist-turned-fashion photographer Kirstin Sinclair.\u00a0\n\"You all get to the fashion show about 30 minutes before it's supposed to start,\" explains Tanbetova, who receives the show addresses from her assigning editors at Vogue, or from the design houses directly. (Newer street-style photographers without such connections often keep in touch with each other through WhatsApp channels to share information.) \"It's not like a red carpet, where everyone has assigned spots. You just find the place that works for you, which might be on a side street next to some trash cans, you know? It shouldn't be 'perfect'. It should be more real.\"\u00a0King says the authenticity is key to a good street-style shot. \"There is a candidness and real-time nature to the photos. What really resonates is when the photographer captures a slice of life along with the fashion.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nSo what is the secret to spotting those tiny moments? \"I think because we live in the clothes, too,\" says Tanbetova, who likes to wear Rick Owens's slip-on black sneakers for Adidas when she's working. When I catch McPherson outside Tod's show in Milan, she sports a pair of of-the-moment black loafers. \"We have places to be!\" she exclaims, but also, trends to set.\nAs an editor-in-chief and stylist, Errico says that street-style photographs \"always\" influence his creative vocabulary, especially when he's dressing influential celebrities like Sienna Miller and Gisele Bundchen. \"How are kids wearing their clothes right now? Are their jackets being worn off their shoulders, or do they only have one arm through their tops? Is everyone layering up or going sheer?\"\nMeanwhile, in a bit of snake-eats-tail irony, Tanbetova has been asked by major fashion houses to shoot their catwalk models as if they're street-style stars. Scroll through her pictures of the buzzy Miu Miu show in Paris, and you won't see fashion stars like Gigi Hadid and Amelia Gray posing carefully in their catwalk looks. Instead, the models are caught flitting up and down staircases, lingering in hallways, and scurrying into line just seconds before the show starts. \"The magic is in those candid moments of anticipation before the runway,\" she says. \"It's so much cooler if you look like you're living in the clothes.\"\u00a0\nStreet style has also led to avenues far beyond the Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. After nearly a decade photographing street style in New York, London, Milan and Paris, in 2022 Dor\u00e9 moved to California and created an eponymous beauty brand. The line has been endorsed by Gwyneth Paltrow and approved by the Environmental Working Group, but Dor\u00e9 credits its success to her street-style learnings: candid fashion photos \"make people want to learn more about you\", she says. \"I think it's the same with a beauty brand.\" Does she miss the street-style scene? \"I loved it,\" she says. \"But there are incredibly talented women on the scene now. It's their turn.\"\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\n\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",
