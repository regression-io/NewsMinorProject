        "article_text": "A lack of this vital nutrient is one of the world's leading causes of disability \u2013 but exactly when it becomes a problem, and the best way to treat it, remains unclear.\nWhen Megan Ryan first noticed her fatigue, she assumed it was normal. After all, she was a single parent to a three-year-old.\u00a0She also worked full-time. Almost every day, when she picked her son up from daycare, she'd fall asleep with him during his afternoon nap. She didn't think much about it. \"I just thought, 'Oh, this is motherhood',\" says Ryan, who lives in upstate New York, US. At a routine medical check-up in June 2023, her doctor asked if she felt exhausted. Blood test results showed that Ryan had iron deficiency anaemia.\nLooking back, there had been other signs. Despite regularly working out, Ryan had suddenly started to feel winded on routine hikes. She had also had iron deficiency before, during pregnancy. That time, her midwife suspected it after Ryan mentioned that her only pregnancy craving was ice \u2013 a classic sign of pica, which is, in turn, a symptom of iron deficiency.\u00a0\nIron deficiency is the\u00a0most common micronutrient deficiency in the world today, affecting roughly two billion people. It is especially prevalent among children as well as women of reproductive age, including pregnant women.\nThe condition can cause a wide range of consequences. When a pregnant woman doesn't have adequate iron stores, for example, it can affect the foetus' brain development and there is also a higher risk of low birth weight, preterm birth, dying during pregnancy and stillbirth. For babies and toddlers, not having enough iron can affect long-term development, with studies finding that children are at risk\u00a0of exhibiting behavioural issues \u2013 they are less happy and contented, and tend to be more socially inhibited. It can also influence children's motor skills, and cognitive ability even years after a deficiency has been corrected. In adults, iron deficiency is one of the world's leading causes of disability. In rare cases, it can be life-threatening.\n\"It's a major global problem,\" says Michael Zimmermann, professor\u00a0of human nutrition at the University of Oxford in the UK and a long-time researcher of micronutrient deficiencies. \"It's very common. It's not going away very fast. And it is associated with a lot of disability.\"\nMost scientists agree that iron deficiency is a common condition. But other questions persist, such as how exactly to define iron deficiency, or how likely it is, in the absence of other symptoms, to raise the risk of poor health outcomes. So, when should, and shouldn't, someone supplement their iron?\u00a0\nWhat isn't disputed is that some groups are more susceptible to iron deficiency than others.\nIn women, for example, iron-deficiency anaemia \u2013 where the body does not have enough iron to make sufficient red blood cells \u2013 is a leading cause of disability worldwide. One study of first-time US blood donors found that iron levels were low in 12% of women, but in less than 3% of men, reflecting the impact made by regular blood loss through menstruation. Then there's the impact of pregnancy, which diverts nutrition to the foetus, meaning that women in this group are particularly at risk. One study found that 46% of UK women had anaemia at some point during pregnancy \u2013 though not all cases stemmed from iron deficiency.\nEndurance athletics, vegetarianism or veganism and frequent blood donation can all put both men and women at increased risk. People with certain health conditions might also be prone to lower iron levels. Kidney disease and coeliac disease can decrease iron absorption, for example.\nBut children are among the most vulnerable group to iron deficiency because the mineral is so important for their development.\n\"What's the most rapid period of growth in our entire lifespan? Infancy,\" says Mark Corkins, chair of the Committee on Nutrition at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). \"You triple your birth weight by a year of age. You double your length.\" As our bodies grow, they need more blood. And red blood cells are built \u2013 in part \u2013 on iron. Without that necessary iron, says Corkins, you risk not able to produce enough red blood cells to deliver oxygen to your growing tissues, including the brain.\nIron deficiency is especially common in children from lower income countries. \"In studies I've done in Africa, 70% of babies between six and 12 months of age have clear iron-deficiency anaemia,\" says Zimmermann.\nEven in wealthier countries, which have better overall nutrition and which are more likely to fortify certain food products with iron, this deficiency persists. Up to 4% of toddlers in the US, for example, have iron-deficiency anaemia, while some 15% have iron deficiency.\nIron deficiency, iron-deficiency anaemia, and anaemia\nAnaemia occurs when someone is not producing enough normal red blood cells or haemoglobin, the substance that carries oxygen around in your blood. While this can be due to various factors, around half of all anaemia cases are caused by iron deficiency. Adults with this condition, iron-deficiency anaemia, might experience weakness, extreme fatigue, or shortness of breath, among other symptoms. Symptoms in babies and small children are similar, though they might also have sleep issues \u2013 particularly frequent night wakes, restlessness during sleep, and difficulty falling asleep.\nJust because someone is iron deficient does not necessarily mean they will have anaemia. \"Iron deficiency can be considered a stage prior to anaemia,\" says clinical haemotologist Sant-Rayn Pasricha, the head of the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health who specialises in iron deficiency and related conditions.\nThe severity of the deficiency plays a key role, Pasricha explains. When someone gets low on iron, their body begins to form red blood cells differently, he says. They get smaller and, eventually, the amount of oxygen-carrying haemoglobin in that person's blood drops below a healthy level. \"That's when we reach iron deficiency anaemia,\" Pasricha says.\nIron deficiency and anaemia are generally diagnosed with a blood test \u2013 usually one that examines levels of ferritin, a protein that helps store iron, or haemoglobin.\nSome specialists question whether iron deficiency is always a cause for concern \u2013 especially if it arises in the absence of any physical symptoms and if the patient does not have anaemia.\nPasricha co-authored a review to help inform the World Health Organization's guidelines on iron supplementation in women. In that research, he found something interesting.\u00a0\nWhile those women in clinical trials who were iron deficient and reported feeling fatigued found that their fatigue improved upon taking iron supplements, the intervention didn't change the energy levels of women who were also iron deficient, but who had not reported fatigue.\u00a0\n\"This hints to us that, at least in adults, if you're clinically unwell with an iron deficiency, then of course you should be treated and that will improve how you feel,\" Pasricha says. \"But it also suggests that, if you're feeling perfectly fine, and someone just finds that you have a low iron level \u2013 then it's hard to be sure that that treating you then would boost you to feel any different.\"\nOverall, iron deficiency in the absence of anaemia has been studied less than iron-deficiency anaemia. But there are some broad conclusions we can make, researchers say.\n\"The consensus is that iron-deficiency anaemia is certainly worse,\" says Zimmermann. \"But iron deficiency is also associated with impairment.\"\nAccording to some studies, the effects of iron-deficiency anaemia \u2013 particularly in children \u2013 can be long-lasting. \"It's not just about [poor health outcomes] \u2013 it is that you didn't maximise your development,\" Corkins says.\nOne review, for example, found a \"consistent association\" between children with iron-deficiency anaemia having poorer cognitive performance compared to controls. However, the researchers note, perhaps it's not iron-deficiency anaemia that's the problem. It could be the effect of anaemia in general, which depresses energy levels. The researchers also say in their review that it is hard to rule out the influence of socioeconomic factors on children\u2019s behaviour and cognition.\nThis complexity lies at the heart of all nutrition research: is it the absence of a nutrient itself that's the problem, or is that deficiency a sign of something else going on?\nTo complicate matters further, the criteria for defining iron deficiency in children is still up for debate, says Zimmermann. Because children are growing so fast, he adds, iron deficiency normally quickly leads to anaemia \u2013 which means it's not easy to find, and study, iron-deficient children who are not anaemic.\nGiven that, and the potential consequences for their development, guidelines often advise supplementing children with iron at any sign of deficiency \u2013 or even to supplement as a prevention measure.\u00a0\nIn the US, for example, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies who are exclusively breastfed receive iron drops from four months old, for example. This is because breastmilk has low levels of iron, while formula milk is usually fortified.\nBut some researchers question this approach.\nPasricha was involved in the largest trial to date that has examined the effect of supplementation on child development, he says. The study, of 3,300 eight-month-old babies in Bangladesh, randomised children into groups that received either daily iron supplementation for three months, or a placebo. He and colleagues measured the children's neurodevelopment before and after the supplementation. \"We did not see any evidence of a functional benefit,\" he says, although they also saw no harm either way.\n\"We did see that haemoglobin and iron status did improve in the children that received iron \u2013 but we didn't see that affect child development,\" says Pasricha. The \"why\", he says, \"is something that the team is really grappling with\".\nOther research has yielded similar findings. For example, in one study, even after infants with iron-deficiency anaemia received supplementation that corrected their anaemia, they continued to show more restless sleep patterns than their cohorts \u2013 sometimes even years later.\nOne possible reason might be that even a brief period of deficiency can lead to long-lasting harm. One study, for example, found that when children had had iron deficiency at birth, they had less activation in the regions of their brain related to cognitive control at eight to 11 years old \u2013 even if their iron levels had been corrected.\u00a0\nBut another possibility, Pasricha says, is that it isn't the low iron itself that causes poorer development, but that low iron is an indicator of something else \u2013 such as other nutrients in a person's diet that are missing.\nMeanwhile, there could also be downsides to supplementing children who don't actually have a deficiency. Some studies have found that babies and toddlers who had adequate iron levels, but received supplementation, had poorer weight gain and less growth compared to controls. Randomised controlled trials have found that babies randomly assigned to high-iron formula milk scored more poorly on cognitive tests of abilities like visual memory, reading comprehension and mathematics at both 10 years old and 16 years old, compared to those on a low-iron formulation. However, exactly how much iron supplementation would avoid these effects remains unclear, the researchers say as other factors could also be involved.\nGiven results like this, however, some experts have criticised US guidelines to supplement all breastfed infants.\nSupplements can also have other side effects. Zimmermann, for example, has studied how supplementation can affect people's microbiome. Bacteria thrive on iron, he says. The very small amount of iron that breastmilk has is bound to protective substances like lactoferrin, which helps to keep iron away from potential pathogens in the gut \u2013 especially protective for babies, who have immature immune systems. Giving a baby aged six months old micronutrient powders containing iron, which is what many experts recommend, could result in a negative outcome, says Zimmermann.\n\"These powders have very high amounts of iron in them\u2026 which can cause a very rapid shift in the microbiome,\" says Zimmermann. The babies can't absorb all that iron, which ends up impacting their gut microbiome \u2013 potentially towards a balance favouring \"the pathogens we worry most about in babies\", he says. This includes E. coli, which grows prolifically in the presence of iron.\nMany clinicians and researchers agree, however, that when someone has iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anaemia along with symptoms, supplementing can be one of the fastest ways to help them improve. One review of iron deficiency in endurance athletes, for example, found that supplementation not only improved ferritin and haemoglobin, but athletes' aerobic capacity, too.\u00a0\nWhether to take supplements \u2013 or give them to a child \u2013 is something that people should decide with the help of a doctor, experts say.\nBut in an ideal world, people would get sufficient iron by eating a balanced diet that includes iron-rich foods, and avoid developing a deficiency in the first place \u2013 though this is not always possible. Ingredients such as liver or red meat, pulses, including kidney and edamame beans and chickpeas, as well as nuts and dried fruits are all considered good sources of iron.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants aged six to 12 months need 11 mg of iron per day. For toddlers, they recommend 7 mg, and for four- to eight-year-olds, 10 mg.\nPart of the higher recommendation for younger babies is because of their rapid development, experts say. But it's also because there is an assumption being made that most infants' first solids will be foods like iron-fortified cereals, as well as fruits and vegetables \u2013 non-heme sources of iron, which the body absorbs less readily than heme sources, which are animal-derived, like meat, fish and eggs.\n\"Diet is the best approach. Your body tends to take it up better. Your body tends to use it better,\" Corkins says. \"Now, if someone is profoundly anaemic, and you're trying to get them fixed faster \u2013 then you do supplementation.\"\nAs for Ryan, she was able to correct her iron deficiency both times it happened: in pregnancy, with a supplement, and in 2023, with iron infusions, administered at her hospital, every two weeks for five months. \"It wasn't a quick fix,\" she says. With time, however, she noticed her fatigue fade.\nDisclaimer\n All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of a doctor or any other health care professional.

Text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app. Listen live on BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Radio 5 Live.\nInterim Wales head coach Matt Sherratt will find himself in an unusual situation this weekend.\nIn his final game in temporary charge, the English-born coach will be plotting the downfall of England when the two sides meet in the Six Nations finale in Cardiff.\nBorn in Gloucester within a drop-kick of the famous Kingsholm ground, Sherratt grew up in a household that was fiercely divided on rugby days between an English father and his Tredegar-born mother.\n\"I used to have to sit between my mum and dad to split them up and then I'd switch sides depending on who won,\" Sherratt joked.\n\"I probably went through the generations. In the 1970s I was probably wearing red a little bit more and then come the 1990s and early 2000s my dad's voice probably took over the house a little bit more.\n\"He's going to the game at the weekend and I've managed to change him I think [from England to Wales].

Family interest in tickets for this weekend's game has peaked even more.\nSherratt was emotional this week when asked about his final game in charge as he highlighted the role his family have played.\n\"The Cardiff boys will tell you, I have a wobble probably two or three times a season, as soon as it becomes about family it's pretty easy to go,\" said Sherratt.\n\"But I have loved it, I'm not going to hide away from it, it's something I'm proud of and enjoyed and so have the family.\n\"My son's main motivation is getting on the pitch afterwards. I had to knock on the door of the Scottish changing room so he could have photos with Finn Russell. \n\"He enjoys that and he's pestering me about trying to meet Fin Smith and Marcus Smith this weekend. I think he's more interested in his Instagram account.\"\nEngland's Marcus Smith returns as Freeman starts at centre\nWales bring in Roberts and Wainwright for England\nHawkins eligible for Wales after Scarlets signing\nMatt Sherratt has introduced some fun into training sessions during his time in charge of Wales\nSherratt has added positivity to the beleaguered Wales team with plenty of fun on show in the final training session before the England game.\nThere have still been two more defeats against Ireland and Scotland which has taken the losing sequence to 16. \nOn Six Nations 'Super Saturday' Wales have traditionally been in the hunt for Six Nations titles or Grand Slams. Now they are hoping to avoid a second successive Wooden Spoon.\nThe statistics are stark. Wales' most recent Test match victory came against World Cup pool opponents Georgia in October 2023.\nHaving been beaten in all four games of this campaign, Wales are bidding to avoid a 17th successive Test defeat, which would be the most for a tier one nation in the professional era.\nThey hope to miss out on an 11th Six Nations consecutive loss with the previous win against Italy in March 2023.\nWales are bidding to avoid a clean sweep of defeats in successive tournaments for the first time in their history.\nThe myth Cardiff provides home comforts has also been dispelled. Wales have lost their previous eight home games after defeating England in August 2023.\nThey have also been defeated in the past eight Six Nations matches at the Principality Stadium since beating Scotland in February 2022.\nThis video can not be played\nWales v England: Ashton & Dawson on Principality 'banana skin'\nBefore he agreed to taking on the role, former teacher Sherratt admitted he thought about the toll the losing sequence would be taking on young captains like Jac Morgan, Dafydd Jenkins and Dewi Lake.\n\"I remember watching the games more as a supporter and seeing Jac, Dewi and Daf in interviews afterwards,\" said Sherratt.\n\"As a coach and maybe an ex-teacher, I hoped it wasn't something they were taking home with them. \n\"They should be at the stage of their career where they're just loving playing for Wales. \n\"Those three lead by example and I know how much it means for them to play for Wales.\n\"My role coming in was to take some of the burden off them.

I would love to sign off [with a win], not for me but for the players and staff who have been here for a long time.  \n\"It's important it's not something we talk about a huge amount about in camp or you can get a bit desperate. \n\"Maybe the emotion takes over some technical or tactical aspects. There'll be emotion on Saturday and stacks of heart.

He told us he hoped the intervention would lead to ''concrete change'' for people like him.\nThe 19-year-old worker, who we're calling Alan, told us in January he had been repeatedly subjected to \"degrading and humiliating\" verbal abuse by his colleagues, and faced \"homophobic slurs\".\nAlan still works there. He says things are not much different and he wants to \"get away\" from it.\nThe letter from the EHRC called the allegations in our investigation \"troubling\" and noted there have been \"repeated incidents\".\nThe vast majority of McDonald's restaurants are run by franchises, which means individual operators are licensed to run the outlets and employ the staff.\nIn February 2023, the watchdog entered into a legally binding agreement with McDonald's to prevent sexual harassment in its restaurants.\nFranchises were not covered by that agreement.\nBut in its latest letter, the EHRC said all businesses in Britain, small or large, must comply with the Equality Act.\n''It is your duty to ensure that any anti-discrimination and harassment measures you currently have in place are effective, and to take any necessary steps to protect your workers,\" the chief executive of the EHRC, John Kirkpatrick, told the restaurants.\nThe letter sets out the ''reasonable steps\" that restaurants could take to prevent sexual harassment.\nThese include regular risk assessments, ensuring younger and more vulnerable workers are properly safeguarded and ensuring complaints are dealt with sensitively and effectively through an established procedure.\nIt added that any franchise restaurant that does not comply with its legal duties \"may be at risk of enforcement action''.\nThe EHRC has a range of statutory enforcement powers open to it, including the ability to launch formal investigations.\nIf an organisation repeatedly refuses to comply, then the watchdog can take it through the courts, where an unlimited fine could be issued.\nLiam Byrne, chair of the Business and Trade Select Committee, said the BBC's investigation of abuse at McDonald's had \"exposed malpractice which was totally and utterly unacceptable\".\nHe called for the EHRC to explain \"why it is only now writing to McDonald's restaurants about their new duty under the law, to prevent sexual harassment from taking place, when it came into effect nearly six months ago\".\nHe said it was \"especially concerning because the regulator has known about hundreds of allegations of harassment for several years\".\nHe added: \"Parliamentary committees have now twice found the vigour of their enforcement to be disappointing. It's now vital the public are reassured they're on top of the problem - and not behind the curve.\"\nEHRC head John Kirkpatrick told the BBC's Today programme that the letter was a \"starting point\".\n\"If it's not proving successful, we can investigate further. If we can find legal robust evidence of breaches of the law then we can impose an action plan on them and if they don't follow that, a court can impose fines on them,\" he said.\n\"The most effective and efficient way to make progress is through agreements but if that's not progressing adequately that's when we can take stronger and further action.\"\nThe BBC first began investigating working conditions at McDonald's more than two years ago, after the fast-food chain signed its agreement with the EHRC.\nIn July 2023, we published our initial investigation, which reported claims by workers, some as young as 17, of being groped and harassed almost routinely.\nAt the time, McDonald's apologised and set up a new unit to deal with complaints.\nSince then, more than 160 people have approached the BBC with allegations while the EHRC has heard 300 reported incidents of harassment.\nEarlier this year, we reported that the watchdog plans to intervene again, \"in light of serious allegations raised by our work with the company, and the BBC investigation\".\nThe BBC understands the action plan will involve strengthening the existing measures - which included providing more training and conducting a survey of workers - as well as announcing new steps.\nAlistair Macrow, the boss of McDonald's in the UK, has been summoned twice to Parliament to answer questions in front of MPs since our initial investigation.\nIn January, he said 29 people had been dismissed over sexual harassment allegations over the past 12 months.\nIn a statement, a McDonald's spokesperson said the agreement with the EHRC was signed \"with the intention that it continues to evolve to ensure the robust measures we have in place are aligned with any updated guidance\".\nIt said the letter was sent \"to remind our franchisees of their legal obligations to provide a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace for their employees - which is the same legal requirement of all employers,\" adding that it \"welcomes\" any steps that mean it is continuing to make progress in this area.\nIt said that together with its franchisees, it is committed to doing everything it can to ensure a safe working environment for all employees, with initiatives and measures as part of a cultural action plan.\n\"These actions include everything from enhanced training programmes and onboarding practices, through to the launch of a new digital speak up channel designed with our and our franchisees' restaurant crew in mind,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"We are confident that the plan we have in place is working and making a difference to the near 170,000 people currently employed by McDonald's and our franchisees across McDonald's in the UK & Ireland today.\"\nThey added that its latest anonymous employee survey showed that 94% of people are aware of ways in which they can speak up.\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this story, information and support is available via the BBC Action Line.\nSome of the names in this story have been changed to protect identities.\nGet our flagship daily newsletter delivered straight to your inbox first thing, with all the latest headlines you need to start the day.

''It is your duty to ensure that any anti-discrimination and harassment measures you currently have in place are effective, and to take any necessary steps to protect your workers,\" the chief executive of the EHRC, John Kirkpatrick, told the restaurants.Unlimited finesThe letter sets out the ''reasonable steps\" that restaurants could take to prevent sexual harassment.These include regular risk assessments, ensuring younger and more vulnerable workers are properly safeguarded and ensuring complaints are dealt with sensitively and effectively through an established procedure.It added that any franchise restaurant that does not comply with its legal duties \"may be at risk of enforcement action''.The EHRC has a range of statutory enforcement powers open to it, including the ability to launch formal investigations.If an organisation repeatedly refuses to comply, then the watchdog can take it through the courts, where an unlimited fine could be issued. \"The BBC first began investigating working conditions at McDonald's more than two years ago, after the fast-food chain signed its agreement with the EHRC.In July 2023, we published our initial investigation, which reported claims by workers, some as young as 17, of being groped and harassed almost routinely.At the time, McDonald's apologised and set up a new unit to deal with complaints.Since then, more than 160 people have approached the BBC with allegations while the EHRC has heard 300 reported incidents of harassment.Other claims the BBC heard include:A 19-year-old worker said managers would \"touch up\" other members of staff and some colleagues were scared of going into work.",

It declined the BBC's request for comment.\nThe move, however, comes just days before a federal judge is due to hear a legal challenge on the legality of the federal government's move to send migrants to Guantanamo, in a lawsuit filed by a coalition of human rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union. \nUS media report that 40 migrants were flown from Guantanamo to Alexandria in Louisiana on Tuesday and Wednesday, where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has a processing facility.\nA facility used to hold migrants at Guantanamo, called the Guantanamo Migrant Operations Center, has been used by both Republican and Democratic administrations for decades - a practice long-criticised by some human rights groups.\nAnother facility, a high-security military prison once used to house detainees suspected of terrorism offences, is also located at Guantanamo. \nThe Washington Post reports that as of 10 March, 23 migrants were being held in the military detention facility, while 17 others were detained in the Migrant Operations Center, citing a Pentagon official.\nLast week, a defence official told the BBC the US military had last received a request from DHS to transport undocumented migrants to Guantanamo Bay on 1 March, adding that it stood ready to assist if additional flights are requested.\nThe expansion of the existing migrant centre at Guantanamo is part of a wider effort to dramatically overhaul the US immigration system, which has included promises of mass deportations.\nAt a signing ceremony early in his term, Trump said that the facility would largely be used to hold undocumented migrants deemed to be dangerous criminals or national security risks. \n\"Some of them are so bad we don't even trust the countries to hold them, because we don't want them coming back,\" he said of migrants. \"So we're going to send them to Guantanamo... it's a tough place to get out.\"\nThe administration's \"border tsar\", Tom Homan, defended the use of the facility as recently as last week and said that plans for its expansion were still under way. \nOn 4 March, for example, he said the facility was \"the perfect place for the worst of the worst\" and that plans for its expansion were still in place. \nCourt documents filed late last week show that about 300 migrants from 27 countries have gone through the facility.\nTwo separate lawsuits have been filed challenging migrant detention in such facilities. \nIn one case, a coalition of legal aid organisations is seeking a court order allowing detainees at the facility access to attorneys, including in-person visits. \nA second lawsuit directly challenges the legality of transferring migrants detained in the US to Guantanamo.

She came second only to Democrats leader Jens Frederik Nielsen in the popular vote.\n\"It's the second biggest party, so you can't avoid them,\" Nielsen told local reporters. \"But we don't want to rule out the other parties beforehand.\"\nThe two current governing parties, Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA) and Siumut, are heading for  third and fourth place - marking an upset for Prime Minister Mute B Egede.\nMore than 40,000 Greenlanders out of a population of 57,000 were eligible to cast their votes to elect 31 MPs, as well as the local government. Six parties were on the ballot.\nThe voting took place at 72 polling stations scattered across the vast island.\n\"The Democrats need a supporting partner to be able to have a majority,\" says Maria Ackren from the University of Greenland. \"It would say it can be either Naleraq or Inuit Ataqatigiit. It's up to the Democrats to try to figure out what they want.\"\nSince 2009 Greenland has had the right to call an independence referendum.\nAlthough Naleraq is pushing for a vote within a few years, Jens-Frederik Nielsen's party favours a gradual approach towards independence, focusing first on making self-government a success.\nProf Ackren believes the Democrats won, partly because Greenlanders wanted a change of government, but also because they were unhappy with new fisheries laws and other domestic issues. \nIndependence is seen as the end goal for most Greenlanders, but not before reforms have been made to the economy, health and other sectors, she says.\nGreenland's strategic location and untapped mineral resources have caught President Trump's eye in particular. He first floated the idea of buying the island during his first term in 2019.\nSince taking office again in January, Trump has reiterated his intention to acquire the territory.\n\"We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're gonna get it,\" he said during his address to the US Congress last week.\nGreenland and Denmark's leaders have repeatedly rebuffed his demands.\nThe leader of the Democrats said Greenland needed to adopt a calm course with the US. He told public broadcaster KNR that while big developments were happening globally, they should stand together and speak with one voice.",

        "article_text": "Gianluigi Donnarumma joined Paris St-Germain in 2021\nIt is the life of a goalkeeper. \nOne day you are the villain. The next, you are the hero.\nGianluigi Donnarumma was blamed by some for Paris St-Germain's defeat by Liverpool last week, allowing Harvey Elliot's 88th-minute effort - the Reds' only shot on target - to slip in. \nAt the other end, the Italian's opposite number Alisson produced the \"performance of his career\" as he single-handedly kept the French side at bay in Paris. \nOn Tuesday night, the tables turned.\nItaly's Donnarumma was the hero, saving two of Liverpool's three penalties in a shootout to send his side through to the Champions League quarter-finals. \n\"The first game belonged to Alisson, the second game belonged to Donnarumma,\" said PSG boss Luis Enrique.\nDonnarumma has now won six of the seven penalty shootouts he has taken part in for club and country.\nSince making his debut aged 16 for boyhood club AC Milan, Donnarumma has faced 60 penalties across his club and international career. \nHe has saved 14 of those, giving him a save percentage of 23.3%.\nRemarkably, the Italian's penalty shootout record is identical.\nThe 26-year-old has saved 10 of the 43 spot-kicks he has faced during shootouts - a save percentage of 23.3%.  \nDonnarumma, who was player of the tournament after Italy's 2021 Euros triumph, saved penalties from Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho in the final against England at Wembley. \nHis full record for penalties faced during matches and in shootouts is 24 saves from 103 penalties. \nDonnarumma missed Luis Enrique's pre-shootout team talk as he headed down the tunnel, choosing instead to retrieve some pre-prepared notes from the dressing room about Liverpool's spot-kicks.\n\"I had prepared something with my trainer, it was right to take something back to try to save some penalties,\" said Donnarumma. \n\"I see a lot of criticism from journalists without knowing what the goalkeeper's job is.\n\"In the first leg we conceded a shot and a goal, it seemed like it was my fault but I always think about smiling, giving my best and working for the team.\"\nAt 6ft 5in, Donnarumma cuts an imposing figure.\nBut unlike many of his peers, he has a slightly different tactic for penalties.\nMany goalkeepers use the moments before a penalty is taken to attempt to 'get into the head' of the taker - slowing down the taking of the penalty, retrieving the ball for the taker or moving along their line. \nDonnarumma is different.\nLaidback and calm, the Italian barely moves until the player puts the ball on the spot. \nJust as they are readying their run-up, he expands his arms to make the goal look as small as possible. \n\"The idea behind that is to stand as slim as you can to start with,\" former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock told Football Daily.\n\"The ball goes on the spot, now you're putting doubt in their mind, you spread yourself, make yourself big and awkward, making the goal look smaller. \n\"You don't do that when they're walking forward. You do it when the ball is on the spot to put doubt in their mind in the last seconds.\" \nDonnarumma remained level-headed after both of his penalty saves, barely celebrating as he prepared for the next. \n\"I'm sat here watching Donnarumma and thinking, 'Wow, look at the size of him!'\" Warnock added.\n\"How imposing is he in that goal? If he dives the right way he stands a great chance of getting it. The guy's a monster.\" \nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Reflecting back on the Netflix hit based on his own life, there are two things that come to mind for Palestinian comedian Mo Amer.\nPride and hurt.\n\"It's very difficult to talk about without breaking down at some point,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat.\nHe is the star of the semi-autobiographical show titled Mo, playing the role of Mo Najjar.\nThe character is a Palestinian refugee learning to adapt to his new world as he seeks to gain US citizenship by navigating a complicated immigration process - all while trying to bring together his cultures and languages.\nMaking a show so closely tied to his life was \"very taxing\" because of \"the sheer amount of emotion\" involved.\n\"I'm extremely proud of it. I put my soul into it and I'm still hurting from making it,\" Mo says.\nThere was another challenge to navigate - when this second season would be set.\nThe final episode, which depicts Mo's visit to his family home in the West Bank, is set on 6 October 2023.\nThat's a day before the armed Palestinian group Hamas launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages.\nThis triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nAvoiding 7 October in the storyline was \"very intentional\", Mo says. \nThe show is ultimately \"grounded in comedy\", he says, and episodes set post-attack drew focus away from the storyline and the characters.\n\"You weren't really tracking them, the emotions of them,\" says Mo.\nMo says he wanted to keep the \"greater context\" in mind and that focusing on 7 October and its aftermath  \"almost insinuates this just started\".\n\"That couldn't be further from the truth,\" he says, referring to the long history of the conflict.\nThere was a practical consideration too, he says, due to the length of time between filming and release being over a year.\n\"That was kind of like scary territory to write about something, and then all these things would happen.\n\"And then whatever you had written and composed in the series could be irrelevant.\"\nThe show has broadly had a positive reception, with the finale being emotional for fans - and Mo.\nIt tracks the character's journey with his family to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and their experience of life there.\nFrom his perspective, it shows the complicated day-to-day issues Palestinians can face, such as being subjected to closer scrutiny at checkpoints controlled by Israeli soldiers.\nMo's character is also shown being tear-gassed.\nThe West Bank - land between Israel and the River Jordan - is home to an estimated three million Palestinians and half a million Jewish settlers.\nAlong with East Jerusalem and Gaza, it is part of what is widely known as the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\nIsrael occupied the areas in the 1967 Middle East war and built settlements, which are considered illegal under international law. Israel disputes this.\nPalestinians claim the areas for a future independent state and want all the settlements removed.\n\"I've gotten so many calls from people just completely in shambles after watching the last episode and how meaningful it was to them to watch,\" Mo says.\nHe adds it was \"not only Palestinians\" contacting him.\nMo says the final episode - originally 60 minutes long - was \"almost like we filmed a movie\" before it was eventually edited down to 39 minutes.\nHe says he wanted to cover \"the main strokes\", which included how difficult it can be to enter and live as a Palestinian once there.\n\"Immediately, you're not on vacation,\" he says. \"You're on edge, actually.\"\nMo feels there has generally been limited representation of Palestinians in TV and film, which means more pressure on his shoulders.\n\"There's a lot of [pressure] from the fans\u2026 more outside voices of what I should say and not say - both Palestinian and non-Palestinian,\" he says.\n\"You really have to put the blinders on and stay focused on telling the story that I know and that I've experienced first-hand.\"\nMo says he can't \"walk away\" from being seen as a spokesperson for Palestinians, admitting to feeling \"like public property at this point\".\n\"I think that everyone just needs to manage their expectations.

It is made up primarily of managers and officials, not the doctors and nurses providing care in hospitals.\nThe government provides it with money and tells it what its priorities are for the health service - for example, that might be cutting waiting times or improving cancer survival rates.\nNHS England's role is to funnel the money it is given into different parts of the health service and work out how to juggle resources in order to bring about the change the government wants to see.\nIn 2012, NHS England was given more independence by the Conservative-led government. They said doing so would prevent politicians from interfering too much in how front line services are run - but critics say that change has made it harder to carry out reform or drive improvement.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer believes that overhauling management structures will put NHS in England \"back into democratic control\" and free up money for front-line services. \nNHS England is also responsible for other functions like overseeing training and collecting data, as well as managing GP services.\nThere are separate organisations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, so these changes only impact England.\nWithin the NHS and Westminster, the writing has been on the wall for NHS England for some months.\nEven in the latter years of the Tory government, health ministers expressed frustration that they were not in charge of the day-to-day running of the health service.\nWhen Labour came into power, it was clear Health Secretary Wes Streeting wanted more control of the NHS and saw a lot of duplication and bureaucracy.\nNHS England's chief executive Amanda Pritchard recently said she would step down at the end of the March and a number of her senior leadership team have followed suit.\nIn that respect, it was clear there was going to be significant reform - but this is as big a change as you could possibly get at the heart of the NHS management structure.\nThese are two words we have heard the government use a lot when setting out why it is scrapping NHS England and bringing the health service under closer government control.\nIn this context, bureaucracy is a stand-in word for a system that is particularly complicated, or requires excessive amounts of administration, paperwork, regulations or layers of management.\nStarmer made it clear he thinks this sort of admin is getting in the way of delivering health services.\nWe also heard him describe NHS England as the \"world's largest quango\" - a term that stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation.\nIn short, quangos are bodies like regulators and advisory groups, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by central government. They do things on behalf of the government, but are not directly controlled by ministers.\nThey range from big organisations like NHS England, Network Rail and the Environment Agency to smaller ones like the British Film Institute and Gambling Commission. \nTheir numbers have fallen by more than half since 2010 because David Cameron's coalition government abolished nearly 300 - but there are still more than 300 across the UK.\nLabour has set up more than 20 since winning the election last July, including Great British Energy and Skills England.\nThe total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - when the latest figures were published - was \u00a3353bn.\nWe do not yet know all of the detail about how health services in England will be managed in the future but it is likely that some of the responsibilities NHS England currently holds will be devolved down to regional bodies.\nOne of the arguments being made about NHS reform is that if you move decision-making down to a local level and nearer to patients, it will be health leaders who are more attuned to the needs of patients in the area making those calls.\nThey will know what local populations need and where the weaknesses are - and that, in theory, could improve services for patients in different parts of the country.\nThursday's announcement was not about funding - that is expected in the summer.\nWe already know NHS is getting an uplift of about 3-4% next year and we do not yet know what spending will look like beyond that.\nBut government sources believe scrapping NHS England will save the government \u00a3500m a year.\nOn access to medicines, it is the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - which is separate from NHS England - which sets the guidelines on what treatments are judged affordable and cost effective.\nWhen a new drug is produced by the pharmaceutical industry, the institute will decide if the NHS can afford it and whether it is better than other drugs that are used.

        "article_text": "England head coach Thomas Tuchel has named his first squad since succeeding Gareth Southgate\nEngland manager Thomas Tuchel has named his first squad since succeeding Gareth Southgate - and it is a selection that is already prompting wide debate.\nTuchel has recalled former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, who is 35 in June, while Marcus Rashford is rewarded with a return to the squad for his fine form on loan at Aston Villa from Manchester United.\nHe has also revealed first picks at either end of the age scale from Arsenal's 18-year-old Myles Lewis-Skelly to 32-year-old Newcastle United defender Dan Burn for the World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia at Wembley next Friday (21 March) and Monday (24 March) respectively.\nSo what can be unpicked from Tuchel's first indication of England's future direction?\nHenderson embodies everything we try to build - Tuchel\nReaction, analysis & your views on Tuchel\u2019s first England squad\nPick your England XI for World Cup qualifiers - and fans have their say\nTuchel's appointment as England head coach has always carried the feel of an 18-month job focussed entirely on winning the World Cup and not beyond.\nWin then move on. Lose then move on.\nThe Football Association provoked debate, and some criticism, by ignoring the claims of English candidates such as Eddie Howe in their succession plan post-Southgate, to go for the best man available regardless of nationality.\nThe strategy was clear. The long-term can wait while a proven winner takes charge and Tuchel's first England squad merely confirms it.\nThere is a nod to the next generation with the inclusion of versatile defender Lewis-Skelly with England short at left-back and Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers, who is 22, but there was the definite whiff of short-term targets in Tuchel's selection.\nHowever, the recall of Henderson is the most eye-catching example of Tuchel wanting experience for the here and now. He last played for England in November 2023 and missed out on selection for last summer's Euro 2024.\nTuchel described Henderson as a \"serial winner\" and this is what the coach has in mind as he plots a path to next year's World Cup.\nJordan Henderson's England career looked over when he was left out of Gareth Southgate's Euro 2024 squad\nAnd then there is the shock selection of Burn. \nA wonderful story, as Newcastle United manager Howe agreed, but a very late stage for any player to prove they are international class.\nBurn would be the oldest player to win his first England cap since Bolton Wanderers striker Kevin Davies made his debut against Montenegro on 12 October 2010 at 33 years and 200 days. The bustling forward was the oldest since 38-year-old Leslie Compton in 1950.\nIt is very much a case of going back to the past for the short-term future. Former interim boss Lee Carsley's last squad contained a total 627 caps, while this one has a tally of 664.\nTuchel is missing younger players who have been injured recently, such as Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, but is clear the German's reign is not going to be a slow burner.\nThe selection of Henderson and the return of Rashford demonstrates that Tuchel is prepared to start with a clean slate.\nHenderson's call-up came out of the blue after it looked like his England career was over when he, like Rashford, was left out of Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2024.\nThe former Liverpool captain had an ill-fated stint in Saudi Arabia before returning to Europe with Ajax, where Tuchel has clearly seen enough to recall him.\nTuchel appears to want Henderson as much for his influence off the pitch, saying: \"What he brings every time is leadership, character, personality and energy. He makes sure everyone lives by the standards and with character. He embodies everything we are trying to build.\"\nEngland's head coach has long been a fan of Rashford and wants to be the beneficiary of Aston Villa manager Unai Emery's repair job on the forward's career.\nHe said: \"I had a strong feeling we should nominate him, to push him to stay at the level he is at now not fall back into old routines.\"\nTuchel's words offer an indication that he realises Rashford had fallen by the wayside at Old Trafford but is also convinced the 27-year-old can offer much to his new England.\nHe clearly does not feel the same about Manchester City's Jack Grealish. He would have been hoping to make a comeback after also missing out on Euro 2024, although he has not figured regularly under manager Pep Guardiola.\nTottenham midfielder James Maddison is another who is, for now at least, consigned to the margins,\nTuchel goes with what he knows by recalling Chelsea's Reece James as he makes his return from another hamstring injury. \nHe was a key member of Tuchel's side that won the Champions League in 2021 and there is a potential opening at right-back with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, Kyle Walker, 34, and on loan at AC Milan, and with Newcastle United's Tino Livramento talented but inexperienced.\nThis video can not be played\n'When Rashford plays, he's one of the best'\nWatch The Football News Show on Tuchel's first England squad\nHenderson embodies everything we try to build - Tuchel\nTuchel has made no secret of his desire to utilise the natural physical aspects of the English style into his squad and this is in evidence with this selection.\nBurn, at 6 feet 7 inches, fits the bill, while Rogers combines raw power with natural skill and strong running. James also combines physical strength with great ability -and the squad has a very powerful look.\nTuchel was asked whether that lack of physicality cost England in previous tournaments.\nHe said: \"I don't think a lot is missing. Obviously a little bit is because we lost consecutive Euros finals and World Cup semi-final and quarter-finals. \n\"The feeling is a little step is needed to bring it over the line.\"\nTuchel's squad is sure to cause debate, especially in Nottingham, where Forest fans will feel Morgan Gibbs-White could have offered an \"X Factor\" after his outstanding performances in their tilt to reach the Champions League.\nThey will also offer up Callum Hudson-Odoi as an example of someone who deserves a return to the England squad after his rejuvenation, exemplified by his winning goal against Manchester City that puts Forest in such a wonderful position to reach the top four.\nEverton defender Jarrad Branthwaite, who won a full cap under Southgate, also misses out despite being in outstanding form since manager David Moyes returned to Goodison Park.

        "summary": "Has Tuchel's first squad revealed England's short-term strategy?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, England head coach Thomas Tuchel has named his first squad since succeeding Gareth SouthgatePhil McNultyChief football writerPublished14 March 20251408 CommentsEngland manager Thomas Tuchel has named his first squad since succeeding Gareth Southgate - and it is a selection that is already prompting wide debate.Tuchel has recalled former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, who is 35 in June, while Marcus Rashford is rewarded with a return to the squad for his fine form on loan at Aston Villa from Manchester United.He has also revealed first picks at either end of the age scale from Arsenal's 18-year-old Myles Lewis-Skelly to 32-year-old Newcastle United defender Dan Burn for the World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia at Wembley next Friday (21 March) and Monday (24 March) respectively.So what can be unpicked from Tuchel's first indication of England's future direction?Henderson embodies everything we try to build - TuchelPublished23 hours agoReaction, analysis & your views on Tuchel\u2019s first England squadPick your England XI for World Cup qualifiers - and fans have their sayPublished1 day agoIs Tuchel only about the short term?Tuchel's appointment as England head coach has always carried the feel of an 18-month job focussed entirely on winning the World Cup and not beyond.Win then move on. Former interim boss Lee Carsley's last squad contained a total 627 caps, while this one has a tally of 664.Tuchel is missing younger players who have been injured recently, such as Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, but is clear the German's reign is not going to be a slow burner.England exiles in from the coldThe selection of Henderson and the return of Rashford demonstrates that Tuchel is prepared to start with a clean slate.Henderson's call-up came out of the blue after it looked like his England career was over when he, like Rashford, was left out of Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2024.The former Liverpool captain had an ill-fated stint in Saudi Arabia before returning to Europe with Ajax, where Tuchel has clearly seen enough to recall him.Tuchel appears to want Henderson as much for his influence off the pitch, saying: \"What he brings every time is leadership, character, personality and energy. He was a key member of Tuchel's side that won the Champions League in 2021 and there is a potential opening at right-back with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, Kyle Walker, 34, and on loan at AC Milan, and with Newcastle United's Tino Livramento talented but inexperienced.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'When Rashford plays, he's one of the best'Watch The Football News Show on Tuchel's first England squadHenderson embodies everything we try to build - TuchelPublished23 hours agoTuchel's England will get physicalTuchel has made no secret of his desire to utilise the natural physical aspects of the English style into his squad and this is in evidence with this selection.Burn, at 6 feet 7 inches, fits the bill, while Rogers combines raw power with natural skill and strong running.

The long-term can wait while a proven winner takes charge and Tuchel's first England squad merely confirms it.There is a nod to the next generation with the inclusion of versatile defender Lewis-Skelly with England short at left-back and Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers, who is 22, but there was the definite whiff of short-term targets in Tuchel's selection.However, the recall of Henderson is the most eye-catching example of Tuchel wanting experience for the here and now.",

        "article_text": "Greenland's centre-right opposition Democratic party has unexpectedly won the territory's general election. \nThe semi-autonomous island is currently controlled by Denmark, and the vote was dominated by the question of independence, and US President Donald Trump's repeated pledge to take it over, \"one way or another\".\nThe Democratic party favours a gradual approach to independence, and has promised to work with the other political parties to take this forward.\nGreenland, the world's largest island, is located in the Arctic.\nIt is also the most sparsely populated territory. About 56,000 people live there, mostly indigenous Inuit people.\nAbout 80% of its territory is covered by ice, meaning most people live on the south-western coast around the capital, Nuuk.\nAn autonomous - or self-governing - territory of Denmark, it is also home to Danish and US military bases.\nGreenland's economy is mainly based on fishing. Large subsidies from the Danish government account for about a fifth of its income, or GDP.\nIn recent years, there has been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources, including mining for rare earth minerals, uranium and iron. \nThese may become more accessible as global warming leads to some of the ice covering Greenland to melt.\nLocated geographically within North America, Greenland has been controlled by Denmark \u2013 nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away \u2013 for about 300 years.\nThe island was governed as a colony until the mid-20th Century. For much of this time, it remained isolated and poor.\nIn 1953, it was made part of the Kingdom of Denmark and Greenlanders became Danish citizens.\nIn 1979, a referendum on home rule gave Greenland control of most policies within the territory, with Denmark retaining control over foreign affairs and defence.\nThe US has long maintained a security interest in Greenland. After Nazi Germany occupied mainland Denmark during World War Two, the US invaded Greenland, establishing military and radio stations across the territory.\nAfter the war, US forces remained in Greenland. Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, has been operated by the US ever since.\nIn 1951, a defence agreement with Denmark granted the US a significant role in the defence of the territory, including the right to build and maintain military bases.\n\"If Russia were to send missiles towards the US, the shortest route for nuclear weapons would be via the North Pole and Greenland,\" said Marc Jacobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College. \n\"That's why the Pituffik Space Base is immensely important in defending the US.\"\nChina and Russia have begun building up their Arctic military capabilities in recent years, according to an Arctic Institute paper. The paper called for the US to further develop its presence in the Arctic to counter its rivals. \nIn January, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Denmark was open to discussions with the US, adding that Washington had \"legitimate\" interests in the region. \n\"We see a Russia that is arming itself. We see a China that is also starting to take an interest,\" Rasmussen said. \nTrump is also likely interested in the mining potential across Greenland's vast landmass, Mr Jacobsen added, especially the rare earth minerals in the south. \nDuring a speech to Congress, Trump said that control of Greenland was essential \"for national security and international security.\"\nHe said he strongly supported the people of Greenland's right to determine their own future.\n\"If you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America,\" he added.\nThough the president's rhetoric may seem unusual, a succession of US presidents have tried to gain control of Greenland for more than a century. \n\"The US has tried a few times to push the Danes out of Greenland and take it over as part of the US, or at least to have full security tutelage of Greenland,\" said Lukas Wahden, the author of 66\u00b0 North, a newsletter on Arctic security.\nIn 1867, after buying Alaska from Russia, US Secretary of State William H Seward led negotiations to buy Greenland from Denmark, but failed to reach any agreement.\nIn 1946, the US offered to pay $100m (equivalent to $1.2bn; \u00a3970m today) for the territory, judging that it was vital for national security, but the Danish government refused.\nTrump also tried to buy Greenland during his first presidential term. \nBoth Denmark and the Greenlandic government rejected the 2019 proposal, saying: \"Greenland is not for sale.\"\nThe debate over the territory's independence has been \"put on steroids by Trump\", according to Masaana Egede, editor of the newspaper Sermitsiaq.\nAccording to recent polls, almost 80% of Greenlanders back independence from Denmark.  \nBut an opinion survey in January found that 85% of Greenlanders rejected the idea of becoming part of the US, versus 6% who wanted it. The rest were undecided. \nWhen BBC correspondent Fergal Keane visited the island in January, he said he heard one phrase again and again: \"Greenland belongs to Greenlanders. So, Trump can visit but that's it.\"\nThe issue took centre stage in the election. \n\"We deserve to be treated with respect and I don't think the American president has done that lately since he took office,\" said outgoing Prime Minister Egede during the campaign.\nHe previously said the territory should free itself from \"the shackles of colonialism\", but wanted to take gradual steps towards autonomy.\nIn contrast, the opposition party Naleraq wanted to immediately start divorce proceedings from Denmark and have closer defence dealings with Washington.\nSpeaking after the election results, Democratic leader Jens-Frederik Nielsen said that \"Greenland needs us to stand together in a time of great interest from outside.\"\n\"There is a need for unity, so we will enter into negotiations with everyone,\" he added.\nWhen Trump first raised the idea of buying Greenland in 2019, many locals told the BBC they were opposed to the proposal. \n\"This is a very dangerous idea,\" said Dines Mikaelsen, a tour operator who was born and raised in Tasiilaq, east Greenland.\n\"He's treating us like a good he can purchase,\" said Aleqa Hammond, Greenland's first female prime minister.

Torden denies the allegations.\nIt marks the first time charges have been brought and heard in a Finnish court over allegations of war crimes in Ukraine. \nTorden, previously known as Yan Petrovsky, was a founding member of Rusich, which operated in the eastern Donbas region as part of pro-Russian separatist fighting against Ukraine.

In 2024 it averaged more than 80 million players per day \u2013 roughly 40% of them below the age of 13. Its vast empire includes some 40 million user-generated games and experiences.\nIn the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.\nBut Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.\n\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.\n\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"\nPlayers who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.\nIn November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.\nHowever, the BBC was able to create two fake accounts, one aged 15 and one aged 27, on unlinked devices and exchange messages between the two.\nWhile the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.\nWhen we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.\n\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.\nHe admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.\nWe also put to him some Roblox game titles that the BBC has discovered were recommended by the platform to an 11 year-old recently, including:\nWhen we asked whether he thought they were appropriate, he said he puts his faith in the platform's age rating systems.\n\"One thing that's really important for the way we do things here, is it's not just on the title of the experience, it's literally on the content of the experience as well,\" he says.\nHe insists that when Roblox rates experience, they go through rigorous guidelines and that the company has a \"consistent policy\" on that.\nMr Baszucki founded the platform with Eric Cassel in 2004 and released it to the public in 2006 \u2013 a year before the first Apple iPhone appeared, heralding the start of the smartphone era.\nMr Baszucki describes his younger self as \"less of a gamer, and more of an engineer\", and the pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution. But they soon noticed that kids weren't only using the product to do their homework.\n\"They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox,\" he says.\nThe name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.\nMr Cassel noticed some players \"starting to act out\" and not always behaving in a \"civilised\" way a couple of months after it launched, recalls Mr Baszucki.\nHe says the roots of building a \"trust and safety system\" therefore began \"very, very early\" and that in those earlier days there were four people acting as safety moderators.\n\"It kind of is what launched this safety civility foundation,\" he adds.\nBut despite attracting decent numbers, it was a year later, when the firm launched its digital currency Robux, that it really started to make money.\nPlayers buy Robux and use it to purchase accessories and unlock content. Content creators now get 70% of the fee, and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.\nMr Baszucki says there was some initial resistance among the leadership team about Roblox becoming more than a hobby for its players, with the introduction of a digital economy.\nRobux stayed, and the firm is now worth $41bn (\u00a331bn).\nIts share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.\nMr Baszucki compares his experience of building Roblox with how Walt Disney may have felt about his creations.\nHe describes his job as \"a little like having the opportunity he had a long time ago when he was designing the Magic Kingdom\", and is focused on Roblox's ongoing evolution into a Metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form.\nThey have also been public in their ambitions to eventually attract 10% of the world's gamers.\nAsked to describe Roblox in three words, he replies: \"The future of communication.\"\nWe finish our time together playing a couple of his favourite games: Natural Disaster Survival and Dress to Impress.\nWe use his account and he's constantly recognised by other players \u2014 but we still get smashed to pieces by a blizzard outside the Natural Disasters mansion.\nAdditional reporting by Ammie Sekhon\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the biggest developments in global technology, with analysis from BBC correspondents around the world.

Lose then move on.\nThe Football Association provoked debate, and some criticism, by ignoring the claims of English candidates such as Eddie Howe in their succession plan post-Southgate, to go for the best man available regardless of nationality.\nThe strategy was clear. The long-term can wait while a proven winner takes charge and Tuchel's first England squad merely confirms it.\nThere is a nod to the next generation with the inclusion of versatile defender Lewis-Skelly with England short at left-back and Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers, who is 22, but there was the definite whiff of short-term targets in Tuchel's selection.\nHowever, the recall of Henderson is the most eye-catching example of Tuchel wanting experience for the here and now. He last played for England in November 2023 and missed out on selection for last summer's Euro 2024.\nTuchel described Henderson as a \"serial winner\" and this is what the coach has in mind as he plots a path to next year's World Cup.\nJordan Henderson's England career looked over when he was left out of Gareth Southgate's Euro 2024 squad\nAnd then there is the shock selection of Burn. \nA wonderful story, as Newcastle United manager Howe agreed, but a very late stage for any player to prove they are international class.\nBurn would be the oldest player to win his first England cap since Bolton Wanderers striker Kevin Davies made his debut against Montenegro on 12 October 2010 at 33 years and 200 days. The bustling forward was the oldest since 38-year-old Leslie Compton in 1950.\nIt is very much a case of going back to the past for the short-term future. Former interim boss Lee Carsley's last squad contained a total 627 caps, while this one has a tally of 664.\nTuchel is missing younger players who have been injured recently, such as Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, but is clear the German's reign is not going to be a slow burner.\nThe selection of Henderson and the return of Rashford demonstrates that Tuchel is prepared to start with a clean slate.\nHenderson's call-up came out of the blue after it looked like his England career was over when he, like Rashford, was left out of Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2024.\nThe former Liverpool captain had an ill-fated stint in Saudi Arabia before returning to Europe with Ajax, where Tuchel has clearly seen enough to recall him.\nTuchel appears to want Henderson as much for his influence off the pitch, saying: \"What he brings every time is leadership, character, personality and energy. He makes sure everyone lives by the standards and with character. He embodies everything we are trying to build.\"\nEngland's head coach has long been a fan of Rashford and wants to be the beneficiary of Aston Villa manager Unai Emery's repair job on the forward's career.\nHe said: \"I had a strong feeling we should nominate him, to push him to stay at the level he is at now not fall back into old routines.\"\nTuchel's words offer an indication that he realises Rashford had fallen by the wayside at Old Trafford but is also convinced the 27-year-old can offer much to his new England.\nHe clearly does not feel the same about Manchester City's Jack Grealish. He would have been hoping to make a comeback after also missing out on Euro 2024, although he has not figured regularly under manager Pep Guardiola.\nTottenham midfielder James Maddison is another who is, for now at least, consigned to the margins,\nTuchel goes with what he knows by recalling Chelsea's Reece James as he makes his return from another hamstring injury. \nHe was a key member of Tuchel's side that won the Champions League in 2021 and there is a potential opening at right-back with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, Kyle Walker, 34, and on loan at AC Milan, and with Newcastle United's Tino Livramento talented but inexperienced.\nThis video can not be played\n'When Rashford plays, he's one of the best'\nWatch The Football News Show on Tuchel's first England squad\nHenderson embodies everything we try to build - Tuchel\nTuchel has made no secret of his desire to utilise the natural physical aspects of the English style into his squad and this is in evidence with this selection.\nBurn, at 6 feet 7 inches, fits the bill, while Rogers combines raw power with natural skill and strong running. James also combines physical strength with great ability -and the squad has a very powerful look.\nTuchel was asked whether that lack of physicality cost England in previous tournaments.\nHe said: \"I don't think a lot is missing. Obviously a little bit is because we lost consecutive Euros finals and World Cup semi-final and quarter-finals. \n\"The feeling is a little step is needed to bring it over the line.\"\nTuchel's squad is sure to cause debate, especially in Nottingham, where Forest fans will feel Morgan Gibbs-White could have offered an \"X Factor\" after his outstanding performances in their tilt to reach the Champions League.\nThey will also offer up Callum Hudson-Odoi as an example of someone who deserves a return to the England squad after his rejuvenation, exemplified by his winning goal against Manchester City that puts Forest in such a wonderful position to reach the top four.\nEverton defender Jarrad Branthwaite, who won a full cap under Southgate, also misses out despite being in outstanding form since manager David Moyes returned to Goodison Park. He is included in Carsley's England Under-21 side.\nTottenham defender Djed Spence will have had his backers, while there is no place for Conor Gallagher despite his fine form at Atletico Madrid.\nTuchel resisted the temptation to include Arsenal 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri, who also goes into Carsley's squad.\nThis video can not be played\nHow Grealish needs 'confidence and love'\nThomas Tuchel gave a hugely impressive performance in front of the media after announcing his first squad.\nFrom suggestion he is intent on \"building a brotherhood\" in his England squad to talking about \"a parental vibe\" when handling Arsenal teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly, Tuchel was confident and comfortable in his new skin as England head coach.\nNo subject was off limits, apart from when he declined to reveal who his captain might be if Harry Kane was not available.\nTuchel was open, honest and clearly excited about the task ahead, although he admitted he was \"missing the smell of the grass\" and could not wait to get on the training ground with his new charges.\nThis is a coach who has been around the block with big clubs such as Borussia Dortmund, Paris St. Germain and Bayern Munich, while getting a feel and admiration for the English game and his players at Chelsea.\nHe is the quick winner the FA wanted with his appointment.\nNow the serious work starts with the World Cup his goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRashford returns as Tuchel names first England squad",

Poland is ready to host this nuclear weapon.\"\nPresident Duda also welcomed proposals made by France's president, Emmanuel Macron, to extend the French nuclear weapons umbrella to other Nato states.\nThe US already rotates about 10,000 troops at a time through Poland. \nWhen asked how the presence of nuclear weapons would make Poland safer, Mr Duda said it would deepen America's commitment to Polish security.\n\"Every strategic kind of infrastructure, American and Nato infrastructure, which we have on our soil is strengthening the inclination of the US and the North Atlantic Alliance to defend this territory.\"\nPoland spends almost 5% of its national income on defence. That is more than any other member of Nato, including the United States.\nLast week, Poland's prime minister, Donald Tusk, made a speech in parliament warning that a \"profound change in American geopolitics\" was putting both Poland and Ukraine into an \"objectively more difficult situation\".\nPrime Minister Tusk called for further increases in Polish defence spending and proposed that Poland should consider reaching for \"opportunities related to nuclear weapons.\"\nMr Tusk is on the centre left, unlike President Duda who is on the right and considers himself a friend of Donald Trump. \nReferring to President Putin's refusal on Thursday to agree immediately to the 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, Mr Duda said he was confident that the US president had a plan, as he put it, to \"to encourage the Russian side to act reasonably\".\nMr Duda will not criticise Mr Trump nor accept that his actions and words have cast a doubt on the US commitment to Article 5, the mutual defence clause of the North Atlantic Treaty. \nBut he has much harsher words for Putin's Russia than Donald Trump ever uses.\nAnd he backs calls for the EU to seize Russian assets worth around 200 billion euros that have been frozen in European banks.\n\"I believe it is obvious that Russian assets collected and locked in banks in Western Europe should be used to support Ukraine, and it should be a double support,\" he says.\n\"First of all, Ukraine should be supported in defending itself against the Russian aggression. And secondly, this should be used to support the rebuilding of Ukraine.\"\n\"I cannot imagine that after the destruction of Ukraine, Russia can simply take this money away without paying war reparations and compensation.\"",

Follow and listen on the BBC Sport website, app, 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds from 19:30 GMT on 15 March and from 18:00 on 16 March\nNorthern Ireland's Rory McIlroy says he does not expect Tiger Woods to play again this year after the 15-time major winner's latest injury setback.\nOn Tuesday 49-year-old Woods had surgery on a ruptured Achilles tendon.\nThe American has played a reduced schedule since suffering serious leg injuries in a car crash in 2021, and has not played in a PGA Tour event since The Open in July.\n\"It sucks,\" said McIlroy, who faced Woods in January in the technology-driven Tomorrow's Golf League (TGL) they co-founded.\n\"He doesn't have much luck when it comes to injuries and his body.\n\"Achilles surgeries obviously aren't fun. [I'm] hoping he's in good spirits and hoping he's doing OK.\n\"We obviously won't see him play golf this year, and hopefully we see him maybe play in 2026.\"\nAsked if he thought Woods would return to competitive golf, four-time major champion McIlroy said: \"I don't know what's in his head. But, judging by prior behaviour, he'll definitely try.\"\nMcIlroy has been largely injury-free since rupturing an ankle ligament in 2015, which forced him to miss the defence of his Open title.\nSpeaking before the Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass starting on Thursday, the 35-year-old said he intends to retire with a \"little bit left in the tank\".\n\"I can acknowledge how lucky golfers are to be able to do what they do for so long compared to other athletes, so whenever I feel like the time is right, I'll have no problem moving aside and letting the next generation do their thing,\" said McIlroy.\n\"When I've achieved everything I want to achieve in the game and I get to the point where I don't think I can maybe do that any more.\n\"I don't want to be out there embarrassing myself. I'd like to walk away maybe a little before I should.\n\"There's always one more, but that's OK. If you can come to terms with that and walk away on your own terms, then that's a good thing.\"\nAsked about the prospect of playing on the Champions Tour, he said: \"Absolutely not.

        "article_text": "US officials are headed to Russia to discuss a potential ceasefire in Ukraine, according to President Donald Trump. \nThe news comes after Ukrainian officials agreed to a 30-day ceasefire following a highly anticipated meeting with American officials in Saudi Arabia. \nEarlier, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the \"ball is truly in their [Russia's] court\" and that the US believes the only way to end the fighting was through peace negotiations. \nThe American visit comes as the Kremlin claimed President Vladimir Putin had visited Russia's Kursk region - parts of which have been under Ukraine's control since an incursion last year. \nFollowing the meeting in Jeddah on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was now up to the US to convince Russia to agree to the \"positive\" proposal.\nThe Kremlin has said it was studying the ceasefire deal, and that a phone call between Trump and Putin is possible. \nSpeaking alongside Ireland's Taoiseach - or Prime Minister - Miche\u00e1l Martin in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump said he had received  \"positive messages\" about the possibility of a ceasefire. \n\"But a positive message means nothing,\" he said. \"This is a very serious situation.\" \nTrump did not specify which officials were travelling to Moscow.\nHowever, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at the White House that National Security Secretary Mike Waltz had spoken to his Russian counterpart. \nEarlier this week, a source familiar with the matter told the BBC that Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff would head to Moscow for negotiations following the talks in Jeddah. \nThe White House confirmed the plans on Wednesday. \n\"We urge the Russians to sign on to this plan. This is the closest we have been to peace in this war,\" Leavitt said. \nThe Kremlin has said it is studying the proposed ceasefire and further details, which spokesman Dmitry Peskov said will come \"via various channels\" over the course of the next several days. \nIn the Oval Office, Trump said that he believes a ceasefire would make sense for Russia, adding - without further details - that there is a \"lot of downside to Russia\" as well.\n\"We have a very complex situation solved on one side. Pretty much solved. We've also discussed land and other things that go with it,\" Trump added. \"We know the areas of land we're talking about, whether it's pull back or not pull back.\" \nTo pressure Russia, Trump said that he \"can do things financially\". \n\"That would be very bad for Russia,\" he said. \"I don't want to do that because I want to get peace.\" \nThe meeting in Jeddah was the first between US and Ukrainian officials since a 28 February meeting between Zelensky, Trump and Vice-President JD Vance descended into a shouting match and, ultimately, a pause in US military assistance and intelligence sharing. \nThe pause was lifted following the meeting in Jeddah, and Trump said that he believes that the \"difficult\" Ukrainian side and Zelensky now want peace. \nEven as negotiations over a potential ceasefire are ongoing, fighting has raged in Ukraine. \nRussian drones and missiles reportedly struck targets in Kryvyy Rih - Zelensky's hometown - overnight, as well as in the port city of Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv. \nClashes also continued in Russia's Kursk region, where Peskov said Russian troops were \"successfully advancing\" and recapturing areas held by Ukrainian forces.\nAnd later on Wednesday, the Kremlin said Putin had visited a command post in the region. He was shown in footage released by the Kremlin walking alongside his military chief Valery Gerasimov, with both men wearing combat gear.\nIt marked the Russian president's first visit to the region since Ukraine's incursion across the border in August last year.\nRussian media report that Putin ordered the military to \"fully liberate\" the region during the visit. He is yet to comment on the ceasefire proposal agreed by Ukraine and the US on Tuesday.\nThe head of Ukraine's military, Oleksandr Syrsky, also indicated on Wednesday that some of its troops were withdrawing from Kursk. In a post on Telegram, he said: \"In the most difficult situation, my priority has been and remains saving the lives of Ukrainian soldiers.\"",

        "article_text": "Deena Ghazarian had only been in business for a year when the trade policies of President Donald Trump's first term of office sent her company into a tailspin.\nIt was 2019 and her California-based firm, Austere, had just agreed to supply several big US retailers with its high-end audio and video accessories that are largely manufactured in China.\nThen Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.\nShe was forced to absorb the costs and for a while thought she would go bust.\n\"I literally thought I am going to start and end a business in less than a year,\" she says. \"I had spent all this time, money and effort, and to have something like this blindside you was shocking.\"\nThe firm pulled through, but like numerous other US businesses it now finds itself in a strikingly similar situation.\nSince returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.\nThe president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.\nBut the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.\nGoods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher. \n\"US importers have to pay these taxes not the exporters,\" says Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a North American trade body that represents more than 1,200 tech firms.\n\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"\nBusinesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.\nMeanwhile, 87% of US video game console imports came from China that year, 78% of smartphones, 79% of laptops and tablets, and two-thirds of monitors, says the CTA.\nWhile many American companies like Austere have diversified their supply chains away from China since Mr Trump's first term, countries such as Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam still do not offer the same manufacturing capabilities and expertise. \nAt the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.\n\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.\n\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"\nResearch suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.\nIn February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.\nMs Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.\n\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"\nDuring Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.\nInsiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.\nFears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.  \nFor the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute. \nHe plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.  \nThere is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.\nMs Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.\nShe hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.\n\"That might mean finding a more cost-effective way to produce the product or doing something completely different. It's frustrating I have to focus on survival rather than growing my business.\"  ",

You just want to be playing. You are at a top club with top players and you just have to wait for your moment.

I think the boys have done really well and in the last bit of the season [are ready] to give it a right push.\"\nSterling was introduced late on in Arsenal's recent home defeat by West Ham and the draw at Nottingham Forest in the Premier League. \nHe was also overlooked entirely by manager Mikel Arteta in the 1-1 draw at Manchester United.\nHowever, with Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus all out injured, former Newcastle and Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Shay Given believes his performance on Wednesday will provide Arteta with food for thought.\n\"Raheem Sterling is a big-name player. He is a Premier League winner and did so well at Manchester City,\" Given told BBC Sport.\n\"It did not work out so well at Chelsea and people will say it has not worked out for him great so far at Arsenal. But I think it is an opportunity for Raheem because you can see Arsenal's squad are struggling for forward players. \n\"He was hugging the touchline, he is direct.

He has struggled for goals and has not scored since September's 5-1 win over League One Bolton in the Carabao Cup.His appearance against the Eredivisie side was also only his third start this term in Europe's elite club competition, while eight of his 12 Premier League outings have come as a substitute.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Champions League highlights: Arsenal 2-2 (Agg 9-3) PSVArsenal set up Real Madrid tie with big aggregate win over PSVWith Arsenal trailing leaders Liverpool by 15 points in the Premier League, Europe arguably represents their most realistic chance of lifting silverware this term.And while a late booking against PSV also means he will be ruled out of the first leg against reigning European champions Real, Sterling remains hopeful he could yet play a pivotal role as the season reaches its climax. But I think it is an opportunity for Raheem because you can see Arsenal's squad are struggling for forward players. He is a Premier League winner and did so well at Manchester City,\" Given told BBC Sport. \"'It is an opportunity' for SterlingSterling was introduced late on in Arsenal's recent home defeat by West Ham and the draw at Nottingham Forest in the Premier League.",

        "article_text": "It was after 21:00 on Tuesday night in Moscow when the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlined the Ukrainian and American proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Russia.\nBy Wednesday afternoon, the Kremlin appeared to be still weighing its response to the proposals.\nRussia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova declined to be drawn into specifics, saying that \"the formation of the position of the Russian Federation [would] take place inside the Russian Federation\".\nAnd Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov skirted the issue. \"Let's not get ahead of ourselves,\" he said, adding Moscow was \"acquainting itself\" with the joint statement issued in Jeddah.\nThere are reports that US envoy Steve Witkoff could travel to Moscow on Thursday, and Peskov said the press would be kept informed. Other than this, it was no comment from the Kremlin.\nPresident Vladimir Putin is no doubt thinking carefully about whether to accept the ceasefire proposal, reject it, or demand amendments to it.\nThe idea of turning down - or amending - the ceasefire proposal seems to be gaining most traction among commentators. \n\"If [Putin] accepts the US suggestion, it will lead to a dangerous situation,\" pro-Kremlin pundit and former Putin aide Sergei Markov told the BBC, arguing that the Russian army currently has the upper hand on the front line and may lose it.\nThere are also concerns that Ukraine could use the month-long ceasefire to rearm, so Russia may put forward some conditions, such as demanding an end to the Western supply of weapons to Kyiv.\n\"The condition should be that during this period, an embargo must be introduced on arms supplies to Ukraine... Europe should support a ceasefire in Europe, not with words, but with actions,\" Mr Markov told Russian media.\nIf he were to accept the proposal, Mr Markov suggests public opinion could be a factor. Russian society is \"tired of the war\", he told the BBC.\nWhile it is true that some recent surveys show a growing percentage of the Russian population is in favour of carrying out peace talks with Ukraine, it's far from clear that public opinion would have any sway on Putin's decision. \nAnother potential avenue for Russia would be to accept the ceasefire and then blame any violations on Ukrainian \"provocations\", in the hope of discrediting Kyiv in Trump's eyes. \nAfter Russia seized Crimea in 2014, numerous attempts were made to implement a ceasefire between Moscow and Kyiv. All of them failed. \nIf this attempt works, it would be unprecedented. \nAway from the Kremlin's silence, the announcement of the ceasefire proposal \u2013 the most detailed of its kind since the start of Moscow's war on Ukraine \u2013 was openly discussed in Russian media.\nIn some cases, there was jubilation over what they saw as Ukraine folding to US demands, with Komsomolskaya Pravda arguing the White House had \"completely trounced\" Kyiv.\n\"They heard from Ukraine exactly the words they wanted to hear,\" said the daily.\nStill, the overwhelming feeling among many Russian commentators and lawmakers is one of scepticism, particularly in light of the US decision to resume sending Kyiv intelligence and weapons.\nMP Viktor Sobolev said a temporary ceasefire would only play into the hands of the Ukrainians as it would allow them to \"regroup in 30 days, replenish their ranks and be replenished with drones\".\nThere has also been a push to highlight the victories of the Russian army in the Kursk region, parts of which Kyiv has occupied since last summer - and to show Russia has the upper hand on the battlefield.\nOn Wednesday morning, images of Russian soldiers recapturing Sudzha - the largest town Ukraine managed to seize in Kursk region - were ubiquitous on Russian TV and popular Telegram channels, accompanied by gushing praise for the \"daring\" work of Moscow's troops.\n\"The real conditions for negotiations are now being created by our heroic guys - all along the front line,\" said daily Moskovsky Komsomolets.\nRegardless of the chatter, the final decision \u2013 as is always the case in today's Russia \u2013 will rest with Vladimir Putin.\nHe, like Trump, is central to this deal. \"We... do not rule out the need for a telephone conversation at the highest level,\" said Peskov on Wednesday morning \u2013 meaning direct contact between the two presidents is on the cards.\nSome Russians may believe this is Trump's preferred avenue, too.\n\"By his own admission, he makes a deal only with the 'boss',\" said state broadcaster Ria Novosti.\n\"This means that there will be no deals with 'teams', 'representatives' and 'envoys'. A possible deal can only be between Putin and Trump.\"",

        "article_text": "Abercrombie & Fitch must pay for the legal fees of former CEO Mike Jeffries as he defends criminal charges of sex trafficking, a US court has ruled.\nThe fashion brand, which has previously said it was \"appalled and disgusted\" by Mr Jeffries' alleged conduct, had signed an agreement in 2014 when the ex-CEO resigned, covering him for the costs of any criminal proceedings which arose from his position.\nThe company had argued in court that the charges, which allege Mr Jeffries ran an international prostitution and sex trafficking business, related to his personal life and not his work.\nBut a judge found that the \"horrific\" charges, filed last year, were tied to his corporate role.\nThe court's ruling could have significant financial and legal ramifications for Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F) - a billion-dollar public company with more than 750 stores worldwide, including the Hollister brand. Legal experts told the BBC the bill for the company is likely to run into millions of dollars.\nThe decision also raises questions about why the company made the far-reaching indemnity agreement when Mr Jeffries stepped down more than a decade ago. The BBC has previously asked A&F about the circumstances surrounding this agreement, and if it had been aware of any allegations against Mr Jeffries at the time, but it declined to comment.\nMr Jeffries, who ran the retailer for 22 years, is currently on bail after pleading not guilty to the charges along with his British life partner, Matthew Smith, and their middleman in the alleged trafficking operation, James Jacobson.\nThe arrests followed a BBC investigation in 2023 that revealed Mr Jeffries and his partner were at the centre of a sophisticated operation scouting young men for sex in the US and abroad.\nRuling that Mr Jeffries' indemnification agreement does cover the criminal charges against him, Judge Paul Fioravanti said: \"In my view, Jeffries's conduct, as alleged in the indictment, as horrific as it is, has a causal connection to his official capacity and status as CEO of Abercrombie.\"\nThe criminal legal costs come in addition to fees in Mr Jeffries' civil cases, which A&F was ordered to pay last year on similar grounds.\nAlong with Mr Jeffries, A&F is defending multiple civil lawsuits from alleged victims, accusing the brand of having facilitated and funded his \"criminal enterprise\".\n\"Jeffries' legal fees will be millions of dollars when it's all said and done,\" said Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of West Coast Trial Lawyers.\nA former federal prosecutor and partner at Shihata & Geddes, Elizabeth Geddes, added: \"You'll have high-paid lawyers charging by the hour, especially if this leads to both a civil and criminal trial which can be expensive and time-consuming.\" \nCompanies can indemnify executives, even for criminal charges, she said, though this would typically be in cases of white-collar crime such as fraud and not sex trafficking.\nMr Rahmani said the Abercrombie & Fitch agreement was \"unique\" in its coverage of criminal conduct. \"Generally, criminal conduct is not something that you can insure for because it falls outside the scope of any company's business,\" he said.\nThe criminal charges against Mr Jeffries date from 2008 to 2015. He stepped down as chief executive of A&F in December 2014 after two decades in charge.\nUS prosecutors allege he had used his wealth, power and status as CEO \"to traffic men for his own sexual pleasure\" and for the pleasure of his partner, Mr Smith.\nA&F is not a defendant in the criminal case, but the latest ruling means it will now have to reimburse Mr Jeffries for legal fees dating back to 2023, as well as advance him funds for his ongoing defence.\nOn top of the legal fees of its former CEO, the company may also face further costs in civil cases it is defending if a court orders compensation to be paid out or both parties agree a settlement.\nDespite the severity of the allegations, the company has been reporting record sales, amounting to $4.95bn (\u00a33.84bn) in the past year.\n\"It doesn't appear as though A&F are at a detriment financially [in sales or share price] due to the lawsuits surrounding Mike Jeffries,\" said Heather Cucolo, a New York Law School professor.\nShe said it was interesting that the company appeared to have been able to \"spin\" or \"stifle some of the information that's out there\".\nFollowing the BBC's investigation, A&F opened an independent investigation and suspended $1m (\u00a3770,000) annual retirement payments to Mr Jeffries.\nIt added that new leadership has transformed the company, and it has \"zero tolerance for abuse, harassment or discrimination of any kind\".",

        "article_text": "A cancer charity has said it is \"angry and frustrated\" that ministers and health officials have not approved the provision of a life-extending prostate cancer drug through the NHS in England.\nThe drug, abiraterone, has been available in Scotland and Wales for two years for high-risk patients whose cancer has not yet spread, but not in England and Northern Ireland.\nIn a letter to Prostate Cancer UK, seen by the BBC, Health Minister Karin Smyth said the decision by NHS England, following a lengthy review, was \"based on overall affordability\" and that \"it would not be appropriate to intervene\". \nThe government said urgent advice had been requested on the issue.\nThe charity said it was a \"dire and urgent situation in England\" with \"a bureaucratic blockage denying men this treatment\".\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We understand the frustration and upset of some patients who cannot access this potentially life-saving treatment. Ministers have requested urgent advice on the issue.\"\nAlthough not a cure, abiraterone can help stop prostate cancer spreading to other parts of the body. \nIn England and Northern Ireland, the drug is only approved for men with very advanced prostate cancer which has spread already. \nIn Wales and Scotland, people with the disease that has not yet spread can also get it.\nResearch has shown that for these earlier stage patients, the survival rate after six years is improved and that the drug halved the rate of progression of the cancer.\nThe charity says many lives could be extended by the drug, given the findings from a trial called Stampede, published in 2022. \nIt found improved odds of survival among men given the drug alongside usual care, and concluded that abiraterone should be considered a new standard treatment. \nAccording to figures from NHS England, each year about 8,400 patients have high-risk prostate cancer that has not yet spread. \nUsing the Stampede assumptions, 672 of those men could die prematurely without access to abiraterone.\nIn October 2023, BBC News spoke to Giles Turner, a retired banker living in Sussex. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier that year but was told that abiraterone could not be obtained on the NHS in England. \nHe chose to pay for treatment with the drug at \u00a3250 a month. He told us then that he felt \"very fortunate\" to be able to afford it, but outraged for others who could not. \nAt the time, NHS England said it was reviewing the drug's use for a wider range of men. \nHowever, in December 2024 it told Prostate Cancer UK that \"it has not been possible to identify the necessary recurrent headroom in revenue budgets\". \nBecause abiraterone is a generic drug which has gone \"off patent\" and is licensed for only one group of prostate cancer patients, there is a complicated process to get it approved for wider use.\nEach year, NHS England can make \"discretionary\" investment decisions with a specialist advisory group, but it has chosen not to for this drug. \nSmyth's letter earlier this month said the process had to look at \"the overall budget impact of introducing a new treatment based on patient volumes\", and ministers would not intervene.\nMr Turner said he was \"stunned\" that nearly one-and-a-half years after the BBC report, NHS England had not caught up with NHS Scotland and NHS Wales. \nHe has spent \u00a320,000 so far on his treatment, and said he felt it was wrong that while expensive new patented drugs treatments could be funded, abiraterone - costing the NHS \u00a377 per pack per month - could not be.

The order references \"egregious actions\" by South Africa and cites \"unjust racial discrimination\" against white Afrikaners - those who descended from Dutch settlers. \nThe order also references a new law, the Expropriation Act, that the order claims targets Afrikaners by allowing the government to take away private land. \n\"As long as South Africa continues to support bad actors on the world stage and allows violent attacks on innocent disfavored minority farmers, the United States will stop aid and assistance to the country,\" according to a statement from the White House. \nThe government in South Africa denies its law is related to race, the Associated Press reported. \nA fact sheet from the White House states the country \"blatantly discriminates against ethnic minority descendants of settler groups\". \nWhile lower-ranking diplomats are sometimes expelled, it's highly unusual in the US for it to happen to a more senior official like a foreign ambassador, the Associated Press reported, noting neither the US nor Russia took such actions against one another even amid tensions during the Cold War. \nRasool previously served as the country's ambassador to the US from 2010 to 2015 before being tapped again for the post in 2025. \nHe was born and grew up in Cape Town. When he was nine, he and his family were forcibly removed from an apartment that was declared only for white people.

They are bad for business, and worse for consumers,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\nThe EU's initial countermeasures will take effect on US products on 1 April, ranging from jeans and motorbikes to peanut butter and bourbon, just as they were with the Trump administration's first tariffs in 2018 and 2020.\n\nBut there will be more to come in mid-April.

But for businesses and some industries, especially steel, there is real danger.\nThe head of Germany's BGA federation of wholesale, foreign trade and service, Dirk Jandura, warned that Germans might have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for American products in the supermarkets.\nOrange juice, bourbon and peanut butter were the most likely products to be hit. \"Margins in trade are so low that this cannot be absorbed by the companies,\" he said.\nIn total, the EU will target \u20ac26bn (\u00a322bn) of US exports. \n\"We're not going to go into hypotheticals other than to say we've been preparing assiduously for all these outcomes,\" said EU spokesman Olof Gill.\nAnt\u00f3nio Costa, the EU's Council President, called on the US to de-escalate, although there was little sign of that on Wednesday, as Trump vowed to hit back at the EU's countermeasures.\n\"We've been abused for a long time and we will be abused no longer,\" he said.\nIn Austria too, there was concern about the escalation.\n\"The US is the second most important export market for Austrian products after Germany - and the most important for Germany,\" said  Christoph Neumayer, who is head of the Federation of Austrian Industries.

Follow and listen on the BBC Sport website, app, 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds from 19:30 GMT on 15 March and from 18:00 on 16 March\nNorthern Ireland's Rory McIlroy says he does not expect Tiger Woods to play again this year after the 15-time major winner's latest injury setback.\nOn Tuesday 49-year-old Woods had surgery on a ruptured Achilles tendon.\nThe American has played a reduced schedule since suffering serious leg injuries in a car crash in 2021, and has not played in a PGA Tour event since The Open in July.\n\"It sucks,\" said McIlroy, who faced Woods in January in the technology-driven Tomorrow's Golf League (TGL) they co-founded.\n\"He doesn't have much luck when it comes to injuries and his body.\n\"Achilles surgeries obviously aren't fun. [I'm] hoping he's in good spirits and hoping he's doing OK.\n\"We obviously won't see him play golf this year, and hopefully we see him maybe play in 2026.\"\nAsked if he thought Woods would return to competitive golf, four-time major champion McIlroy said: \"I don't know what's in his head. But, judging by prior behaviour, he'll definitely try.\"\nMcIlroy has been largely injury-free since rupturing an ankle ligament in 2015, which forced him to miss the defence of his Open title.\nSpeaking before the Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass starting on Thursday, the 35-year-old said he intends to retire with a \"little bit left in the tank\".\n\"I can acknowledge how lucky golfers are to be able to do what they do for so long compared to other athletes, so whenever I feel like the time is right, I'll have no problem moving aside and letting the next generation do their thing,\" said McIlroy.\n\"When I've achieved everything I want to achieve in the game and I get to the point where I don't think I can maybe do that any more.\n\"I don't want to be out there embarrassing myself. I'd like to walk away maybe a little before I should.\n\"There's always one more, but that's OK. If you can come to terms with that and walk away on your own terms, then that's a good thing.\"\nAsked about the prospect of playing on the Champions Tour, he said: \"Absolutely not. I will not play Champions Tour golf.\n\"I've said a lot of absolutes in my time that I've walked back, but I do not envision playing Champions Tour golf.\n\"Something has gone terribly wrong if I have to compete at golf at 50.\"\nMcIlroy won his 27th PGA Tour title at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am last month, and finished tied for 17th and 15th in his two tournaments since - the Genesis Invitational and Arnold Palmer Invitational respectively.\n\"The two finishes post-Pebble have been almost like the worst that they could be,\" said McIlroy.\n\"I finished bad on Sunday at Bay Hill.

        "article_text": "Thousands of frontline healthcare workers in southern India's Kerala state, who have been holding demonstrations for the past month seeking better pay and recognition, have vowed to continue their protest.\nKerala's 26,225 female workers, known as Accredited Social Health Activists or Ashas (Hindi for hope), have been holding protests near the state government headquarters in the capital city of Thiruvananthapuram.\nThe protesters, who provide crucial medical support in the country's rural areas, say they plan to \"lay siege\" to the state secretariat in the coming week, if authorities continue to ignore their demands.\nThe Ashas, who number more than a million across the country, are fighting for better salaries and for official \"worker\" status.\nThe women are currently categorised as volunteers, which means they are not guaranteed any benefits from the government, despite playing a crucial role in delivering healthcare in rural and underserved areas.\nOn Monday, Shashi Tharoor, an MP from Kerala, said the Asha volunteers were \"unsung heroes\" of India's healthcare system and the \"protests highlight the systemic undervaluation of community health workers in India and in particular in Kerala\".\nIndia's federal health minister recently told parliament that the government would raise incentives for the workers. Authorities in Kerala, meanwhile, have released three months of pending payments.\nThe state's health minister also said Kerala would request the federal government to recognise these women as regular workers and not volunteers.\nThe state government, however, has insisted that the money it offers to the Ashas is the highest in the country.\nBut the protesters said state authorities had not engaged in talks with them and accused them of instead employing tactics to suppress their protest.\nThis week, police removed the plastic tarpaulin sheet the protesters had tied overhead at the site of their sit-in demonstration, exposing them to direct sun.\nThe Ashas - who get an honorarium of 7,000 rupees and not a salary because they are volunteers and not workers - say they want the payment to be increased to 21,000 rupees ($240.8; \u00a3186.2) and retirement benefits.\nThe state's Health Minister Veena George, however, says that 90% of the Ashas earn between 10,000-13,500 rupees per month, including incentives.\n\"They are entitled to maternity leave, and measures are taken to prevent excessive workload,\" she said.\nBut some of the protesting women counter these claims.\nKuzhipparamba Thankamony, one of the protesters, said she received only 6,300 rupees as honorarium in October 2024.\n\"They deducted 700 rupees for a meeting I missed because I was sick and had to go to hospital.\"\nWhen the 45-year-old joined the Ashas 17 years ago, she worked only for an hour or two a day, she said.\n\"Now I am so burdened with work that a whole day does not suffice,\" she told the BBC.\n\"This is a matter of social justice,\" Saboora Arifa, one of the Asha protest co-ordinators told the BBC. \"Those who work eight hours a day are not volunteers. We have every right to get worker status.\"\nIn a country where millions of Indians, especially in the remote areas, do not have access to quality healthcare, the Asha workers have played a vital role over the years.\nTheir job involves going door-to-door to raise awareness about nutrition, sanitation, immunisation and providing neonatal and antenatal care, among other things.\nThey played a crucial role during the Covid pandemic, especially in Kerala which was first to report a Covid case, and have been credited for successfully containing outbreaks of Zika and Nipah viruses.\nDr Joe Thomas, a Melbourne-based public health policy analyst, believes India should change its perception of these community health workers whose contribution to primary health is universally recognised.\nThese workers are doing the job of midwives in Kerala after the state's health authorities froze recruitment of midwives, he told the BBC. \"The maternity care support has slowly been shifted to Ashas.\"\nAccording to him, 90% of the women in Kerala get prenatal care like testing, nutrition supplements and advice from Asha volunteers.\n\"Kerala takes pride in achieving 99% vaccination,\" says Dr Thomas. \"The credit for its vaccination success goes to the Ashas. Their contribution to primary health in Kerala is that they are the only people working on prevention.\"\nThe protest in Kerala is only the latest in a series of protests by these community health workers across India.\nEarlier this year, neighbouring Karnataka state increased its honorarium amount to 10,000 rupees after Asha volunteers went on strike.\nAnd last year, volunteers in Andhra Pradesh held several state-wide protests. This month, the state became the first in the country to give its workers a gratuity of 150,000 rupees ($1,723; 1,330), along with paid maternity leave of 180 days, and raised retirement age from 60 to 62.",

        "article_text": "During his election campaign last year, Donald Trump promised Americans he would usher in a new era of prosperity.\nNow two months into his presidency, he's painting a slightly different picture. \nHe has warned that it will be hard to bring down prices and the public should be prepared for a \"little disturbance\" before he can bring back wealth to the US.\nMeanwhile, even as the latest figures indicate inflation is easing, analysts say the odds of a downturn are increasing, pointing to his policies.\nSo is Trump about to trigger a recession in the world's largest economy?\nIn the US, a recession is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.\nA chorus of economic analysts have warned in recent days that the risks of such a scenario are rising. \nA JP Morgan report put the chance of recession at 40%, up from 30% at the start of the year, warning that US policy was \"tilting away from growth\", while Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, upped the odds from 15% to 35%, citing tariffs. \nThe forecasts came as the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US sank sharply. It has now fallen to its lowest level since September in a sign of fears about the future.\nThe market turmoil is being driven partly by concerns about new taxes on imports, called tariffs, which Trump has introduced since he took office.\nHe has hit products from America's three biggest trade partners with the new duties, and threatened them more widely in moves that analysts believe will increase prices and curb growth.\nThe latest official inflation figures in the US showed the rate of price increases cooling in February, however. \nPrices were up 2.8% over the 12 months to February, down from 3% in January, the Labor Department said.  \nStill, Trump and his economic advisers have been warning the public to be prepared for some economic pain, while appearing to dismiss the market concerns - a marked change from his first term, when he frequently cited the stock market as a measure of his own success. \n\"There will always be changes and adjustments,\" he said last week, in response to pleas from businesses for more certainty. \nThe posture has increased investor worries about his plans. \nGoldman Sachs last week raised its recession bets from 15% to 20%, saying it saw policy changes as \"the key risk\" to the economy. But it noted that the White House still had \"the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious\". \n\"If the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data, recession risk would rise further,\" the firm's analysts warned. \n\nFor many firms, the biggest question mark is tariffs, which raise costs for US businesses by putting taxes on imports. As Trump unveils tariff plans, many companies are now facing lower profit margins, while holding off on investments and hiring as they try to figure out what the future will look like. \nInvestors are also worried about big cuts to the government workforce and government spending.\nBrian Gardner, chief of Washington policy strategy at the investment bank Stifel, said businesses and investors had thought Trump intended tariffs as a negotiating tool. \n\"But what the president and his cabinet are signalling is actually a bigger deal. It's a restructuring of the American economy,\" he said. \"And that's what's been driving markets in the last couple of weeks.\"\nThe US economy was already undergoing a slowdown, engineered in part by the central bank, which has kept interest rates higher to try to cool activity and stabilise prices.\nIn recent weeks, some data suggests a more rapid weakening.\nRetail sales fell in February, confidence - which had popped after Trump's election on several surveys of consumers and businesses - has fallen, and companies including major airlines, retailers such as Walmart and Target, and manufacturers are warning of a pullback.\nSome analysts are worried a drop in the stock market could trigger a further clampdown in spending, especially among higher income households.\nThat could deliver a major hit to the US economy, which is driven by consumer spending and has grown increasingly dependent on those richer households, as lower income families face pressure from inflation. \n\nThe head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, offered assurances in a speech last week, noting that sentiment had not been a good indicator of behaviour in recent years.\n\"Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,\" he said.\nBut the US economy is currently deeply linked to the rest of the world, warned Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.\n\"The fact that tariffs could disrupt that at the same time that there were signs that the US economy was weakening anyway ... is really fuelling recession fears,\" she says. \nThe unease in the stock market isn't all about Trump. \nInvestors were already jittery about the possibility of a correction, after big gains over the last two years, driven by the sharp run-up in tech stocks fuelled by investor optimism about artificial intelligence (AI).\nChipmaker Nvidia, for example, saw its share price jump from less than $15 at the start of 2023 to nearly $150 in November of last year.\nThat type of rise had stirred debate about an \"AI bubble\" - with investors on high alert for signs of it bursting, which would have a big impact on the stock market, regardless of the dynamics in the wider economy. \nNow, with views of the US economy darkening, optimism about AI is getting even harder to sustain.\nTech analyst Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management wrote on social media this week that his optimism had \"taken a step back\" as the chance of a recession increased \"measurably\" over the past month.\n\"The bottom line is that if we enter a recession, it will be extremely difficult for the AI trade to continue,\" he said. \nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

Russia must now agree to a ceasefire and an end to the fighting too.\"\nTrump told reporters that US officials would discuss the deal with Moscow either late on Tuesday or Wednesday as he wanted to \"get this show on the road\".\nWhen asked about the 30-day ceasefire proposal, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said \"let's not get ahead of ourselves\".\nSpeaking at a daily press briefing, he said Russia was \"carefully studying the statements made after the meeting\" and that the Kremlin needed to be briefed by the US on the outcome of US-Ukrainian talks in Saudi Arabia before commenting on whether a proposed ceasefire was acceptable to Russia.\nPeskov did not rule out the need for a phone conversation between Vladimir Putin and Trump.\nLabour MP Dame Emily Thornberry, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said Britain has played a \"big part\" in where things currently stand in the war in Ukraine, including proposals for a halt in fighting.\n\"I think we need to just pause this moment and appreciate the calm and optimism and hope,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.\n\"We might have peace in Ukraine, this is a step along that road, it could happen and I think we need to at this stage kind of appreciate what it is that we have achieved and I think that Britain has played a big part in that.\"\nShe also said that Powell had \"earnt his money\", noting that the work he has done in helping Ukraine and the US reach an agreement over a proposed ceasefire deal with Russia is an \"achievement\".\nOn Saturday, Sir Keir will host a phone call of leaders which he has dubbed the \"coalition of the willing\" to discuss peacekeeping efforts aimed at deterring Russian President Putin from launching future incursions into Ukraine.\nThose joining the call are \"ready to help bring an end to this war in a just and permanent way that allows Ukraine to enjoy its freedom\", he said.\nOne aim of the European teams working behind the scenes has been to ensure that it is now Russia that is in the spotlight: does it want peace?\nA UK source said \"the ball is firmly in the Russian court. Will they reciprocate and stop the fighting to allow serious negotiations on a lasting peace or will they continue to slaughter innocent civilians?\".\nHundreds of thousands of people, most of them soldiers, are believed to have been killed or injured on both sides, and millions of Ukrainian civilians have fled as refugees, since Russia invaded Ukraine just over three years ago. \nRussia's attacks on Ukraine have continued with Ukrainian authorities confirming one missile attack in President Zelensky's hometown of Kryvyi Rih - which killed one person - and an attack on a cargo ship in the port city of Odessa - which killed four Syrian nationals and damaged port infrastructure and grain storage facilities.",

Lose then move on.\nThe Football Association provoked debate, and some criticism, by ignoring the claims of English candidates such as Eddie Howe in their succession plan post-Southgate, to go for the best man available regardless of nationality.\nThe strategy was clear. The long-term can wait while a proven winner takes charge and Tuchel's first England squad merely confirms it.\nThere is a nod to the next generation with the inclusion of versatile defender Lewis-Skelly with England short at left-back and Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers, who is 22, but there was the definite whiff of short-term targets in Tuchel's selection.\nHowever, the recall of Henderson is the most eye-catching example of Tuchel wanting experience for the here and now. He last played for England in November 2023 and missed out on selection for last summer's Euro 2024.\nTuchel described Henderson as a \"serial winner\" and this is what the coach has in mind as he plots a path to next year's World Cup.\nJordan Henderson's England career looked over when he was left out of Gareth Southgate's Euro 2024 squad\nAnd then there is the shock selection of Burn. \nA wonderful story, as Newcastle United manager Howe agreed, but a very late stage for any player to prove they are international class.\nBurn would be the oldest player to win his first England cap since Bolton Wanderers striker Kevin Davies made his debut against Montenegro on 12 October 2010 at 33 years and 200 days. The bustling forward was the oldest since 38-year-old Leslie Compton in 1950.\nIt is very much a case of going back to the past for the short-term future. Former interim boss Lee Carsley's last squad contained a total 627 caps, while this one has a tally of 664.\nTuchel is missing younger players who have been injured recently, such as Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, but is clear the German's reign is not going to be a slow burner.\nThe selection of Henderson and the return of Rashford demonstrates that Tuchel is prepared to start with a clean slate.\nHenderson's call-up came out of the blue after it looked like his England career was over when he, like Rashford, was left out of Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2024.\nThe former Liverpool captain had an ill-fated stint in Saudi Arabia before returning to Europe with Ajax, where Tuchel has clearly seen enough to recall him.\nTuchel appears to want Henderson as much for his influence off the pitch, saying: \"What he brings every time is leadership, character, personality and energy. He makes sure everyone lives by the standards and with character. He embodies everything we are trying to build.\"\nEngland's head coach has long been a fan of Rashford and wants to be the beneficiary of Aston Villa manager Unai Emery's repair job on the forward's career.\nHe said: \"I had a strong feeling we should nominate him, to push him to stay at the level he is at now not fall back into old routines.\"\nTuchel's words offer an indication that he realises Rashford had fallen by the wayside at Old Trafford but is also convinced the 27-year-old can offer much to his new England.\nHe clearly does not feel the same about Manchester City's Jack Grealish. He would have been hoping to make a comeback after also missing out on Euro 2024, although he has not figured regularly under manager Pep Guardiola.\nTottenham midfielder James Maddison is another who is, for now at least, consigned to the margins,\nTuchel goes with what he knows by recalling Chelsea's Reece James as he makes his return from another hamstring injury. \nHe was a key member of Tuchel's side that won the Champions League in 2021 and there is a potential opening at right-back with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, Kyle Walker, 34, and on loan at AC Milan, and with Newcastle United's Tino Livramento talented but inexperienced.\nThis video can not be played\n'When Rashford plays, he's one of the best'\nWatch The Football News Show on Tuchel's first England squad\nHenderson embodies everything we try to build - Tuchel\nTuchel has made no secret of his desire to utilise the natural physical aspects of the English style into his squad and this is in evidence with this selection.\nBurn, at 6 feet 7 inches, fits the bill, while Rogers combines raw power with natural skill and strong running. James also combines physical strength with great ability -and the squad has a very powerful look.\nTuchel was asked whether that lack of physicality cost England in previous tournaments.\nHe said: \"I don't think a lot is missing. Obviously a little bit is because we lost consecutive Euros finals and World Cup semi-final and quarter-finals. \n\"The feeling is a little step is needed to bring it over the line.\"\nTuchel's squad is sure to cause debate, especially in Nottingham, where Forest fans will feel Morgan Gibbs-White could have offered an \"X Factor\" after his outstanding performances in their tilt to reach the Champions League.\nThey will also offer up Callum Hudson-Odoi as an example of someone who deserves a return to the England squad after his rejuvenation, exemplified by his winning goal against Manchester City that puts Forest in such a wonderful position to reach the top four.\nEverton defender Jarrad Branthwaite, who won a full cap under Southgate, also misses out despite being in outstanding form since manager David Moyes returned to Goodison Park. He is included in Carsley's England Under-21 side.\nTottenham defender Djed Spence will have had his backers, while there is no place for Conor Gallagher despite his fine form at Atletico Madrid.\nTuchel resisted the temptation to include Arsenal 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri, who also goes into Carsley's squad.\nThis video can not be played\nHow Grealish needs 'confidence and love'\nThomas Tuchel gave a hugely impressive performance in front of the media after announcing his first squad.\nFrom suggestion he is intent on \"building a brotherhood\" in his England squad to talking about \"a parental vibe\" when handling Arsenal teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly, Tuchel was confident and comfortable in his new skin as England head coach.\nNo subject was off limits, apart from when he declined to reveal who his captain might be if Harry Kane was not available.\nTuchel was open, honest and clearly excited about the task ahead, although he admitted he was \"missing the smell of the grass\" and could not wait to get on the training ground with his new charges.\nThis is a coach who has been around the block with big clubs such as Borussia Dortmund, Paris St. Germain and Bayern Munich, while getting a feel and admiration for the English game and his players at Chelsea.\nHe is the quick winner the FA wanted with his appointment.\nNow the serious work starts with the World Cup his goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRashford returns as Tuchel names first England squad",

        "article_text": "Harley Watson was on a path to what he calls a \"gangster\" life.\nThe 17-year-old, from Clacton, in Essex, was a \"lost and troubled kid\", having grown up without a dad.\n\"I was behaving very badly in school and, if I'd carried on, I would almost certainly have been excluded.\"\nHis experience is echoed in a new report, which says young men who lack a positive male role model are in crisis.\nFatherlessness has a significant impact on boys' mental health, education and future prospects, the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) report found.\nAged 14, Harley joined Lads Need Dads, a local programme that equips boys with life skills and confidence.\nMale mentors work with small groups of eight boys at a time, teaching them about healthy relationships, anger management and what makes a good dad.\nHarley says it changed his life. He learned how to take care of himself and \"become a better man\".\n\"Now they are supporting me to join the Army,\" he adds. \"They've bought me the kit and helped me meet the right people. It's a career path I wouldn't even have looked into but I'm really excited by it.\"\nSonia Shaljean, who runs the organisation, says she knew Harley had huge potential, even though he was \"quite shut down\" when he joined them.\nShe believes fatherlessness is a key factor in issues from crime and addiction to school exclusions, homelessness and male suicide.\n\"It's not taken seriously enough,\" she says. \"We skirt around the issue, and it's almost controversial to say it, but boys need a supportive father figure.\n\"Some people are offended by our name - Lads Need Dads - but I stand by it. We're not taking away from the importance of a mother, but that male influence is also important.\n\"Ultimately, we're helping women and girls too by raising boys who are more emotionally intelligent, stable and secure.\"\nSource: CSJ - a Conservative think-tank focused on tackling poverty.\nSonia, who is a mother of three young men, says some boys who have grown up in violent homes can be fearful of men, so positive male role models are crucial.\n\"We work with them in the same group for up to eight years, so they build real friendships and it becomes like a family.\n\"Our groups are incredibly diverse. It's a misconception that father absence is just an issue in certain communities.\"\nNot all fathers are absent by choice, she says.\n\"Some were wonderful dads but have sadly passed away. Some boys have been abandoned by their fathers but others desperately want to be involved in their sons' lives and some even struggle with suicidal thoughts as a result.\"\nAround the eight-month mark of the programme, boys often start to talk about their fathers, she says.\n\"As their confidence grows, some feel ready to explore the possibility of reconnecting and many go on to re-establish a relationship with their dads.\"\nSonia set up Lads Need Dads 10 years ago, with an initial grant of \u00a34,000, having worked for more than 20 years on the frontlines of criminal justice, addiction, domestic abuse and homelessness.\n\"I kept seeing the same heartbreaking pattern - so many men stuck in cycles of crime, addiction, and hopelessness. And nearly every time, there was one thing they had in common: growing up without a father or a positive male role model.\n\"I thought 'I've got to do something'. If we don't provide a service for these boys we won't break this cycle,\" she says.\nAbout 250 boys have been helped by the organisation. \nCharlie Howlett, 19, says it saved his life when he joined six years ago.\nHis mother had died when he was a two, leaving his father to bring him and his younger brother up alone.\n\"My dad didn't take it too well and it wasn't the best situation growing up,\" he adds.\nThe brothers moved in with their nan and aunt a few years later, but still remained close to their dad until he died suddenly from a blood clot when Charlie was 12.\nCharlie tried to be strong for everyone and be the father figure. \"But I couldn't cope,\" he says. \"I was lashing out at everyone and started thinking about taking my own life.\"\nLads Need Dads has given him an \"unimaginable\" amount of support, he says.\n\"I thought I was the only person going through it, then I met this group of boys my age who were also growing up without a dad.\n\"The mentors were a huge part of it for me. You grow to trust them like your own dad.\"\nSonia and her team supported Charlie three years ago when his nan, who he was still living with, also died.\n\"They have helped me be a better big brother and I think that has kept him on a good path too,\" he adds.\nSonia helped Charlie get a plumbing apprenticeship and, for the last year, he has also been mentoring boys on the programme.\n\"It's a really good feeling to know I'm giving something back. I can see parts of myself in all of them,\" he says.\nLads Need Dads also runs a reading mentor programme in primary schools and is piloting a new programme in September where, for the first time, male teachers will deliver a three-month intervention to Year 7 boys.\nDespite its impact, Sonia says Lads Need Dads is struggling for funding.\n\"It's so frustrating because I feel like we have this blueprint that works that could be rolled out nationwide, but I have to turn away mothers who don't live in Essex, who are desperate for help for their sons.\"\nSonia says society has to believe in boys like Harley and Charlie, and help them reach their potential and break the cycle of fatherlessness.\nAs for Charlie, he says he wants to carry on plumbing, see more of the world and continue mentoring boys. But his ultimate wish is to be a father.\n\"I can't wait to be a dad. It's the one thing in my life I know is exactly what I want.

        "article_text": "James Finlayson failed to make it as a lead man in Holywood but became one of the most memorable comic foils ever to grace the silver screen.\nThe Scottish actor performed in more than 100 films but was best known for being the \"third man\" to Laurel and Hardy. \nWith his distinctive fake moustache, he starred with the iconic duo in 33 of their films and later became the inspiration for Homer Simpson's \"D'oh!\" catchphrase.\nNow Finlayson has been memorialised with a new portrait in the Scottish theatre where he first tread the boards more than a century ago. \nDobbie Hall in his hometown of Larbert, Stirling, commissioned the oil painting to celebrate the actor's career and rise to international fame in the early days of cinema. \nThe portrait by young artist Connor Draycott was unveiled by Finlayson's family, some of whom had travelled from the US for the occasion.\nThey were joined by fans of the black and white movies and \"talkies\" from the UK chapters of Sons of the Desert, named after the fictional lodge that Laurel and Hardy belonged to in the 1933 film of the same name. \nFinlayson, known as Fin to his fans and as Jimmy to his good friend Stan Laurel, was born in Larbert in 1887.\nHe worked for a while as a tinsmith in his father's foundry before moving to Edinburgh to study and then pursue an acting career. \nAt the age of 23 he was performing at the Theatre Royal, but his ambitions were not satisfied. \nAfter the death of his parents he moved to New York with his brother.\nWithin the year he had landed a role on Broadway in The Great Game, for which reviews offered \"nothing but praise\". \nIn May 1912, the New York Dramatic Mirror said Finlayson had \"an excellent opportunity, which he did not miss, for developing two characters in his one role - the simple, naive Scotsman and the artful, determined detective\". \nIt added: \"The remarkable thing is that he managed to do them both at the same time.\"\nHe took on another Scottish character in the Broadway production of Bunty Pulls the Strings, but pulled out of the national tour in 1916 when Holywood beckoned. \nBy 1919 he was signed with the \"King of Comedy\" Mack Sennet, appearing as a Keystone Cop and lauded as a \"legitimate and screen player of international celebrity\".\nAfter a move to Hal Roach at Culver City in 1923, Finlayson was tested in different billings, sometimes in a lead role or as one of a comic trio with up-and-coming comics Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. \nHe eventually found his niche as their established comic support or antagonist. \nBy the time he died aged 66 in 1953, he had more than 100 film credits to his name and his eccentric mannerisms were internationally recognised. \nThe double-take, the squint then a one-eyed stare and raised eyebrow - Finlayson's madcap facial expressions became his trademark, along with the drawn-out \"dohhhh\".\nIt inspired Dan Castellaneta when he voiced Homer in The Simpsons, which first aired in 1989. \nIt is also said Finlayson's fake walrus moustache allowed him a degree of anonymity even in his heyday in Holywood. \nThe artist who created his new portrait said he toyed with the idea of picturing the actor without his famous facial hair. \nDraycott, who is studying fine art at Glasgow School of Art, was commissioned to produce the artwork by the Dobbie Hall Trust.\nIt wanted to commemorate the Larbert man's global success and inspire young performers who appear in shows at the theatre.\nDraycott, 20, said it was an honour to be asked to create the portrait for the theatre.\nAnd he revealed he spent hours watching Finlayson's films to \"recreate his trademark facial expression\". \nDraycott said: \"James is such a well-known face among fans of black and white movies and I wanted to capture the distinctive look that made him a real superstar of his day.\" \nThe award-winning artist said he was fascinated by Finlayson's look and story.\nHe added: \"There was initially some debate as to whether I should include his moustache in the portrait, as it was actually a false moustache that he wore specially for filming, but we decided that his moustache was such an integral part of his unique look that it should feature in the painting.\"\n\"I like the fact that despite his face being so well-known during the 19040s and 50's he could apparently remove the moustache and walk around Hollywood without being recognised by members of the public.\"\nBut now, thanks to his portrait, new generations in his hometown will recognise the young man from Larbert who followed his dream all the way to Holywood.",

        "article_text": "Alberto Angela has made a career out of exploring his hometown. Here are his favourite spots to unearth Rome's millennia of secrets, from the Vatican Museums to Ostia Antica.\nFrom the 1st-Century BCE ruins of the Imperial Forum to the Trevi Fountain\u2019s Baroque splendour, Rome packs such an overwhelming myriad of postcard-worthy landmarks that digging through its historical layers can make any visitor feel like they've turned into an archaeologist.\nAlberto Angela, a TV presenter, global ambassador for Italian heritage, art, history and culture, and a familiar face in Italian living rooms for nearly four decades knows a thing or two about his hometown's 2,000 years of history \u2013 and he's ready to help visitors discover it, especially as this year's Jubilee newly puts it into the limelight.\nThe SpeciaList\nAlberto Angela is an Italian palaeontologist and TV presenter raised and based in Rome. A well-recognised public scholar, he has published books and conducted documentaries for Italian state broadcaster RAI on science, history and archaeology-related topics for the past 36 years.\n\"Rome has two faces,\" says Angela. \"The Papal \u2013 that of the rich \u2013 and its working-class soul, the one that is closest to us\u2026 the most interesting,\" he says.\nIn a city where grand basilicas lie next to shady alleyways, Angela recommends exploring without cramming in too many sights \u2013 so that one can \"immerse oneself in the world of the ancients\".\nHaving followed in the footsteps of his famous father, Piero Angela \u2013 Italy's most well-known documentarist often called a \"national treasure\" \u2013 the younger Angela attributes his career and love of history to growing up in the Italian capital.\n\"You breathe history here,\" he says. \"Anyone who comes to Rome can see the same afterglow Caesar would have seen. You aren't in a place that doesn't exist anymore. Rome was rebuilt on top of its ancient structures.\"\nFor Angela, this is what makes Rome so unique. \"The city did not cancel its history, unlike many others,\" he says. \"Living here, you understand the ancients.\"\nEmerging from a small market settlement on the Tiber, the city of Rome was at an intersection between the Mediterranean and mainland Europe, making it a crossroads that swelled into the world\u2019s first true metropolis. Angela believes that the city's immense global-reaching political and symbolic impact throughout history means everyone has a \"piece\" of Rome inside them \u2013 which is why it can have such a profound impact on those who visit it.\nHere are Angela's favourite ways to experience ancient history in modern Rome.\nMuch of central Rome's labyrinthine urban grid is a direct heir of the former imperial capital, with public spaces like the Baroque Piazza Navona or Campo de\u2019 Fiori piazza taking their shape from a bygone stadium and theatre, respectively.\nTip:\nTrying to cram in all of Rome's main landmarks in a few days is an Olympian feat, so Angela recommends first-time visitors follow a three-day rule.\n\"See the major sights on the first and second days \u2013 Saint Peter's, the Pantheon, the Colosseum,\" he says. \"And then on the third day, choose yourself, to see something cool [off the beaten path]. When you get home, you'll feel you'll have seen the things everyone talks about, but you'll also have seen something you yourself like.\"\nBut on the Palatine Hill, the mythical birthplace of Rome, you can actually walk on the same stones where emperors Augustus and Nero once dwelled.\n\"It's the place where the Caesars lived and died,\" Angela says.\nAs the legend goes, twin brothers Romulus and Remus received an omen from the gods and decided to lay the foundations of a new city on the Palatine Hill in 753 BCE. In the subsequent centuries, the Palatine developed into an exclusive neighbourhood of patrician villas and Imperial palaces \u2013 indeed, it\u2019s where the word \u201cpalace\u201d takes its root.\nOne of the legendary seven hills of the ancient city, offering an incomparable vantage point with a 360 panorama, Palatine Hill offers what Angela describes as \"a beautiful walk\", with arguably the best views of the Colosseum \u2013 the unmistakable \"star of ancient Rome\".\nVisiting the Palatine is a full immersion into the life of the Roman empire, with a plethora of impressive ruins, including the mosaic floors of Augustus's palace, Domitian's hippodrome and the balcony overlooking the Circus Maximus racecourse.\nWebsite: https://colosseo.it/en/area/the-palatine/\nAddress: Parco archeologico del Colosseo, Via di S. Gregorio 30, 00186\nPhone: + 39 06 21115 843\nInstagram: @parcocolosseo\nAs the centre of Catholicism and one of the most important sites in Christendom, the Unesco-listed Vatican is firmly entrenched among Rome's unmissable sights. In honour of the 2025 Jubilee, tourists and pilgrims alike are flocking to Saint Peter's Basilica to walk through its Holy Door, opened for the occasion every quarter of a century.\nBut while much of the Holy See's architectural majesty is immediately apparent \u2013 from the Michelangelo- and Giacomo della Porta-designed designed dome of Saint Peter's all the way to the Sistine Chapel and Vatican Museums \u2013 some of its greatest treasures are hidden underground.\n\"Once in Saint Peter's, you walk on beautiful marble floorings, you look up to the Baldachin,\" says Angela, renowned for his 2015 TV miniseries Alla Scoperta dei Musei Vaticani (Discovering the Vatican Museums). \"But you can go underground. The Popes' tombs can be found underneath, but under those is the ancient Roman graveyard where Peter the Apostle himself was buried. The foundations of [the Basilica] are a graveyard.\"\nThe Vatican Necropolis, excavated only in the 1940s, features mausoleums belonging to citizens of many faiths, as well as a cluster of tombs called \"Field P\u201d, suspected by some scholars to hold the burial chamber of the Church founder himself.\n\"It's a trip into ancient Rome that you wouldn't expect to find [there]\", Angela says. \"It makes you understand how Rome really is.\"\nVisitors must book visits to the Necropolis on the official website of Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica. The dress code mandates covered shoulders and below-the-knee clothing.\nWebsite: https://www.basilicasanpietro.va/en/san-pietro/the-necropolis\nAddress: Piazza San Pietro, 00120 Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano, Vatican City\nPhone: +39 06 6988 5318\nInstagram: @basilicasanpietro.va\nRome has more than 900 Catholic sites of worship built over the course of the centuries. Now and then, there's one that best encapsulates the city's multi-millennial history, like Angela's pick, the Basilica of San Clemente.\n\"This Basilica conceals the three souls of Rome \u2013 Baroque, medieval and ancient,\" Angela says. \"Anyone who comes across it is enchanted.\"\nTucked behind the Colosseum and a composite of two different churches, San Clemente \u2013 dedicated to the third pope of the same name \u2013 has been a site of worship since ancient Roman times, when it served as a temple for the Zoroastrian cult of Mithras.\nThe temple eventually swelled into its grand current form, featuring an intricate overlay of architectural styles \u2013 from its Renaissance courtyard and the Mannerist facade of the main Basilica, all the way to its underground, early medieval second structure, which hides ancient Roman remnants.\n\"The exterior is beautiful and well-maintained, from the 16th Century, with a Cosmatesque [geometric] marble flooring, and then you take the stairs and arrive at the medieval Basilica,\" says Angela. \"And you find yourself right in ancient Rome, in a Roman temple.\"\nWebsite: https://www.basilicasanclemente.com/eng/\nAddress: Piazza di S. Clemente, 00184\nPhone: +39 06 774 0021\nInstagram: @sanclementeroma\nFrom 17th-Century Villa Borghese to the Capitoline, the city\u2019s oldest art gallery, Rome has no shortage of museums displaying a vast array of artefacts \u2013 matched by equally colossal crowds of spectators.\nWhile Angela certainly recommends visitors enjoy the time-worn classics, he also suggests a quieter, quirkier alternative: the Museo della Comunicazione Scritta dei Romani.\nConveniently located a mere five-minute walk from the Termini train station, the museum is found inside the Baths of Diocletian, where the majestic 4th-Century Imperial termae have survived in remarkable condition. It is also home to a curious collection of esoteric Roman artefacts, showing how the ancients dabbled in the occult.\n\"It's a museum dedicated to how Romans expressed themselves,\" Angela says. \"But there's a part dedicated to magic, voodoo of sorts.\"\nSuperstition was the unspoken crux of ancient Roman life, but one that we often overlook. \"It's a world that often gets left behind, that of spiritual beliefs,\" he adds. \"They found the objects in a parking lot.\"\nAmong the objects on display is a large copper cauldron, curse tablets (defixiones), ritual tools and even Christian spells.\n\"For someone coming from the station, especially if it rains, it's quite an intriguing thing to visit,\" says Angela.\nWebsite: https://museonazionaleromano.beniculturali.it/terme-di-diocleziano/il-museo-della-comunicazione-scritta-dei-romani/\nAddress: Viale Enrico de Nicola 78, 00185\nPhone: +39 06 684 851\nInstagram: @museonazionaleromano\nThe 16th to 18th Centuries were a crucial time for Rome's urban development, as the city's aristocratic families \u2013 including the Farnese, Borghese, Doria and Pamphilj \u2013 vied for social dominance through commissioning lavish building projects, all designed in the Baroque style favoured by the Papal Counter-Reformation.\n\"I'd advise anyone coming to visit Rome to see the palaces of the powerful Roman families,\" says Angela.\nWhile listing a few examples \u2013 Palazzo Colonna and Palazzo Farnese among them \u2013 few rival the opulence of the Palazzo Doria Pamphilj, Rome's very own \"Versailles\", in Angela's words.\nThe product of an alliance of noble families, what resulted was a Baroque fantasy come to life and an impressive art collection featuring the works of many of Italy's greats, from Titian to Raphael.\nIts crown jewel is its Hall of Mirrors, commissioned by Gabriele Valvassori in the 1730s and featuring whimsical frescos, gilded Venetian frescos and ornate gold-plated furniture.\n\"I had never been prior to shooting [a TV special] and it's truly spectacular,\" he says. \"It truly surpasses anything else.\"\nWebsite: https://www.doriapamphilj.it/roma/\nAddress: Via del Corso 305, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 679 7323\nInstagram: @galleriadoriapamphilj\nMany visitors coming to Rome don't know that the city has what Angela considers its very own \"Pompeii\" around 32km from the city centre: Ostia Antica.\nOnce Rome's sea port, potentially from as early as the 7th Century BCE, Ostia Antica developed into a bustling seaside suburb, reaching a peak of 75,000 inhabitants in the late Imperial age. While the city declined after the empire\u2019s fall, and the coastline ended up advancing by 3.2km, much of the ancient town that once stood there has been preserved.\n\"You lose yourself there, you can see everything,\" Angela says. \"Bakeries, public bathrooms (latrines), homes, apartment blocks\u2026 street businesses, not too dissimilar to those of today.\"\nA tour of Ostia Antica can show you much of the amenities and features of ancient Roman life \u2013 from its 1st-Century BCE theatre, to its forum, public baths and necropolis.\nFor Angela, Ostia Antica best preserves the \"popolare\" (working-class) soul of ancient Rome \u2013 one which its newer counterpart, the beach suburb Lido di Ostia, has carried on in modern form.\nOstia Antica is a roughly 30-minute drive from central Rome, and can be reached in around the same time by taking the Metromare commuter rail from the Porta S Paolo station.\u00a0\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Deena Ghazarian had only been in business for a year when the trade policies of President Donald Trump's first term of office sent her company into a tailspin.\nIt was 2019 and her California-based firm, Austere, had just agreed to supply several big US retailers with its high-end audio and video accessories that are largely manufactured in China.\nThen Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.\nShe was forced to absorb the costs and for a while thought she would go bust.\n\"I literally thought I am going to start and end a business in less than a year,\" she says. \"I had spent all this time, money and effort, and to have something like this blindside you was shocking.\"\nThe firm pulled through, but like numerous other US businesses it now finds itself in a strikingly similar situation.\nSince returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.\nThe president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.\nBut the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.\nGoods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher. \n\"US importers have to pay these taxes not the exporters,\" says Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a North American trade body that represents more than 1,200 tech firms.\n\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"\nBusinesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.\nMeanwhile, 87% of US video game console imports came from China that year, 78% of smartphones, 79% of laptops and tablets, and two-thirds of monitors, says the CTA.\nWhile many American companies like Austere have diversified their supply chains away from China since Mr Trump's first term, countries such as Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam still do not offer the same manufacturing capabilities and expertise. \nAt the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.\n\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.\n\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"\nResearch suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.\nIn February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.\nMs Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.\n\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"\nDuring Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.\nInsiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.\nFears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.  \nFor the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute. \nHe plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.  \nThere is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.\nMs Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.\nShe hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.\n\"That might mean finding a more cost-effective way to produce the product or doing something completely different. It's frustrating I have to focus on survival rather than growing my business.\"  ",

And for Ukraine and its Western partners. many of them are going to prove unacceptable or impossible to fulfil.\n\"We agree with the proposals to cease hostilities,\" he started positively, only to add: \"This cessation must be such that it would lead to long-term peace and eliminate the root causes of this crisis.\"\nNobody would disagree with the need for long-term peace, but Putin's idea of the root causes of the war revolve around Ukraine's desire to exist as a sovereign state, beyond Russia's orbit.\nUkraine wants to be part of Nato and the European Union - so much so, it is enshrined in the constitution.\nPresident Trump has already cast doubt on Nato membership, but Putin has repeatedly dismissed the idea of Ukraine as a state at all.\nAnd that underpins many of the nuances he sketched out.\nHe wants to stop Ukraine from reinforcing its army and replenishing its weapons supply - so there would be no more deliveries from the West. He wants to know who would ensure that was verified.\nFrom the start of this war, Putin has demanded the \"demilitarisation\" of Ukraine, which is anathema to Kyiv and its allies.\nIn essence, Putin is looking for security guarantees in reverse.\nWould Russia agree to halt rearming or mobilising its forces? That seems implausible and there was no hint of any concession on his part, as he addressed reporters in the Kremlin.\nPutin has just come back in bullish mood from the front line in Kursk, a Russian border region that has been partially occupied since last August by Ukraine.\nRussia has the upper hand in Kursk. Putin clearly feels he is negotiating from a position of strength and doesn't want to lose it.\n\"If we stop military actions for 30 days, what does that mean? Will everyone who is there leave the battle?\"\nRussia's defence ministry announced on Thursday that its forces had now taken full control of the biggest city the Ukrainians had managed to seize, Sudzha. Putin says all the Ukrainians have left is a wedge, so why would Russia stop now?\n\"If a physical blockade occurs in the coming days, no-one will be able to leave at all. There will be only two options \u2013 to surrender or die.\"\nThe same applied to the whole of the 1,000km (620-mile) front line, where he claimed the situation on the ground was changing rapidly, with Russian troops \"advancing in practically all areas\".\nThat is not the case, as most of the front is at a stalemate, even if Russia has had some recent success in the east.\nPutin believes a 30-day ceasefire would deprive Russia of its advantage and enable the Ukrainians to regroup and rearm.\n\"What are our guarantees that nothing like that will be allowed to happen,\" he asked rhetorically.\nAs yet, no mechanism has been offered to ensure that the terms of any ceasefire would hold.\nAlthough 15 Western countries have tentatively offered peacekeeping troops, they would only come in the event of a final peace deal, not a ceasefire.\nNot that Russia would allow that arrangement anyway.\nGiven all these \"nuances\", Putin appeared to be sceptical of how a ceasefire could benefit Russia, especially when his troops were on the front foot. His entire outlook was \"based on how the situation on the ground develops\".\nPutin was meeting Trump's envoys on Moscow late on Thursday, notably Steve Witkoff.\nWhatever happens in those talks, Putin knows that ultimately, his most important conversation will be with the president.\n\"I think we need to talk to our American colleagues\u2026 maybe have a phone call with President Trump and discuss this with him,\" he said.\nBut Putin was setting out his stall ahead of those conversations, with a message that the road to a ceasefire was littered with conditions that would be almost impossible to meet.",

Lose then move on.\nThe Football Association provoked debate, and some criticism, by ignoring the claims of English candidates such as Eddie Howe in their succession plan post-Southgate, to go for the best man available regardless of nationality.\nThe strategy was clear. The long-term can wait while a proven winner takes charge and Tuchel's first England squad merely confirms it.\nThere is a nod to the next generation with the inclusion of versatile defender Lewis-Skelly with England short at left-back and Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers, who is 22, but there was the definite whiff of short-term targets in Tuchel's selection.\nHowever, the recall of Henderson is the most eye-catching example of Tuchel wanting experience for the here and now. He last played for England in November 2023 and missed out on selection for last summer's Euro 2024.\nTuchel described Henderson as a \"serial winner\" and this is what the coach has in mind as he plots a path to next year's World Cup.\nJordan Henderson's England career looked over when he was left out of Gareth Southgate's Euro 2024 squad\nAnd then there is the shock selection of Burn. \nA wonderful story, as Newcastle United manager Howe agreed, but a very late stage for any player to prove they are international class.\nBurn would be the oldest player to win his first England cap since Bolton Wanderers striker Kevin Davies made his debut against Montenegro on 12 October 2010 at 33 years and 200 days. The bustling forward was the oldest since 38-year-old Leslie Compton in 1950.\nIt is very much a case of going back to the past for the short-term future. Former interim boss Lee Carsley's last squad contained a total 627 caps, while this one has a tally of 664.\nTuchel is missing younger players who have been injured recently, such as Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, but is clear the German's reign is not going to be a slow burner.\nThe selection of Henderson and the return of Rashford demonstrates that Tuchel is prepared to start with a clean slate.\nHenderson's call-up came out of the blue after it looked like his England career was over when he, like Rashford, was left out of Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2024.\nThe former Liverpool captain had an ill-fated stint in Saudi Arabia before returning to Europe with Ajax, where Tuchel has clearly seen enough to recall him.\nTuchel appears to want Henderson as much for his influence off the pitch, saying: \"What he brings every time is leadership, character, personality and energy. He makes sure everyone lives by the standards and with character. He embodies everything we are trying to build.\"\nMarcus Rashford (right) is enjoying a revival in form and fortune on loan at Aston Villa\nEngland's head coach has long been a fan of Rashford and wants to be the beneficiary of Aston Villa manager Unai Emery's repair job on the forward's career.\nHe said: \"I had a strong feeling we should nominate him, to push him to stay at the level he is at now not fall back into old routines.\"\nTuchel's words offer an indication that he realises Rashford had fallen by the wayside at Old Trafford but is also convinced the 27-year-old can offer much to his new England.\nHe clearly does not feel the same about Manchester City's Jack Grealish. He would have been hoping to make a comeback after also missing out on Euro 2024, although he has not figured regularly under manager Pep Guardiola.\nTottenham midfielder James Maddison is another who is, for now at least, consigned to the margins,\nTuchel goes with that he knows by recalling Chelsea's Reece James as he makes his return from another hamstring injury. \nHe was a key member of Tuchel's side that won the Champions League in 2021 and there is a potential opening at right-back with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, Kyle Walker, 34, and on loan at AC Milan, and with Newcastle United's Tino Livramento talented but inexperienced.\nTuchel has made no secret of his desire to utilise the natural physical aspects of the English style into his squad and this is in evidence with this selection.\nBurn, ay 6 feet 7 inches, fits the bill, while Rogers combines raw power with natural skill and strong running. James also combines physical strength with great ability -and the squad has a very powerful look.\nTuchel was asked whether that lack of physicality cost England in previous tournaments.\nHe said: \"I don't think a lot is missing. Obviously a little bit is because we lost consecutive Euros finals and World Cup semi-final and quarter-finals. \n\"The feeling is a little step is needed to bring it over the line.\"\nTuchel's squad is sure to cause debate, especially in Nottingham, where Forest fans will feel Morgan Gibbs-White could have offered an \"X Factor\" after his outstanding performances in their tilt to reach the Champions League.\nThey will also offer up Callum Hudson-Odoi as an example of someone who deserves a return to the England squad after his rejuvenation, exemplified by his winning goal against Manchester City that puts Forest in such a wonderful position to reach the top four.\nEverton defender Jarrad Branthwaite, who won a full cap under Southgate, also misses out despite being in outstanding form since manager David Moyes returned to Goodison Park. He is included in Carsley's England Under-21 side.\nTottenham defender Djed Spence will have had his backers, while there is no place for Conor Gallagher despite his fine form at Atletico Madrid.\nTuchel resisted the temptation to include Arsenal 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri, who also goes into Carsley's squad.\nThomas Tuchel gave a hugely impressive performance in front of the media after announcing his first squad.\nFrom suggestion he is intent on \"building a brotherhood\" in his England squad to talking about \"a parental vibe\" when handling Arsenal teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly, Tuchel was confident and comfortable in his new skin as England head coach.\nNo subject was off limits, apart from when he declined to reveal who his captain might be if Harry Kane was not available.\nTuchel was open, honest and clearly excited about the task ahead, although he admitted he was \"missing the smell of the grass\" and could not wait to get on the training ground with his new charges.\nThis is a coach who has been around the block with big clubs such as Borussia Dortmund, Paris St. Germain and Bayern Munich, while getting a feel and admiration for the English game and his players at Chelsea.\nHe is the quick winner the FA wanted with his appointment.\nNow the serious work starts with the World Cup his goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRashford returns as Tuchel names first England squad",

        "article_text": "As an engineer who flies into hurricanes for the US government, Josh Ripp is accustomed to turbulence. But the last two weeks have been far bumpier than he's used to.\nIn late February, the Trump administration fired Mr Ripp and over 800 recently hired or promoted staff at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration using a form email, part of ongoing cuts to the federal workforce.\nSuddenly, he and several other members of the elite Hurricane Hunters flight team were out of a job - until around 21:00 Friday when he received a second email. He was to report back to work in Lakeland, Florida, 12 March, it said.\nFor Mr Ripp, a retired US Navy officer who voted for Donald Trump, the confusion highlighted the dangers of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency slashing thousands of government jobs to cut costs without agency input.\nAs soon as this week, the Trump administration could consider axing more than 1,000 additional staffers at NOAA, according to BBC News partner CBS News. Those potential cuts, plus losses from previous firings and buyouts, would cost the agency up to 20% of its workforce, the New York Times reported. \nThe White House did not comment on additional cuts, but a Trump administration official said an \"extensive process was conducted\" to ensure \"mission critical functions\" were not compromised during the first round of dismissals.\n\"NOAA provides vital information to the entire country and we do it at a fraction of the cost that anyone else could do,\" Mr Ripp said. \"There's a lot of jobs out there that are very important. NOAA is a small agency. Every little bit hurts.\"\nThe cuts will not only harm government functions, staffers and weather experts warn, but they could disrupt the daily lives of Americans who rely on accurate NOAA data more than they know.\nThe data that powers Americans' smartphone weather apps and informs local meteorologists comes from NOAA and its subsidiary, the National Weather Service. Americans use it to decide what to wear, and whether to meet friends in the park or indoors. They rely on it during hurricanes, tornadoes or blizzards.  \nAirlines and federal aviation officials need forecasts to safely guide planes through the sky. Retailers use them to schedule customer deliveries. Shipping companies and fisheries in the Great Lakes rely on NOAA updates about ice conditions and algae blooms.\n\"People take for granted how accurate the weather forecasts are,\" said Andy Hazelton, a NOAA climate scientist who modelled hurricane paths and was fired in February. \"Forecasts are going to get worse because offices are understaffed.\"\nHurricane Hunters measure hurricanes from the inside, gauging their strength and paths. As a flight engineer for the P-3 aircraft, Mr Ripp ensures that the nearly 50-year-old planes NOAA uses are safe. Missions cannot take off without team members like him aboard.\nThe original staffing cuts would have limited hurricane flights, said Lt Kerri Englert, a flight director for the Hurricane Hunters -  also cut in February then reinstated. \n\"That means data doesn't get ingested into the models, and forecasting for those hurricane tracks and intensity will be less accurate,\" she said. A disruption would impact evacuations, money allocated for storm preparation and disaster response.\nAlready, local National Weather Service offices have scaled back lesser known but crucial work, due to cuts.\nFor example, scientific balloon launches from Alaska - vital to national forecasts because the location allows them to assess systems moving from west to east - were curtailed, weather experts told the BBC. Launches in New York and Maine also were reduced.\nNOAA spokeswoman Susan Buchanan declined to comment on individual staffing decisions, citing agency policy.\nBut, she said, \"NOAA remains dedicated to its mission, providing timely information, research, and resources that serve the American public and ensure our nation's environmental and economic resilience.\"\n\"We continue to provide weather information, forecasts and warnings pursuant to our public safety mission.\"\nSome of NOAA's long-term, climate-focused initiatives also face cuts.\nBefore he was fired, NOAA scientist Zack Labe studied using artificial intelligence to prepare for deadly heat waves. Others in his division, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, also were fired and their specialities make them difficult to replace, he said.\n\"People who were impacted were definitely the key people who were leading the development of the US weather models,\" Mr Labe told BBC.\nEven private sector weather companies rely on accurate NOAA and NWS data for their products.\n\"We operate on razor thin margins to keep costs low,\" said Ryan Hickman, owner and chief technology officer at AllisonHouse, which takes data from NOAA and other sources to create custom weather visualisations.\nFor AllisonHouse, NOAA is both a data source and a client.\nMr Hickman was particularly worried that the agency's radar and satellite services could be impacted. \"Nobody else has these satellite capabilities NOAA has,\" he said.\n\"Unless someone has a billion dollars to build a weather satellite and launch it into geostationary orbit, and have it sit there and read all this data, and bring it back down to Earth so that everyone else can see it and use it, then what are we doing here?\"\nThe prospect of more cuts alarms scientists and private businessmen like Mr Hickman, who believe they will strain the agency's maintenance of the complex and delicate instruments needed to produce real-time as well as future forecasts.\nNOAA's primary goal is to keep Americans informed about the future, in ways both mundane and urgent, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\"There is almost unanimous horror among people who really understand how this works,\" he said.\nHe feared some in the administration believe in a \"philosophy that not only can we not plan for the future, but we also should not even try to prevent bad things from happening.\"\nBack in Florida, Mr Ripp still doesn't know what the future holds.\nDuring his brief unemployment, he explored opportunities flying for a private firefighting company \u2013 and still would not rule out leaving NOAA. He remains angry that fellow veterans were caught up in the layoffs.\nHe backed Trump due to the president's commitment to the rule of law, he said, but now Mr Ripp thinks Trump is flouting the correct procedures for reducing the federal workforce.\n\"We're very good stewards of the money we're given by the government. We're not out here committing waste or anything like that,\" Mr Ripp said. \"If you're looking for government savings, NOAA's not the place.\"",

        "summary": "\"The cuts will not only harm government functions, staffers and weather experts warn, but they could disrupt the daily lives of Americans who rely on accurate NOAA data more than they know.The data that powers Americans' smartphone weather apps and informs local meteorologists comes from NOAA and its subsidiary, the National Weather Service. \"People take for granted how accurate the weather forecasts are,\" said Andy Hazelton, a NOAA climate scientist who modelled hurricane paths and was fired in February. \"People who were impacted were definitely the key people who were leading the development of the US weather models,\" Mr Labe told BBC.Even private sector weather companies rely on accurate NOAA and NWS data for their products. He was to report back to work in Lakeland, Florida, 12 March, it said.For Mr Ripp, a retired US Navy officer who voted for Donald Trump, the confusion highlighted the dangers of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency slashing thousands of government jobs to cut costs without agency input.As soon as this week, the Trump administration could consider axing more than 1,000 additional staffers at NOAA, according to BBC News partner CBS News. Missions cannot take off without team members like him aboard.The original staffing cuts would have limited hurricane flights, said Lt Kerri Englert, a flight director for the Hurricane Hunters -  also cut in February then reinstated.",

But now I understand.\"\nHe says this while at the Get Busy Living Centre, a state-of-the art facility that he is the driving force behind, which offers total support to those in a similar situation.\nThe centre, which is nestled among farmland outside Melton Mowbray in rural Leicestershire, is also home of the foundation set up in Hampson's name.\n\"I come into the driveway and see the foundation and centre and this is what it's all about,\" he said.\n\"This is why it happened. Realising how much support I had and how many people that I'd be able to help and influence, just through my journey and my story - to show people that there is a great life to be had in this situation.\"\nMatt Hampson was awarded an OBE in 2022 and received an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Leicester in January\nIt was the support that Hampson got after his accident that made him realise what could be possible.\nIn hospital he was visited by so many people that he ended up needing a booking system to stay on top of it all. As a high-profile injury that rocked the rugby world, there was also a lot of money donated to help him and his family cope.\nHe knew he was \"blessed\" to be in that position, but also saw that many were not so fortunate.\n\"It didn't just come to me straightaway,\" Hampson said of plans for his foundation and the centre. \"The trust fund was sort of thrust upon me where people were raising money for me. \n\"I felt very grateful for that and I felt that I needed to give something back. The natural progression for the trust was to turn into a foundation, a charity to help other people.\n\"The most worthwhile thing we can do in our life is to make an impression on someone else's life.\"\nHow many people the foundation and centre have supported over the years, Hampson can't put an exact number on.\nBut it is hundreds who have sought access to expert physiotherapists, specialist personal trainers, wellbeing support and other tailored healthy living advice at the centre.\nAccommodation has been set up there recently to help offer even greater levels of access, and there are further redevelopment plans for the site and aspirations to expand its reach with satellite centres around the country.\nSome people who have come through the centre have even gone on establish themselves as athletes, competing at the Paralympic Games. Among them are Nick Cummins and Jamie Stead, who were both part of ParalympicsGB's gold medal-winning wheelchair rugby side at the Tokyo games in 2021.\nGraham Lee, a Grand National-winning jockey who suffered a spinal injury in 2024 in a riding accident, went direct to the centre from hospital to start his rehabilitation.\n\"The second I got out of the van, Matt was there,\" Lee said. \"He is a class act in every way.\"\nWhen Hampson turned 40 last year, he spoke of his pride in how he, and those he works with, have \"shaken things up for the disability world\".\n\"The world is a lot more inclusive. You were just existing back then,\" Hampson said when reflecting on the support he received after he first left hospital with his injury.\n\"Now you can get busy living and you can do things. It's a challenge, every day is a challenge, but it makes it enjoyable and makes it worthwhile.\n\"You feel like you are actually getting somewhere, actually changing the world for disabled people but also changing the world for a lot of other people as well.\n\"I'm immensely proud of what we do here.\"\nNatalie Jackson, BBC East Midlands Today sports editor:\nI have been covering Matt Hampson's story for 20 years and first met him in Stoke Mandeville Hospital not long after his accident. \nWhen he was first injured he could only communicate by blinking and clicking, and his injury is the worst level of tetraplegia \u2013 paralysed  from the neck down and on a ventilator.  \nHe was in hospital for 18 months and I filmed with him during his last week in hospital before he came home. \nI was nervous about meeting him because I was worried about saying the wrong thing but he instantly put me at ease with his smile, humour and positivity. And that mental strength he has used ever since to change the way people view disability and to shake up the disability world, changing and saving hundreds of lives. \nHe has an incredible ability to know what people need. \nI have seen people take their first steps at his centre and seen him take people from a dark place and transform their lives, proving that you can have a full and incredible life after a spinal injury \u2013 Getting Busy Living.",

        "article_text": "Gianluigi Donnarumma joined Paris St-Germain in 2021\nIt is the life of a goalkeeper. \nOne day you are the villain. The next, you are the hero.\nGianluigi Donnarumma was blamed by some for Paris St-Germain's defeat by Liverpool last week, allowing Harvey Elliot's 88th-minute effort - the Reds' only shot on target - to slip in. \nAt the other end, the Italian's opposite number Alisson produced the \"performance of his career\" as he single-handedly kept the French side at bay in Paris. \nOn Tuesday night, the tables turned.\nItaly's Donnarumma was the hero, saving two of Liverpool's three penalties in a shootout to send his side through to the Champions League quarter-finals. \n\"The first game belonged to Alisson, the second game belonged to Donnarumma,\" said PSG boss Luis Enrique.\nDonnarumma has now won six of the seven penalty shootouts he has taken part in for club and country.\nSince making his debut aged 16 for boyhood club AC Milan, Donnarumma has faced 60 penalties across his club and international career. \nHe has saved 14 of those, giving him a save percentage of 23.3%.\nRemarkably, the Italian's penalty shootout record is identical.\nThe 26-year-old has saved 10 of the 43 spot-kicks he has faced during shootouts - a save percentage of 23.3%.  \nDonnarumma, who was player of the tournament after Italy's 2021 Euros triumph, saved penalties from Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho in the final against England at Wembley. \nHis full record for penalties faced during matches and in shootouts is 24 saves from 103 penalties. \nDonnarumma missed Luis Enrique's pre-shootout team talk as he headed down the tunnel, choosing instead to retrieve some pre-prepared notes from the dressing room about Liverpool's spot-kicks.\n\"I had prepared something with my trainer, it was right to take something back to try to save some penalties,\" said Donnarumma. \n\"I see a lot of criticism from journalists without knowing what the goalkeeper's job is.\n\"In the first leg we conceded a shot and a goal, it seemed like it was my fault but I always think about smiling, giving my best and working for the team.\"\nAt 6ft 5in, Donnarumma cuts an imposing figure.\nBut unlike many of his peers, he has a slightly different tactic for penalties.\nMany goalkeepers use the moments before a penalty is taken to attempt to 'get into the head' of the taker - slowing down the taking of the penalty, retrieving the ball for the taker or moving along their line. \nDonnarumma is different.\nLaidback and calm, the Italian barely moves until the player puts the ball on the spot. \nJust as they are readying their run-up, he expands his arms to make the goal look as small as possible. \n\"The idea behind that is to stand as slim as you can to start with,\" former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock told Football Daily.\n\"The ball goes on the spot, now you're putting doubt in their mind, you spread yourself, make yourself big and awkward, making the goal look smaller. \n\"You don't do that when they're walking forward. You do it when the ball is on the spot to put doubt in their mind in the last seconds.\" \nDonnarumma remained level-headed after both of his penalty saves, barely celebrating as he prepared for the next. \n\"I'm sat here watching Donnarumma and thinking, 'Wow, look at the size of him!'\" Warnock added.\n\"How imposing is he in that goal?

        "article_text": "Disney's live-action remake of Snow White is set to be released in UK cinemas next week, marking the latest efforts by the film studio to revive a beloved old classic.\nBut the film, which stars Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot, has faced several issues throughout its production. \nThe movie is being released amid a debate about how the seven dwarfs are represented on screen, while Zegler has made headlines for critical comments about the original 1937 film.\nThe European premiere was held on Wednesday at a castle in Northern Spain, instead of a more traditional and high-profile location such as London's Leicester Square.\nThe debate around the film began making headlines in January 2022, when Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, an actor with Dwarfism, described the decision to retell the story of \"seven dwarfs living in a cave\" as \"backward\".\nDisney has used computer-generated dwarfs in the remake and said it would \"avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film\". \nBut this week, other actors with Dwarfism have said they would have liked the opportunity to play the roles. \nSpeaking to the Daily Mail, performer Choon Tan said the decision to use CGI was \"absolutely absurd and discriminating in a sense\".\n\"There really is nothing wrong casting someone with dwarfism as a dwarf in any given opportunity,\" he said.\n\"As long as we are treated equally and with respect, we're usually more than happy to take on any acting roles that are suitable for us,\" he added.\nAnother performer, Blake Johnston, told the newspaper that \"we have plenty of dwarf actors out there who are dying for roles like this\".\nHe said he also said he believed Disney had \"succumb to peer pressure on political correctness, which has now given top dwarf actors less work\".\nDinklage, who has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, criticised the film in 2022 during an interview with podcaster Marc Maron.\n\"I was a little taken aback by [the fact] they were very proud to cast a Latina actress as Snow White,\" he said, referring to Colombian-American actress Zegler.\n\"You're progressive in one way, but then you're still making that backward story about seven dwarfs living in a cave together? Have I done nothing to advance the cause from my soapbox? I guess I'm not loud enough.\" \nThe actor had previously spoken about the representation of dwarfism, saying it was \"bad writing\" to make it a \"dominant character trait\".\nIn a statement released after Dinklage's comments, Disney said they were \"taking a different approach with these seven characters\" and had made their decision to use CGI after \"consulting with members of the dwarf community\".\nThe film's European premiere took place on Wednesday at a remote castle in Spain, which was the inspiration behind the castle in the 1937 original animated film.\nZegler performed a rendition of original song Waiting On a Wish at the event on Wednesday evening in Segrovia, north-West of Madrid. \nMost media outlets were not invited to the medieval castle, and Zegler instead performed to a relatively small crowd.\nThe Los Angeles premiere, meanwhile, will be reportedly smaller than usual for a film of this magnitude, with the stars only expected to pose for photographs and speak to Disney's in-house crews. \nNews journalists have not been invited to attend the red carpet and therefore will not have the opportunity to interview the film's cast and creatives. \nHowever, the cast are taking part in a few select sit-down interviews with some outlets as part of a press junket which is taking place this week.\nThe debate about the seven dwarfs is not the only controversy which has surrounded the film, which has reportedly cost \u00a3217m to make.\nEarly in the film's production, there was controversy around Disney's decision to cast Zegler, a Latina actress, in the role of a character deemed to have skin \"as white as snow\".\nIt was part of a drive by Disney to cast a more diverse range of actors to play updated versions of some classic characters. \nHalle Bailey, a black actress, was cast in another recent Disney live-action movie, The Little Mermaid. Both actresses faced abuse online after their casting was announced.\nZegler also made headlines after she made critical comments about some elements of the previous animated film. \n\"The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so,\" Zegler said in 2022. \"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"\nZegler also called the original film \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power,\" adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"\nElsewhere, fans have speculated that there may have been a behind-the-scenes rift between Zegler and Gadot, who plays the wicked stepmother, because the actresses have opposing views on the Israel-Palestine conflict.\nZegler has publicly taken a pro-Palestine stance, whilst Gadot is Israeli and served in the country's army for two years. \nHowever, others have said rumours of a rift are misguided, noting Gadot and Zegler have appeared publicly together on several occasions, including when they jointly presented an award at last week's Oscars.\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the latest in a long line of classic animated Disney stories which have been remade as live-action films.\nOther recent live-action remakes the studio has produced include Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, Dumbo and The Jungle Book.",

        "article_text": "Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent figure during the Gaza war protests at Columbia University in the spring of 2024, has drawn global attention after the Trump administration arrested and moved to deport him.\nThe case has raised questions about free speech on college campuses and the legal process that would allow for the deportation of a US permanent resident.\nMr Khalil will remain in detention in Louisiana following a court hearing on Wednesday, where lawyers argued over whether he should be moved back to New York.\nBorn in Syria, the Columbia graduate's arrest by immigration agents was linked to President Donald Trump's promise to crack down on student demonstrators he accuses of \"un-American activity\". \nTrump has repeatedly alleged that pro-Palestinian activists, including Mr Khalil, support Hamas, a group designated a terrorist organisation by the US. The president argues these protesters should be deported and called Mr Khalil's arrest \"the first of many to come\".\nThe 30-year-old's lawyers say he was exercising free speech rights to demonstrate in support of Palestinians in Gaza and against US support for Israel. They accused the government of \"open repression of student activism and political speech\".\nBorn in Syria to Palestinian refugees, Mr Khalil earned a degree in computer science from the Lebanese American University before working with the Syrian-American non-profit Jusoor. \nMore recently, he managed the Syria Chevening Programme for the British Embassy in Beirut, offering scholarships for study in the UK, according to his biography on the Society for International Development website.  \nThe UK Foreign Office said Mr Khalil stopped work there more than two years ago. \nMr Khalil moved to the US in 2022, where he earned a master's degree at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. He has since married an American woman, who is eight months pregnant, and initially faced arrest threats herself, according to his lawyer.\nMr Khalil's role in Columbia's 2024 protests placed him in the public eye. On the front lines of negotiations, he played a role in mediating between university officials and the activists and students who attended the protests.\nActivists supporting Israel have accused Mr Khalil of being a leader of Columbia University Apartheid Divest (Cuad), a student group that demanded, among other things, the university to divest from its financial ties to Israel and a ceasefire in Gaza.\nMr Khalil has denied that he led the group, telling the Associated Press (AP) that he only served as a spokesperson for protesters and as a mediator with the university.\nAfter Mr Khalil's arrest the Department of Homeland Security accused him of  \"leading activities aligned to Hamas\" but did not provide further details. \nOn Tuesday, the White House alleged that he had organised protests where pro-Hamas propaganda was distributed. His lawyers responded that there was no evidence that he had provided support of any kind to US-designated terror groups.\n\"They're trying to make an example of him to chill others from making similar speech,\" Samah Sisay told the AP.\nSome Jewish students at Columbia have said the protests veered into antisemitism and made them feel unsafe on campus. \nThe Columbia Jewish Alumni Association said Mr Khalil had \"spent over a year abusing the privileges this country and Columbia gave him\".\nThe Trump administration recently cut $400m in funding to the university over what it said was \"continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students\".\nStudents affiliated with Cuad and the protests have rejected these characterisations, and many Jewish students and groups participated in the campus rallies. \nColumbia was just one college campus that played host to mass student protests over the war in Gaza. And activists say they fear the Trump administration will continue to target protesters who are not US citizens.\nLegal experts say green card holders can be deported on national security grounds, but add that the case against Mr Khalil is unprecedented.\n\"Targeting individual protesters just for protesting... is highly unusual and something that we haven't seen before, even under the first Trump administration,\" said Jacob Hamburger, a visiting assistant professor at Cornell Law School.\nAmid the protests early last year, Mr Khalil was briefly suspended from the university, after police swarmed the campus following the occupation of a building.\nAt the time, he told the BBC that while he was acting as a key protest negotiator with Columbia officials, he had not participated directly in the student encampment because he was worried it could affect his student visa. \nIt is unclear when he obtained his green card, which provides permanent residency.\n\"[They said] that after reviewing the evidence, they don't have any evidence to suspend (me),\" he said in an interview in early May. \"It shows how random the suspension was \u2026 they did that randomly, and without due process.\"\nAt the time he said he would continue protesting, but more recently, Mr Khalil's wife said her husband had grown worried about deportation, after facing online attacks that \"were simply not based in reality\". She said he sent Columbia University an email asking for urgent legal help on 7 March, the day before immigration agents arrested him. \nMr Khalil's arrest has sparked demonstrations in New York City, where Columbia is located. On Monday, hundreds of people gathered at a Manhattan protest, including students and professors from Columbia University. \nDonna Lieberman, president of New York Civil Liberties Union, called the attempted deportation of Mr Khalil \"targeted retaliation and an extreme attack on the First Amendment\". New York Attorney General Letitia James said she was \"extremely concerned\".\nThe American Civil Liberties Union called the arrest \"unprecedented\" and \"obviously intended to intimidate and chill speech on one side of a public debate\"\n\"The federal government is claiming the authority to deport people with deep ties to the US and revoke their green cards for advocating positions that the government opposes,\" it said.\nThe White House has continued to defend its move.\n\"This administration is not going to tolerate individuals having the privilege of studying in our country and then siding with pro-terrorist organisations that have killed Americans,\" said Karoline Leavitt, Trump's press secretary.",

The next possible launch opportunity is on Friday evening.\nThe rocket aimed to fly four new crew members to the International Space Station (ISS) and pave the way for the return of Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore. \nThe two Nasa astronauts flew to space in June but were not able to return on a Boeing spacecraft after it was deemed unsafe. The pair should be able to return to Earth within days of the SpaceX mission reaching the ISS. \nThe Nasa astronauts left earth on 5 June 2024 for an eight-day mission and have been stuck at the ISS for more than nine months, instead helping ongoing missions at the station with maintenance and experiments. \nThe Wednesday launch would have made it possible for them to return to Earth as early as Sunday. \nSpaceX said the issue that forced the launch to scrub related to the hydraulics on one of the clamp arms, which engineers were trying to fix. There were concerns the arm would not have been able to open fully during launch. \nThe company said the next launch window would be at 1903 Eastern Time (2303GMT) on Friday. \nMs Williams, 58, and Mr Wilmore, 61, have taken their peculiar situation in their stride, saying in a news conference from the ISS in September that they have been trained to \"expect the unexpected\". \n\"This is my happy place,\" Ms Williams said at the time, though admitting she missed her family and two dogs.\nMr Wilmore noted the issues with the Starliner spacecraft they arrived on made them not \"comfortable\" to fly back home on.\nHe added, however, that 90% of their training was \"preparing for the unexpected\".\nHe said they would stay up there for \"eight months, nine months, 10 months\" if necessary.\nMs Williams said being in space makes her think more about planet Earth.\n\"It opens up the door to making you think a bit differently,\" she explained. \"It's the one planet we have and we should be taking care of it.\"",

        "article_text": "Reflecting back on the Netflix hit based on his own life, there are two things that come to mind for Palestinian comedian Mo Amer.\nPride and hurt.\n\"It's very difficult to talk about without breaking down at some point,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat.\nHe is the star of the semi-autobiographical show titled Mo, playing the role of Mo Najjar.\nThe character is a Palestinian refugee learning to adapt to his new world as he seeks to gain US citizenship by navigating a complicated immigration process - all while trying to bring together his cultures and languages.\nMaking a show so closely tied to his life was \"very taxing\" because of \"the sheer amount of emotion\" involved.\n\"I'm extremely proud of it. I put my soul into it and I'm still hurting from making it,\" Mo says.\nThere was another challenge to navigate - when this second season would be set.\nThe final episode, which depicts Mo's visit to his family home in the West Bank, is set on 6 October 2023.\nThat's a day before the armed Palestinian group Hamas launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages.\nThis triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nAvoiding 7 October in the storyline was \"very intentional\", Mo says. \nThe show is ultimately \"grounded in comedy\", he says, and episodes set post-attack drew focus away from the storyline and the characters.\n\"You weren't really tracking them, the emotions of them,\" says Mo.\nMo says he wanted to keep the \"greater context\" in mind and that focusing on 7 October and its aftermath  \"almost insinuates this just started\".\n\"That couldn't be further from the truth,\" he says, referring to the long history of the conflict.\nThere was a practical consideration too, he says, due to the length of time between filming and release being over a year.\n\"That was kind of like scary territory to write about something, and then all these things would happen.\n\"And then whatever you had written and composed in the series could be irrelevant.\"\nThe show has broadly had a positive reception, with the finale being emotional for fans - and Mo.\nIt tracks the character's journey with his family to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and their experience of life there.\nFrom his perspective, it shows the complicated day-to-day issues Palestinians can face, such as being subjected to closer scrutiny at checkpoints controlled by Israeli soldiers.\nMo's character is also shown being tear-gassed.\nThe West Bank - land between Israel and the River Jordan - is home to an estimated three million Palestinians and half a million Jewish settlers.\nAlong with East Jerusalem and Gaza, it is part of what is widely known as the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\nIsrael occupied the areas in the 1967 Middle East war and built settlements, which are considered illegal under international law. Israel disputes this.\nPalestinians claim the areas for a future independent state and want all the settlements removed.\n\"I've gotten so many calls from people just completely in shambles after watching the last episode and how meaningful it was to them to watch,\" Mo says.\nHe adds it was \"not only Palestinians\" contacting him.\nMo says the final episode - originally 60 minutes long - was \"almost like we filmed a movie\" before it was eventually edited down to 39 minutes.\nHe says he wanted to cover \"the main strokes\", which included how difficult it can be to enter and live as a Palestinian once there.\n\"Immediately, you're not on vacation,\" he says. \"You're on edge, actually.\"\nMo feels there has generally been limited representation of Palestinians in TV and film, which means more pressure on his shoulders.\n\"There's a lot of [pressure] from the fans\u2026 more outside voices of what I should say and not say - both Palestinian and non-Palestinian,\" he says.\n\"You really have to put the blinders on and stay focused on telling the story that I know and that I've experienced first-hand.\"\nMo says he can't \"walk away\" from being seen as a spokesperson for Palestinians, admitting to feeling \"like public property at this point\".\n\"I think that everyone just needs to manage their expectations. But I'm not going to shy away from it,\" he says.\n\"Those that agree with me or disagree with me\u2026 it's important to continue the dialogue and have a conversation.\"\nThe ceasefire agreement in Gaza has provided some hope that there could be an end to fighting, but it has also felt fragile with concern that deal could collapse.\nMo says he is \"always hopeful\" things can get better.\n\"I never lose hope. \n\"If you do, then it becomes a really, really sad place whenever you're devoid of hope,\" he says.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

They are bad for business and worse for consumers,\" she said, warning the economic disruption put jobs at stake and would send prices higher. \n\"Nobody needs that \u2013 on both sides, neither in the European Union nor in the United States.\"\nTrump had said he wants to boost US steel and aluminium production in the longer run, but critics say in the immediate term the taxes on imports of the metals will raise prices for US consumers and dent economic growth.\nMajor packaged food makers including Quaker Oats and Folgers coffee asked Trump for targeted exemptions from tariffs on imports such as cocoa and fruit, according to a letter seen by Reuters.\nPepsiCo, Conagra and J M Smucker, also requested the president exempt ingredients not available from US sources in the letter, which was sent by the trade group the Consumer Brands Association.\nCoffee, oats, cocoa, spices, tropical fruit and tin mill steel, used for some food and household goods, are among the imports listed as unavailable domestically, Reuters reported.\nThe import taxes are also expected to reduce demand for steel and aluminium that is not made in the US - a blow to makers of the metals elsewhere. \nThe EU estimated that the latest US tariffs affect about 5% of its total exports to the US, while the US is the destination for roughly 90% of Canada's steel and aluminium exports.\nShares in the US were mixed on Wednesday, after two days of sharp decline.

She's probably one of the smartest businesswomen I've ever seen,\" Riley says. \nSwift is famously re-recording six albums after her former music manager Scooter Braun gained control of the master recordings.\nShe has said she saw it as a an act of aggression that \"stripped me of my life's work\". \nRiley said Swift's experiences showed her the importance of keeping the rights to her songs and gave her the confidence to explore other genres of music.\n\"You're na\u00efve when you're younger,\" says Riley, who was 11 when she was introduced to Swift's music by a school friend, inspiring her to write her own songs. \n\"You think 'I'll write the songs, I'll wear the dresses, I'll play on the stages and somebody else will handle the business aspect of things' but actually Taylor has shown me that's not the case.\"\nFollowing Swift's example, Riley worked hard and saved to produce her own music \"song by song, one by one\", while retaining the rights to them.\nSince starting her career at age 17, Riley has toured with fellow Scottish artists ili and Tide Lines.\nRecent trips to Nashville to collaborate and meet others in the industry have helped develop her career and the confidence to stay as an independent artist until the time is right.\n\"I used to hate the thought of being independent. It had a stigma attached that they're not good enough to get signed or they won't be able to do it,\" she says.\n\"When I realised what that word meant - that you don't need anyone and can accomplish things by yourself - I look back at my music that I've saved up song by song to produce, it was a ton of work but it's so worth it to see people listen to those songs.\"\nRiley's passion for music began after being introduced to artists like James Taylor and Joni Mitchell by her dad. Her grandmother gave her a book of poetry, leading her to write her own \"poems to a tune\".\nLike many teenagers, Riley enjoyed attending concerts but felt something different when she saw country artists perform.\n\"These country music gigs absolutely blew me away,\" she says.\n\"It had a hold on me and it made me realise I wanted to do that myself.\"\nRiley soon began to appreciate other country music artists - Ella Langley, Megan Moroney, Carter Faith and - to her, \"the Queen of everything\"- Kelsea Ballerini.\nFunding from charity Help Musicians was the key that allowed Riley to visit the country music city of Nashville and work on her new EP.\nThe EP even has nods to her hometown, mentioning Glasgow streets as well as a song dedicated to Maggie's Rock n Rodeo, a popular venue for country music fans.\n\"My song writing inspiration absolutely comes mixed from Glasgow and Nashville,\" she says.\n\"Glasgow feels a lot like Nashville to me. \n\"When I got to Nashville the first time, I phoned my mum and she asked how it was. I said it literally feels just like home.\"\nRiley is performing at King Tut's as part of the Country to Country festival on Sunday 16 March.",

Follow and listen on the BBC Sport website, app, 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds from 19:30 GMT on 15 March and from 18:00 on 16 March\nWhile negotiations aimed at reunifying men's golf grind to a halt, the PGA Tour is taking steps to speed up play.\nCommissioner Jay Monahan's state of the union news conference, before this week's Players Championship here at Sawgrass, made clear that eradicating slow play has become more of a priority than ever before for a circuit that has always indulged slowcoaches.\nBut this, the tour's marquee tournament, will again be played in the shadow of the ongoing split brought about by the arrival in 2022 of the breakaway LIV tour.\nThis year's Players will play out in the absence of the reigning US Open champion.  Last year the Masters winner was missing and in 2023 there was no title defence.\nThis, of course, is because Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith all play on LIV.\nTheir absence from the PGA Tour is felt more keenly this week than any other. The old debate as to whether the Players is the 'fifth' major is no longer relevant and will not be until the game reunifies.\nHere we have the most stark imperative for a deal to be done with LIV's Saudi backers.\nAn agreement, though, is not imminent. \nMonahan reiterated that no follow-up meetings are in the diary after the recent White House gathering with the Saudi Public Investment Fund's governor Yasir Al Rumayyan ended without settlement.\n\"We appreciate Yasir's innovative vision,\" Monahan said. \"And we can see a future where we welcome him on to our board and work together to move the global game forward.\n\"As part of our negotiations, we believe there's room to integrate important aspects of LIV Golf into the PGA Tour platform. We're doing everything that we can to bring the two sides together.\"\nMonahan added that while his organisation has \"removed some hurdles, others remain\". \nIn other words, something has to give to end the stalemate.\n'Hurdles' in PGA-LIV deal - but Trump 'bolstering' talks\nAnd no matter how hard the golf media tried, the commissioner flat-batted every enquiry as to how that might be achieved.  \nMonahan does not play verbal 'Bazball'; every non-answer dictated by the delicate nature of golf's future.\nWhere he was more forthcoming, was an acceptance - at long last - that men's professional golf has a problem with slow play.  It seems steps are being taken where the biggest offenders will start to be named and shamed.\n\"We've committed to addressing the speed of play,\" Monahan said as he announced working group recommendations that will be implemented to try to erase one of the sport's biggest blights.\n\"We will begin publishing speed-of-play-related statistics later this season,\" he added.  From 14 April testing will begin on the PGA Tour's feeder circuits to impose stroke penalties on the slowest golfers.\nMonahan also confirmed that the use of range finders will be allowed at tournaments between next month's Masters and the US PGA Championship in May to see whether this improves round times.\n\"We're listening to our fans and we're responding, and clearly this is something where they would like to see improvement,\" the commissioner said.\n\"I think there's a real commitment from players across the board to make certain that we're doing everything that we possibly can to improve, and these three steps are just a start.\"\nThis is a marked shift from an organisation that for decades insisted that slow play was not a problem. The rival LIV circuit has imposed stroke penalties on slowcoaches and now the PGA Tour is starting to respond.\n\"I look at this as a very positive development,\" Monahan insisted.\n\"I think it's pretty telling that when you've got six player directors that sit on our boards, and you've got 16 members of our Player Advisory Council, that there's a lot of shaking of heads and there's an understanding that this is an area where we need to improve.\"\nTwo-time major winner Collin Morikawa says publishing data that shows which players are quicker than others, thereby identifying the slowest, is a good idea. \n\"I don't know why you wouldn't want it to be released,\" said the 2021 Open winner.\n\"You just have to start giving guys actual penalties, whether it be strokes or FedExCup (point deductions). What I've learned is that monetary fines are useless.\"\nMorikawa added:  \"What is there to hide, right? If you're slow, you know you're slow. I mean, if you don't know, then there's an issue.\n\"To me, there's no issue with letting it out. It's only going to make things better because then you're either going to have a target on you, put a little more pressure and hopefully you pick it up, or you get penalised. It's very simple.\"\nDouble US PGA Championship winner Justin Thomas agrees that publicly revealing which players are the slowest will have a beneficial effect. \n\"Nobody wants to be known as that,\" said the US Ryder Cup star.\n\"I'm the first to admit I'm on the slow side of players. It bothers me, but I've talked to many officials about it, like I want to know why I'm slow because obviously the first thing that any slower player thinks is that they're not slow.\"\nFans will surely welcome such long-awaited initiatives to improve pace of play on the game's biggest tour.\nBut those awaiting some kind of resolution that brings the game back together are still left playing the waiting game.",

Follow and listen on the BBC Sport website, app, 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds from 19:30 GMT on 15 March and from 18:00 on 16 MarchWhile negotiations aimed at reunifying men's golf grind to a halt, the PGA Tour is taking steps to speed up play.Commissioner Jay Monahan's state of the union news conference, before this week's Players Championship here at Sawgrass, made clear that eradicating slow play has become more of a priority than ever before for a circuit that has always indulged slowcoaches.But this, the tour's marquee tournament, will again be played in the shadow of the ongoing split brought about by the arrival in 2022 of the breakaway LIV tour.This year's Players will play out in the absence of the reigning US Open champion. If you're slow, you know you're slow. Monahan does not play verbal 'Bazball'; every non-answer dictated by the delicate nature of golf's future.Where he was more forthcoming, was an acceptance - at long last - that men's professional golf has a problem with slow play.

        "article_text": "When Kajol contracted tuberculosis in January, USAID kept her alive. Now she and her family are in danger again after the Trump administration ordered most US aid spending to end.\nTB can be fatal if left untreated. The highly contagious bacterial disease, which usually infects the lungs, is not prevalent in rich countries, because treatment is relatively cheap. But in Bangladesh, it is a scourge.\nThat's especially so in neighbourhoods such as Mohammadpur, a slum in the capital Dhaka where Kajol,17, lives. \n\"We are poor people,\" she says. She is the sole breadwinner for herself, her mother and little brother. Her job in a garment factory keeps them all afloat.\nSo when she fell ill in January, it could have been catastrophic.\nInstead, help arrived through Dipa Halder. For the last three years, she has been canvassing the residents of Mohammadpur about TB and getting people the treatment they so desperately need, free of cost.\nThe initiative, which gets people tested and get them treatment they need including proper nutrition, is run by a local aid organisation, Nari Maitree. It was funded by the US Agency for International Aid (USAID) until February, when it received a letter from the US government saying the funds had been terminated.\nThat brought Kajol's treatment, only partially completed, to an abrupt end.\nCutting off medicines mid-treatment makes the chances of TB becoming drug-resistant much greater. It makes the disease much more difficult to combat and puts patients at greater risk of severe illness and death. \nThe government provides free medication but getting diagnosed and collecting the medicines can be cost prohibitive for many.\n\"Now I have to go get the medicine myself,\" she says. \"I am struggling a lot.\"\n\"The people here are quite vulnerable,\" says Dipa, 21. \"I can tell them to go to a particular doctor, which would help them save some money. \n\"Or I try to provide them with some financial assistance from our organisation so that they can continue their treatment.\"\nAccording to a US government performance report seen by the BBC, support by USAID in 2023 resulted directly in the identification and reporting of more than a quarter of a million new cases of TB in Bangladesh. In the same year, there were 296,487 new or relapse cases of TB which were cured or successfully completed as a result of USAID.\nThe agency was seen as integral to the country's fight against tuberculosis.\n\"You ask people on the street, they will say yeah, it's the US, they are the ones that are keeping it [tuberculosis] in control,\" said a director of a USAID project in Bangladesh, who is not authorised to speak publicly and did not want to be named.\n\"Bangladesh was USAID's largest programme in Asia,\" says Asif Saleh, executive director of the non-profit BRAC organisation. \"In terms of its impact, particularly in the healthcare sector, it has been massive.\n\"Particularly around vaccination, reducing child mortality and maternal mortality, USAID has played a massive role in this country.\"\nIn 2024, Bangladesh received $500m in foreign assistance. This year, that amount has cratered to $71m. To put that number into context, in the three-year period from 2021-2023, USAID committed an average of $83m annually in Bangladesh for health initiatives alone, including combating TB.\nCuts to USAID have meant Nari Maitree can no longer offer its Stop TB Program, but it also means Dipa is out of work. She supports her elderly parents and her younger sister.\n\"I am completely shattered now that I lost my job. I am carrying the burden of the family. Being unemployed is a devastating situation,\" she told the BBC.\nIn a document seen by the BBC, 113 programmes that were funded directly by the USAID office in Bangladesh have stopped. The list does not include the myriad programmes that are funded directly by US agencies in Washington.\n\"The NGO sector [In Bangladesh] employs 500,000 people at least,\" says Mr Saleh. \"It's huge. Thousands and thousands of jobs are going to be eliminated.\"\nIt's not just the United States that is moving away from foreign aid. The UK has announced cuts to its foreign assistance programmes, as has Switzerland. It is likely that other countries may follow suit.\nIt's a sobering reality for Bangladesh. The country's government was overthrown last year and the economy is shaky, with inflation near 10% and a jobs crisis, particularly among young people.\nInterim leader Muhammad Yunus says Bangladesh will come up with a new strategy on how to survive following the aid cuts \u2013 but doesn't say how.\nWhen pressed in a BBC interview on how the country will cover the shortfall from USAID, Yunus said: \"It was a small part, not a big deal. It doesn't mean Bangladesh will disappear from the map.\"\nAsif Saleh says the way the cuts have been implemented has been abrupt and chaotic. The impact on a country like Bangladesh is immeasurable.\nNowhere is that more clear than in Cox's Bazar, a coastal city in south-eastern Bangladesh, home to the world's largest refugee camp. More than one million Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority community that the United Nations calls victims of ethnic cleansing, fled violent purges in their home country, neighbouring Myanmar.\nUnable to go back home and unable to work outside the refugee camp, the Rohingya depend on international aid for their survival.\nThe United States contributed almost half of all aid to Rohingya refugees.\n\"We have run out of soap,\" says Rana Flowers, country representative for the UN children's agency Unicef. \"We are now having to truck water into the camps. It's an absolutely critical time. There is an outbreak of cholera with over 580 cases, along with a scabies outbreak.\"\nWater sanitation projects in the camps used to be funded by USAID.\nSince the order to stop work went into effect at the end of January, hospitals such as the International Red Cross hospital in Cox's Bazar are reduced to providing emergency assistance only. Any hope the money would be reinstated was crushed this week, when the Trump administration cancelled more than 80% of all the programmes at USAID.\n\nPatients like Hamida Begum, who was getting regular treatment for hypertension, are left with few options.\n\"I'm old and I don't have anyone to help me,\" she says. Her husband died last year, leaving her to care for her four children alone, including her 12-year-old daughter who cannot walk.\n\"I cannot go to another hospital far from home because of my daughter.\"\nAt a nearby UN food distribution centre, Rehana Begum is standing beside two large sacks.\nInside, she says, are six litres of cooking oil and 13kg of rice, along with basics such as onions, garlic and dried chillies. These rations, given to her by the World Food Programme (WFP), need to last her and her family a month.\nI ask how she will manage now that her rations will be cut in half beginning next month.\nShe looked shocked. Then she started to cry.\n\"How can we possibly survive with such a small amount?\" asks Rehana, 47, who shares one room with her husband and five children. \"Even now, it is difficult to manage.\"\nThe WFP says it was forced to make the drastic cut because of \"a critical funding shortfall for its emergency response operations\".\nThe rations now being allotted to the Rohingya community will only meet their basic daily dietary needs, igniting fears they will be left with just enough to live and not much more.\n\"This is an absolute disaster in the making,\" says Rana Flowers of Unicef. \"Desperate frustrated people within the camps will lead to security concerns. If that escalates to the degree it could, we won't be able to go into the camps to help.\"",

Myles Lewis-Skelly debut?\nWill Palace midfielder Adam Wharton be called up?\nTuchel has spoken to more than 55 players on the phone to \"build connections\"\nWill selection give any clues of a 4-2-3-1 formation or 3-4-2-1?\nWildcards: Ethan Nwaneri, Jamie Gittens, Liam Delap, Elliott Anderson\nFollow the BBC Sport's live page on Friday as the squad is announced, including a Tuchel news conference live stream.\nTuchel has planned his squad announcement for Friday to take into account the English players playing on Thursday in Europe for Manchester United, Tottenham and Chelsea.\nOver the past few weeks, Tuchel has spoken to more than 55 players individually on the phone, sources told BBC Sport. FA chief Mark Bullingham said Tuchel was \"building connections\".\nTuchel has been partly working remotely from Germany, although Bullingham clarified last week that Tuchel is based at St George's Park and living in London.\nThe England boss is often shown on TV cameras at Premier League matches and has travelled to Milan to watch Kyle Walker, Madrid to see Jude Bellingham and also been to Germany to watch England captain Harry Kane.\nTuchel's assistant Anthony Barry has also been to watch games individually and Tuchel has been at St George's Park between two to three days a week, with his backroom team planning next week's camp.\nLineker and Shearer defend England criticism after Kane comments\nTuchel making brilliant impact - FA chief Bullingham\nGiven Tuchel's job description has been underlined as an 18-month trophy quest, will he focus on experienced players he knows well to win now? Interim Lee Carsley's preference was to experiment with youth and prioritise the long-term development of the squad.\nEngland's established centre-back pairing of Harry Maguire and John Stones are both injured, with a younger crop of centre backs such as Marc Guehi, Levi Colwill and Jarrad Branthwaite in strong contention.\nBen White made himself unavailable for England selection after the World Cup in Qatar in 2022 when he left the squad but Tuchel has spoken to the Arsenal defender who can play both at right back and centre back. While Chelsea captain Reece James is also known and liked by Tuchel.\nJude Bellingham and Declan Rice are two near certainties to play for England in midfield with the third place up for grabs if Tuchel plays with a three-man midfield.\nKobbie Mainoo took that role at Euro 2024 but is currently injured, whilst Carsley introduced Angel Gomes, Morgan Gibbs-White and Curtis Jones during his interim time in charge.\nAnd Tuchel has been at Selhurst Park for their past two Premier League matches and Adam Wharton. The former Blackburn man was included in the Euro 2024 squad but did not play a minute, yet has impressed since coming back from injury and could be the 'number 6' that England are craving.\nRecord goalscorer Kane's England place was one of the biggest talking points of the summer. But any discussion of evolving away from the Bayern striker has disappeared with the appointment of his former boss Tuchel and Kane's 10 Champions League and 21 Bundesliga goals this season.\nUnusually for this squad, form and fitness means England's usual array of attacking talent is partly reduced.\nCole Palmer, Phil Foden and Jack Grealish are all out of form, Bukayo Saka and Noni Madueke are injured. They are competing with Anthony Gordon, Ollie Watkins and Morgan Rogers who are all having good periods. Could Aston Villa's Marcus Rashford, on loan from Manchester United, get a surprise recall?\nIn terms of formation, Tuchel has used both the 4-2-3-1 formation and a variation of 3-4-2-1, which he implemented at Chelsea in an impressively short amount of time for Champions League glory.\nHis sides can be described as pragmatic with an extremely high level of detail put onto each player. Not afraid of a direct style, his Bayern side knocked Arsenal out of last season's Champions League maximising long diagonal balls into pacey wingers for one v one situations.\nThe biggest clue as to whether Tuchel will play three at the back will be if six centre-backs options are chosen to cover the two games, rather than four or five, including versatile players like White. Another hint would be the inclusion of Crystal Palace's Tyrick Mitchell, who is playing as left wing-back under Oliver Glasner. \nThomas Tuchel at Crystal Palace v Ipswich in March\nSouthgate was criticised for his failed Luke Shaw fitness gamble in the summer and left-back remains a dilemma for Tuchel.\nIn-form Newcastle defender Lewis Hall - who was given his Chelsea debut by Tuchel - was nailed on, before being ruled out for the rest of the campaign with an injury.\nHowever, Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly has had an impressive breakthrough season despite actually being a midfielder at youth level.\nPalace defender Mitchell has not added to his two England caps since making his debut in 2022, but with Tuchel being a regular visitor to Selhurst Park, he may be an outside bet.\nThen there is Tottenham's Djed Spence, a right-footed left wing-back nominated for February's Premier League Player of the Month after finally getting a run of games under Ange Postecoglou.\nEthan Nwaneri - Arsenal's exciting 17-year-old has scored eight goals in 30 games in his debut season, and is attracting high praise from pundits, team-mates and his manager, Mikel Arteta.\nJamie Gittens - Another England youth international flourishing at Dortmund, the 20-year-old has four goals in 12 Champions League games this season\nLiam Delap - Tipped as a long-term Kane replacement as England's central striker, the 21-year-old Ipswich star has 10 Premier League goals despite his side's relegation fears.\nElliott Anderson - High-flying Nottingham Forest's 22-year-old midfielder has played for both England and Scotland at Under 21s level.\nTuchel: How did we get here so quickly and quietly?\nWhat challenges lie ahead for Tuchel?\nTuchel - a sacrifice of principle or best man for England job?",

        "article_text": "It has been five months since Jonas Eidevall unexpectedly decided to walk away from his position as Arsenal manager.\nNow the 42-year-old is looking forward to a new chapter in the United States as head coach of NWSL side San Diego Wave, with the season getting under way this weekend.\nEidevall tells BBC Sport about the reasons behind his Arsenal exit, why he has no regrets over letting record goalscorer Vivianne Miedema leave and the challenge facing him in the NWSL.\n'Shock' at Eidevall resignation but not his exit\nEidevall criticises 'amateurish behaviour' with fixture schedule\nDuring the Swede's three years at Arsenal he guided them to three consecutive top-three finishes but the closest they came to unseating Chelsea as Women's Super League champions came in his first campaign when they ended a point adrift of the Blues.\nHe claimed the club's first trophy in four years when they won the League Cup in 2023, and they retained it the following year, but further silverware eluded him.\nHis final game came against the side which had proved his biggest nemesis, Chelsea, as he oversaw a 2-1 defeat at the Emirates Stadium in front of increasingly disillusioned supporters.\n\"I thought the easiest quick fix in this moment here now is for me to step away,\" he says.\n\"It was extremely tough, both for me personally - my family of course - but also professionally. It's a privilege to be leading a club like Arsenal.\n\"It's very special when you're there, so an extremely difficult decision to make.\"\nThe departure of striker Miedema, who scored 125 goals and provided 50 assists in 172 appearances, to Manchester City during the summer had piled the pressure on Eidevall before the season had even begun.\nHe has previously spoken to Sky Sports, external about how he \"lost quite a lot of my relationship with the supporters\" when he decided not to renew Miedema's contract, so does he have any regrets?\n\"I don't. I think you always take the best decisions as you can make for the club at that point with the information that you know,\" he says.\n\"You can't rethink decisions based on new information that you could not have known at that time. That's not a helpful way of thinking about life. So no regrets. \n\"I do think that that decision was a big part in my relationship with the supporters [deteriorating].\n\"I never took any decision to be liked. I always took decisions because I felt they were the best for the club and for the team,\" adds Eidevall, who signed Spain World Cup winner Mariona Caldentey as a replacement.\n\"But the problem is when you take those decisions and you don't get the results then of course it very much spirals.\"\nStrong results did not materialise.\nThe north London club were sixth in the WSL after winning just one of their opening four games, while they suffered a demoralising 5-2 defeat at Bayern Munich in the Champions League three days before that defeat at home to Chelsea, where some fans could be seen clamouring for his sacking by waving P45 signs.\nSo, on the Monday after that match, Eidevall informed the club of his intention to step down.\nAsked whether the club were surprised, he says: \"Yeah I think so.\"\nYet it ended up being a quick process, explains Eidevall, who had not told the club he wanted to leave the next day, but that's when his departure was announced.\n\"They were onboard with that decision [to leave], which very much told me that if the club is onboard with that decision it's 100% the right decision to walk away,\" he adds.\n\"So that gave me that little bit extra sense of clarity in where we were at.\"\nWith time to reflect on his departure, he looks back on his spell in north London fondly, focusing on the \"immense growth\" the team went through off the pitch.\n\"Both my mission - and also the club's - was to make sure that Arsenal was back to the top of the women's game,\" he says.\n\"I think you can argue on a lot of levels right now Arsenal are that, with having the Emirates as the main home, having really, really good attendances both home and away, having much-improved facilities and staffing around the team, and having a team that has a better mix of youth and more experienced players.\n\"That part is really good, and I can see my part that I played in that.\"\nOn the pitch, he says that \"you can argue quite fairly\" that Arsenal were the second-best team in the UK behind Chelsea during his time as manager, if you take all the competitions into account.\n\"When you see the resources - with player salaries and other costs around the team - Chelsea are by far the biggest spender and it reasonable that they are also the best team,\" Eidevall says.\n\"To be above [Manchester] City and below Chelsea is probably a reasonable result to get from what was invested.\n\"Would I have liked to get a league title? Yes, very much. Then I would have been very, very happy with the results.\"\nEidevall was announced as the new San Diego Wave head coach in January, becoming the permanent replacement for former England captain Casey Stoney, who was sacked in June.\nHe says after leaving Arsenal \"there was quite a bit of interest immediately from various club teams and national teams\" and he spoke to a few different clubs, including San Diego.\nThe \"long-term vision\" at the Californian club really appealed to him, as well as the \"competitiveness\" of the NWSL itself.\nHowever, Eidevall is joining a league undergoing big changes,, external with this year the first time there will be no annual draft - making it the first major US professional sports league to abolish the draft system and aligning the competition closer to other women's football leagues around the world.\nHis club are also going through a period of transition having lost two of their biggest names - Naomi Girma to Chelsea and Alex Morgan to retirement - and they navigated the second-half of the season without a permanent coach.\nHe describes Girma as an \"irreplaceable player\" but says the defender was \"set on leaving\" before his arrival.\nYet despite the huge turnover of players at the club, he says the team's goal should still be \"to reach the play-offs\" at the end of the season.\n\"It feels like a complete rebuild to be honest,\" he says. \"That's the challenge but also the opportunity.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.\nMark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.\nHe had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.\nBut unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States. \nBut holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.\nAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.\nWith three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.\nThe son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. \nIn 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs. \n\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race. \n\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"\nIn 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.\nIn 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.\nAlthough central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. \nThat move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.\nHe is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.\nIn 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.\nInterest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.\nConfusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.\nUnlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.\nIn 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.\nBefore the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.\nIn the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.\nHe described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.\nThe Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.\nHis final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\". \nCarney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.\nFrom 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.\nHe was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.\nAlthough he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.\nAfter Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.\n\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said. \n\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"\nHe seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".\nThe Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.\n\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.\nThings changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.\nReports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.\nFreeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.\n\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\" \nStill, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. \nThe Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.\nThey have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament. \nHis team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.\nIn addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.\nHe is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\nOne of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.\nShortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.\nOn immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.\nHis biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US. \nThere are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre.

        "article_text": "Abercrombie & Fitch must pay for the legal fees of former CEO Mike Jeffries as he defends criminal charges of sex trafficking, a US court has ruled.\nThe fashion brand, which has previously said it was \"appalled and disgusted\" by Mr Jeffries' alleged conduct, had signed an agreement in 2014 when the ex-CEO resigned, covering him for the costs of any criminal proceedings which arose from his position.\nThe company had argued in court that the charges, which allege Mr Jeffries ran an international prostitution and sex trafficking business, related to his personal life and not his work.\nBut a judge found that the \"horrific\" charges, filed last year, were tied to his corporate role.\nThe court's ruling could have significant financial and legal ramifications for Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F) - a billion-dollar public company with more than 750 stores worldwide, including the Hollister brand. Legal experts told the BBC the bill for the company is likely to run into millions of dollars.\nThe decision also raises questions about why the company made the far-reaching indemnity agreement when Mr Jeffries stepped down more than a decade ago. The BBC has previously asked A&F about the circumstances surrounding this agreement, and if it had been aware of any allegations against Mr Jeffries at the time, but it declined to comment.\nMr Jeffries, who ran the retailer for 22 years, is currently on bail after pleading not guilty to the charges along with his British life partner, Matthew Smith, and their middleman in the alleged trafficking operation, James Jacobson.\nThe arrests followed a BBC investigation in 2023 that revealed Mr Jeffries and his partner were at the centre of a sophisticated operation scouting young men for sex in the US and abroad.\nRuling that Mr Jeffries' indemnification agreement does cover the criminal charges against him, Judge Paul Fioravanti said: \"In my view, Jeffries's conduct, as alleged in the indictment, as horrific as it is, has a causal connection to his official capacity and status as CEO of Abercrombie.\"\nThe criminal legal costs come in addition to fees in Mr Jeffries' civil cases, which A&F was ordered to pay last year on similar grounds.\nAlong with Mr Jeffries, A&F is defending multiple civil lawsuits from alleged victims, accusing the brand of having facilitated and funded his \"criminal enterprise\".\n\"Jeffries' legal fees will be millions of dollars when it's all said and done,\" said Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of West Coast Trial Lawyers.\nA former federal prosecutor and partner at Shihata & Geddes, Elizabeth Geddes, added: \"You'll have high-paid lawyers charging by the hour, especially if this leads to both a civil and criminal trial which can be expensive and time-consuming.\" \nCompanies can indemnify executives, even for criminal charges, she said, though this would typically be in cases of white-collar crime such as fraud and not sex trafficking.\nMr Rahmani said the Abercrombie & Fitch agreement was \"unique\" in its coverage of criminal conduct. \"Generally, criminal conduct is not something that you can insure for because it falls outside the scope of any company's business,\" he said.\nThe criminal charges against Mr Jeffries date from 2008 to 2015. He stepped down as chief executive of A&F in December 2014 after two decades in charge.\nUS prosecutors allege he had used his wealth, power and status as CEO \"to traffic men for his own sexual pleasure\" and for the pleasure of his partner, Mr Smith.\nA&F is not a defendant in the criminal case, but the latest ruling means it will now have to reimburse Mr Jeffries for legal fees dating back to 2023, as well as advance him funds for his ongoing defence.\nOn top of the legal fees of its former CEO, the company may also face further costs in civil cases it is defending if a court orders compensation to be paid out or both parties agree a settlement.\nDespite the severity of the allegations, the company has been reporting record sales, amounting to $4.95bn (\u00a33.84bn) in the past year.\n\"It doesn't appear as though A&F are at a detriment financially [in sales or share price] due to the lawsuits surrounding Mike Jeffries,\" said Heather Cucolo, a New York Law School professor.\nShe said it was interesting that the company appeared to have been able to \"spin\" or \"stifle some of the information that's out there\".\nFollowing the BBC's investigation, A&F opened an independent investigation and suspended $1m (\u00a3770,000) annual retirement payments to Mr Jeffries.\nIt added that new leadership has transformed the company, and it has \"zero tolerance for abuse, harassment or discrimination of any kind\".",

        "article_text": "Parents who don't want their children on Roblox should not let them use it, the chief executive of the gigantic gaming platform has said.\nThe site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.\nBut its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.\nWhen asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"\n\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.\nUS-based Roblox is one of the world's largest games platforms, with more monthly users than Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation combined. In 2024 it averaged more than 80 million players per day \u2013 roughly 40% of them below the age of 13. Its vast empire includes some 40 million user-generated games and experiences.\nIn the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.\nBut Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.\n\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.\n\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"\nPlayers who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.\nIn November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.\nHowever, the BBC was able to create two fake accounts, one aged 15 and one aged 27, on unlinked devices and exchange messages between the two.\nWhile the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.\nWhen we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.\n\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.\nHe admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.\nWe also put to him some Roblox game titles that the BBC has discovered were recommended by the platform to an 11 year-old recently, including:\nWhen we asked whether he thought they were appropriate, he said he puts his faith in the platform's age rating systems.\n\"One thing that's really important for the way we do things here, is it's not just on the title of the experience, it's literally on the content of the experience as well,\" he says.\nHe insists that when Roblox rates experience, they go through rigorous guidelines and that the company has a \"consistent policy\" on that.\nMr Baszucki founded the platform with Eric Cassel in 2004 and released it to the public in 2006 \u2013 a year before the first Apple iPhone appeared, heralding the start of the smartphone era.\nMr Baszucki describes his younger self as \"less of a gamer, and more of an engineer\", and the pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution. But they soon noticed that kids weren't only using the product to do their homework.\n\"They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox,\" he says.\nThe name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.\nMr Cassel noticed some players \"starting to act out\" and not always behaving in a \"civilised\" way a couple of months after it launched, recalls Mr Baszucki.\nHe says the roots of building a \"trust and safety system\" therefore began \"very, very early\" and that in those earlier days there were four people acting as safety moderators.\n\"It kind of is what launched this safety civility foundation,\" he adds.\nBut despite attracting decent numbers, it was a year later, when the firm launched its digital currency Robux, that it really started to make money.\nPlayers buy Robux and use it to purchase accessories and unlock content. Content creators now get 70% of the fee, and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.\nMr Baszucki says there was some initial resistance among the leadership team about Roblox becoming more than a hobby for its players, with the introduction of a digital economy.\nRobux stayed, and the firm is now worth $41bn (\u00a331bn).\nIts share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.\nMr Baszucki compares his experience of building Roblox with how Walt Disney may have felt about his creations.\nHe describes his job as \"a little like having the opportunity he had a long time ago when he was designing the Magic Kingdom\", and is focused on Roblox's ongoing evolution into a Metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form.\nThey have also been public in their ambitions to eventually attract 10% of the world's gamers.\nAsked to describe Roblox in three words, he replies: \"The future of communication.\"\nWe finish our time together playing a couple of his favourite games: Natural Disaster Survival and Dress to Impress.\nWe use his account and he's constantly recognised by other players \u2014 but we still get smashed to pieces by a blizzard outside the Natural Disasters mansion.\nAdditional reporting by Ammie Sekhon",

On Friday, Russia's state media quoted the air traffic monitor Flightradar as saying the plane believed to be carrying Witkoff had left Moscow.\nMoscow and Washington have not commented on the issue.\nLate on Thursday and overnight, both Russia and Ukraine reported new enemy drone attacks. \nUkraine said seven people - including children - were injured in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv.\nRussia reported a large fire at an oil facility in the southern city of Tuapse. \nSpeaking at a news conference in Moscow on Thursday, Putin said of the ceasefire proposal: \"The idea is right - and we support it - but there are questions that we need to discuss.\"\nA ceasefire should lead to \"an enduring peace and remove the root causes of this crisis\", Putin said. \n\"We need to negotiate with our American colleagues and partners,\" he said. \"Maybe I'll have a call with Donald Trump.\"\nPutin added: \"It will be good for the Ukrainian side to achieve a 30-day ceasefire.\n\"We are in favour of it, but there are nuances.\"\nOne of the areas of contention is Russia's western Kursk region, Putin said, where Ukraine launched a military incursion last August and captured some territory. \nHe claimed Russia was fully back in control of Kursk, and said Ukrainian troops there \"have been isolated\".\n\"They are trying to leave, but we are in control. Their equipment has been abandoned,\" Putin said.\n\"There are two options for Ukrainians in Kursk - surrender or die.\"\nUkraine's top commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said a day earlier that Ukrainian troops would hold defensive positions in the Kursk region \"as long as it is expedient and necessary\" despite \"increased\" pressure from Russian forces.\nAt Thursday's press conference, Putin also outlined some of his questions over how a ceasefire would work. He asked: \"How will those 30 days be used? For Ukraine to mobilise? Rearm? Train people? Or none of that? Then a question - how will that be controlled?\n\"Who will give the order to end the fighting? At what cost? Who decides who has broken any possible ceasefire, over 2,000km? All those questions need meticulous work from both sides. Who polices it?\"\nPutin \"doesn't say no directly\", Zelensky said in his nightly video address, but \"in practice, he's preparing a rejection\".\nHe added: \"Putin, of course, is afraid to tell President Trump directly that he wants to continue this war, wants to kill Ukrainians.\" \nThe Russian leader had set so many pre-conditions \"that nothing will work out at all\", Zelensky said. \nAfter Putin's remarks and Zelensky's response, there is now a clear divide between both sides' positions. \nUkraine wants a two-stage process: a quick ceasefire and then talks about a longer-term settlement. \nRussia believes you cannot separate the two processes and all the issues should be decided in a single deal. Both sides seem content to argue their differences. \nUkraine believes it can put pressure on Russia, painting it as a reluctant peacemaker, playing for time. Russia, equally, believes it has a chance now to raise its fundamental concerns, about Nato expansion and Ukraine's sovereignty. \nBut this presents a problem for Donald Trump. He has made it clear he wants a quick result, ending the fighting in days. \nAnd right now, Putin does not appear to want to play ball. \nSpeaking at the White House following Putin's remarks, Trump said he would \"love\" to meet the Russian leader and that he hoped Russia would \"do the right thing\" and agree to the proposed 30-day truce. \n\"We'd like to see a ceasefire from Russia,\" he said. \nSpeaking earlier at a meeting in the Oval Office with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump told reporters he had already discussed specifics with Ukraine.\n\"We've been discussing with Ukraine land and pieces of land that would be kept and lost, and all of the other elements of a final agreement,\" Trump said.\n\"A lot of the details of a final agreement have actually been discussed.\"\nOn the subject of Ukraine joining the Nato military alliance, Trump said \"everybody knows what the answer to that is\".\nThe fresh sanctions on Russian oil and gas came as the Trump administration further restricted access to US payment systems, making it harder for other countries to buy Russian oil.\nEarlier in the day, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov rejected the ceasefire proposal put forward by the US.\nOn Wednesday, the Kremlin released a video it said showed Putin visiting Russia's Kursk region, symbolically dressed in military fatigues. Russia later said it recaptured the key town of Sudzha.\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022, and now controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.\nMore than 95,000 people fighting for Russia's military have been killed in the war, according to data analysed so far and confirmed by the BBC. The actual death toll is believed to be much higher.\nRussia's military has not publicly revealed its battlefield casualties since September 2022, when it said 5,937 soldiers had been killed.\nUkraine last updated its casualty figures in December 2024, when Zelensky acknowledged 43,000 Ukrainian deaths among soldiers and officers. Western analysts believe this figure to be underestimated.",

        "article_text": "Thomas Tuchel's 18-month contract as England head coach started in January 2025\nEngland's new head coach Thomas Tuchel will name his first squad on Friday morning as the Three Lions prepare for the start of World Cup qualifying.\nEngland play Latvia and Albania on 21 and 24 March, and Tuchel has just seven international windows and roughly 450 days between now and the ultimate challenge of winning the 2026 World Cup.\nBBC Sport looks at some of the talking points around Tuchel's first announcement, including:\nForwards: Kane a definite but injuries and poor form limit attackers\nFull-backs: Ben White return? Myles Lewis-Skelly debut?\nWill Palace midfielder Adam Wharton be called up?\nTuchel has spoken to more than 55 players on the phone to \"build connections\"\nWill selection give any clues of a 4-2-3-1 formation or 3-4-2-1?\nWildcards: Ethan Nwaneri, Jamie Gittens, Liam Delap, Elliott Anderson\nFollow the BBC Sport's live page on Friday as the squad is announced, including a Tuchel news conference live stream.\nTuchel has planned his squad announcement for Friday to take into account the English players playing on Thursday in Europe for Manchester United, Tottenham and Chelsea.\nOver the past few weeks, Tuchel has spoken to more than 55 players individually on the phone, sources told BBC Sport. FA chief Mark Bullingham said Tuchel was \"building connections\".\nTuchel has been partly working remotely from Germany, although Bullingham clarified last week that Tuchel is based at St George's Park and living in London.\nThe England boss is often shown on TV cameras at Premier League matches and has travelled to Milan to watch Kyle Walker, Madrid to see Jude Bellingham and also been to Germany to watch England captain Harry Kane.\nTuchel's assistant Anthony Barry has also been to watch games individually and Tuchel has been at St George's Park between two to three days a week, with his backroom team planning next week's camp.\nLineker and Shearer defend England criticism after Kane comments\nTuchel making brilliant impact - FA chief Bullingham\nGiven Tuchel's job description has been underlined as an 18-month trophy quest, will he focus on experienced players he knows well to win now? Interim Lee Carsley's preference was to experiment with youth and prioritise the long-term development of the squad.\nEngland's established centre-back pairing of Harry Maguire and John Stones are both injured, with a younger crop of centre backs such as Marc Guehi, Levi Colwill and Jarrad Branthwaite in strong contention.\nBen White made himself unavailable for England selection after the World Cup in Qatar in 2022 when he left the squad but Tuchel has spoken to the Arsenal defender who can play both at right back and centre back. While Chelsea captain Reece James is also known and liked by Tuchel.\nJude Bellingham and Declan Rice are two near certainties to play for England in midfield with the third place up for grabs if Tuchel plays with a three-man midfield.\nKobbie Mainoo took that role at Euro 2024 but is currently injured, whilst Carsley introduced Angel Gomes, Morgan Gibbs-White and Curtis Jones during his interim time in charge.\nAnd Tuchel has been at Selhurst Park for their past two Premier League matches and Adam Wharton. The former Blackburn man was included in the Euro 2024 squad but did not play a minute, yet has impressed since coming back from injury and could be the 'number 6' that England are craving.\nRecord goalscorer Kane's England place was one of the biggest talking points of the summer. But any discussion of evolving away from the Bayern striker has disappeared with the appointment of his former boss Tuchel and Kane's 10 Champions League and 21 Bundesliga goals this season.\nUnusually for this squad, form and fitness means England's usual array of attacking talent is partly reduced.\nCole Palmer, Phil Foden and Jack Grealish are all out of form, Bukayo Saka and Noni Madueke are injured. They are competing with Anthony Gordon, Ollie Watkins and Morgan Rogers who are all having good periods. Could Aston Villa's Marcus Rashford, on loan from Manchester United, get a surprise recall?\nIn terms of formation, Tuchel has used both the 4-2-3-1 formation and a variation of 3-4-2-1, which he implemented at Chelsea in an impressively short amount of time for Champions League glory.\nHis sides can be described as pragmatic with an extremely high level of detail put onto each player. Not afraid of a direct style, his Bayern side knocked Arsenal out of last season's Champions League maximising long diagonal balls into pacey wingers for one v one situations.\nThe biggest clue as to whether Tuchel will play three at the back will be if six centre-backs options are chosen to cover the two games, rather than four or five, including versatile players like White. Another hint would be the inclusion of Crystal Palace's Tyrick Mitchell, who is playing as left wing-back under Oliver Glasner. \nThomas Tuchel at Crystal Palace v Ipswich in March\nSouthgate was criticised for his failed Luke Shaw fitness gamble in the summer and left-back remains a dilemma for Tuchel.\nIn-form Newcastle defender Lewis Hall - who was given his Chelsea debut by Tuchel - was nailed on, before being ruled out for the rest of the campaign with an injury.\nHowever, Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly has had an impressive breakthrough season despite actually being a midfielder at youth level.\nPalace defender Mitchell has not added to his two England caps since making his debut in 2022, but with Tuchel being a regular visitor to Selhurst Park, he may be an outside bet.\nThen there is Tottenham's Djed Spence, a right-footed left wing-back nominated for February's Premier League Player of the Month after finally getting a run of games under Ange Postecoglou.\nEthan Nwaneri - Arsenal's exciting 17-year-old has scored eight goals in 30 games in his debut season, and is attracting high praise from pundits, team-mates and his manager, Mikel Arteta.\nJamie Gittens - Another England youth international flourishing at Dortmund, the 20-year-old has four goals in 12 Champions League games this season\nLiam Delap - Tipped as a long-term Kane replacement as England's central striker, the 21-year-old Ipswich star has 10 Premier League goals despite his side's relegation fears.\nElliott Anderson - High-flying Nottingham Forest's 22-year-old midfielder has played for both England and Scotland at Under 21s level.\nTuchel: How did we get here so quickly and quietly?\nWhat challenges lie ahead for Tuchel?\nTuchel - a sacrifice of principle or best man for England job?",

But it was midnight in Washington DC when President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium took effect on major US trading partners.\nThe European Union was quick to respond.\n\"Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and worse for consumers,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\nThe EU's initial countermeasures will take effect on US products on 1 April, ranging from jeans and motorbikes to peanut butter and bourbon, just as they were with the Trump administration's first tariffs in 2018 and 2020.\n\nBut there will be more to come in mid-April.

But for businesses and some industries, especially steel, there is real danger.\nThe head of Germany's BGA federation of wholesale, foreign trade and service, Dirk Jandura, warned that Germans might have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for American products in the supermarkets.\nOrange juice, bourbon and peanut butter were the most likely products to be hit. \"Margins in trade are so low that this cannot be absorbed by the companies,\" he said.\nIn total, the EU will target \u20ac26bn (\u00a322bn) of US exports. \n\"We're not going to go into hypotheticals other than to say we've been preparing assiduously for all these outcomes,\" said EU spokesman Olof Gill.\nAnt\u00f3nio Costa, the EU's Council President, called on the US to de-escalate, although there was little sign of that on Wednesday, as Trump vowed to hit back at the EU's countermeasures.\n\"We've been abused for a long time and we will be abused no longer,\" he said.\nIn Austria too, there was concern about the escalation.\n\"The US is the second most important export market for Austrian products after Germany - and the most important for Germany,\" said  Christoph Neumayer, who is head of the Federation of Austrian Industries.

        "article_text": "Former Tate Modern director Vicente Todol\u00ed founded Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3 to preserve rare citrus varieties and compile a catalogue of farming knowledge to inspire future generations.\nOur preconceptions of lemons are very rarely challenged. But on a crisp November morning on Spain's leafy Valencian coastline, Vicente Todol\u00ed is showing me the secret side of citrus \u2013\u00a0and it's unlike anything I've seen on supermarket shelves.\nThe most weird and wonderful specimens are arranged on a table in his Sun-soaked orchard. There's one shaped like an octopus with fat tentacles, a wart-covered citron the size of a newborn baby and a colourful pear-shaped fruit splattered in a tie-dye of green and yellow.\u00a0\nThey're not at all what I was expecting, and they're not entirely safe, either. \"You will get burned,\" Todol\u00ed warns, pointing at a grass-greenbergamot. The oil is phototoxic, causing\u00a0 the skin to burn if it's exposed to UV light (it isn't dangerous to eat, but it is very acidic). \"Want to taste?\" he asks. I hold a slice up to the sun and eye it suspiciously; the golden segments light up like a stained-glass window. I tip my head back and squeeze drops into my mouth, being careful not to touch my lips. Eye-watering acidic needles stab my tongue. I'm reeling and wiping away tears, but Todol\u00ed is already on to the next fruit, squeezing the pearly contents of a finger lime into my hand. The little balls pop like lime-flavoured caviar in my mouth.\nThere are hundreds more unusual fruits to try at Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3, a not-for-profit farm dedicated to researching and preserving rare citrus varieties. Hidden on a sleepy street in the town of Palmera, this is Todol\u00ed's passion project. He was born and raised on this farm, going on to study art history before serving as director at esteemed galleries such as Tate Modern in London and Milan's Pirelli HangarBicocca, where he works today.\nNow, Todol\u00ed considers himself a fifth-generation orange farmer. He's fiercely protective of his old family farm, which is one of the reasons Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3 came to be. In 2010, a project was launched to raze Palmera's orange groves to make room for real estate. He tried to derail it through official channels and lost. \"I was called a romantic enemy of progress,\" he recalls. But Todol\u00ed did not desist. Changing tack, he began buying plots of land. Some were abandoned patches of weeds and others were established orchards. He acquired around 4.5 hectares in total, an impenetrable fortress of precious farmland. \"When I started it was a matter of urgency, I had to save the land,\" he says.\nAround the same time, Todol\u00ed was working as cultural advisor to Ferran Adri\u00e0, former head chef of the iconic (and sadly closed) El Bulli (once-billed as the world's best restaurant). One day, the pair visited a garden on the outskirts of Perpignan which had more than 400 types of citrus trees, some exceedingly rare. The south of France is a little too chilly for citrus, so the trees are planted in pots. In summer they bask outside, and in October the gardeners heave them into a greenhouse to keep warm. During their visit Todol\u00ed asked, \"How is it possible that they have done this amazing project with citrus, and in my area no one has done it?\" Adri\u00e0 replied: \"Why not do it yourself?\"\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nTodol\u00ed was inspired. He knew Palmera had the perfect microclimate for citrus; there would be no need for pots. Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3 is 3km from the sea and backed by a ripple of mountains. When the warm wind travels across the Mediterranean Sea, it becomes humid, and when it hits the mountains, it drops bathtubs of rain. The water trickles down the mountainside to Palmera, absorbing organic matter along the way. The fertile, nutrient-rich soil is known as alluvial soil, and Todol\u00ed is blessed with buckets of it.\nPalmera's crisp mornings also help to balance the flavour of fruit, Todol\u00ed explains. \"In January it's one or two degrees in the morning and around 20C in the afternoon. That's what creates the balance between acidity and sweetness. If you're in Florida, for example, it's too hot. They're sweeter but they're bland. In Japan, it's colder so they have more acidity. Here and Sicily are the perfect areas for citrus.\"\nPlan your trip:\nTours cost \u20ac15 for adults and \u20ac10 for children up to 15 and are available from around November to April (depending on when the fruit matures). Book at todolicitrusfundacio.org. The closest airport is Valencia Airport; it takes around an hour to drive from Valencia city centre to Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3.\u00a0\nFor inspiration, he turned to history's most illustrious citrus gardens. He studied the Italian gardens of the Medici family in the 1500s and opulent Arabic palaces like the Alhambra. \"For the Arabs, gardens appealed to the senses. It was a paradise on Earth, an immersive experience,\" says Todol\u00ed.\u00a0\nLikewise, the sights, smells and sounds of Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3 seduce visitors. Chirping locusts the size of frogs hop in the mallow and honeybees buzz between wildflowers. While licking sour juice from fingertips, there's a soundtrack of water trickling along an ancient Arabic irrigation route and the frenetic chirping of goldfinches in the aviary. The zesty scent of lemons perfumes visitors' hands for the rest of the day.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n\u2022\u00a0Spain's accidental tourist attraction\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\nThere are other farms nearby, but they don't look like this. The surrounding countryside is an orderly grid of single-crop fields, with rows upon rows of orange trees. Spain is the world's leading exporter of citrus, shipping around 4 million tonnes a year. In order to produce such vast quantities, most farms lean heavily on mono-cropping, which can leave soil depleted and plants more vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3, on the other hand, is a genetic diversity bank; a motley bunch of more than 500 varieties. Some of the rarest plants include ancient Valencian orange trees used as rootstock. The grafts were made around 150 years ago and Todol\u00ed cut the scion back to allow the roots to grow freely.\n\"It's like Jurassic Park,\" he says. \"We can see resurrected varieties that were in extinction.\"\nAs well as tours of the farm, the garden comes alive with events throughout the year. Poets read stanzas on a stage decorated with lemons at the annual Poec\u00edtrics festival (14 June 2025), while Cine de Vanguardia is a celebration of experimental cinema.\u00a0\nBack on the tour, and Todol\u00ed's right-hand man Ton Gjekaj is waiting at the final tasting table. He has cut the last slices of fruit. There are wedges of passionfruit-tasting trifoliate orange, apple-sour calamansi and rosewater-scented Palestinian sweet lime, still warm from the Sun. I greedily eat them all, popping whole carpels into my mouth. I try to jot down the flavours but by now my notepad is covered in juice, my camera's buttons sticky.\nThere's just time to peep inside The Laboratory, a high-tech kitchen and library. This is a hub of experimentation, used by experts from around the world who come to play with Todol\u00ed's extraordinary pantry. Chefs make ice cream from bergamots; bartenders pickle lemon rind for gin and tonics; and perfumiers extract oils from nearly extinct oranges.\nAgustina Basilico Miara, head of beverage at London's Toklas restaurant, has visited three times and says she always goes home with new ideas. \"It's incredible. Every time we go, we take as many people as possible from the restaurant,\" Miara says. \"Especially after being in cloudy London, to arrive in an explosion of colours is super inspiring.\"\nMiara uses leftover peel from the kitchen (like fragrant blood orange and chandler red pomelo) to make a tea, which she turns into a syrup. She uses it for a variety of cocktails, like her zingy take on the classic whisky highball. \"We've also done a martini with chinotto. The vodka is infused with chinotto and then we candy the fruit,\" Miara says. \"It adds another layer, like an olive brine element to the flavour, it's very aromatic.\"\u00a0\nAfter flicking through some books (every mention of citrus has been bookmarked, resulting in a pleasing rainbow of Post-it notes along the spines) we conclude the tour by tasting marmalade. The most delicious is made from Borneo lemon \u2013 not technically a lemon, but a cross between a pomelo and a key lime. Delicate and creamy, the marmalade tastes like well-balanced lemon curd.\nFor Todol\u00ed, this open-air gallery is his legacy. It's a place to challenge preconceptions, encourage biodiversity and foster local culture. \"For me, it's like a museum where you don't have to refresh the collection because it changes every day,\" he says. \"People think that citrus is what they see in the supermarkets. They don't know that it started eight million years ago, that it's one of the oldest fruits in the world. It has been so important in literature, poetry and art.\"\nTodol\u00ed can see the art of citrus \u2013\u00a0and from his otherworldly orchard, he's helping the rest of the world to see it too.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

The M23 has talked about advancing west in a bid to seize the capital, Kinshasa, even though it is 1,600km (1,000 miles) away.\nGiven the dangers, it is not surprising that President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi might be looking at ways to shore up his position.\nOn 22 February, Tshisekedi was reported by the New York Times to have said that the Trump administration had shown interest in a deal involving strategic minerals.\nThe day before, the Africa-USA Business Council - a lobby group - wrote to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on behalf of a Congolese senator describing a possible deal that included an \"economic and military partnership\".\nDR Congo is estimated to have $24tn-worth (\u00a319tn) of untapped resources - including cobalt, gold and copper.\nThe country is currently the world's largest supplier of cobalt - which has defence and aerospace applications as well as being essential for batteries in electric vehicles - but most of this goes to China.

She says he was shot dead by the gunmen who abducted him.\nDalaal is from Syria's Alawite minority sect, which was targeted in a surge of sectarian violence since last week.\n\"Everyone knew he had diabetes and anaemia disorder, and he was just doing his best to get by.\"\nThe BBC team found Dalaal seeking refuge alongside thousands of other people in a remote Russian airbase in the country's western coastal region.\nA war monitoring group says that more than 1,400 civilians have been killed since 6 March - most of them Alawites - in Latakia and the neighbouring provinces of Tartous, Hama and Homs.\nDalaal is one of the few people willing to talk to us about what happened.\nLast week, security forces launched an operation in the region, in response to a growing insurgency by fighters loyal to deposed president Bashar al-Assad - an Alawite whose regime was dominated by members of the sect.\nThe violence escalated after 13 security personnel were killed in an ambush by gunmen in the coastal town of Jableh.\nGunmen loyal to the Sunni Islamist-led government which replaced Assad have been accused of carrying out revenge killings in predominantly Alawite communities following the attack.\nEntire families, including women and children, were killed over the next four days, according to the United Nations human rights office.\nOn Wednesday, a spokesman told reporters that the UN had so far verified the killing of 111 civilians, but that the actual figure was believed to be significantly higher.\nMany of the cases were summary executions, he added.\nOn the highway, our team found a car riddled with bullets.\nIt is unknown how many people died in it, nor their backgrounds.\nBut it is hard to imagine that anyone inside survived.\nThe coastal highway has been secured and cleared after an attack by those described by officials as remnants of the former regime. The attack was  followed by acts of revenge against members of the Alawite sect.\nBut our team saw dozens of bodies still scattered among the bushes and in mass graves, during a tour accompanied by fighters affiliated with the Syrian Ministry of Defence.\nSecurity sources told the BBC that the Assad loyalists behind the attack in Jableh were not all killed.\nInstead, they managed to retreat into the nearby mountains when security forces deployed large numbers of reinforcements from across the country.\n\"They are all from these villages,\" said Mahmoud al-Haik, a soldier in the new government's defence ministry, who has been stationed in Baniyas in the Latakia countryside.\n\n\"Everyone involved in what happened - they belonged to these communities. But now, they have all left the area.\n\"The area was in complete chaos. But, thank God, we managed to regain control. People started returning to their homes, and now, many are calling for the rest to be allowed to come back.\"\nMost of the villages in the area are still abandoned.\nFearing sectarian killings, residents fled to the mountains, where they have been sleeping in open areas for a week.\nIn a village on the outskirts of Baniyas, our team came across a small group of men who had cautiously returned to check on their homes and shops.\nAlawite Wafiq Ismail said he was there when the attack took place, but he would not go into detail.\n\"Brother, I really can't say anything about it. I don't know. That's it... May God keep us safe from harm.\"\nIn the countryside of Latakia, the Syrian security forces' control ends, and the boundaries of the Russian military's Hmeimim airbase begin.\nThousands of Alawite families have taken refuge in this base to escape attacks by various Syrian factions. They are living in very harsh conditions.\nIt is where Dalaal says her son was killed. Others there told us similar stories.\nMost of the families have lost someone: a son, a relative, or a neighbour.\nAnother Alawite woman told us: \"We need international protection from what we're going through. We left our homes, we left everything, our livelihoods, and we came here.\"\nVery few details have been revealed regarding last Thursday's attack and its significant sectarian repercussions. These were acknowledged by Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, who led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad in December.\nSharaa has promised to hold the perpetrators accountable, even if they are among his allies, saying that \"we won't accept that any blood be shed unjustly\".\nHowever, few believe that that the wound caused by these events in the already heavily scarred Syrian body will heal easily.",

        "article_text": "During his election campaign last year, Donald Trump promised Americans he would usher in a new era of prosperity.\nNow two months into his presidency, he's painting a slightly different picture. \nHe has warned that it will be hard to bring down prices and the public should be prepared for a \"little disturbance\" before he can bring back wealth to the US.\nMeanwhile, even as the latest figures indicate inflation is easing, analysts say the odds of a downturn are increasing, pointing to his policies.\nSo is Trump about to trigger a recession in the world's largest economy?\nIn the US, a recession is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.\nA chorus of economic analysts have warned in recent days that the risks of such a scenario are rising. \nA JP Morgan report put the chance of recession at 40%, up from 30% at the start of the year, warning that US policy was \"tilting away from growth\", while Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, upped the odds from 15% to 35%, citing tariffs. \nThe forecasts came as the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US sank sharply. It has now fallen to its lowest level since September in a sign of fears about the future.\nThe market turmoil is being driven partly by concerns about new taxes on imports, called tariffs, which Trump has introduced since he took office.\nHe has hit products from America's three biggest trade partners with the new duties, and threatened them more widely in moves that analysts believe will increase prices and curb growth.\nThe latest official inflation figures in the US showed the rate of price increases cooling in February, however. \nPrices were up 2.8% over the 12 months to February, down from 3% in January, the Labor Department said.  \nStill, Trump and his economic advisers have been warning the public to be prepared for some economic pain, while appearing to dismiss the market concerns - a marked change from his first term, when he frequently cited the stock market as a measure of his own success. \n\"There will always be changes and adjustments,\" he said last week, in response to pleas from businesses for more certainty. \nThe posture has increased investor worries about his plans. \nGoldman Sachs last week raised its recession bets from 15% to 20%, saying it saw policy changes as \"the key risk\" to the economy. But it noted that the White House still had \"the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious\". \n\"If the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data, recession risk would rise further,\" the firm's analysts warned. \n\nFor many firms, the biggest question mark is tariffs, which raise costs for US businesses by putting taxes on imports. As Trump unveils tariff plans, many companies are now facing lower profit margins, while holding off on investments and hiring as they try to figure out what the future will look like. \nInvestors are also worried about big cuts to the government workforce and government spending.\nBrian Gardner, chief of Washington policy strategy at the investment bank Stifel, said businesses and investors had thought Trump intended tariffs as a negotiating tool. \n\"But what the president and his cabinet are signalling is actually a bigger deal. It's a restructuring of the American economy,\" he said. \"And that's what's been driving markets in the last couple of weeks.\"\nThe US economy was already undergoing a slowdown, engineered in part by the central bank, which has kept interest rates higher to try to cool activity and stabilise prices.\nIn recent weeks, some data suggests a more rapid weakening.\nRetail sales fell in February, confidence - which had popped after Trump's election on several surveys of consumers and businesses - has fallen, and companies including major airlines, retailers such as Walmart and Target, and manufacturers are warning of a pullback.\nSome analysts are worried a drop in the stock market could trigger a further clampdown in spending, especially among higher income households.\nThat could deliver a major hit to the US economy, which is driven by consumer spending and has grown increasingly dependent on those richer households, as lower income families face pressure from inflation. \n\nThe head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, offered assurances in a speech last week, noting that sentiment had not been a good indicator of behaviour in recent years.\n\"Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,\" he said.\nBut the US economy is currently deeply linked to the rest of the world, warned Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.\n\"The fact that tariffs could disrupt that at the same time that there were signs that the US economy was weakening anyway ... is really fuelling recession fears,\" she says. \nThe unease in the stock market isn't all about Trump. \nInvestors were already jittery about the possibility of a correction, after big gains over the last two years, driven by the sharp run-up in tech stocks fuelled by investor optimism about artificial intelligence (AI).\nChipmaker Nvidia, for example, saw its share price jump from less than $15 at the start of 2023 to nearly $150 in November of last year.\nThat type of rise had stirred debate about an \"AI bubble\" - with investors on high alert for signs of it bursting, which would have a big impact on the stock market, regardless of the dynamics in the wider economy. \nNow, with views of the US economy darkening, optimism about AI is getting even harder to sustain.\nTech analyst Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management wrote on social media this week that his optimism had \"taken a step back\" as the chance of a recession increased \"measurably\" over the past month.\n\"The bottom line is that if we enter a recession, it will be extremely difficult for the AI trade to continue,\" he said. \nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Former Tate Modern director Vicente Todol\u00ed founded Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3 to preserve rare citrus varieties and compile a catalogue of farming knowledge to inspire future generations.\nOur preconceptions of lemons are very rarely challenged. But on a crisp November morning on Spain's leafy Valencian coastline, Vicente Todol\u00ed is showing me the secret side of citrus \u2013\u00a0and it's unlike anything I've seen on supermarket shelves.\nThe most weird and wonderful specimens are arranged on a table in his Sun-soaked orchard. There's one shaped like an octopus with fat tentacles, a wart-covered citron the size of a newborn baby and a colourful pear-shaped fruit splattered in a tie-dye of green and yellow.\u00a0\nThey're not at all what I was expecting, and they're not entirely safe, either. \"You will get burned,\" Todol\u00ed warns, pointing at a grass-greenbergamot. The oil is phototoxic, causing\u00a0 the skin to burn if it's exposed to UV light (it isn't dangerous to eat, but it is very acidic). \"Want to taste?\" he asks. I hold a slice up to the sun and eye it suspiciously; the golden segments light up like a stained-glass window. I tip my head back and squeeze drops into my mouth, being careful not to touch my lips. Eye-watering acidic needles stab my tongue. I'm reeling and wiping away tears, but Todol\u00ed is already on to the next fruit, squeezing the pearly contents of a finger lime into my hand. The little balls pop like lime-flavoured caviar in my mouth.\nThere are hundreds more unusual fruits to try at Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3, a not-for-profit farm dedicated to researching and preserving rare citrus varieties. Hidden on a sleepy street in the town of Palmera, this is Todol\u00ed's passion project. He was born and raised on this farm, going on to study art history before serving as director at esteemed galleries such as Tate Modern in London and Milan's Pirelli HangarBicocca, where he works today.\nNow, Todol\u00ed considers himself a fifth-generation orange farmer. He's fiercely protective of his old family farm, which is one of the reasons Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3 came to be. In 2010, a project was launched to raze Palmera's orange groves to make room for real estate. He tried to derail it through official channels and lost. \"I was called a romantic enemy of progress,\" he recalls. But Todol\u00ed did not desist. Changing tack, he began buying plots of land. Some were abandoned patches of weeds and others were established orchards. He acquired around 4.5 hectares in total, an impenetrable fortress of precious farmland. \"When I started it was a matter of urgency, I had to save the land,\" he says.\nAround the same time, Todol\u00ed was working as cultural advisor to Ferran Adri\u00e0, former head chef of the iconic (and sadly closed) El Bulli (once-billed as the world's best restaurant). One day, the pair visited a garden on the outskirts of Perpignan which had more than 400 types of citrus trees, some exceedingly rare. The south of France is a little too chilly for citrus, so the trees are planted in pots. In summer they bask outside, and in October the gardeners heave them into a greenhouse to keep warm. During their visit Todol\u00ed asked, \"How is it possible that they have done this amazing project with citrus, and in my area no one has done it?\" Adri\u00e0 replied: \"Why not do it yourself?\"\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nTodol\u00ed was inspired. He knew Palmera had the perfect microclimate for citrus; there would be no need for pots. Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3 is 3km from the sea and backed by a ripple of mountains. When the warm wind travels across the Mediterranean Sea, it becomes humid, and when it hits the mountains, it drops bathtubs of rain. The water trickles down the mountainside to Palmera, absorbing organic matter along the way. The fertile, nutrient-rich soil is known as alluvial soil, and Todol\u00ed is blessed with buckets of it.\nPalmera's crisp mornings also help to balance the flavour of fruit, Todol\u00ed explains. \"In January it's one or two degrees in the morning and around 20C in the afternoon. That's what creates the balance between acidity and sweetness. If you're in Florida, for example, it's too hot. They're sweeter but they're bland. In Japan, it's colder so they have more acidity. Here and Sicily are the perfect areas for citrus.\"\nPlan your trip:\nTours cost \u20ac15 for adults and \u20ac10 for children up to 15 and are available from around November to April (depending on when the fruit matures). Book at todolicitrusfundacio.org. The closest airport is Valencia Airport; it takes around an hour to drive from Valencia city centre to Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3.\u00a0\nFor inspiration, he turned to history's most illustrious citrus gardens. He studied the Italian gardens of the Medici family in the 1500s and opulent Arabic palaces like the Alhambra. \"For the Arabs, gardens appealed to the senses. It was a paradise on Earth, an immersive experience,\" says Todol\u00ed.\u00a0\nLikewise, the sights, smells and sounds of Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3 seduce visitors. Chirping locusts the size of frogs hop in the mallow and honeybees buzz between wildflowers. While licking sour juice from fingertips, there's a soundtrack of water trickling along an ancient Arabic irrigation route and the frenetic chirping of goldfinches in the aviary. The zesty scent of lemons perfumes visitors' hands for the rest of the day.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n\u2022\u00a0Spain's accidental tourist attraction\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\nThere are other farms nearby, but they don't look like this. The surrounding countryside is an orderly grid of single-crop fields, with rows upon rows of orange trees. Spain is the world's leading exporter of citrus, shipping around 4 million tonnes a year. In order to produce such vast quantities, most farms lean heavily on mono-cropping, which can leave soil depleted and plants more vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3, on the other hand, is a genetic diversity bank; a motley bunch of more than 500 varieties. Some of the rarest plants include ancient Valencian orange trees used as rootstock. The grafts were made around 150 years ago and Todol\u00ed cut the scion back to allow the roots to grow freely.\n\"It's like Jurassic Park,\" he says. \"We can see resurrected varieties that were in extinction.\"\nAs well as tours of the farm, the garden comes alive with events throughout the year. Poets read stanzas on a stage decorated with lemons at the annual Poec\u00edtrics festival (14 June 2025), while Cine de Vanguardia is a celebration of experimental cinema.\u00a0\nBack on the tour, and Todol\u00ed's right-hand man Ton Gjekaj is waiting at the final tasting table. He has cut the last slices of fruit. There are wedges of passionfruit-tasting trifoliate orange, apple-sour calamansi and rosewater-scented Palestinian sweet lime, still warm from the Sun. I greedily eat them all, popping whole carpels into my mouth. I try to jot down the flavours but by now my notepad is covered in juice, my camera's buttons sticky.\nThere's just time to peep inside The Laboratory, a high-tech kitchen and library. This is a hub of experimentation, used by experts from around the world who come to play with Todol\u00ed's extraordinary pantry. Chefs make ice cream from bergamots; bartenders pickle lemon rind for gin and tonics; and perfumiers extract oils from nearly extinct oranges.\nAgustina Basilico Miara, head of beverage at London's Toklas restaurant, has visited three times and says she always goes home with new ideas. \"It's incredible. Every time we go, we take as many people as possible from the restaurant,\" Miara says. \"Especially after being in cloudy London, to arrive in an explosion of colours is super inspiring.\"\nMiara uses leftover peel from the kitchen (like fragrant blood orange and chandler red pomelo) to make a tea, which she turns into a syrup. She uses it for a variety of cocktails, like her zingy take on the classic whisky highball. \"We've also done a martini with chinotto. The vodka is infused with chinotto and then we candy the fruit,\" Miara says. \"It adds another layer, like an olive brine element to the flavour, it's very aromatic.\"\u00a0\nAfter flicking through some books (every mention of citrus has been bookmarked, resulting in a pleasing rainbow of Post-it notes along the spines) we conclude the tour by tasting marmalade. The most delicious is made from Borneo lemon \u2013 not technically a lemon, but a cross between a pomelo and a key lime. Delicate and creamy, the marmalade tastes like well-balanced lemon curd.\nFor Todol\u00ed, this open-air gallery is his legacy. It's a place to challenge preconceptions, encourage biodiversity and foster local culture. \"For me, it's like a museum where you don't have to refresh the collection because it changes every day,\" he says. \"People think that citrus is what they see in the supermarkets.

        "article_text": "Cases of the incredibly contagious measles virus are continuing to rise in Texas and across the US as the nation's top health official promotes treatments not supported by health experts. \nTo date this year, the US has recorded more than 250 measles cases across several states, including Oklahoma, Alaska, California, Georgia, Florida, New York, Kentucky and Rhode Island. \nThe epicentre remains in western Texas and neighbouring New Mexico, where two unvaccinated people have died from the virus. \nIt comes as Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy, Jr continues to focus on unproven treatments like cod liver oil, and his casting doubt on the safety of the vaccines. \nThe BBC has contacted the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for comment.\nMeasles is a dangerous virus that has no cure and can lead to a host of complications, including pneumonia and brain swelling. It can be deadly. \nVaccination rates must be 95% or higher for the broader population to be protected, but several communities where the virus is spreading have rates well below that.\nThe US declared measles eliminated in 2000, but outbreaks have continued to crop up in recent years as anti-vaccine sentiments have grown. \nHealth officials say cases have shown no signs of slowing down in western Texas, where two pregnant women recently reported infections. \nAcross the state's border, New Mexico now has more than 30 cases, while new infections have been confirmed in Oklahoma, New York and in Los Angeles this week.  \nIn several instances, unvaccinated Americans have spread measles to others after contracting the virus outside of the country, including on Long Island in New York, where a baby caught the virus while traveling with family, health officials say. \nCases are also on the rise in Canada, which has reported 146 infections. \nKennedy has so far offered mixed messages about the outbreaks. \nAt first, he suggested the rising cases were \"not unusual\" for the US, before backtracking and calling the situation \"serious\".\nThen, this week, in an interview with Fox News, Kennedy suggested cod liver oil and other alternative measles treatments had proven \"miraculous\". \nThe remarks are resonating with some residents in western Texas, said Ron Cook, a family physician and health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak in Lubbock, where a child died of measles this month. \nThere, a handful of physicians are handing out cod liver oil to parents of sick children who are sceptical of measles immunizations, Dr Cook said. One physician told NBC News he was just trying to help families with the alternative treatment \"like Bobby Kennedy is trying to do\". \nVitamin A - a nutrient found in cod liver oil - is sometimes offered as a part of a treatment for measles, especially if someone is deficient, Dr Cook said. But, he added, it is difficult to monitor the levels of the vitamin in cod liver oil, which could endanger children if they are given too much of the vitamin or other nutrients it contains. \n\"What disappoints me the most is that they're not talking about the vaccine,\" Dr Cook said.\nHe said he believed that it was a missed opportunity to engage with vaccine-sceptical communities to help slow the spread of measles.\nKennedy, this week, offered a conditional endorsement of the vaccine, telling Fox News it was \"recommended\" for the Texas Mennonite community - the origin of the outbreak - while also suggesting some of the children had been harmed by the vaccines, which have been thoroughly studied and found to be safe. \nThis week, the Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine nonprofit that Kennedy founded, updated and re-promoted a 2021 book in which Kennedy called measles vaccines \"risky\". \n\"Measles outbreaks have been fabricated to create fear that in turn forces government officials to 'do something,'\" he said, adding that benefits of the vaccine had been \"exaggerated\".

        "article_text": "Parents who are worried about their children being on Roblox should not let them use it, the chief executive of the gigantic gaming platform has said.\nThe site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.\nBut its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.\nWhen asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"\n\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.\nResponding to the interview, Mumsnet boss Justine Roberts said parents on the forum had spoken of how they struggled to manage their children's use of Roblox.\n\"There are parental controls, and our users would urge constant parental supervision,\" she told the BBC.\n\"But we all know that with the best will in the world life sometimes gets in the way. \n\"If you've got multiple children you're looking after and things happen, and you probably can't 24/7 watch everything they're doing, even if you've got all your parental controls set.\"\nEllie Gibson - from the Scummy Mummies podcast - said Mr Baszucki's message risked sounding \"a bit of a get out\".\n\"It's much easier said than done, especially when all their friends are playing it,\" she told the BBC.\nUS-based Roblox is one of the world's largest games platforms, with more monthly users than Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation combined. In 2024 it averaged more than 80 million players per day \u2013 roughly 40% of them below the age of 13. Its vast empire includes some 40 million user-generated games and experiences.\nIn the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.\nBut Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.\n\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.\n\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"\nPlayers who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.\nIn November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.\nHowever, the BBC was able to create two fake accounts, one aged 15 and one aged 27, on unlinked devices and exchange messages between the two.\nWhile the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.\nWhen we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.\n\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.\nHe admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.\nWe also put to him some Roblox game titles that the BBC has discovered were recommended by the platform to an 11 year-old recently, including:\nWhen we asked whether he thought they were appropriate, he said he puts his faith in the platform's age rating systems.\n\"One thing that's really important for the way we do things here, is it's not just on the title of the experience, it's literally on the content of the experience as well,\" he says.\nHe insists that when Roblox rates experience, they go through rigorous guidelines and that the company has a \"consistent policy\" on that.\nMr Baszucki founded the platform with Eric Cassel in 2004 and released it to the public in 2006 \u2013 a year before the first Apple iPhone appeared, heralding the start of the smartphone era.\nMr Baszucki describes his younger self as \"less of a gamer, and more of an engineer\", and the pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution. But they soon noticed that kids weren't only using the product to do their homework.\n\"They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox,\" he says.\nThe name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.\nMr Cassel noticed some players \"starting to act out\" and not always behaving in a \"civilised\" way a couple of months after it launched, recalls Mr Baszucki.\nHe says the roots of building a \"trust and safety system\" therefore began \"very, very early\" and that in those earlier days there were four people acting as safety moderators.\n\"It kind of is what launched this safety civility foundation,\" he adds.\nBut despite attracting decent numbers, it was a year later, when the firm launched its digital currency Robux, that it really started to make money.\nPlayers buy Robux and use it to purchase accessories and unlock content. Content creators now get 70% of the fee, and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.\nMr Baszucki says there was some initial resistance among the leadership team about Roblox becoming more than a hobby for its players, with the introduction of a digital economy.\nRobux stayed, and the firm is now worth $41bn (\u00a331bn).\nIts share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.\nMr Baszucki compares his experience of building Roblox with how Walt Disney may have felt about his creations.\nHe describes his job as \"a little like having the opportunity he had a long time ago when he was designing the Magic Kingdom\", and is focused on Roblox's ongoing evolution into a Metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form.\nThey have also been public in their ambitions to eventually attract 10% of the world's gamers.\nAsked to describe Roblox in three words, he replies: \"The future of communication.\"\nWe finish our time together playing a couple of his favourite games: Natural Disaster Survival and Dress to Impress.\nWe use his account and he's constantly recognised by other players \u2014 but we still get smashed to pieces by a blizzard outside the Natural Disasters mansion.\nAdditional reporting by Ammie Sekhon\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the biggest developments in global technology, with analysis from BBC correspondents around the world.

        "article_text": "Former Tate Modern director Vicente Todol\u00ed founded Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3 to preserve rare citrus varieties and compile a catalogue of farming knowledge to inspire future generations.\nOur preconceptions of lemons are very rarely challenged. But on a crisp November morning on Spain's leafy Valencian coastline, Vicente Todol\u00ed is showing me the secret side of citrus \u2013\u00a0and it's unlike anything I've seen on supermarket shelves.\nThe most weird and wonderful specimens are arranged on a table in his Sun-soaked orchard. There's one shaped like an octopus with fat tentacles, a wart-covered citron the size of a newborn baby and a colourful pear-shaped fruit splattered in a tie-dye of green and yellow.\u00a0\nThey're not at all what I was expecting, and they're not entirely safe, either. \"You will get burned,\" Todol\u00ed warns, pointing at a grass-greenbergamot. The oil is phototoxic, causing\u00a0 the skin to burn if it's exposed to UV light (it isn't dangerous to eat, but it is very acidic). \"Want to taste?\" he asks. I hold a slice up to the sun and eye it suspiciously; the golden segments light up like a stained-glass window. I tip my head back and squeeze drops into my mouth, being careful not to touch my lips. Eye-watering acidic needles stab my tongue. I'm reeling and wiping away tears, but Todol\u00ed is already on to the next fruit, squeezing the pearly contents of a finger lime into my hand. The little balls pop like lime-flavoured caviar in my mouth.\nThere are hundreds more unusual fruits to try at Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3, a not-for-profit farm dedicated to researching and preserving rare citrus varieties. Hidden on a sleepy street in the town of Palmera, this is Todol\u00ed's passion project. He was born and raised on this farm, going on to study art history before serving as director at esteemed galleries such as Tate Modern in London and Milan's Pirelli HangarBicocca, where he works today.\nNow, Todol\u00ed considers himself a fifth-generation orange farmer. He's fiercely protective of his old family farm, which is one of the reasons Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3 came to be. In 2010, a project was launched to raze Palmera's orange groves to make room for real estate. He tried to derail it through official channels and lost. \"I was called a romantic enemy of progress,\" he recalls. But Todol\u00ed did not desist. Changing tack, he began buying plots of land. Some were abandoned patches of weeds and others were established orchards. He acquired around 4.5 hectares in total, an impenetrable fortress of precious farmland. \"When I started it was a matter of urgency, I had to save the land,\" he says.\nAround the same time, Todol\u00ed was working as cultural advisor to Ferran Adri\u00e0, former head chef of the iconic (and sadly closed) El Bulli (once-billed as the world's best restaurant). One day, the pair visited a garden on the outskirts of Perpignan which had more than 400 types of citrus trees, some exceedingly rare. The south of France is a little too chilly for citrus, so the trees are planted in pots. In summer they bask outside, and in October the gardeners heave them into a greenhouse to keep warm. During their visit Todol\u00ed asked, \"How is it possible that they have done this amazing project with citrus, and in my area no one has done it?\" Adri\u00e0 replied: \"Why not do it yourself?\"\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nTodol\u00ed was inspired. He knew Palmera had the perfect microclimate for citrus; there would be no need for pots. Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3 is 3km from the sea and backed by a ripple of mountains. When the warm wind travels across the Mediterranean Sea, it becomes humid, and when it hits the mountains, it drops bathtubs of rain. The water trickles down the mountainside to Palmera, absorbing organic matter along the way. The fertile, nutrient-rich soil is known as alluvial soil, and Todol\u00ed is blessed with buckets of it.\nPalmera's crisp mornings also help to balance the flavour of fruit, Todol\u00ed explains. \"In January it's one or two degrees in the morning and around 20C in the afternoon. That's what creates the balance between acidity and sweetness. If you're in Florida, for example, it's too hot. They're sweeter but they're bland. In Japan, it's colder so they have more acidity. Here and Sicily are the perfect areas for citrus.\"\nPlan your trip:\nTours cost \u20ac15 for adults and \u20ac10 for children up to 15 and are available from around November to April (depending on when the fruit matures). Book at todolicitrusfundacio.org. The closest airport is Valencia Airport; it takes around an hour to drive from Valencia city centre to Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3.\u00a0\nFor inspiration, he turned to history's most illustrious citrus gardens. He studied the Italian gardens of the Medici family in the 1500s and opulent Arabic palaces like the Alhambra. \"For the Arabs, gardens appealed to the senses. It was a paradise on Earth, an immersive experience,\" says Todol\u00ed.\u00a0\nLikewise, the sights, smells and sounds of Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3 seduce visitors. Chirping locusts the size of frogs hop in the mallow and honeybees buzz between wildflowers. While licking sour juice from fingertips, there's a soundtrack of water trickling along an ancient Arabic irrigation route and the frenetic chirping of goldfinches in the aviary. The zesty scent of lemons perfumes visitors' hands for the rest of the day.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n\u2022\u00a0Spain's accidental tourist attraction\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\nThere are other farms nearby, but they don't look like this. The surrounding countryside is an orderly grid of single-crop fields, with rows upon rows of orange trees. Spain is the world's leading exporter of citrus, shipping around 4 million tonnes a year. In order to produce such vast quantities, most farms lean heavily on mono-cropping, which can leave soil depleted and plants more vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3, on the other hand, is a genetic diversity bank; a motley bunch of more than 500 varieties. Some of the rarest plants include ancient Valencian orange trees used as rootstock. The grafts were made around 150 years ago and Todol\u00ed cut the scion back to allow the roots to grow freely.\n\"It's like Jurassic Park,\" he says. \"We can see resurrected varieties that were in extinction.\"\nAs well as tours of the farm, the garden comes alive with events throughout the year. Poets read stanzas on a stage decorated with lemons at the annual Poec\u00edtrics festival (14 June 2025), while Cine de Vanguardia is a celebration of experimental cinema.\u00a0\nBack on the tour, and Todol\u00ed's right-hand man Ton Gjekaj is waiting at the final tasting table. He has cut the last slices of fruit. There are wedges of passionfruit-tasting trifoliate orange, apple-sour calamansi and rosewater-scented Palestinian sweet lime, still warm from the Sun. I greedily eat them all, popping whole carpels into my mouth. I try to jot down the flavours but by now my notepad is covered in juice, my camera's buttons sticky.\nThere's just time to peep inside The Laboratory, a high-tech kitchen and library. This is a hub of experimentation, used by experts from around the world who come to play with Todol\u00ed's extraordinary pantry. Chefs make ice cream from bergamots; bartenders pickle lemon rind for gin and tonics; and perfumiers extract oils from nearly extinct oranges.\nAgustina Basilico Miara, head of beverage at London's Toklas restaurant, has visited three times and says she always goes home with new ideas. \"It's incredible. Every time we go, we take as many people as possible from the restaurant,\" Miara says. \"Especially after being in cloudy London, to arrive in an explosion of colours is super inspiring.\"\nMiara uses leftover peel from the kitchen (like fragrant blood orange and chandler red pomelo) to make a tea, which she turns into a syrup. She uses it for a variety of cocktails, like her zingy take on the classic whisky highball. \"We've also done a martini with chinotto. The vodka is infused with chinotto and then we candy the fruit,\" Miara says. \"It adds another layer, like an olive brine element to the flavour, it's very aromatic.\"\u00a0\nAfter flicking through some books (every mention of citrus has been bookmarked, resulting in a pleasing rainbow of Post-it notes along the spines) we conclude the tour by tasting marmalade. The most delicious is made from Borneo lemon \u2013 not technically a lemon, but a cross between a pomelo and a key lime. Delicate and creamy, the marmalade tastes like well-balanced lemon curd.\nFor Todol\u00ed, this open-air gallery is his legacy. It's a place to challenge preconceptions, encourage biodiversity and foster local culture. \"For me, it's like a museum where you don't have to refresh the collection because it changes every day,\" he says. \"People think that citrus is what they see in the supermarkets. They don't know that it started eight million years ago, that it's one of the oldest fruits in the world. It has been so important in literature, poetry and art.\"\nTodol\u00ed can see the art of citrus \u2013\u00a0and from his otherworldly orchard, he's helping the rest of the world to see it too.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "During his election campaign last year, Donald Trump promised Americans he would usher in a new era of prosperity.\nNow two months into his presidency, he's painting a slightly different picture. \nHe has warned that it will be hard to bring down prices and the public should be prepared for a \"little disturbance\" before he can bring back wealth to the US.\nMeanwhile, even as the latest figures indicate inflation is easing, analysts say the odds of a downturn are increasing, pointing to his policies.\nSo is Trump about to trigger a recession in the world's largest economy?\nIn the US, a recession is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.\nA chorus of economic analysts have warned in recent days that the risks of such a scenario are rising. \nA JP Morgan report put the chance of recession at 40%, up from 30% at the start of the year, warning that US policy was \"tilting away from growth\", while Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, upped the odds from 15% to 35%, citing tariffs. \nThe forecasts came as the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US sank sharply. It has now fallen to its lowest level since September in a sign of fears about the future.\nThe market turmoil is being driven partly by concerns about new taxes on imports, called tariffs, which Trump has introduced since he took office.\nHe has hit products from America's three biggest trade partners with the new duties, and threatened them more widely in moves that analysts believe will increase prices and curb growth.\nThe latest official inflation figures in the US showed the rate of price increases cooling in February, however. \nPrices were up 2.8% over the 12 months to February, down from 3% in January, the Labor Department said.  \nStill, Trump and his economic advisers have been warning the public to be prepared for some economic pain, while appearing to dismiss the market concerns - a marked change from his first term, when he frequently cited the stock market as a measure of his own success. \n\"There will always be changes and adjustments,\" he said last week, in response to pleas from businesses for more certainty. \nThe posture has increased investor worries about his plans. \nGoldman Sachs last week raised its recession bets from 15% to 20%, saying it saw policy changes as \"the key risk\" to the economy. But it noted that the White House still had \"the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious\". \n\"If the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data, recession risk would rise further,\" the firm's analysts warned. \n\nFor many firms, the biggest question mark is tariffs, which raise costs for US businesses by putting taxes on imports. As Trump unveils tariff plans, many companies are now facing lower profit margins, while holding off on investments and hiring as they try to figure out what the future will look like. \nInvestors are also worried about big cuts to the government workforce and government spending.\nBrian Gardner, chief of Washington policy strategy at the investment bank Stifel, said businesses and investors had thought Trump intended tariffs as a negotiating tool. \n\"But what the president and his cabinet are signalling is actually a bigger deal. It's a restructuring of the American economy,\" he said. \"And that's what's been driving markets in the last couple of weeks.\"\nThe US economy was already undergoing a slowdown, engineered in part by the central bank, which has kept interest rates higher to try to cool activity and stabilise prices.\nIn recent weeks, some data suggests a more rapid weakening.\nRetail sales fell in February, confidence - which had popped after Trump's election on several surveys of consumers and businesses - has fallen, and companies including major airlines, retailers such as Walmart and Target, and manufacturers are warning of a pullback.\nSome analysts are worried a drop in the stock market could trigger a further clampdown in spending, especially among higher income households.\nThat could deliver a major hit to the US economy, which is driven by consumer spending and has grown increasingly dependent on those richer households, as lower income families face pressure from inflation. \n\nThe head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, offered assurances in a speech last week, noting that sentiment had not been a good indicator of behaviour in recent years.\n\"Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,\" he said.\nBut the US economy is currently deeply linked to the rest of the world, warned Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.\n\"The fact that tariffs could disrupt that at the same time that there were signs that the US economy was weakening anyway ... is really fuelling recession fears,\" she says. \nThe unease in the stock market isn't all about Trump. \nInvestors were already jittery about the possibility of a correction, after big gains over the last two years, driven by the sharp run-up in tech stocks fuelled by investor optimism about artificial intelligence (AI).\nChipmaker Nvidia, for example, saw its share price jump from less than $15 at the start of 2023 to nearly $150 in November of last year.\nThat type of rise had stirred debate about an \"AI bubble\" - with investors on high alert for signs of it bursting, which would have a big impact on the stock market, regardless of the dynamics in the wider economy. \nNow, with views of the US economy darkening, optimism about AI is getting even harder to sustain.\nTech analyst Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management wrote on social media this week that his optimism had \"taken a step back\" as the chance of a recession increased \"measurably\" over the past month.\n\"The bottom line is that if we enter a recession, it will be extremely difficult for the AI trade to continue,\" he said. \nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "A lack of this vital nutrient is one of the world's leading causes of disability \u2013 but exactly when it becomes a problem, and the best way to treat it, remains unclear.\nWhen Megan Ryan first noticed her fatigue, she assumed it was normal. After all, she was a single parent to a three-year-old.\u00a0She also worked full-time. Almost every day, when she picked her son up from daycare, she'd fall asleep with him during his afternoon nap. She didn't think much about it. \"I just thought, 'Oh, this is motherhood',\" says Ryan, who lives in upstate New York, US. At a routine medical check-up in June 2023, her doctor asked if she felt exhausted. Blood test results showed that Ryan had iron deficiency anaemia.\nLooking back, there had been other signs. Despite regularly working out, Ryan had suddenly started to feel winded on routine hikes. She had also had iron deficiency before, during pregnancy. That time, her midwife suspected it after Ryan mentioned that her only pregnancy craving was ice \u2013 a classic sign of pica, which is, in turn, a symptom of iron deficiency.\u00a0\nIron deficiency is the\u00a0most common micronutrient deficiency in the world today, affecting roughly one in three people. It is especially prevalent among children as well as women of reproductive age, including pregnant women.\nThe condition can cause a wide range of consequences. When a pregnant woman doesn't have adequate iron stores, for example, it can affect the foetus' brain development and there is also a higher risk of low birth weight, preterm birth, dying during pregnancy and stillbirth. For babies and toddlers, not having enough iron can affect long-term development, with studies finding that children are at risk\u00a0of exhibiting behavioural issues \u2013 they are less happy and contented, and tend to be more socially inhibited. It can also influence children's motor skills, and cognitive ability even years after a deficiency has been corrected. In adults, iron deficiency is one of the world's leading causes of disability. In rare cases, it can be life-threatening.\n\"It's a major global problem,\" says Michael Zimmermann, professor\u00a0of human nutrition at the University of Oxford in the UK and a long-time researcher of micronutrient deficiencies. \"It's very common. It's not going away very fast. And it is associated with a lot of disability.\"\nMost scientists agree that iron deficiency is a common condition. But other questions persist, such as how exactly to define iron deficiency, or how likely it is, in the absence of other symptoms, to raise the risk of poor health outcomes. So, when should, and shouldn't, someone supplement their iron?\u00a0\nWhat isn't disputed is that some groups are more susceptible to iron deficiency than others.\nIn women, for example, iron-deficiency anaemia \u2013 where the body does not have enough iron to make sufficient red blood cells \u2013 is a leading cause of disability worldwide. One study of first-time US blood donors found that iron levels were low in 12% of women, but in less than 3% of men, reflecting the impact made by regular blood loss through menstruation. Then there's the impact of pregnancy, which diverts nutrition to the foetus, meaning that women in this group are particularly at risk. One study found that 46% of UK women had anaemia at some point during pregnancy \u2013 though not all cases stemmed from iron deficiency.\nEndurance athletics, vegetarianism or veganism and frequent blood donation can all put both men and women at increased risk. People with certain health conditions might also be prone to lower iron levels. Kidney disease and coeliac disease can decrease iron absorption, for example.\nBut children are among the most vulnerable group to iron deficiency because the mineral is so important for their development.\n\"What's the most rapid period of growth in our entire lifespan? Infancy,\" says Mark Corkins, chair of the Committee on Nutrition at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). \"You triple your birth weight by a year of age. You double your length.\" As our bodies grow, they need more blood. And red blood cells are built \u2013 in part \u2013 on iron. Without that necessary iron, says Corkins, you risk not able to produce enough red blood cells to deliver oxygen to your growing tissues, including the brain.\nIron deficiency is especially common in children from lower income countries. \"In studies I've done in Africa, 70% of babies between six and 12 months of age have clear iron-deficiency anaemia,\" says Zimmermann.\nEven in wealthier countries, which have better overall nutrition and which are more likely to fortify certain food products with iron, this deficiency persists. Up to 4% of toddlers in the US, for example, have iron-deficiency anaemia, while some 15% have iron deficiency.\nIron deficiency, iron-deficiency anaemia, and anaemia\nAnaemia occurs when someone is not producing enough normal red blood cells or haemoglobin, the substance that carries oxygen around in your blood. While this can be due to various factors, around half of all anaemia cases are caused by iron deficiency. Adults with this condition, iron-deficiency anaemia, might experience weakness, extreme fatigue, or shortness of breath, among other symptoms. Symptoms in babies and small children are similar, though they might also have sleep issues \u2013 particularly frequent night wakes, restlessness during sleep, and difficulty falling asleep.\nJust because someone is iron deficient does not necessarily mean they will have anaemia. \"Iron deficiency can be considered a stage prior to anaemia,\" says clinical haemotologist Sant-Rayn Pasricha, the head of the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health who specialises in iron deficiency and related conditions.\nThe severity of the deficiency plays a key role, Pasricha explains. When someone gets low on iron, their body begins to form red blood cells differently, he says. They get smaller and, eventually, the amount of oxygen-carrying haemoglobin in that person's blood drops below a healthy level. \"That's when we reach iron deficiency anaemia,\" Pasricha says.\nIron deficiency and anaemia are generally diagnosed with a blood test \u2013 usually one that examines levels of ferritin, a protein that helps store iron, or haemoglobin.\nSome specialists question whether iron deficiency is always a cause for concern \u2013 especially if it arises in the absence of any physical symptoms and if the patient does not have anaemia.\nPasricha co-authored a review to help inform the World Health Organization's guidelines on iron supplementation in women. In that research, he found something interesting.\u00a0\nWhile those women in clinical trials who were iron deficient and reported feeling fatigued found that their fatigue improved upon taking iron supplements, the intervention didn't change the energy levels of women who were also iron deficient, but who had not reported fatigue.\u00a0\n\"This hints to us that, at least in adults, if you're clinically unwell with an iron deficiency, then of course you should be treated and that will improve how you feel,\" Pasricha says. \"But it also suggests that, if you're feeling perfectly fine, and someone just finds that you have a low iron level \u2013 then it's hard to be sure that that treating you then would boost you to feel any different.\"\nOverall, iron deficiency in the absence of anaemia has been studied less than iron-deficiency anaemia. But there are some broad conclusions we can make, researchers say.\n\"The consensus is that iron-deficiency anaemia is certainly worse,\" says Zimmermann. \"But iron deficiency is also associated with impairment.\"\nAccording to some studies, the effects of iron-deficiency anaemia \u2013 particularly in children \u2013 can be long-lasting. \"It's not just about [poor health outcomes] \u2013 it is that you didn't maximise your development,\" Corkins says.\nOne review, for example, found a \"consistent association\" between children with iron-deficiency anaemia having poorer cognitive performance compared to controls. However, the researchers note, perhaps it's not iron-deficiency anaemia that's the problem. It could be the effect of anaemia in general, which depresses energy levels. The researchers also say in their review that it is hard to rule out the influence of socioeconomic factors on children\u2019s behaviour and cognition.\nThis complexity lies at the heart of all nutrition research: is it the absence of a nutrient itself that's the problem, or is that deficiency a sign of something else going on?\nTo complicate matters further, the criteria for defining iron deficiency in children is still up for debate, says Zimmermann. Because children are growing so fast, he adds, iron deficiency normally quickly leads to anaemia \u2013 which means it's not easy to find, and study, iron-deficient children who are not anaemic.\nGiven that, and the potential consequences for their development, guidelines often advise supplementing children with iron at any sign of deficiency \u2013 or even to supplement as a prevention measure.\u00a0\nIn the US, for example, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies who are exclusively breastfed receive iron drops from four months old, for example. This is because breastmilk has low levels of iron, while formula milk is usually fortified.\nBut some researchers question this approach.\nPasricha was involved in the largest trial to date that has examined the effect of supplementation on child development, he says. The study, of 3,300 eight-month-old babies in Bangladesh, randomised children into groups that received either daily iron supplementation for three months, or a placebo. He and colleagues measured the children's neurodevelopment before and after the supplementation. \"We did not see any evidence of a functional benefit,\" he says, although they also saw no harm either way.\n\"We did see that haemoglobin and iron status did improve in the children that received iron \u2013 but we didn't see that affect child development,\" says Pasricha. The \"why\", he says, \"is something that the team is really grappling with\".\nOther research has yielded similar findings. For example, in one study, even after infants with iron-deficiency anaemia received supplementation that corrected their anaemia, they continued to show more restless sleep patterns than their cohorts \u2013 sometimes even years later.\nOne possible reason might be that even a brief period of deficiency can lead to long-lasting harm. One study, for example, found that when children had had iron deficiency at birth, they had less activation in the regions of their brain related to cognitive control at eight to 11 years old \u2013 even if their iron levels had been corrected.\u00a0\nBut another possibility, Pasricha says, is that it isn't the low iron itself that causes poorer development, but that low iron is an indicator of something else \u2013 such as other nutrients in a person's diet that are missing.\nMeanwhile, there could also be downsides to supplementing children who don't actually have a deficiency. Some studies have found that babies and toddlers who had adequate iron levels, but received supplementation, had poorer weight gain and less growth compared to controls. Randomised controlled trials have found that babies randomly assigned to high-iron formula milk scored more poorly on cognitive tests of abilities like visual memory, reading comprehension and mathematics at both 10 years old and 16 years old, compared to those on a low-iron formulation. However, exactly how much iron supplementation would avoid these effects remains unclear, the researchers say as other factors could also be involved.\nGiven results like this, however, some experts have criticised US guidelines to supplement all breastfed infants.\nSupplements can also have other side effects. Zimmermann, for example, has studied how supplementation can affect people's microbiome. Bacteria thrive on iron, he says. The very small amount of iron that breastmilk has is bound to protective substances like lactoferrin, which helps to keep iron away from potential pathogens in the gut \u2013 especially protective for babies, who have immature immune systems. Giving a baby aged six months old micronutrient powders containing iron, which is what many experts recommend, could result in a negative outcome, says Zimmermann.\n\"These powders have very high amounts of iron in them\u2026 which can cause a very rapid shift in the microbiome,\" says Zimmermann. The babies can't absorb all that iron, which ends up impacting their gut microbiome \u2013 potentially towards a balance favouring \"the pathogens we worry most about in babies\", he says. This includes E. coli, which grows prolifically in the presence of iron.\nMany clinicians and researchers agree, however, that when someone has iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anaemia along with symptoms, supplementing can be one of the fastest ways to help them improve. One review of iron deficiency in endurance athletes, for example, found that supplementation not only improved ferritin and haemoglobin, but athletes' aerobic capacity, too.\u00a0\nWhether to take supplements \u2013 or give them to a child \u2013 is something that people should decide with the help of a doctor, experts say.\nBut in an ideal world, people would get sufficient iron by eating a balanced diet that includes iron-rich foods, and avoid developing a deficiency in the first place \u2013 though this is not always possible. Ingredients such as liver or red meat, pulses, including kidney and edamame beans and chickpeas, as well as nuts and dried fruits are all considered good sources of iron.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants aged six to 12 months need 11 mg of iron per day. For toddlers, they recommend 7 mg, and for four- to eight-year-olds, 10 mg.\nPart of the higher recommendation for younger babies is because of their rapid development, experts say. But it's also because there is an assumption being made that most infants' first solids will be foods like iron-fortified cereals, as well as fruits and vegetables \u2013 non-heme sources of iron, which the body absorbs less readily than heme sources, which are animal-derived, like meat, fish and eggs.\n\"Diet is the best approach. Your body tends to take it up better. Your body tends to use it better,\" Corkins says. \"Now, if someone is profoundly anaemic, and you're trying to get them fixed faster \u2013 then you do supplementation.\"\nAs for Ryan, she was able to correct her iron deficiency both times it happened: in pregnancy, with a supplement, and in 2023, with iron infusions, administered at her hospital, every two weeks for five months. \"It wasn't a quick fix,\" she says. With time, however, she noticed her fatigue fade.\nDisclaimer\n All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of a doctor or any other health care professional.

Lose then move on.\nThe Football Association provoked debate, and some criticism, by ignoring the claims of English candidates such as Eddie Howe in their succession plan post-Southgate, to go for the best man available regardless of nationality.\nThe strategy was clear. The long-term can wait while a proven winner takes charge and Tuchel's first England squad merely confirms it.\nThere is a nod to the next generation with the inclusion of versatile defender Lewis-Skelly with England short at left-back and Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers, who is 22, but there was the definite whiff of short-term targets in Tuchel's selection.\nHowever, the recall of Henderson is the most eye-catching example of Tuchel wanting experience for the here and now. He last played for England in November 2023 and missed out on selection for last summer's Euro 2024.\nTuchel described Henderson as a \"serial winner\" and this is what the coach has in mind as he plots a path to next year's World Cup.\nJordan Henderson's England career looked over when he was left out of Gareth Southgate's Euro 2024 squad\nAnd then there is the shock selection of Burn. \nA wonderful story, as Newcastle United manager Howe agreed, but a very late stage for any player to prove they are international class.\nBurn would be the oldest player to win his first England cap since Bolton Wanderers striker Kevin Davies made his debut against Montenegro on 12 October 2010 at 33 years and 200 days. The bustling forward was the oldest since 38-year-old Leslie Compton in 1950.\nIt is very much a case of going back to the past for the short-term future. Former interim boss Lee Carsley's last squad contained a total 627 caps, while this one has a tally of 664.\nTuchel is missing younger players who have been injured recently, such as Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, but is clear the German's reign is not going to be a slow burner.\nThe selection of Henderson and the return of Rashford demonstrates that Tuchel is prepared to start with a clean slate.\nHenderson's call-up came out of the blue after it looked like his England career was over when he, like Rashford, was left out of Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2024.\nThe former Liverpool captain had an ill-fated stint in Saudi Arabia before returning to Europe with Ajax, where Tuchel has clearly seen enough to recall him.\nTuchel appears to want Henderson as much for his influence off the pitch, saying: \"What he brings every time is leadership, character, personality and energy. He makes sure everyone lives by the standards and with character. He embodies everything we are trying to build.\"\nEngland's head coach has long been a fan of Rashford and wants to be the beneficiary of Aston Villa manager Unai Emery's repair job on the forward's career.\nHe said: \"I had a strong feeling we should nominate him, to push him to stay at the level he is at now not fall back into old routines.\"\nTuchel's words offer an indication that he realises Rashford had fallen by the wayside at Old Trafford but is also convinced the 27-year-old can offer much to his new England.\nHe clearly does not feel the same about Manchester City's Jack Grealish. He would have been hoping to make a comeback after also missing out on Euro 2024, although he has not figured regularly under manager Pep Guardiola.\nTottenham midfielder James Maddison is another who is, for now at least, consigned to the margins,\nTuchel goes with what he knows by recalling Chelsea's Reece James as he makes his return from another hamstring injury. \nHe was a key member of Tuchel's side that won the Champions League in 2021 and there is a potential opening at right-back with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, Kyle Walker, 34, and on loan at AC Milan, and with Newcastle United's Tino Livramento talented but inexperienced.\nThis video can not be played\n'When Rashford plays, he's one of the best'\nWatch The Football News Show on Tuchel's first England squad\nHenderson embodies everything we try to build - Tuchel\nTuchel has made no secret of his desire to utilise the natural physical aspects of the English style into his squad and this is in evidence with this selection.\nBurn, at 6 feet 7 inches, fits the bill, while Rogers combines raw power with natural skill and strong running.

Obviously a little bit is because we lost consecutive Euros finals and World Cup semi-final and quarter-finals. \n\"The feeling is a little step is needed to bring it over the line.\"\nTuchel's squad is sure to cause debate, especially in Nottingham, where Forest fans will feel Morgan Gibbs-White could have offered an \"X Factor\" after his outstanding performances in their tilt to reach the Champions League.\nThey will also offer up Callum Hudson-Odoi as an example of someone who deserves a return to the England squad after his rejuvenation, exemplified by his winning goal against Manchester City that puts Forest in such a wonderful position to reach the top four.\nEverton defender Jarrad Branthwaite, who won a full cap under Southgate, also misses out despite being in outstanding form since manager David Moyes returned to Goodison Park.

        "article_text": "As an engineer who flies into hurricanes for the US government, Josh Ripp is accustomed to turbulence. But the last two weeks have been far bumpier than he's used to.\nIn late February, the Trump administration fired Mr Ripp and over 800 recently hired or promoted staff at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency using a form email, part of ongoing cuts to the federal workforce.\nSuddenly, he and several other members of the elite Hurricane Hunters flight team were out of a job - until around 21:00 Friday when he received a second email. He was to report back to work in Lakeland, Florida, 12 March, it said.\nFor Mr Ripp, a retired US Navy officer who voted for Donald Trump, the confusion highlighted the dangers of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency slashing thousands of government jobs to cut costs without agency input.\nAs soon as this week, the Trump administration could consider axing more than 1,000 additional staffers at NOAA, according to BBC News partner CBS News. Those potential cuts, plus losses from previous firings and buyouts, would cost the agency up to 20% of its workforce, the New York Times reported. \nThe White House did not comment on additional cuts, but a Trump administration official said an \"extensive process was conducted\" to ensure \"mission critical functions\" were not compromised during the first round of dismissals.\n\"NOAA provides vital information to the entire country and we do it at a fraction of the cost that anyone else could do,\" Mr Ripp said. \"There's a lot of jobs out there that are very important. NOAA is a small agency. Every little bit hurts.\"\nThe cuts will not only harm government functions, staffers and weather experts warn, but they could disrupt the daily lives of Americans who rely on accurate NOAA data more than they know.\nThe data that powers Americans' smartphone weather apps and informs local meteorologists comes from NOAA and its subsidiary, the National Weather Service. Americans use it to decide what to wear, and whether to meet friends in the park or indoors. They rely on it during hurricanes, tornadoes or blizzards.  \nAirlines and federal aviation officials need forecasts to safely guide planes through the sky. Retailers use them to schedule customer deliveries. Shipping companies and fisheries in the Great Lakes rely on NOAA updates about ice conditions and algae blooms.\n\"People take for granted how accurate the weather forecasts are,\" said Andy Hazelton, a NOAA climate scientist who modelled hurricane paths and was fired in February. \"Forecasts are going to get worse because offices are understaffed.\"\nHurricane Hunters measure hurricanes from the inside, gauging their strength and paths. As a flight engineer for the P-3 aircraft, Mr Ripp ensures that the nearly 50-year-old planes NOAA uses are safe. Missions cannot take off without team members like him aboard.\nThe original staffing cuts would have limited hurricane flights, said Lt Kerri Englert, a flight director for the Hurricane Hunters -  also cut in February then reinstated. \n\"That means data doesn't get ingested into the models, and forecasting for those hurricane tracks and intensity will be less accurate,\" she said. adding that it would impact evacuations, money allocated for storm preparation and disaster response.\nAlready, local National Weather Service offices have scaled back lesser known but crucial work, due to cuts.\nFor example, scientific balloon launches from Alaska - vital to national forecasts because the location allows them to assess systems moving from west to east - were curtailed, weather experts told the BBC. Launches in New York and Maine also were reduced.\nNOAA spokeswoman Susan Buchanan declined to comment on individual staffing decisions, citing agency policy.\nBut, she said, \"NOAA remains dedicated to its mission, providing timely information, research, and resources that serve the American public and ensure our nation's environmental and economic resilience.\"\n\"We continue to provide weather information, forecasts and warnings pursuant to our public safety mission.\"\nA Trump administration official said an \"extensive process was conducted\" to ensure \"mission critical functions\" were not compromised.\nSome of NOAA's long-term, climate-focused initiatives also face cuts.\nBefore he was fired, NOAA scientist Zach Labe studied using artificial intelligence to prepare for deadly heat waves. Others in his division, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, also were fired and their specialities make them difficult to replace, he said.\n\"People who were impacted were definitely the key people who were leading the development of the US weather models,\" Mr Labe told BBC.\nEven private sector weather companies rely on accurate NOAA and NWS data for their products.\n\"We operate on razor thin margins to keep costs low,\" said Ryan Hickman, owner and chief technology officer at AllisonHouse, which takes data from NOAA and other sources to create custom weather visualisations.\nFor AllisonHouse, NOAA is both a data source and a client.\nMr Hickman was particularly worried that the agency's radar and satellite services could be impacted. \"Nobody else has these satellite capabilities NOAA has,\" he said.\n\"Unless someone has a billion dollars to build a weather satellite and launch it into geostationary orbit, and have it sit there and read all this data, and bring it back down to Earth so that everyone else can see it and use it, then what are we doing here?\"\nThe prospect of more cuts alarms scientists and private businessmen like Mr Hickman, who believe they will strain the agency's maintenance of the complex and delicate instruments needed to produce real-time as well as future forecasts.\nNOAA's primary goal is to keep Americans informed about the future, in ways both mundane and urgent, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\"There is almost unanimous horror among people who really understand how this works,\" he said.\nHe feared some in the administration believe in a \"philosophy that not only can we not plan for the future, but we also should not even try to prevent bad things from happening.\"\nBack in Florida, Mr Ripp still doesn't know what the future holds.\nDuring his brief unemployment, he explored opportunities flying for a private firefighting company \u2013 and still would not rule out leaving NOAA. He remains angry that fellow veterans were caught up in the layoffs.\nHe backed Trump due to the president's commitment to the rule of law, he said, but now Mr Ripp thinks Trump is flouting the correct procedures for reducing the federal workforce.\n\"We're very good stewards of the money we're given by the government. We're not out here committing waste or anything like that,\" Mr Ripp said. \"If you're looking for government savings, NOAA's not the place.\"",

The exact time frame had not been decided.\nBut with the 2030 target now scrapped, and a much delayed energy strategy still not forthcoming, the pressure is off.\nAlthough the plan could be revived in the future it is pretty clear, from the tone of the ministerial statement, that something major would have to change for that to happen.",

        "article_text": "Newcastle, Aston Villa and Fulham are all in the race for Champions League football\nThe Premier League title race and relegation battles look ominously like 'done deals' - but what about the fight for Champions League football?\nEngland's top division is on course to gain an additional spot in Europe's elite club competition for next season thanks to Uefa's coefficient ranking table, which you can find out more about here.\nAs a result, as many as seven Premier League clubs could qualify but that would require Arsenal - though unlikely - or Aston Villa to finish outside the top five and win the Champions League, and either Tottenham or Manchester United to win the Europa League.\nOf the likely five spots on offer through the league, leaders Liverpool - 15 points clear at the top - will surely take one. Arsenal, in second, have an eight-point cushion to Newcastle in sixth so should secure another.\nHowever, with 10th-placed Fulham just five points off fifth, as many as eight teams probably remain in the mix for the final three places.\nCrystal Palace, in 11th, are in great form but closing a nine-point feels too big an ask, especially given the number of sides they would have to overhaul.\nWith 10 games left for most, BBC Sport looks at the eight clubs in contention and the challenges they will have to overcome to claim one of those lucrative places. Plus Phil McNulty gives his predictions on where each club will finish and fans have their say on why they back their team in the race for Europe...\nThis video can not be played\nNottingham Forest manager Nuno reflects on big win against Manchester City\nNuno Espirito Santo's side have been this season's surprise package (and a big one at that), going from a relegation scrap last term to challenging at the top, claiming famous wins at Anfield and Old Trafford along the way. Dreams of the title have faded since the start of the year but they remain in a great position to end a memorable campaign celebrating Champions League qualification.\nKey fixtures: The week after March's international break looks huge for Forest. After an FA Cup quarter-final at Brighton, they host Manchester United on 1 April before travelling to fellow top-five hopefuls Aston Villa four days later.\nShould it go down to the wire, expect quite the atmosphere when Forest face Chelsea at the City Ground on the final day of the season in what could be a winner-takes-all match.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Fourth\nWhat a story it will be for this great old club with the rich history of two European Cup wins under Brian Clough to return to the elite competition.\nAnd the surge of belief that swept around the atmospheric City Ground after the win against Manchester City makes you believe the force is with Nuno's side.\nThey have a top-class goalkeeper in Matz Sels, formidable central defenders in Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic, quality in midfield and out wide with Morgan Gibbs-White and Callum Hudson-Odoi. Throw in a striker having the season of his life in Chris Wood and a top-four place is there for the taking.\nOpta's prediction: 73.1% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nMossy: Best defence in the Premier League.\nStuart: Great business, great recruitment, great morals and an incredible work-rate.\nSteve: Forest will continue to do what they've done for most of the games so far, defend well and catch teams on the break.\nCole Palmer is Chelsea's top goalscorer in the Premier League but has gone seven league games without a goal\nAs recently as December, Chelsea were being mentioned as title challengers. Manager Enzo Maresca was quick to dismiss such talk before a post-Christmas slump that led to them dropping out of the Champions League spots. Back-to-back league wins suggest they might be finding form again at just the right time, though.\nKey fixtures: If Chelsea are to make the top five, they will really have earned it given their remaining fixtures. They travel to Arsenal on Sunday, then host rivals Tottenham before tricky games at Brentford and Fulham in April.\nIn May they face Liverpool and Manchester United at Stamford Bridge, either side of a trip to Newcastle, before that potentially crucial trip to Nottingham Forest on the last day.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Fifth\nTouted as title contenders at one point, there has been a drop off in form but Maresca still has lots of quality at his disposal.

        "article_text": "Gianluigi Donnarumma joined Paris St-Germain in 2021\nIt is the life of a goalkeeper. \nOne day you are the villain. The next, you are the hero.\nGianluigi Donnarumma was blamed by some for Paris St-Germain's defeat by Liverpool last week, allowing Harvey Elliot's 88th-minute effort - the Reds' only shot on target - to slip in. \nAt the other end, the Italian's opposite number Alisson produced the \"performance of his career\" as he single-handedly kept the French side at bay in Paris. \nOn Tuesday night, the tables turned.\nItaly's Donnarumma was the hero, saving two of Liverpool's three penalties in a shootout to send his side through to the Champions League quarter-finals. \n\"The first game belonged to Alisson, the second game belonged to Donnarumma,\" said PSG boss Luis Enrique.\nDonnarumma has now won six of the seven penalty shootouts he has taken part in for club and country.\nSince making his debut aged 16 for boyhood club AC Milan, Donnarumma has faced 60 penalties across his club and international career. \nHe has saved 14 of those, giving him a save percentage of 23.3%.\nRemarkably, the Italian's penalty shootout record is identical.\nThe 26-year-old has saved 10 of the 43 spot-kicks he has faced during shootouts - a save percentage of 23.3%.  \nDonnarumma, who was player of the tournament after Italy's 2021 Euros triumph, saved penalties from Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho in the final against England at Wembley. \nHis full record for penalties faced during matches and in shootouts is 24 saves from 103 penalties. \nDonnarumma missed Luis Enrique's pre-shootout team talk as he headed down the tunnel, choosing instead to retrieve some pre-prepared notes from the dressing room about Liverpool's spot-kicks.\n\"I had prepared something with my trainer, it was right to take something back to try to save some penalties,\" said Donnarumma. \n\"I see a lot of criticism from journalists without knowing what the goalkeeper's job is.\n\"In the first leg we conceded a shot and a goal, it seemed like it was my fault but I always think about smiling, giving my best and working for the team.\"\nAt 6ft 5in, Donnarumma cuts an imposing figure.\nBut unlike many of his peers, he has a slightly different tactic for penalties.\nMany goalkeepers use the moments before a penalty is taken to attempt to 'get into the head' of the taker - slowing down the taking of the penalty, retrieving the ball for the taker or moving along their line. \nDonnarumma is different.\nLaidback and calm, the Italian barely moves until the player puts the ball on the spot. \nJust as they are readying their run-up, he expands his arms to make the goal look as small as possible. \n\"The idea behind that is to stand as slim as you can to start with,\" former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock told Football Daily.\n\"The ball goes on the spot, now you're putting doubt in their mind, you spread yourself, make yourself big and awkward, making the goal look smaller. \n\"You don't do that when they're walking forward. You do it when the ball is on the spot to put doubt in their mind in the last seconds.\" \nDonnarumma remained level-headed after both of his penalty saves, barely celebrating as he prepared for the next. \n\"I'm sat here watching Donnarumma and thinking, 'Wow, look at the size of him!'\" Warnock added.\n\"How imposing is he in that goal? If he dives the right way he stands a great chance of getting it. The guy's a monster.\" \nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is set to unveil details of how the government plans to cut billions of pounds from the working-age welfare bill. \nThe focus will be on reducing spending on health-related and disability benefits.\nThat bill is rising rapidly and many argue it needs to be curbed for the sake of the UK's public finances \u2013 as well as the economic and individual benefits of getting people back into work.\nBut this is not the first government to seek savings from the welfare budget, and to try to encourage more people into employment.\nAnd charities are warning about the adverse impact on vulnerable recipients.\nThere are three broad approaches which the government is believed to be examining:\nBBC Verify has examined the past 15 years of policies in this area to see what might be effective \u2013 and what risks being counterproductive.\nThe working-age health and disability benefits bill has certainly been increasing in recent years, and is rising rapidly.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the official forecaster, has projected that total state spending on these benefits for people in the UK aged between 18 and 64 will increase from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.\nThat would represent an increase from 1.7% of the size of the UK economy to 2.2%.\nBy 2030, around half of the expenditure is projected to be on incapacity benefit, which is designed to provide additional income for people whose health limits their ability to work.\nThe other half is projected to be on Personal Independence Payments (PIP), which are intended to help people of working age with disabilities manage the additional day-to-day costs arising from their disability.\nOne straightforward way for ministers to curb this projected rise would be to hold payments flat in cash terms, rather than allowing them to rise in line with prices each year.\n\"Reducing award amounts is the easiest way to get savings in the short term,\" says Eduin Latimer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\nFreezing incapacity benefits in cash terms until 2030 would save \u00a31bn a year, according to the Resolution Foundation.\nBut you can only receive incapacity benefit if your income and savings are below a certain level, so freezing payments would impact people who are worse off.\nAlso, people on disability benefits such as PIP are considerably more likely to be in poverty and material deprivation.\nUnder previous governments between 2014 and 2020, most working-age benefits did not rise in line with inflation - to save money.\nAnd from 2015, more and more people claimed incapacity benefit.\nSo cutting the value of individual payments might save some money up front, but still not have a dramatic impact on the overall bill in the longer term if claimants continue to rise.\nRather than cutting the value of these benefits for all recipients, the government could seek to save money by making it harder for people to claim them in the first place.\nFor instance, the previous government had proposed making it harder for people with mental health conditions to claim PIP, arguing that the monthly payment was not proportionate to the additional financial needs created by their conditions.\nBut it is important to note that efforts to change the eligibility criteria for these benefits over the past 15 years have not yielded the results hoped for.\nPIP was introduced in 2013 to replace the old Disability Living Allowance, with the intention it would lead to savings of \u00a31.4bn a year relative to the previous system by reducing the number of people eligible.\nPIP was initially projected to reduce the number of claimants by 606,000 (28%) in total.\nYet the reform ended up saving only \u00a3100m a year by 2015 and the number of claimants rose by 100,000 (5%).\nAnother attempt in 2017 to limit access to PIP was also reversed.\nThe reason was that many people appealed against refusals that had been triggered by the tightened eligibility criteria. Also, the emergence of cases in the media which seemed unfair meant ministers, often under pressure from their own backbench MPs, ultimately ordered the eligibility rules to be relaxed.\nOfficial decisions not to award PIP and incapacity benefit to claimants are still often challenged and around a third of those challenges are ultimately upheld at an independent tribunal.\n\"Britain's chequered history of benefit reform shows that the government should proceed cautiously, rather than rush ahead to find savings which could backfire,\" says Louise Murphy of the Resolution Foundation.\nAnother way for the government to try to achieve savings is by encouraging more people to come off these benefits and enter work.\nAround 93% of incapacity benefit claimants are not in work and the same is true of 80% of PIP claimants.\nOne potential route to increase employment rates could be regular reassessments of people in receipt of incapacity benefit and a requirement for them to start looking for jobs if they are found to be fit for work.\nThe fall in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit in the early 2010s has been attributed by the OBR to reassessments of a large number of people in receipt of an older form of the benefit.\nHowever, an aggressive or onerous reassessment regime could risk imposing distress on people who are unable to work and could also create unexpected distortions in the system.\nThe OBR has suggested the sanctions introduced to the wider benefits system by the last government, requiring people judged fit to work to be actively looking for employment or risk losing their benefits, had the counterproductive effect of increasing the incentive for people to try to claim incapacity benefits (for which these work-searching requirements did not apply).\nAnother potential policy avenue to boost employment rates is through providing much greater support to find jobs.\nSome advocate increasing government investment in official schemes, working with employers, to help people to enter the workplace.\nThere have been various schemes designed to achieve this over the past 15 years, though they have not been on a large scale.\nEvaluations have shown some positive employment effects from them.\nHowever, the OBR concluded last year that the evidence base was still limited and did not suggest such programmes have, so far, made a \"significant contribution\" to getting people into work.\nThat implies the official forecaster may hesitate to assume greater state investment in these schemes will pay for itself through higher employment and tax revenues, and result in net savings in public expenditure.\nNevertheless, some experts argue it would make sense for the government to re-assess more regularly whether people in receipt of health and disability benefits are still unable to work and - if their circumstances are found to have changed - to provide them with additional support to get into the workforce.\n\"Not doing reassessments and work-focused interviews definitely makes things worse,\" says Jonathan Portes, a former chief economist at the Department for Work & Pensions.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

        "summary": "\"Reducing award amounts is the easiest way to get savings in the short term,\" says Eduin Latimer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.Freezing incapacity benefits in cash terms until 2030 would save \u00a31bn a year, according to the Resolution Foundation.But you can only receive incapacity benefit if your income and savings are below a certain level, so freezing payments would impact people who are worse off.Also, people on disability benefits such as PIP are considerably more likely to be in poverty and material deprivation.Under previous governments between 2014 and 2020, most working-age benefits did not rise in line with inflation - to save money.And from 2015, more and more people claimed incapacity benefit.So cutting the value of individual payments might save some money up front, but still not have a dramatic impact on the overall bill in the longer term if claimants continue to rise.Tighten eligibilityRather than cutting the value of these benefits for all recipients, the government could seek to save money by making it harder for people to claim them in the first place.For instance, the previous government had proposed making it harder for people with mental health conditions to claim PIP, arguing that the monthly payment was not proportionate to the additional financial needs created by their conditions.But it is important to note that efforts to change the eligibility criteria for these benefits over the past 15 years have not yielded the results hoped for.PIP was introduced in 2013 to replace the old Disability Living Allowance, with the intention it would lead to savings of \u00a31.4bn a year relative to the previous system by reducing the number of people eligible.PIP was initially projected to reduce the number of claimants by 606,000 (28%) in total.Yet the reform ended up saving only \u00a3100m a year by 2015 and the number of claimants rose by 100,000 (5%).Another attempt in 2017 to limit access to PIP was also reversed.The reason was that many people appealed against refusals that had been triggered by the tightened eligibility criteria. \"Britain's chequered history of benefit reform shows that the government should proceed cautiously, rather than rush ahead to find savings which could backfire,\" says Louise Murphy of the Resolution Foundation.Encourage workAnother way for the government to try to achieve savings is by encouraging more people to come off these benefits and enter work.Around 93% of incapacity benefit claimants are not in work and the same is true of 80% of PIP claimants.One potential route to increase employment rates could be regular reassessments of people in receipt of incapacity benefit and a requirement for them to start looking for jobs if they are found to be fit for work.The fall in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit in the early 2010s has been attributed by the OBR to reassessments of a large number of people in receipt of an older form of the benefit.However, an aggressive or onerous reassessment regime could risk imposing distress on people who are unable to work and could also create unexpected distortions in the system.The OBR has suggested the sanctions introduced to the wider benefits system by the last government, requiring people judged fit to work to be actively looking for employment or risk losing their benefits, had the counterproductive effect of increasing the incentive for people to try to claim incapacity benefits (for which these work-searching requirements did not apply).Another potential policy avenue to boost employment rates is through providing much greater support to find jobs.Some advocate increasing government investment in official schemes, working with employers, to help people to enter the workplace.There have been various schemes designed to achieve this over the past 15 years, though they have not been on a large scale.Evaluations have shown some positive employment effects from them.However, the OBR concluded last year that the evidence base was still limited and did not suggest such programmes have, so far, made a \"significant contribution\" to getting people into work.That implies the official forecaster may hesitate to assume greater state investment in these schemes will pay for itself through higher employment and tax revenues, and result in net savings in public expenditure.Nevertheless, some experts argue it would make sense for the government to re-assess more regularly whether people in receipt of health and disability benefits are still unable to work and - if their circumstances are found to have changed - to provide them with additional support to get into the workforce. The focus will be on reducing spending on health-related and disability benefits.That bill is rising rapidly and many argue it needs to be curbed for the sake of the UK's public finances \u2013 as well as the economic and individual benefits of getting people back into work.But this is not the first government to seek savings from the welfare budget, and to try to encourage more people into employment.And charities are warning about the adverse impact on vulnerable recipients.There are three broad approaches which the government is believed to be examining:Cutting the level of benefit paymentsTightening the eligibility for benefitsAttempting to get people off benefits and into workBBC Verify has examined the past 15 years of policies in this area to see what might be effective \u2013 and what risks being counterproductive.Cutting paymentsThe working-age health and disability benefits bill has certainly been increasing in recent years, and is rising rapidly.The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the official forecaster, has projected that total state spending on these benefits for people in the UK aged between 18 and 64 will increase from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.That would represent an increase from 1.7% of the size of the UK economy to 2.2%.By 2030, around half of the expenditure is projected to be on incapacity benefit, which is designed to provide additional income for people whose health limits their ability to work.The other half is projected to be on Personal Independence Payments (PIP), which are intended to help people of working age with disabilities manage the additional day-to-day costs arising from their disability.One straightforward way for ministers to curb this projected rise would be to hold payments flat in cash terms, rather than allowing them to rise in line with prices each year. \"Not doing reassessments and work-focused interviews definitely makes things worse,\" says Jonathan Portes, a former chief economist at the Department for Work & Pensions.What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?Chancellor's Spring Statement Does cutting benefits work?4 hours agoShareSaveBen ChuBBC VerifyShareSaveBBCWork and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is set to unveil details of how the government plans to cut billions of pounds from the working-age welfare bill.",

        "article_text": "As leaders around the world try to figure out how best to deal with the new Trump administration, one Canadian official has come out swinging.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford, a regular on major US networks where he has addressed Americans directly, was among the first in Canada to pull US alcohol off the shelves as a trade war between the two neighbours ramped up.\nFord has also ripped up a multi-million dollar contract with Elon Musk's Starlink, and has been unafraid to use energy exports to the US as a bargaining chip - all in a bid to get Trump to withdraw his tariff threats against Canada.\nThe right-wing, plain-spoken politician admitted he was initially delighted Donald Trump won re-election and viewed him as an ally.\nBut then, Ford said, using an expletive, the US president pulled a knife and \"yanked it into us\".\nThis week, it appeared that Ford's unusual tactics had grabbed Trump's attention.\nSpeaking to reporters on the White House lawn on Tuesday, the US president described Ford as a \"very strong man\" as he addressed Ontario's threat to slap a 25% surcharge on US-bound electricity.\nFord has since shelved that plan pending further discussions with the Trump administration. But his threat to hike the price of electricity on Americans seems to have earned him a grudging nod of respect from Trump, who later backed off from doubling tariffs on aluminium and steel to 50%.\nIt also helped Ford score a meeting with US officials in Washington to discuss the future of the Canada-US trade relationship. \nFord sat on Thursday with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The meeting was also attended by Canada's Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc.\nThe meeting was \"very, very productive\" though \"bumps in the road\" remain, he said afterwards. \nIt is unclear whether Ford's defiant stance will earn Canada more favours from Trump. It is also an approach that is not unanimously agreed on, with Premier Danielle Smith of the oil-rich Alberta vehemently refusing to withhold any of her province's energy exports to the US.\nTrump's recent willingness to turn down the heat, however, signals that Ford may be succeeding in grabbing the attention of the US, said Shakir Chambers, a Canadian Conservative strategist at the Toronto-based Oyster Group.\n\"That's how you deal with Trump, through a position of strength,\" Mr Chambers told the BBC. \"Ford understands the language of Trump's people and inner circle.\"\nIt at least earned him a rare compliment from the US president, who for several months has berated Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau repeatedly by calling him \"governor,\" while expressing his desire to absorb Canada and make it \"the 51st state\".\nAlso rare is seeing the Oval Office pay attention to the premier of a Canadian province, whose day-to-day is ordinarily preoccupied with domestic matters such as infrastructure projects, healthcare funding and co-operating with the federal government.\nBut these are no ordinary times in Canada. The country is in the middle of a transfer of power, from outgoing Trudeau to Prime Minister-designate Mark Carney.\nIt is also facing what has been referred to as an \"existential threat\" from its neighbour and long-time ally to the south.\nAnnouncing his intention to pause energy tariffs pending trade talks, Ford vowed to Canadians that he will not \"roll over\" and warned that using Ontario's energy supply as a bargaining chip remains on the table. \nBut he said he will not ignore the chance to resolve this dispute with Americans.\nHis emergence as the face of Canada's fight is, in many ways, understandable. As Ontario premier, he is at the helm of a province that is home to 16 million people and Canada's large auto manufacturing sector, which is deeply intertwined with that of the US, leaving it vulnerable to any broad tariff threats.\nHe is also chair of the Council of the Federation, a multilateral congress that includes all of Canada's provincial and territorial premiers.\nOn Wednesday, Ford kept busy ahead of his meeting with the Americans. He sat down for breakfast with incoming Prime Minister Carney, where the two discussed the need to \"stand firm and strong\" to Trump.\nAmericans will undoubtedly see more of Ford in the coming weeks and months. The premier just decisively secured four more years in office after campaigning on standing up against the US president.\nFor Ontarians, Ford is a well-known figure. He has led the province since 2018 and is only the second premier in its history to secure three consecutive majority government wins.\nHe is the product of a Toronto political dynasty known as \"Ford Nation\". For many years, he was overshadowed by his younger brother, the late Rob Ford, who was the mayor of Toronto from 2010 to 2014 before he was ousted after a crack cocaine scandal.\nLocally, the Fords are infamous for their \"authentic\" and approachable style of politics, said Mr Chambers, who was coached high school football by the younger Ford.\nPremier Ford is known for handing out his personal cell phone number to constituents, encouraging them to contact him directly. During a news conference on US tariffs last week, he urged people to be patient as he worked to respond to more than 4,000 text messages he has received lately.\nDespite his popularity, the premier is also embroiled in several controversies. Chief among them is an ongoing police investigation into a now-scrapped deal his government made that would have allowed the development of environmentally-protected land.\nOn the national stage, he has run up against Alberta Premier Smith, who has called for a more measured and cautious response to Trump and his tariffs. \nThat caution has also been practised by other leaders, namely France's Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, both of whom struck a more diplomatic tone in their February visits to the White House. \nBut Ford's defiant stance against Trump is widely supported in Canada. Polls show the majority of Canadians support retaliating against the US, and a swell of nationalism has since emerged across the country.\nWhile Ford has been forceful, he has also been careful in his direct appeals to Americans.\n\"Believe me when I say I don't want to do this,\" he said earlier this week when he announced his plan to hike electricity prices, before underscoring that his priority is to protect Ontario jobs.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has threatened a 200% tariff on any alcohol coming to the US from the European Union (EU) in the latest twist of an escalating trade war.\nThe threat is a response to the EU's plans for a 50% tax on imports of US-produced whiskey as part of its retaliation to Trump's tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports to the US.\nThe US president called for the immediate removal of the EU's \"nasty\" tariff on US whiskey, calling the bloc \"hostile and abusive\" and \"formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States\".\nA European Commission spokesperson said that \"calls are being prepared\" between between the US and the EU to discuss the situation.\nIt confirmed that its trade commissioner, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, had \"reached out to his American counterparts\" after Trump's latest threat.\nThe stand-off marked another escalation of a trade war which has rattled financial markets and raised concerns over the impact on the economies and consumers in many countries around the world, including the US.\nEurope sends more than \u20ac4.5bn ($4.89bn; \u00a33.78bn) worth of wine each year to the US, which is its largest export market, according to the Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en des Entreprises Vins, which represents the European wine industry.\nIgnacio S\u00e1nchez Recarte, secretary-general of the group, said if Trump carried through on his threats, it would destroy the market, costing thousands of jobs.\n\"There is no alternative to sell all this wine,\" he said, pleading with the two sides to \"keep wine out of this fight\".\nThe latest clash came after new US tariffs on steel and aluminium came into effect on Wednesday, hitting imports of the metals with a blanket duty of 25% and ending exemptions from the duties that the US had previously granted for shipments from some countries, including from the EU and Canada.\nCanada and Europe - which are among America's biggest trade partners - called the new taxes unjustified and struck back with their own tariffs on a range of US products. The EU's measures are due to go into force 1 April. \nThe clash reprises a battle that played out during Trump's first term, when he first announced tariffs on steel and aluminium. \nThe EU responded with its own tariffs, including a 25% tax on American whiskey.\nIn the aftermath, whiskey sales to the EU dropped 20%, falling from roughly $552m in 2018 to $440m in 2021, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the US. Trump in turn\nThe tariffs were lifted after Trump left office, after the two sides reached an agreement that exempted a certain amount of European metals from the duties.\nBut Trump has indicated little appetite for deal-making so far, at least when it comes to steel and aluminium.\n\"If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the US will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all wines, champagnes & alcoholic products coming out of France and other EU represented countries,\" he wrote on social media, using all capital letters for some of the message. \nThe targeting of wine and whiskey is symbolic - there are few consumer goods more iconic than French Bordeaux or Tennessee whiskey. From a value standpoint, drinks trade is worth less than some of the other items facing tariffs.\nBut Mary Taylor, a US-based importer of European wines, said the measures would be catastrophic for her business and industry, with an impact that would ripple out to restaurants, bars and distributors across the US. \n\"It just looks like a big, giant threat to our livelihoods,\"  she said.\nMs Taylor, who brings in 2 million bottles a year, weathered the 25% tariff Trump put on certain EU bottles during his first term by expanding her distribution in Europe, but she said, \"200% is a whole different ball game\".\nShares in the US fell again on Thursday. \nThe S&P 500 dropped nearly 1.4%, taking it down roughly 10% from its most recent peak - a milestone known as a correction. The Dow slumped 1.3%, while the Nasdaq dropped almost 2%. \nIn Europe, London's FTSE 100 was flat, while Germany's Dax ended about 0.5% lower. \nIn Paris, the Cac 40 fell 0.6%, as shares of major spirit-makers were hit, with Pernod Ricard down 4% and Hennessy cognac maker LVMH falling 1.1%.\nIn interviews with US business media on Thursday, White House officials blamed the EU for escalating the dispute.\n\"Why are Europeans picking on Kentucky bourbon or Harley-Davidson motorcycles? It's disrespectful,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg Television, describing the back-and-forth as \"off the topic\".\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that a trade war was likely to inflict more economic pain on the EU than on the US, dismissing concerns that the clash could spiral.\n\"One or two items, with one trading bloc \u2013 I'm not sure why that's a big deal for the markets,\" he said.\nIn an interview with the BBC's HardTalk, European central bank president Christine Lagarde, said that the EU had \"no choice\" but to retaliate.\n\"At the moment, everybody is positioning,\" she said, adding that she expected the two sides to sit down and negotiate.\n\"Everybody will suffer\" if the dispute were to develop into a full blown trade war, she warned.\nSo far, Trump has shown little tolerance for retaliation from countries over the tariffs he has introduced.\nEarlier this week, he blasted Canada with the threat of a 50% tariff on its steel and aluminium after the Canadian province of Ontario responded to new tariffs with a surcharge on electricity exports to the US.\nHe rescinded that threat after Ontario agreed to suspend the charges.\nFormer Trump adviser Stephen Moore, now an economist with the Heritage Foundation, said he thought the EU would have to make a concession to defuse the situation, noting that Trump had consistently voiced concerns about rules on agricultural products.\n\"Absolutely this is going to end up with a deal,\" he said. \"It's only a question if it ends up in a deal in a day, a week, a month or six months, but there will eventually be a negotiated settlement.\" \nThe full HARDtalk will be available from 14 March on the BBC News Channel, iPlayer, the World Service and as a podcast.",

        "article_text": "US officials are headed to Russia to discuss a potential ceasefire in Ukraine, according to President Donald Trump. \nThe news comes after Ukrainian officials agreed to a 30-day ceasefire following a highly anticipated meeting with American officials in Saudi Arabia. \nEarlier, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the \"ball is truly in their [Russia's] court\" and that the US believes the only way to end the fighting is through peace negotiations. \nThe Kremlin has said it was studying the ceasefire proposal, and that a phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is possible. \nFollowing the meeting in Jeddah on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky said it was now up to the US to convince Russia to agree to the \"positive\" proposal.\nSpeaking alongside Ireland's Taoiseach - or Prime Minister - Miche\u00e1l Martin in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump said he had received  \"positive messages\" about the possibility of a ceasefire. \n\"But a positive message means nothing,\" he said. \"This is a very serious situation.\" \nTrump did not specify which officials were travelling to Moscow.\nHowever, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at the White House that National Security Secretary Mike Waltz had spoken to his Russian counterpart. \nEarlier this week, a source familiar told the BBC that Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff would head to Moscow for negotiations following the talks in Jeddah. \nThe White House confirmed the plans on Wednesday. \n\"We urge the Russians to sign on to this plan. This is the closest we have been to peace in this war,\" Leavitt said. \nThe Kremlin has said it is studying the proposed ceasefire and further details, which spokesman Dmitry Peskov said will come \"via various channels\" over the course of the next several days. \nIn the Oval Office, Trump said that he believes a ceasefire would make sense for Russia, adding - without further details - that there is a \"lot of downside to Russia\" as well.\n\"We have a very complex situation solved on one side. Pretty much solved.

        "article_text": "The fabled route leading to Machu Picchu is one of the world's most jaw-droppingly beautiful treks \u2013 but it's also plagued by controversies that travellers can avoid.\nAt 2,840m above sea level, the trail leaves the rushing Urubamba River that carves Cusco's Sacred Valley and winds its way uphill. It ascends past Andean cloud forests to Warmiwa\u00f1usca, the infamous \"Dead Woman's Pass\" at 4,215m, before descending to the ancient Inca citadel of Machu Picchu, one of the Seven New Wonders of the World.\nThis is the legendary Inca Trail, South America's most popular hike and one of the world's most jaw-droppingly beautiful treks. In an effort to protect the path, which was designed and built more than 600 years ago by Inca engineers, the Peruvian government limits the number of passes available to visitors during the trail's March-to-January opening (the trail opens 31 March 2025). As a result, every year permits for the 43km hike sell out quickly as travellers try to secure one of the roughly 200 daily passes allocated daily for tourists.\nIronically, the Inca Trail's popularity contrasts with frequent protests that often leave hundreds of travellers stranded, as the porters tasked with hauling hikers' gear across the mountains petition for better working conditions. While these protests rarely reach English-language publications, the Porters' Voice Collective (an organisation aiming to elevate the rights of Inca Trail workers) released a documentary in 2024 detailing these struggles.\nHow can such an idyllic place hike generate so much conflict? According to the trail's Indigenous guides, the problem is a lack of law enforcement governing porters' working conditions.\nSince mules are prohibited on the Inca Trail because their hooves would destroy the ancient stone paving and stairs, trekkers are required to hire porters to haul their camping equipment. Porters' days often begin at 05:00 and end after 22:00. While a 2022 law mandates that porters receive s/650 Peruvian Nuevo Soles (\u00a3140 or $176) for the four-day trek, very few trekking agencies abide by this and pay as little as s/350 (\u00a375 or $95) per trek. Since the law was passed, trekking agency lawyers have been fighting it, and in the meantime refusing to pay the legal wage.\nInca Trail permits\nTrekking independently on the Inca Trail isn't allowed. Instead, travellers must obtain a permit and hire porters through a licensed tour operator such as Evolution Treks Peru or Intrepid Travel.\nIn addition to trekking agencies not compensating porters properly, many companies require their porters to carry more weight than the 20kg maximum that is also stipulated in the law.\n\"Most [male] porters carry about 30kg, and I've seen 40kg packs,\" says Natalia Amao Huillca, who has been guiding travellers along the Inca Trail since 2007. \"About 80% of the injuries I see in porters are knee injuries. The others are mostly back injuries. They frequently ask me for pain pills in the evening.\"\nAccording to Cenovia Quispe Flores, who has worked as a porter for Evolution Treks Peru since 2018, \"The law for women is 15kg,\" but she says she has seen women working for other companies carrying 25 to 30kg. To get around weight limits, many companies either send gear around the first checkpoint where porters' backpacks are weighed or simply pay those off who enforce these limits.\n\"In theory, the checkpoint is strict, but in practice, it's not strict for everybody,\" explains Shandira Arque Lucana, who has guided hikers on the Inca Trail since 2016. She says that big companies cut deals with people working the checkpoints but that small companies don't have enough influence to evade enforcement.\nThoughtful Travel\nWant to travel better?\u00a0Thoughtful Travel\u00a0is a series on the ways people behave while away, from ethics to etiquette and more.\nEven companies that want to play by the rules can find themselves stymied by the strict limit of 500 total people (which includes 300 non-tourist porters and guides) allowed on the trail each day. Sometimes there is extra weight but no way to add an extra porter.\n\"I've seen many porters working with hernias, bad knees and ankle problems,\" says Pedro, a guide who asked not to be identified by his real name. \"I know a porter who became an alcoholic because he couldn't get treatment for his injured knee. He still works on the Inca Trail, and he dulls the pain with ca\u00f1azo (a liquor made from sugarcane)\".\nPorters also suffer from dehydration. They drink unclean water from streams and handwashing taps near bathrooms, though paying customers get filtered and boiled water.\nWith all this in mind, what should travellers know if they want to trek South America's most famous ruins in a responsible, ethical way? According to local guides, the first thing to remember is that there are other treks that lead to Machu Picchu.\n\"The Inca Trail is not the only option,\" says Liz Montesinos Pumayalle, who has worked as a guide on the Inca Trail for eight years and notes that mules are used instead of porters on all other trails. \"People who want to connect with Indigenous communities should hike the Lares Trek. The Salkantay Trek (which has two options that connect to Machu Picchu directly and other routes that connect indirectly) is best for people who want to sleep in eco-domes or lodges, rather than tents.\"\nAmao Huillca notes that companies who hire many female porters often treat their staff better than those who only have one or none. \"I like working with porter teams that are half women and have a woman head porter,\" she says. \"Most companies send one or two token women porters.\" She says that because female porters are more inclined to go to a doctor when they're injured than their male colleagues, tourists who request women porters are more likely to trek with healthier porters.\n\"One way to ensure that porters are treated and paid well is for there to be women porters,\" echoes Inca Trail guide Edson Lucana Mej\u00eda. He explains that it has historically been common for male porters to sleep in the dining tent, which doesn't have a floor and is often muddy. Women usually insist on individual tents, so in a team with more women, you can be sure that more porters have a decent place to sleep. \u00a0\nMarco Antonio Carri\u00f3n, who has been guiding treks on the Inca Trail for 20 years offers other recommendations. \"Look for photos of porters with ergonomic backpacks and for reviews that mention something about how porters are treated,\" he says. \"If a company is sustainable and treats the porters well, it will show in the online reviews.\"\nThe lighter, the better\nMany operators still require porters to carry heavy canvas tents, tables and chairs. When considering a company, ask how much their camping equipment weighs and if they have lightweight options.\nIn addition, Carri\u00f3n says travellers should ask if porters are required to wear their employer's uniforms. While it may be a small detail in some cultures, for many Indigenous Peruvians, traditional Quechua clothing is an important part of their identity.\nDespite allegations of mistreatment by certain Inca Trail operators, many guides and porters not only feel fulfilled, but also fortunate to work in such a stunning natural setting. \"I love this work\" says Quispe Flores. \"I like the mountains and working with my friends, the other women porters. Working in agriculture is harder and doesn't pay.\"\nWhile it isn't always easy to determine which companies follow the law and which don't, Lucana Mej\u00eda has one message he wishes the many thousands of travellers hoping to hike the fabled route will remember: \"Without porters, there is no Inca Trail.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Miniature models of Belfast's lost theatres created by set designer Stuart Marshall are bringing the city's vibrant theatre history back into the the limelight. \nThey are part of an exhibition at Ulster University for the Children's Festival. \nMr Marshall told BBC News NI that the models, which are made from cardboard, have a cross generational appeal.\n\"Children appreciate the miniature dolls house type model making, adults appreciate the skill that goes into making them, and older people who may remember when some of these places still stood.\" \n\"It all started as a lockdown project,\" Mr Marshall told BBC News NI. \n\"I started working on a model of the Grand Opera House as part of the heritage exhibition and through doing that got interested in looking at all the other theatres that aren't about anymore.\"\nThe models are \"mostly made of different types of cardboard, like mounting card or coloured paper and then they're glued together\".\n\"The Hippodrome was the most complicated and detailed one I've made, it took me around six weeks to make.\"\nHe said he mostly works from old photographs, but it can be hard to get enough accurate detail because \"with a black and white photograph that you can't move around, it's basically static\". \nWhen photographs of the old theatres are not available or poor quality, Mr Marshall refers to old newspaper articles which sometimes have written descriptions of what materials the theatre was built from and how it appeared. \nOpening in the early 1870s, the Alhambra was Belfast's first music hall and was a \"real spit on the floor type joint\", according to Mr Marshall. \n\"In the early days, the Alhambra was more of a variety house, and I've heard that it wasn't the most enticing establishment, quite a rowdy place.\n\"The Alhambra didn't cater for the more refined clientele,\" he added. \nA typical bill from the early days of the Alhambra shows performances which \"would nowadays be contentious\" included events such as a minstrel show and a Japanese troupe. \n\"I've seen other things listed, which were more overtly racist, but that was kind of the way at the time,\" he added.\nTo adapt to the evolution of mass entertainment, the Alhambra converted to a full time cinema house in 1936. \nBetween the late 1800s and it's closure in 1959, the Alhambra suffered four separate fires. \nThe Theatre Royal was Belfast's original high-end theatre, opening in the late 1700s with a capacity of just over 1,000. \nThe building was demolished and rebuilt a number of times.\n\"As these places go, they kept getting burnt down or demolished and rebuilt again - there's always a renewal aspect to them.\"\nThe Theatre Royal was to be Belfast's \"higher class establishment\", which in the end became \"a mixed-use building of shops and place called the 'boom boom room', which was like a dance hall upstairs, which then became the starlight ballroom upstairs\". \n\"Now,  there's a little Starbucks in the corner where the building stood,\" he added.\nNot to be mistaken with the pub and music hall on Botanic Avenue, The Empire Theatre was situated on Victoria Square and opened to the public in 1894. \nAccording to Mr Marshall, the Empire \"operated at a similar time to the Alhambra from the 1890s up until the early 1960s, and then it was it was knocked down.\n\"It was eventually replaced by a Little Woods department store, which has been redeveloped again and again, until finally becoming Victoria Square shopping centre.\" \nWhile it did adapt to the growing popularity of cinema, The Empire \"stayed true to theatre for all of its life\", Mr Marshall said. \nThe Hippodrome was \"more fiddly [model to make] than some of the other ones\". \nMr Marshall describes how there aren't too many quality photographs of the Hippodrome, so he \"had to use his judgement\" when designing the model in terms of colour scheme and scale. \nComing quite late, the \"Hippodrome was was built in 1907 originally with a cinema in mind\" as to take full advantage of the advent of modern cinema and growing popularity of picture shows. \n\"And then there was the Ritz...\" which opened in 1938. \nThe Ritz was, according to Mr Marshall, \"a giant cinema more or less, but it called itself the Ritz Theatre\". However, it did produce shows as part of the night's entertainment. \n\"They would have a brass band, dancers or a ballet, and then a film at the end.\"\n\"It also did huge concerts, people like the Stones, The Beatles and Billy Connolly all performed at the Ritz during their time,\" he added. \nIt was the biggest in Northern Ireland at the time, with just over 2,000 capacity. \nThe Ritz was damaged by bombs hidden in the seats and the theatres interior and roof was destroyed in 1977. \nThe Belfast 'Young at Art' Children's Festival finishes on 15 March.

We need to sit down and move this forward.\"\nIn his social media post early on Tuesday, which threatened to double levies on Canadian steel and aluminium, Trump said he was responding to Ford's moves. \nHe also criticised Canada for relying on the US for \"military protection\", and reiterated that he wanted the country to become the 51st US state.\nHe added that it \"would make all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear\" if Canada were to join the US as a state.\nThe White House declared the episode a win, saying in a statement that Trump had \"once again used the leverage of the American economy, which is the best and biggest in the world, to deliver a win for the American people\".\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.\nThe companies that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government. \nThe back-and-forth came during a turbulent time for markets.\nThe S&P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US fell a further 0.7% on Tuesday after dropping 2.7% on Monday, which was its biggest one-day drop since December.\nThe UK's FTSE 100 share index, which had edged lower earlier on Tuesday, fell further following Trump's latest comments and closed down more than 1%. The French Cac 40 index and German Dax followed a similar pattern.\nMonday's stock market sell-off had begun after Trump said the economy was in a \"transition\" when asked about whether the US was heading for a recession.\nInvestors have been concerned about the economic effects of Trump's trade policies, which it is feared could push up inflation in the US and beyond, while uncertainty leads to economic paralyisis.\nEven before Tuesday's comments, Trump's tariffs had already been causing concern for US businesses.\nOn Monday, Jason Goldstein, founder of Icarus Brewing, a small beer-maker in New Jersey that employs 50 people, told the BBC that previous tariff announcements had prompted a slew of emails from his suppliers. \nThey have been warning that price increases for everything from grain and aluminium cans are likely to be coming.\nMr Goldstein has stockpiled an extra month's supply of cans and held off on new purchases as a result of the uncertainty and rapidly changing situation.\n\"It's definitely a worrying time for us,\" he said.\n\"Never before in my life have I had to read so much news, watch so much news to know, here's what my industry's going to look like tomorrow.\"",

        "article_text": "Former Tate Modern director Vicente Todol\u00ed founded Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3 to preserve rare citrus varieties and compile a catalogue of farming knowledge to inspire future generations.\nOur preconceptions of lemons are very rarely challenged. But on a crisp November morning on Spain's leafy Valencian coastline, Vicente Todol\u00ed is showing me the secret side of citrus \u2013\u00a0and it's unlike anything I've seen on supermarket shelves.\nThe most weird and wonderful specimens are arranged on a table in his Sun-soaked orchard. There's one shaped like an octopus with fat tentacles, a wart-covered citron the size of a newborn baby and a colourful pear-shaped fruit splattered in a tie-dye of green and yellow.\u00a0\nThey're not at all what I was expecting, and they're not entirely safe, either. \"You will get burned,\" Todol\u00ed warns, pointing at a grass-greenbergamot. The oil is phototoxic, causing\u00a0 the skin to burn if it's exposed to UV light (it isn't dangerous to eat, but it is very acidic). \"Want to taste?\" he asks. I hold a slice up to the sun and eye it suspiciously; the golden segments light up like a stained-glass window. I tip my head back and squeeze drops into my mouth, being careful not to touch my lips. Eye-watering acidic needles stab my tongue. I'm reeling and wiping away tears, but Todol\u00ed is already on to the next fruit, squeezing the pearly contents of a finger lime into my hand. The little balls pop like lime-flavoured caviar in my mouth.\nThere are hundreds more unusual fruits to try at Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3, a not-for-profit farm dedicated to researching and preserving rare citrus varieties. Hidden on a sleepy street in the town of Palmera, this is Todol\u00ed's passion project. He was born and raised on this farm, going on to study art history before serving as director at esteemed galleries such as Tate Modern in London and Milan's Pirelli HangarBicocca, where he works today.\nNow, Todol\u00ed considers himself a fifth-generation orange farmer. He's fiercely protective of his old family farm, which is one of the reasons Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3 came to be. In 2010, a project was launched to raze Palmera's orange groves to make room for real estate. He tried to derail it through official channels and lost. \"I was called a romantic enemy of progress,\" he recalls. But Todol\u00ed did not desist. Changing tack, he began buying plots of land. Some were abandoned patches of weeds and others were established orchards. He acquired around 4.5 hectares in total, an impenetrable fortress of precious farmland. \"When I started it was a matter of urgency, I had to save the land,\" he says.\nAround the same time, Todol\u00ed was working as cultural advisor to Ferran Adri\u00e0, former head chef of the iconic (and sadly closed) El Bulli (once-billed as the world's best restaurant). One day, the pair visited a garden on the outskirts of Perpignan which had more than 400 types of citrus trees, some exceedingly rare. The south of France is a little too chilly for citrus, so the trees are planted in pots. In summer they bask outside, and in October the gardeners heave them into a greenhouse to keep warm. During their visit Todol\u00ed asked, \"How is it possible that they have done this amazing project with citrus, and in my area no one has done it?\" Adri\u00e0 replied: \"Why not do it yourself?\"\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nTodol\u00ed was inspired. He knew Palmera had the perfect microclimate for citrus; there would be no need for pots. Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3 is 3km from the sea and backed by a ripple of mountains. When the warm wind travels across the Mediterranean Sea, it becomes humid, and when it hits the mountains, it drops bathtubs of rain. The water trickles down the mountainside to Palmera, absorbing organic matter along the way. The fertile, nutrient-rich soil is known as alluvial soil, and Todol\u00ed is blessed with buckets of it.\nPalmera's crisp mornings also help to balance the flavour of fruit, Todol\u00ed explains. \"In January it's one or two degrees in the morning and around 20C in the afternoon. That's what creates the balance between acidity and sweetness. If you're in Florida, for example, it's too hot. They're sweeter but they're bland. In Japan, it's colder so they have more acidity. Here and Sicily are the perfect areas for citrus.\"\nPlan your trip:\nTours cost \u20ac15 for adults and \u20ac10 for children up to 15 and are available from around November to April (depending on when the fruit matures).

The closest airport is Valencia Airport; it takes around an hour to drive from Valencia city centre to Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3.\u00a0\nFor inspiration, he turned to history's most illustrious citrus gardens. He studied the Italian gardens of the Medici family in the 1500s and opulent Arabic palaces like the Alhambra. \"For the Arabs, gardens appealed to the senses. It was a paradise on Earth, an immersive experience,\" says Todol\u00ed.\u00a0\nLikewise, the sights, smells and sounds of Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3 seduce visitors. Chirping locusts the size of frogs hop in the mallow and honeybees buzz between wildflowers. While licking sour juice from fingertips, there's a soundtrack of water trickling along an ancient Arabic irrigation route and the frenetic chirping of goldfinches in the aviary. The zesty scent of lemons perfumes visitors' hands for the rest of the day.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n\u2022\u00a0Spain's accidental tourist attraction\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\nThere are other farms nearby, but they don't look like this. The surrounding countryside is an orderly grid of single-crop fields, with rows upon rows of orange trees. Spain is the world's leading exporter of citrus, shipping around 4 million tonnes a year. In order to produce such vast quantities, most farms lean heavily on mono-cropping, which can leave soil depleted and plants more vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Todol\u00ed Citrus Fundaci\u00f3, on the other hand, is a genetic diversity bank; a motley bunch of more than 500 varieties. Some of the rarest plants include ancient Valencian orange trees used as rootstock. The grafts were made around 150 years ago and Todol\u00ed cut the scion back to allow the roots to grow freely.\n\"It's like Jurassic Park,\" he says. \"We can see resurrected varieties that were in extinction.\"\nAs well as tours of the farm, the garden comes alive with events throughout the year. Poets read stanzas on a stage decorated with lemons at the annual Poec\u00edtrics festival (14 June 2025), while Cine de Vanguardia is a celebration of experimental cinema.\u00a0\nBack on the tour, and Todol\u00ed's right-hand man Ton Gjekaj is waiting at the final tasting table. He has cut the last slices of fruit. There are wedges of passionfruit-tasting trifoliate orange, apple-sour calamansi and rosewater-scented Palestinian sweet lime, still warm from the Sun. I greedily eat them all, popping whole carpels into my mouth. I try to jot down the flavours but by now my notepad is covered in juice, my camera's buttons sticky.\nThere's just time to peep inside The Laboratory, a high-tech kitchen and library. This is a hub of experimentation, used by experts from around the world who come to play with Todol\u00ed's extraordinary pantry. Chefs make ice cream from bergamots; bartenders pickle lemon rind for gin and tonics; and perfumiers extract oils from nearly extinct oranges.\nAgustina Basilico Miara, head of beverage at London's Toklas restaurant, has visited three times and says she always goes home with new ideas. \"It's incredible. Every time we go, we take as many people as possible from the restaurant,\" Miara says. \"Especially after being in cloudy London, to arrive in an explosion of colours is super inspiring.\"\nMiara uses leftover peel from the kitchen (like fragrant blood orange and chandler red pomelo) to make a tea, which she turns into a syrup. She uses it for a variety of cocktails, like her zingy take on the classic whisky highball. \"We've also done a martini with chinotto. The vodka is infused with chinotto and then we candy the fruit,\" Miara says. \"It adds another layer, like an olive brine element to the flavour, it's very aromatic.\"\u00a0\nAfter flicking through some books (every mention of citrus has been bookmarked, resulting in a pleasing rainbow of Post-it notes along the spines) we conclude the tour by tasting marmalade. The most delicious is made from Borneo lemon \u2013 not technically a lemon, but a cross between a pomelo and a key lime. Delicate and creamy, the marmalade tastes like well-balanced lemon curd.\nFor Todol\u00ed, this open-air gallery is his legacy. It's a place to challenge preconceptions, encourage biodiversity and foster local culture. \"For me, it's like a museum where you don't have to refresh the collection because it changes every day,\" he says. \"People think that citrus is what they see in the supermarkets. They don't know that it started eight million years ago, that it's one of the oldest fruits in the world. It has been so important in literature, poetry and art.\"\nTodol\u00ed can see the art of citrus \u2013\u00a0and from his otherworldly orchard, he's helping the rest of the world to see it too.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Sleep can have a significant impact on athlete performance at the highest level\nGood sleep hygiene is a crucial competent of any top-level athlete's approach to fitness and wellbeing.\nPoor quality sleep can have a negative physical and mental impact, hindering an athlete's performance. But manage sleep well, and they can maximise their ability.\nFor World Sleep Day - 14 March - BBC Sport spoke to a sleep expert and international athlete to find out how elite sportspeople manage their sleep, and how you can improve yours.\nAccording to the NHS, adults require between seven and nine hours of sleep per night.\nGiven the changeable schedules athletes in elite sports are subject to, sticking to a strict sleep routine can be very difficult.\nThat means maintaining as much consistency as possible, even when on the road, can have a huge benefit.\nRemi Mobed, a physiotherapist with an expertise in sleep who has worked with the England men's national teams in football and rugby, supports the Ineos Grenadiers cycling team.\nHe says their approach is the \"gold standard\" for managing sleep in elite-level sport.\n\"In a group stage of a Tour de France, the cyclists are going to be in approximately 20 different hotels over the course of 22 days,\" he says.\n\"Each of those cyclists has their own dehumidifier, their own mattress, their own duvet and their own pillow that come as a travel pack. The team travels with that and the soigneur goes ahead and prepares the athlete's room for them prior to arrival, every day for 22 days.\n\"The reality for other team sports is to do the basics as well as you can, like getting the athletes to travel with an eye mask and their own pillow from home.\"\nIneos Grenadiers' Carlos Rodriguez, who benefits from Mobed's insight, finished seventh in the 2024 Tour de France\nDoubles tennis player Neal Skupski - a three-time Wimbledon champion - travels all over the world on the ATP Tour. For him, the constant change of location is part of the challenge.\n\"You're sleeping in a different bed each week - some mattresses hard, some soft,\" the 35-year-old says. \n\u201cFor a lot of the guys [the problem] is the pillows - they can mess you up. You can wake up with a bad neck and then you can't turn, and that hurts you especially on the serve.\n\"In the Olympic village in Paris last summer, one of the manufacturers allowed people to go to them and change the mattress hardness or softness. There was a line way out the door of athletes going in, testing the bed, trying to get a softer or harder one that suited them. The queue was so long I couldn't believe my eyes!\"\nCompeting worldwide requires athletes to traverse time zones and adjust their sleep schedules accordingly. So far in 2025, Skupski has played in Australia, Japan, Qatar, the UAE, and the US.\n\"People see players at tournaments on TV and sometimes think that they should be playing better, but it is probably down to the fact that their body is just knackered,\" the Liverpudlian says.\n\"I stay up as long as possible on a plane. Then if I get to Australia 12 o'clock in the afternoon, I would definitely stay up all day until around 10pm, just trying getting on the new time zone straight away.\n\"For the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, Andy Murray was trying to get on time zone back in the UK a week in advance. So he was getting up around 2am and then starting his day, which I found crazy. But then he had a much better sleep when he got to Tokyo than me, so maybe I should have listened to him.\u201d\nMobed adds: \"As a general rule, if you're jumping three time zones, your body is able to cope with it. On top of that, it takes an athlete one day per hour that they've travelled to adjust.\n\"So if the difference is seven hours, the first three are fine to adjust to, and then it would be four days for the final four hours to be fully adjusted. Going across to Australia or New Zealand, 12 or 13 hours ahead, then that is a much bigger task.\"\nSkupski has represented Great Britain in the Davis Cup around the world since 2019\nIn team sports, athletes often share hotel rooms with a team-mate while travelling to away matches or international competitions.\n\"Coaches overlook sleep as a major factor,\" Mobed says. \"They often partner the strikers together, for instance, or the fly-halves, because the coaches want them to be discussing tactics. It is a mentorship system, thinking, 'this young kid can learn from Harry Kane through small conversations in the hotel room'.\n\"But the hotel room is not somewhere that should be done. That should be a place that is sacrosanct for the athletes to be in a relaxed state.\n\"You need to figure out who are the night owls and who are the morning larks. It is no good putting people in at the opposite end of the scale.\"\nAccording to NHS data, more than a million people in the UK were prescribed medication to help with sleep in 2023. Addiction to sleeping pills can lead to withdrawal symptoms including anxiety, panic attacks, sweating, headaches and shaking.\nBrentford captain Christian Norgaard revealed he feared becoming addicted to sleeping pills during his time with Brondby in his native Denmark, saying a sleep coach helped him avoid developing a serious problem.\n\"Sleeping pills are a really taboo subject in sport,\" Mobed says. \"There are many athletes, unfortunately, that are addicted to these sleep-enhancing meds.\n\"I think there is a time and a place for them, but the basics of sleep hygiene must be addressed first. Athletes often won't prioritise sleep, because they know that they can go to the doctor and get a sleeping pill.\n\"They can stay in your system for quite a prolonged period after you wake up. So let's say it gets to 1am and you're not sleeping so you take some of these meds - they are definitely still in your system the next morning.\"\nMelatonin is a hormone which can also be taken as a supplement to help sleep, but despite some of his doubles partners using it in the past, Skupski prefers to manage his sleep naturally\nNot everybody needs to be as precise about their sleep hygiene as an elite athlete, but getting good-quality sleep is important for the health and wellbeing of everyone.\n\"Naps should be no more than 40 minutes long, ideally 20,\" Mobed offers as a key tip. \"Some people will nap for one hour, two hours, three hours during the day, and that will have a massive detrimental effect.\n\"You've got this napping vicious cycle - sleeping too much in the day can actually completely put out your rhythm, and then at night you're not going to sleep well. You're then being counter-productive because the drowsiness goes into the next day.\"\nFor Skupski, one crucial change has made a big difference.\n\"I was waking up in the middle of the night and thinking, 'why am I wide awake?',\u201c he says.\n\"I was having coffee too late at night - having dinner and then a coffee around 7 or 8pm. One of the doctors told me you shouldn't be taking in coffee after 4pm because caffeine can stay in your system for eight hours.\"",

Now, 20 years on, the former Leicester Tigers prop remembers how it all felt \"so surreal\" when he was rushed to Northampton General Hospital.\nThe injury left Hampson only able to breathe through a ventilator and as \"bizarre and scary\" as that struck him at the time, he admits he was momentarily distracted from the life-changing chaos of it all.\n\"Having my England kit that I was so proud of being cut off me with scissors was a small trivial thing I was thinking of,\" Hampson told BBC East Midlands Today.\n\"I was so proud of playing for England with the rose on my chest, and then having that kit cut off me, I was just thinking of that rather than thinking of myself.\"\nHampson had started the day - 15 March, 2005 - by slipping that England shirt on as one of the nation's finest rising rugby union prospects.\nIt was with the academy at Leicester Tigers, a club renowned for developing forwards of fierce pedigree, that Hampson worked hard to gain that reputation.\n\"I wasn't a natural rugby player, but I wanted it, I was hungry for it and was passionate about it,\" he said.\n\"Rugby was my purpose and what I could do to channel my energy. I felt like it was my calling.\"\nHampson reflects on foundation's work as he turns 40\nI was too busy to die - Hampson\n'Get busy living or get busy dying' - Hampson reflects on injury 10 years on \nThat calling, however, was silenced in harrowing circumstances which sent him in a different direction.\nHe would go on to spend 18 months at Stoke Mandeville Hospital - home of the National Spinal Injuries Centre - and after that he said there was \"a lot of soul searching\" about what would come next.\n\"You are a rugby player, so to redefine yourself was massively important,\" he said.\n\"It was obviously a turning point in my life and initially I struggled to justify why it happened to me and why life would never be the same again. But now I understand.\"\nHe says this while at the Get Busy Living Centre, a state-of-the art facility that he is the driving force behind, which offers total support to those in a similar situation.\nThe centre, which is nestled among farmland outside Melton Mowbray in rural Leicestershire, is also home of the foundation set up in Hampson's name.\n\"I come into the driveway and see the foundation and centre and this is what it's all about,\" he said.\n\"This is why it happened. Realising how much support I had and how many people that I'd be able to help and influence, just through my journey and my story - to show people that there is a great life to be had in this situation.\"\nMatt Hampson was awarded an OBE in 2022 and received an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Leicester in January\nIt was the support that Hampson got after his accident that made him realise what could be possible.\nIn hospital he was visited by so many people that he ended up needing a booking system to stay on top of it all. As a high-profile injury that rocked the rugby world, there was also a lot of money donated to help him and his family cope.\nHe knew he was \"blessed\" to be in that position, but also saw that many were not so fortunate.\n\"It didn't just come to me straightaway,\" Hampson said of plans for his foundation and the centre. \"The trust fund was sort of thrust upon me where people were raising money for me. \n\"I felt very grateful for that and I felt that I needed to give something back. The natural progression for the trust was to turn into a foundation, a charity to help other people.\n\"The most worthwhile thing we can do in our life is to make an impression on someone else's life.\"\nHow many people the foundation and centre have supported over the years, Hampson can't put an exact number on.\nBut it is hundreds who have sought access to expert physiotherapists, specialist personal trainers, wellbeing support and other tailored healthy living advice at the centre.\nAccommodation has been set up there recently to help offer even greater levels of access, and there are further redevelopment plans for the site and aspirations to expand its reach with satellite centres around the country.\nSome people who have come through the centre have even gone on establish themselves as athletes, competing at the Paralympic Games. Among them are Nick Cummins and Jamie Stead, who were both part of ParalympicsGB's gold medal-winning wheelchair rugby side at the Tokyo games in 2021.\nGraham Lee, a Grand National-winning jockey who suffered a spinal injury in 2024 in a riding accident, went direct to the centre from hospital to start his rehabilitation.\n\"The second I got out of the van, Matt was there,\" Lee said. \"He is a class act in every way.\"\nWhen Hampson turned 40 last year, he spoke of his pride in how he, and those he works with, have \"shaken things up for the disability world\".\n\"The world is a lot more inclusive. You were just existing back then,\" Hampson said when reflecting on the support he received after he first left hospital with his injury.\n\"Now you can get busy living and you can do things. It's a challenge, every day is a challenge, but it makes it enjoyable and makes it worthwhile.\n\"You feel like you are actually getting somewhere, actually changing the world for disabled people but also changing the world for a lot of other people as well.\n\"I'm immensely proud of what we do here.\"\nNatalie Jackson, BBC East Midlands Today sports editor:\nI have been covering Matt Hampson's story for 20 years and first met him in Stoke Mandeville Hospital not long after his accident. \nWhen he was first injured he could only communicate by blinking and clicking, and his injury is the worst level of tetraplegia \u2013 paralysed  from the neck down and on a ventilator.  \nHe was in hospital for 18 months and I filmed with him during his last week in hospital before he came home. \nI was nervous about meeting him because I was worried about saying the wrong thing but he instantly put me at ease with his smile, humour and positivity. And that mental strength he has used ever since to change the way people view disability and to shake up the disability world, changing and saving hundreds of lives. \nHe has an incredible ability to know what people need. \nI have seen people take their first steps at his centre and seen him take people from a dark place and transform their lives, proving that you can have a full and incredible life after a spinal injury \u2013 Getting Busy Living.",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump has halted a plan to double US tariffs on Canadian steel and metal imports to 50%, just hours after first threatening them.\nTariffs of 25% still went ahead and took effect on Wednesday.\nThe move by the president comes after the Canadian province of Ontario suspended new charges of 25% on electricity that it sends to some northern states in the US, hours after Trump threatened to sharply increase his tariffs on the country. \nIt marked the latest skirmish in a trade war that risks economic damage to the two North American neighbours. \n\"Cooler heads prevailed,\" Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro told broadcaster CNBC, confirming that Trump would not move forward with his latest tariff threats.\nCanada, one of America's closest trade partners, has borne the brunt of Trump's ire as he has launched trade battles in his first months in office. \nTrump has hit goods from the country, along with Mexico, with a blanket 25% tariff, though he signed orders temporarily exempting a significant number of items from the new duties, which he said were a response to drugs and migrants crossing into the US. \nCanada is also facing 25% tariffs on its steel and aluminium, which are set to go into effect on Wednesday, after Trump said he was ending exemptions to the duties previously granted to some countries. \nCanada has called Trump's attacks unjustified and announced retaliation, including new tariffs on C$30bn ($22bn; \u00a316bn) of US products. \nFord had announced he would tax electricity exports to the US in an effort to get those tariffs removed. \nHe had also previously said he would \"not hesitate to shut off electricity completely\" if the US \"escalates\".\nAnnouncing the decision to suspend the electricity duties, Ford said he thought it was the \"right decision\" to try to focus the discussions on the wider North American free trade deal.\n\"With any negotiation that we have, there's a point that both parties are heated and the temperature needs to come down,\" he said,  thanking Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for contacting him about a meeting.\n\"They understand how serious we are,\" he added. \"We have both agreed, let cooler heads prevail. We need to sit down and move this forward.\"\nIn his social media post early on Tuesday, which threatened to double levies on Canadian steel and aluminium, Trump said he was responding to Ford's moves. \nHe also criticised Canada for relying on the US for \"military protection\", and reiterated that he wanted the country to become the 51st US state.\nHe added that it \"would make all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear\" if Canada were to join the US as a state.\nThe White House declared the episode a win, saying in a statement that Trump had \"once again used the leverage of the American economy, which is the best and biggest in the world, to deliver a win for the American people\".\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.\nThe companies that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government. \nThe back-and-forth came during a turbulent time for markets.\nThe S&P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US fell a further 0.7% on Tuesday after dropping 2.7% on Monday, which was its biggest one-day drop since December.\nThe UK's FTSE 100 share index, which had edged lower earlier on Tuesday, fell further following Trump's latest comments and closed down more than 1%. The French Cac 40 index and German Dax followed a similar pattern.\nMonday's stock market sell-off had begun after Trump said the economy was in a \"transition\" when asked about whether the US was heading for a recession.\nInvestors have been concerned about the economic effects of Trump's trade policies, which it is feared could push up inflation in the US and beyond, while uncertainty leads to economic paralyisis.\nEven before Tuesday's comments, Trump's tariffs had already been causing concern for US businesses.\nOn Monday, Jason Goldstein, founder of Icarus Brewing, a small beer-maker in New Jersey that employs 50 people, told the BBC that previous tariff announcements had prompted a slew of emails from his suppliers. \nThey have been warning that price increases for everything from grain and aluminium cans are likely to be coming.\nMr Goldstein has stockpiled an extra month's supply of cans and held off on new purchases as a result of the uncertainty and rapidly changing situation.\n\"It's definitely a worrying time for us,\" he said.\n\"Never before in my life have I had to read so much news, watch so much news to know, here's what my industry's going to look like tomorrow.\"",

        "article_text": "The US Department of Education is planning to cut about half of its workforce, as the Trump administration works to slash the size of the federal government.\nThe mass layoffs will affect nearly 2,100 people who are set to be placed on leave from 21 March.\nTrump has long sought to eliminate the department, a long-cherished goal of some conservatives, but such an action would require approval by Congress. \nThe department, which has an annual budget of around $238bn (\u00a3188bn), employs more than 4,000 people.\nEstablished in 1979, the department oversees funding for public schools, administers student loans and runs programmes that help low-income students.\nBut Trump has accused the agency of \"indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial, sexual, and political material\".\nA common misconception is that the department operates US schools and sets curricula - that is done by states and local districts.\nAnd a relatively small percentage of funding for primary and secondary schools  - about 13% - comes from federal funds. The majority is made up from states and local groups.\nThe agency also plays a prominent role in administering and overseeing the federal student loans used by millions of Americans to pay for higher education.\n\"As part of the Department of Education's final mission, the department today initiated a reduction in force impacting nearly 50% of the department's workforce,\" a statement from Education Secretary Linda McMahon said on Tuesday.\nShe said the cuts would impact all divisions in the department and were made to \"better serve students, parents, educators, and taxpayers\". \nThe agency had 4,133 employees when Trump was sworn into office, an announcement from the department states. It has the smallest staff of all the 15 US cabinet-level agencies.\nAfter the cuts, 2,183 people would remain, which included several hundred who retired or accepted a buyout programme earlier this year, the agency said. \nThe notice to employees said that all of those who are laid off would continue to receive their normal pay and benefits until 9 June, as well as a severance package or retirement pay based on how long they'd worked at the department.\n\"The Department of Education will continue to deliver on all statutory programs that fall under the agency's purview, including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special needs students, and competitive grantmaking,\" the email states.\nReports have suggested that Trump, for weeks, has considered signing an executive order impacting the Department of Education, though he has not yet done so.\nSeveral of his executive orders have been met with lawsuits, as have Trump's dramatic cuts at agencies around Washington. \nSeveral lawsuits have also challenged actions by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), a team aiming to slash government spending that's being led by Elon Musk. The agency has installed deputies at various agencies, slashed staff and accessed data across the government. \nFor decades, Republicans have floated the idea of axing the Education Department. When Ronald Reagan ran for president in 1980, he pushed for its dismantling. \nIt hasn't been done because it would take an act of Congress to accomplish, which in the current makeup would mean Trump would need Democratic support. \nMany conservatives have pointed to decentralising education and giving states and local governments more power.  \nThe American Federation of Teachers, the nation's most powerful education union, condemned the cuts to the department in a statement.\n\"The massive reduction in force at the Education Department is an attack on opportunity that will gut the agency and its ability to support students, throwing federal education programs into chaos across the country,\" the union's president Randi Weingarten said. \nShe called for Congress and the courts to intervene.",

        "article_text": "PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan met with LIV counterpart Yasir Al Rumayyan and US President Donald Trump last month\nThe Players Championship 2025\nVenue: TPC Sawgrass Date: 13-16 Mar\nCoverage: Live radio and text commentaries of the third and fourth rounds. Follow and listen on the BBC Sport website, app, 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds from 19:30 GMT on 15 March and from 18:00 on 16 March\nWhile negotiations aimed at reunifying men's golf grind to a halt, the PGA Tour is taking steps to speed up play.\nCommissioner Jay Monahan's state of the union news conference, before this week's Players Championship here at Sawgrass, made clear that eradicating slow play has become more of a priority than ever before for a circuit that has always indulged slowcoaches.\nBut this, the tour's marquee tournament, will again be played in the shadow of the ongoing split brought about by the arrival in 2022 of the breakaway LIV tour.\nThis year's Players will play out in the absence of the reigning US Open champion.  Last year the Masters winner was missing and in 2023 there was no title defence.\nThis, of course, is because Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith all play on LIV.\nTheir absence from the PGA Tour is felt more keenly this week than any other. The old debate as to whether the Players is the 'fifth' major is no longer relevant and will not be until the game reunifies.\nHere we have the most stark imperative for a deal to be done with LIV's Saudi backers.\nAn agreement, though, is not imminent. \nMonahan reiterated that no follow-up meetings are in the diary after the recent White House gathering with the Saudi Public Investment Fund's governor Yasir Al Rumayyan ended without settlement.\n\"We appreciate Yasir's innovative vision,\" Monahan said. \"And we can see a future where we welcome him on to our board and work together to move the global game forward.\n\"As part of our negotiations, we believe there's room to integrate important aspects of LIV Golf into the PGA Tour platform. We're doing everything that we can to bring the two sides together.\"\nMonahan added that while his organisation has \"removed some hurdles, others remain\". \nIn other words, something has to give to end the stalemate.\n'Hurdles' in PGA-LIV deal - but Trump 'bolstering' talks\nAnd no matter how hard the golf media tried, the commissioner flat-batted every enquiry as to how that might be achieved.  \nMonahan does not play verbal 'Bazball'; every non-answer dictated by the delicate nature of golf's future.\nWhere he was more forthcoming, was an acceptance - at long last - that men's professional golf has a problem with slow play.  It seems steps are being taken where the biggest offenders will start to be named and shamed.\n\"We've committed to addressing the speed of play,\" Monahan said as he announced working group recommendations that will be implemented to try to erase one of the sport's biggest blights.\n\"We will begin publishing speed-of-play-related statistics later this season,\" he added.  From 14 April testing will begin on the PGA Tour's feeder circuits to impose stroke penalties on the slowest golfers.\nMonahan also confirmed that the use of range finders will be allowed at tournaments between next month's Masters and the US PGA Championship in May to see whether this improves round times.\n\"We're listening to our fans and we're responding, and clearly this is something where they would like to see improvement,\" the commissioner said.\n\"I think there's a real commitment from players across the board to make certain that we're doing everything that we possibly can to improve, and these three steps are just a start.\"\nThis is a marked shift from an organisation that for decades insisted that slow play was not a problem. The rival LIV circuit has imposed stroke penalties on slowcoaches and now the PGA Tour is starting to respond.\n\"I look at this as a very positive development,\" Monahan insisted.\n\"I think it's pretty telling that when you've got six player directors that sit on our boards, and you've got 16 members of our Player Advisory Council, that there's a lot of shaking of heads and there's an understanding that this is an area where we need to improve.\"\nTwo-time major winner Collin Morikawa says publishing data that shows which players are quicker than others, thereby identifying the slowest, is a good idea. \n\"I don't know why you wouldn't want it to be released,\" said the 2021 Open winner.\n\"You just have to start giving guys actual penalties, whether it be strokes or FedExCup (point deductions). What I've learned is that monetary fines are useless.\"\nMorikawa added:  \"What is there to hide, right? If you're slow, you know you're slow. I mean, if you don't know, then there's an issue.\n\"To me, there's no issue with letting it out. It's only going to make things better because then you're either going to have a target on you, put a little more pressure and hopefully you pick it up, or you get penalised. It's very simple.\"\nDouble US PGA Championship winner Justin Thomas agrees that publicly revealing which players are the slowest will have a beneficial effect. \n\"Nobody wants to be known as that,\" said the US Ryder Cup star.\n\"I'm the first to admit I'm on the slow side of players. It bothers me, but I've talked to many officials about it, like I want to know why I'm slow because obviously the first thing that any slower player thinks is that they're not slow.\"\nFans will surely welcome such long-awaited initiatives to improve pace of play on the game's biggest tour.\nBut those awaiting some kind of resolution that brings the game back together are still left playing the waiting game.",

Follow and listen on the BBC Sport website, app, 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds from 19:30 GMT on 15 March and from 18:00 on 16 MarchWhile negotiations aimed at reunifying men's golf grind to a halt, the PGA Tour is taking steps to speed up play.Commissioner Jay Monahan's state of the union news conference, before this week's Players Championship here at Sawgrass, made clear that eradicating slow play has become more of a priority than ever before for a circuit that has always indulged slowcoaches.But this, the tour's marquee tournament, will again be played in the shadow of the ongoing split brought about by the arrival in 2022 of the breakaway LIV tour.This year's Players will play out in the absence of the reigning US Open champion. If you're slow, you know you're slow. Monahan does not play verbal 'Bazball'; every non-answer dictated by the delicate nature of golf's future.Where he was more forthcoming, was an acceptance - at long last - that men's professional golf has a problem with slow play. It bothers me, but I've talked to many officials about it, like I want to know why I'm slow because obviously the first thing that any slower player thinks is that they're not slow.",

Baby and mom slowly waddled back off together into the bush.\"\n\"The baby was carefully held for one minute in total and then released back to mom,\"  she wrote in the comments, responding to criticism.\n\"They wandered back off into the bush together completely unharmed. I don't ever capture wildlife that will be harmed by my doing so.\" \nFollowing the backlash, Ms Jones, who has more than 92,000 followers on Instagram, made her account private. But several media outlets had already shared the video - as well as earlier posts, said to be taken in Australia, which show her holding an echidna and a \"little shark\". \nWombats, which are native to Australia, are a legally protected species across the country. Baby wombats share a strong bond with their mothers, and any separation can be distressing and harmful, conservationists say. \n\"Wombats are not a photo prop or plaything,\" said Suzanne Milthorpe, Head of Campaigns at World Animal Protection Australia, in a statement online. \n\"It's just unacceptable, and we're glad she's being called to account. Snatching a screaming baby wombat from their mother is not just appalling, it's very possibly illegal under state or national laws,\" Ms Milthrope said. \nSome experts believe Ms Jones broke the law because Australia prohibits people from harming or taking native wildlife. \nIt is only allowed if the joey is in need of help because its mother has died, wildlife veterinarian Tania Bishop told ABC News.\nAustralia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong also weighed in on the \"dreadful\" video. \n\"I think everyone who would have seen that would have thought, leave the baby wombat alone. Leave it with its mum,\" she told 7News.\nAdditional reporting by Simon Atkinson",

For everyone, or for the majority of people watching, looking at it afterwards, everyone felt like it was a rugby incident which was really unfortunate.\n\"No player goes out to injure another player, it just doesn't happen. Whatever the insinuations were from different people post-game, it's disappointing because the unfortunate thing is people who don't really understand the game pick up on it.\"\nCrowley starts as Ireland make six changes for Italy\nPorter says no foul play in Dupont injury incident\nFrance captain Dupont has cruciate knee injury\nEasterby said the French camp's post-match comments created a situation where \"people are getting abuse\".\n\"It's just unnecessary and not acceptable,\" he added.\n\"It happens, we know it happens, but those things could have been avoided had maybe other things been said post-game by certain individuals.\"\nWhen asked to clarify who he meant by \"certain individuals\", Easterby said: \"The French camp have obviously come out pretty strongly post-game about the incident. \n\"It could have been handled in a better way and on the back of that it's created some unnecessary ill-feeling and it has affected other people in the wider group.\"\nThis video can not be played\nRight decision made in 'horrible' Dupont injury citing\nAsked to clarify whether players have received online abuse in the wake of the incident, he said: \"I'm just saying that it's unnecessary, the coverage on social media, that's all I am saying. \n\"I don't read it, I don't necessarily take a lot of notice of it but when it's directed at certain individuals and certain individuals' wider family group, then it becomes an issue.\n\"We talk as coaches all the time and we chat post-game. I think it could have been a different discussion, a different platform to air those frustrations that maybe France had.\n\"We and World Rugby and the Six Nations believe there was no case to answer and certainly it didn't help, it almost sort of fanned the flames of what was a really unfortunate incident.\n\"But it was a rugby incident and that's the bottom line. Unfortunately, these things happen.\"\nEasterby was speaking after restoring Jack Crowley as Ireland's starting fly-half for Saturday's final Six Nations encounter with Italy in Rome.\nCrowley, who has been second-choice behind Sam Prendergast recently, returns amid reports linking him, external with a move to English Premiership side Leicester Tigers when his Munster deal expires in the summer. \nEasterby, however, is \"confident\" the 25-year-old will remain in Ireland. \n\"Jack knows how important he is to us,\" said Easterby, who added he does not think speculation will affect Crowley's performance on Saturday. \n\"Regardless of selection across the last four games, he understands the role that he has and the standing he has in the group. \n\"He's a brilliant person first and foremost. He's a great pro, he's always looking to get better.\n\"We believe that for him to keep getting better, to keep getting experiences at this level and keep driving us forward as a team and being competitive in the number 10 position in particular, it's important that he plays his rugby in Ireland and we're confident that will continue to happen.\"\nThis video can not be played\nKidnapping their dads, crazy tattoos & hairy shoulders\n2025 Six Nations permutations - who can still win?",
