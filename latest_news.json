        "article_text": "Living with some of the world's most remote tribal communities has changed filmmaker and indigenous right activist Bruce Parry.\n\"I started out as an adventurer,\" he says. \"It was all ego \u2013 I wanted to climb the biggest mountain, go and find the tribe that no one's visited to show the world how tough I was.\"\nAcross three series of the BAFTA-winning Tribe, viewers have seen Parry taking the psychedelic drug ayahuasca, having his nose pierced with a thorn and taking part in numerous rituals. Now, the series is returning to screens for the first time since 2007.\nHe was in his mid-30s in the first series of Tribe - and he has just turned 56. \n\"Initially on the show, my whole remit was to not say anything and to experience,\" he says.\n\"Now, I am much more knowledgeable, and that made it harder to be that wide-eyed character. \n\"I'm not the same guy any more.\"\nWarning: This story contains descriptions of animal cruelty some readers may find distressing.\nWhile trying to understand the communities he visits, Parry sometimes encounters difficult situations. \nAmong Angola's Mucubal community, for example, custom demands that as a guest, he must sacrifice a goat in a way expected within the group \u2013 that is, by suffocating it.\n\"They do it because they see it as respectful,\" says Parry. In the episode, he says this is the \"most gruesome thing\" he has ever been a part of.\n\"I knew how that was going to feel to some members of the audience,\" he says, adding that some might see it as \"barbaric\".\nDespite finding it upsetting, he says he was able to get through it by thinking on a global scale.\n\"If you take these people as a whole, they are not a problem on this planet,\" he says, arguing, in his view, that by doing things like eating meat \"you are contributing to so much more that is potentially negative and impactful on the planet\".\nIn his new three-part BBC series, he lives among three remote communities. He conducts a sacred ritual with Colombia's Waimaha people, lives among Angola's Mucubal community and visits Indonesia's Marapu.\nBehind the scenes, Parry's team works hard to make sure their visits are not just what he calls \"coming to take away their images [by filming them] and take them home\".\nInstead, he refers to his time with the remote communities as an \"exchange\", with his team often trading gifts with the people he visits.\nIn the past, he has given equipment, from boats to a machine used to grind sorghum - a staple grain in Africa and Asia. And in the show, we see him receive items in return in the form of livestock or other items culturally important to each community.\n\"Sometimes they just want guns,\" Parry says, \"but as the BBC, we can't quite do that.\"\nHe adds: \"We haven't ever really approached anyone that isn't really excited for us to come. I've never really had a sense that people didn't want me there.\"\nThere may, however, be some wariness based on negative experience with outsiders. \nThe Waimaha, whose culture was nearly decimated by rubber tappers and missionaries, for example, make Parry sleep away from them until he has gained their trust.\nEach episode reveals some of the other outside factors facing each community. \nThe region of Angola that Parry visits was inaccessible for decades because of landmines left during that country's civil war. And the Mucubal group feel the effects of climate change as the desert they live in gets hotter and drier.\nParry says he brings these issues to our attention after identifying what he saw as a problem with the original series.\n\"You could be forgiven for watching those first episodes and thinking that these people were living in pristine environments in the middle of nowhere, untouched by the outside world,\" he says.\n\"We used to get people saying it was questionable to go to these places and change them by our presence.\n\"To some degree, we are doing that, but our impact on those people was a drop in the ocean compared to all the other forces of change, the globalisation, the miners, the loggers and the missionaries.\"\nWhile travelling, Parry says he often finds unexpected similarities in how people live their lives.\nThe Mucubal, for example, knock out some of their bottom teeth and file down their front two. In the show, Parry says: \"The things we do for beauty\" - hinting at dental and cosmetic procedures common around the world. \nOther communities have very different practices - but Parry thinks we can learn from them. The Marapu live among the graves of their dead ancestors, giving them a unique bond.\n\"I'm not here to put any group on a pedestal,\" he says, \"we're all human, but there is definitely always something that we can learn from each other. \n\"And actually, the more different you are, probably the more there is for us to learn.\"\nNow, he says his guiding principle is \"the more you can try and see the world through another person's eyes, the more you can reflect on your own life and your own culture. \n\"And that's where wisdom comes.\"",

        "article_text": "The WSL season ends on 10 May\nWith just four games of the Women's Super League season remaining, Chelsea are in the driving seat for a sixth successive title.\nThe Blues, looking to win their first league title under Sonia Bompastor, find themselves six points clear at the top.\nHowever, their 2-2 draw with West Ham means Arsenal and Manchester United have reduced the deficit by two points, having started the weekend eight points behind. \nAt the other end of the table, Aston Villa's late win against Liverpool has given them the advantage in their fight with Crystal Palace for safety.\nMeanwhile, Manchester City face an uphill battle to claim the final Champions League spot.\nHow are things shaping up for the remaining games? Who has the tougher run-in? What do the pundits and managers think?\nThere have been no signs of teething problems for Chelsea this season under new boss Bompastor, and the Blues' dominance of the league - established under predecessor Emma Hayes - has continued.\nUnbeaten in the WSL this season, Chelsea have won 48 points from a possible 54 and they are six clear of closest challengers Arsenal and Manchester United.\nWith a maximum 12 points available from the remaining four games, the highest Arsenal and United could finish with is 54 points, meaning the Blues need seven more to guarantee the title.\nChelsea's game against Manchester United on 27 April will be rearranged due to the Blues' Champions League semi-final participation, which means their exact run-in is not yet confirmed, so predicting exactly when they could lift the title is not possible.\nYet if Arsenal win all of their fixtures, the earliest Chelsea could clinch the title is in their penultimate game of the season.\nThe Women's Champions League format is changing from 2025-26, with the number of teams earning direct qualification expanding from four teams to nine.\nThe winners of the WSL will directly qualify, along with the champions from the other five top-ranked national associations.\nThe runners-up of the two top-ranked associations will also be guaranteed direct qualification, along with the previous season's winners.\nThe WSL is currently ranked second, external, so as it stands the top two teams will automatically enter the 18-team league format, with the team in third going into the qualifying rounds.\nManchester City, who challenged Chelsea until the final day last season, are now mathematically out of the title race, while their chances of European football next season are hanging by a thread.\nThey sit seven points behind rivals United in third. Six points from the remaining four games would be enough for United to pip their city rivals to European qualification.\nAfter winning the Championship last season, Crystal Palace have struggled to adapt during their first season in England's top division.\nThe club looked destined to go straight back down before a 3-1 win over fellow strugglers Villa earlier this month gave Leif Smerud's side a fighting chance.\nHowever, a late own goal saw Villa win 2-1 against Liverpool and extend their buffer over Palace to four points.\nLeicester will hope their seven-point cushion is enough to see them through. They have games against Manchester City and Arsenal in their final four but it would require a big turnaround from Palace to send the Foxes down.\nMarc Skinner's Manchester United face three of the top four teams as they look to pile pressure on Chelsea and keep their Champions League place.\nThe Manchester derby on the penultimate day of the season could prove key in the race for Europe.\nThe fixture list has given City interim boss Nick Cushing cause for optimism.\n\"Once that's mathematically impossible then it is what it is, but until then we're going to fight right until the end,\" he said. \n\"We know we have to play Manchester United, we know Manchester United have to finish with Chelsea, us and Arsenal.\"\nIt's a tough run-in for bottom-placed Crystal Palace, who have to play Chelsea and Manchester City before the season is over.\nVilla, meanwhile, only face one top-four side in their four remaining games, while they will have the added bonus of a home crowd for their last game at Villa Park.\nFormer Arsenal and Manchester City defender Jen Beattie said she is \"more worried\" for Palace than Villa.\n\"Based on who they're about to play, they're about to play the top teams higher up, whereas Aston Villa, I think they can get more out of their results,\" Beattie said.\nHowever, Palace manager Leif Smerud is confident his side can turn things around, despite a difficult fixture list.\n\"This is not a defeated group. This is not a team that's given up,\" he said.\n\"I think football is the biggest sport in the world because the underdog always has a chance.\"\nOpta's 'supercomputer' prediction model has Chelsea as nailed-on favourites to lift the WSL trophy, with the Blues projected as champions in 98.11% of simulations.\nArsenal, meanwhile, have been given a slither of hope, with Opta giving them a 1.83% chance of winning the title.\nManchester City's bid for European football does not look favourable either, with Cushing's side predicted to finish outside of the top three in 76.41% of simulations.\nAccording to Opta's predictions, Amandine Miquel's Leicester have all but confirmed their stay in the WSL for another season, with only a 0.28% chance of relegation.\nThe stats also favour Villa, with them having a 96.07% chance of staying up.\nIt's a worrying tale for Crystal Palace. They have a 95.97% chance of sitting bottom of the table on 10 May.",

What do the pundits and managers think?How do things stand at the top?There have been no signs of teething problems for Chelsea this season under new boss Bompastor, and the Blues' dominance of the league - established under predecessor Emma Hayes - has continued.Unbeaten in the WSL this season, Chelsea have won 48 points from a possible 54 and they are six clear of closest challengers Arsenal and Manchester United.With a maximum 12 points available from the remaining four games, the highest Arsenal and United could finish with is 54 points, meaning the Blues need seven more to guarantee the title.Chelsea's game against Manchester United on 27 April will be rearranged due to the Blues' Champions League semi-final participation, which means their exact run-in is not yet confirmed, so predicting exactly when they could lift the title is not possible.Yet if Arsenal win all of their fixtures, the earliest Chelsea could clinch the title is in their penultimate game of the season.What about the race for Champions League?The Women's Champions League format is changing from 2025-26, with the number of teams earning direct qualification expanding from four teams to nine.The winners of the WSL will directly qualify, along with the champions from the other five top-ranked national associations.The runners-up of the two top-ranked associations will also be guaranteed direct qualification, along with the previous season's winners.The WSL is currently ranked second, external, so as it stands the top two teams will automatically enter the 18-team league format, with the team in third going into the qualifying rounds.Manchester City, who challenged Chelsea until the final day last season, are now mathematically out of the title race, while their chances of European football next season are hanging by a thread.They sit seven points behind rivals United in third. At the other end of the table, Aston Villa's late win against Liverpool has given them the advantage in their fight with Crystal Palace for safety.Meanwhile, Manchester City face an uphill battle to claim the final Champions League spot.How are things shaping up for the remaining games? They have games against Manchester City and Arsenal in their final four but it would require a big turnaround from Palace to send the Foxes down.What are the remaining fixtures?Marc Skinner's Manchester United face three of the top four teams as they look to pile pressure on Chelsea and keep their Champions League place.The Manchester derby on the penultimate day of the season could prove key in the race for Europe.The fixture list has given City interim boss Nick Cushing cause for optimism. \"What does the Opta 'supercomputer' suggest?Opta's 'supercomputer' prediction model has Chelsea as nailed-on favourites to lift the WSL trophy, with the Blues projected as champions in 98.11% of simulations.Arsenal, meanwhile, have been given a slither of hope, with Opta giving them a 1.83% chance of winning the title.Manchester City's bid for European football does not look favourable either, with Cushing's side predicted to finish outside of the top three in 76.41% of simulations.According to Opta's predictions, Amandine Miquel's Leicester have all but confirmed their stay in the WSL for another season, with only a 0.28% chance of relegation.The stats also favour Villa, with them having a 96.07% chance of staying up.It's a worrying tale for Crystal Palace.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nPundits on Rashford's MOTM performance against Preston\nMarcus Rashford has got his swagger back.\nThe Aston Villa loanee ended his 120-day goal drought with a second-half double at Preston on Sunday to help Unai Emery's side set up an FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace - and provide another clear sign he is enjoying his football again.\nFrozen out of the first-team picture at Manchester United by head coach Ruben Amorim just weeks after he replaced Erik ten Hag at the helm, even those closest to Rashford accepted he had a major point to prove when he completed his loan move to Aston Villa on 3 February.\nThose working with him can see the improvement in Rashford, maybe not quite to the levels of old but certainly a far cry from the passive figure he appeared at Old Trafford for most of the previous 18 months.\nEngland boss Thomas Tuchel must have felt so too, judging by the speed with which he restored Rashford to the international fold earlier this month.\nYet there were plenty of doubters. They were out in force on social media during the first half of Villa's 3-0 FA Cup quarter-final victory at Preston, as Rashford wasted a couple of free-kicks as the visitors struggled to turn their dominance into goals.\nThe only measure, though, of a striker's success is the regularity they hit the back of the net - and he hadn't done it for 14 games and counting since his double for United against Everton on 1 December.\nBut when Lucas Digne presented the opportunity 13 minutes into the second half at Deepdale, Rashford's innate ability did the rest as he calmly picked his spot before finding the bottom corner. \nFive minutes later, despite a wait for the video assistant referee (VAR) to confirm Villa should be awarded a penalty, and goalkeeper David Cornell offering some 'advice' as he walked past to take up his position, Rashford's nerve held. He took his time, did an extended stuttering run-up, and found the net.\n\"The swagger is back,\" gushed Guy Mowbray in his Match of the Day commentary. \"The confidence and the pose.\"\n\"It's a great feeling,\" Rashford told BBC Sport afterwards: \"It's always nice for a forward to get a goal, so hopefully it continues.\n\"I feel like I've been getting fitter and playing better football since I've been here. I missed a lot of football before joining up with them. My body feels good and I'm enjoying my football for now.\"\nFA Cup 'sparkle' returns - but will there be a 'fairytale ending'?\nRashford scores double as Aston Villa beat Preston in FA Cup quarters\nForest draw Bournemouth or Man City, Palace v Villa\nThis video can not be played\nRashford scores first Villa goals within space of five minutes\nThe deal United struck with Villa to let Rashford leave is not straightforward.\nThe precise nature of the loan deal is complicated. United have said 75% of Rashford's wages are being covered, although they have not explained exactly how. \nThat could rise to 90% if certain performance-related bonuses are met.\nThat, presumably, will include an extended run in the Champions League - Villa have been paired with French heavyweights Paris St-Germain in the quarter-finals - as well as the FA Cup.\nUnai Emery's side face Crystal Palace at Wembley next month as the next step in their quest to win the trophy for the first time since 1957. \nIn addition, they are ninth in the Premier League, three points behind fifth-placed Manchester City, who occupy what is virtually certain to be the final Champions League spot.\nThat proliferation of targets underscores why Emery did not really want to talk about the likelihood of Villa triggering their \u00a340m option to turn Rashford's move into a permanent deal.\n\"We can't waste time speaking about that,\" he said\n\"If next year we are in the Champions League, in the Europa, or Conference League or not. Or we don't win a trophy - it is completely different.\"\nMarcus Rashford (left) celebrates his second goal for Aston Villa at Preston\nUnlike Villa, Rashford has won the FA Cup twice in recent memory, including last season. He has also been part of teams who have won the Europa League and EFL Cup. In addition, he has 60 England caps. His past playbook means if he can reach the standards he has previously set, he would be an asset to any side in the world.\nIt is that talent Emery is trying to coax out of the player. It is, in the modern football vocabulary, 'a process'.\nThe Aston Villa boss, said: \"There is still work, still weeks to get it, but today he did one step forward. He is feeling comfortable, getting confident and scoring goals. He was obviously getting better, but today it was more in his adaptation and helping us.\n\"He's playing in the idea, in the plan we did with him. He has played more as a winger on the left side but he's played in some moments as a striker. Today we decided to play him as a striker to his quality, his power and the way he exploits things. \n\"The process we have with him is more or less not changing. There is still work to do because he came here after not training consistently and not feeling in his best fitness. Progressively playing more and with the national team will help him to feel better and today was confirmation of that, which is good.\"\nThe painful divorce of Marcus Rashford and Manchester United\nThe good thing from Rashford's perspective is he is beginning to put together a positive body of work to counter the extended period of drift he experienced at United.\nIt still feels bizarre he has left his boyhood club for a perceived smaller rival, yet finds himself entering the final two months of the campaign with substantially more to play for - both in number and prestige of competitions - than he would have had if he remained at Old Trafford.\nNo professional career is a straight line ascent, which is why insight from those who have been there and done it is so valuable.\n\"You are constantly being asked questions at the top,\" said former England keeper Joe Hart on Match of the Day.\n\"Maybe Rashford found himself in a lull but he has come to Villa with people around him that know what they are doing. He hasn't come here with question marks about how he is going to behave and what he is going to do and how he can change the team.\"\nHart found himself frozen out for a time at Manchester City and Micah Richards did not have the greatest time at Aston Villa.\nBut, like Hart, Rashford can see how a change of scenery has provided the impetus for improvement.\n\"He looks confident and happy,\" said Richards.\n\"It was a big move going to Villa. But when you've got a manager that believes in you, you can do special things.\n\"His whole body language looks a lot better and his all-round game was brilliant. That is the best way to shut people up. People were asking questions about not fulfilling his potential but that is the way to answer.\n\"I really like Rashford in these wide areas because he's always looking to run in behind.\nWhen I talk about body language and his movement - his all round game today was brilliant.\"\nGet Aston Villa news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "When Cyclone Alfred barrelled over Australia's east coast earlier this month, it also blew the government's election plans off course.\nHoping to capitalise on some rare good news on interest rates, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was on the cusp of announcing an April polling date. Instead he had to pivot and focus on responding to the natural disaster. It was, one Labor Minister told me, a decision taken from him by \"an act of God\".\nYou might say that's been a theme of his government: big plans often derailed by unpleasant surprises \u2013 trying global economic conditions and a cost-of-living crisis which is battering many countries, foreign wars and tricky geopolitics, post-pandemic fallout and rising national divisions, and now giant storms.\n\"Global conditions are real,\" Albanese, who leads the Labor Party, said as he officially announced a 3 May election.\nThough, despite those challenges, he says his party has delivered. \"Landing where we have is like landing a 747 [jet] on a helicopter pad,\" he said, pointing to a recent increase in wage growth and falling inflation. \nBut he wants a second term to reset.\nStanding in his way is Peter Dutton - a conservative who leads the Liberal Party, the dominant member of the so-called Coalition with the National Party of Australia \u2013 who just two years ago polling indicated was deeply unpopular.\nBut the race between them is now so tight and the rise of independents or minor parties such that many are expecting a hung parliament.\nSo how has it unravelled for Prime Minister Albanese?\nHis victory in May 2022 was seen as a fresh start after nine years of conservative rule.\nClimate action was big on the agenda, as was addressing the cost-of-living and restoring stability to the country's leadership.\nBut the legacy he eyed for his government was on Indigenous affairs. He opened his victory speech reiterating a pledge to hold a historic referendum on an Indigenous Voice to Parliament, an advisory body that would inform the government on issues that affect First Nations people.\nAlbanese spent most of 2023 campaigning for a \"Yes\" vote. This was the moment, he hoped, that First Nations people would get constitutional recognition - finally catching up with other former British colonies - and that Australia would begin mending what many see as a very broken relationship with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.\nBut the proposal was decisively rejected, leaving many Indigenous people feeling disappointed and betrayed. Albanese was also left licking his wounds after a damaging campaign.\nSome critics blamed confusion and misinformation for why about 60% of Australians voted \"No\". But while Albanese was campaigning for the \"Yes\" vote, opposition leader Peter Dutton campaigned for \"No\", attacking Albanese for spending money on the referendum while a cost-of-living crisis intensified.\n\"[Dutton] not only won on the referendum, but also he won on positioning Labor as the government that's not completely focused on the issues that matter to Australia,\" says Kos Samaras, political consultant and a former Labor strategist.\nDuring Albanese's tenure, interest rates have been put up 12 times (and cut once, in February), inflation soared post-pandemic, the country's housing crisis deepened, and Australians increasingly felt stretched.\nThough the prime minister would lay the blame for many of those issues at the previous coalition government's feet, voters want to know who is best placed to deal with all of them now.\nIn Anthony Albanese's victory speech in 2022, he said Australia was \"the greatest country on earth\". Australian voters though are increasingly questioning whether that's still true \u2013 and perhaps more importantly, whether politicians from traditional parties are the ones able to fix it.\nSo though many are disillusioned with Labor, this won't necessarily translate as a vote for Dutton's Coalition at the ballot box.\nSupport for minor parties and independents reached record levels at the previous election, and similar is expected this time around. If neither party reaches the magic number of 76 seats in the House of Representatives, which poll after poll paints as unlikely, independent candidates could be the kingmakers of any future government.\nIf that happens, Australia would be another page in a story unfolding all over the world - disenfranchised voters seeking more radical solutions and voting for change. In many places this is a real threat to democracy as people stop trusting the system.\nBut while Australia faces the same challenges as other parts of the world, a few quirks in its electoral system have thus far guarded against more radical swings that we've seen in other countries, like the US, France and Germany.\nExperts all agree that mandatory voting is a key factor in Australia's political stability. In the 2022 elections, just under 90% of the population voted \u2013 much, much higher than the average OECD turnout of 69%. The fine for not voting in a federal election is a mere A$20 but there's a sense of duty here to go out and vote.\nWhat that means is politicians don't have to mobilise their bases \u2013 turnout is a given, it's just about pushing your narrative. Where voting is optional, there's a tendency for special interest groups to become overly influential as those who are less engaged decide not to cast a ballot. Plus, if everyone, no matter their politics, education or their wealth, goes to vote, it tends to pull the result towards a more representative centre.\n\"[Australia's] elections are decided in the middle,\" says the country's chief election analyst Antony Green. \"That means getting your message through those people who aren't paying much attention.\"\nThe other big stabiliser for Australia, say experts, is preferential voting \u2013 where voters effectively number their candidates in order of who they want to win. It's why in recent years the Greens have emerged on the left and One Nation on the right but still, Labor and the Coalition dominate. Experts say preferential voting tempers the effects of polarisation and forces the two major parties to appeal to people who aren't necessarily voting for them first in order to receive their next preferences, which also helps moderate policy.\nWhile the campaign will focus on problems close to home, the candidates would be foolish to ignore the global political headwinds.\nDuring last year's presidential election, few analysts I spoke to seemed to think a Trump White House would massively impact Australia, this comparatively small and distant democracy.\nBut five months feels like a lifetime in today's politics. Not a day goes by without Donald Trump making the headlines and Australians are tuning in to watch.\nWith Trump's obvious disregard for longstanding alliances as well as constant talk of tariffs and trade wars, all this plays a part in Australians' fears about their place in the world \u2013 and importantly, the future of what is arguably its most important diplomatic and military relationship.\nPeter Dutton argues he'd be much better than Albanese at dealing with Trump. But there are doubts that anyone really knows how to handle this new administration \u2013 politicians of all stripes around the globe are feeling their way with how best to manage their relationship with the US.\nWith Albanese firing the starting gun today, Australians have just over a month of intense campaigning to help them determine who they want to lead them through the next three years.\nWhile Labor's handling of the ex-cyclone Alfred has improved its chances \u2013 the Prime Minister's approval ratings have risen to their highest level in 18 months \u2013 polling in recent months has pointed towards a Dutton administration.\nIt's still incredibly close, and the Albanese government faces the unenviable prospect of being the first which fails to win a second term since 1931.",

We have been trying for hours to pull out a girl trapped under the collapsed school.\"\nAnother worker in Mandalay told a BBC reporter in Yangon that communication had been near impossible.\n\"The main thing is that we don't have internet lines, we don't have phone lines, so it's very difficult to connect with each other. The rescue team has arrived. But we don't know where it will go, because the phone lines are down.\"\nA Mandalay resident said people were doing their best in the chaotic circumstances.\n\"There is no coordination in the rescue efforts, no one to lead them, or tell them what to do.

Power outages have exacerbated the situation, and according to officials restoring power could take days.\nMandalay airport is not functional as the runways were damaged during the earthquake. The military council said that it had been working to resume operations and a temporary hospital, medical relief camp and shelter have been set up there.\nLess than 25km (15 miles) from Mandalay in Sagaing, the older of two bridges connecting the regions has completely collapsed and the newer one has developed cracks, cutting off access for rescue teams. \n\"Right now, there are not enough people even for emergency rescue. We can't pick up bodies, there are so many people trapped. We can't cross either bridge, so we are all trapped in the rubble. Please help emergency rescuers come and rescue us,\" a local resident told BBC Burmese.\nThe recently constructed capital Nay Pyi Taw, where the military junta is headquartered, has been hit by aftershocks and small tremors. The city has seen extensive damage with high numbers of casualties, collapsed buildings and buckled roads.\nEven as the junta has made a rare international appeal for aid, it has continued air strikes and drone attacks against the armed groups it has been fighting.\nBBC Burmese confirmed that seven people were killed in an air strike in Naungcho in northern Shan state. This strike took place around 15:30 local time, less than three hours after the quake struck.\nPro-democracy rebel groups fighting to remove the military from power have reported aerial bombings in Chang-U township in the central Sagaing region, the epicentre of the quake. There are also reports of airstrikes in regions near the Thai border.\nThe UN's special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, urged the junta to cease bombing raids.\n\"The problem is that you still have military operations going on right now...

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nPundits on Rashford's MOTM performance against Preston\nMarcus Rashford has got his swagger back.\nThe Aston Villa loanee ended his 120-day goal drought with a second-half double at Preston on Sunday to help Unai Emery's side set up an FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace - and provide another clear sign he is enjoying his football again.\nFrozen out of the first-team picture at Manchester United by head coach Ruben Amorim just weeks after he replaced Erik ten Hag at the helm, even those closest to Rashford accepted he had a major point to prove when he completed his loan move to Aston Villa on 3 February.\nThose working with him can see the improvement in Rashford, maybe not quite to the levels of old but certainly a far cry from the passive figure he appeared at Old Trafford for most of the previous 18 months.\nEngland boss Thomas Tuchel must have felt so too, judging by the speed with which he restored Rashford to the international fold earlier this month.\nYet there were plenty of doubters. They were out in force on social media during the first half of Villa's 3-0 FA Cup quarter-final victory at Preston, as Rashford wasted a couple of free-kicks as the visitors struggled to turn their dominance into goals.\nThe only measure, though, of a striker's success is the regularity they hit the back of the net - and he hadn't done it for 14 games and counting since his double for United against Everton on 1 December.\nBut when Lucas Digne presented the opportunity 13 minutes into the second half at Deepdale, Rashford's innate ability did the rest as he calmly picked his spot before finding the bottom corner. \nFive minutes later, despite a wait for the video assistant referee (VAR) to confirm Villa should be awarded a penalty, and goalkeeper David Cornell offering some 'advice' as he walked past to take up his position, Rashford's nerve held. He took his time, did an extended stuttering run-up, and found the net.\n\"The swagger is back,\" gushed Guy Mowbray in his Match of the Day commentary. \"The confidence and the pose.\"\n\"It's a great feeling,\" Rashford told BBC Sport afterwards: \"It's always nice for a forward to get a goal, so hopefully it continues.\n\"I feel like I've been getting fitter and playing better football since I've been here. I missed a lot of football before joining up with them. My body feels good and I'm enjoying my football for now.\"\nFA Cup 'sparkle' returns - but will there be a 'fairytale ending'?\nRashford scores double as Aston Villa beat Preston in FA Cup quarters\nForest draw Bournemouth or Man City, Palace v Villa\nThis video can not be played\nRashford scores first Villa goals within space of five minutes\nThe deal United struck with Villa to let Rashford leave is not straightforward.\nThe precise nature of the loan deal is complicated. United have said 75% of Rashford's wages are being covered, although they have not explained exactly how. \nThat could rise to 90% if certain performance-related bonuses are met.\nThat, presumably, will include an extended run in the Champions League - Villa have been paired with French heavyweights Paris St-Germain in the quarter-finals - as well as the FA Cup.\nUnai Emery's side face Crystal Palace at Wembley next month as the next step in their quest to win the trophy for the first time since 1957. \nIn addition, they are ninth in the Premier League, three points behind fifth-placed Manchester City, who occupy what is virtually certain to be the final Champions League spot.\nThat proliferation of targets underscores why Emery did not really want to talk about the likelihood of Villa triggering their \u00a340m option to turn Rashford's move into a permanent deal.\n\"We can't waste time speaking about that,\" he said\n\"If next year we are in the Champions League, in the Europa, or Conference League or not. Or we don't win a trophy - it is completely different.\"\nMarcus Rashford (left) celebrates his second goal for Aston Villa at Preston\nUnlike Villa, Rashford has won the FA Cup twice in recent memory, including last season. He has also been part of teams who have won the Europa League and EFL Cup. In addition, he has 60 England caps. His past playbook means if he can reach the standards he has previously set, he would be an asset to any side in the world.\nIt is that talent Emery is trying to coax out of the player. It is, in the modern football vocabulary, 'a process'.\nThe Aston Villa boss, said: \"There is still work, still weeks to get it, but today he did one step forward. He is feeling comfortable, getting confident and scoring goals. He was obviously getting better, but today it was more in his adaptation and helping us.\n\"He's playing in the idea, in the plan we did with him. He has played more as a winger on the left side but he's played in some moments as a striker. Today we decided to play him as a striker to his quality, his power and the way he exploits things. \n\"The process we have with him is more or less not changing. There is still work to do because he came here after not training consistently and not feeling in his best fitness. Progressively playing more and with the national team will help him to feel better and today was confirmation of that, which is good.\"\nThe painful divorce of Marcus Rashford and Manchester United\nThe good thing from Rashford's perspective is he is beginning to put together a positive body of work to counter the extended period of drift he experienced at United.\nIt still feels bizarre he has left his boyhood club for a perceived smaller rival, yet finds himself entering the final two months of the campaign with substantially more to play for - both in number and prestige of competitions - than he would have had if he remained at Old Trafford.\nNo professional career is a straight line ascent, which is why insight from those who have been there and done it is so valuable.\n\"You are constantly being asked questions at the top,\" said former England keeper Joe Hart on Match of the Day.\n\"Maybe Rashford found himself in a lull but he has come to Villa with people around him that know what they are doing. He hasn't come here with question marks about how he is going to behave and what he is going to do and how he can change the team.\"\nHart found himself frozen out for a time at Manchester City and Micah Richards did not have the greatest time at Aston Villa.\nBut, like Hart, Rashford can see how a change of scenery has provided the impetus for improvement.\n\"He looks confident and happy,\" said Richards.\n\"It was a big move going to Villa. But when you've got a manager that believes in you, you can do special things.\n\"His whole body language looks a lot better and his all-round game was brilliant. That is the best way to shut people up. People were asking questions about not fulfilling his potential but that is the way to answer.\n\"I really like Rashford in these wide areas because he's always looking to run in behind.\nWhen I talk about body language and his movement - his all round game today was brilliant.\"\nGet Aston Villa news sent straight to your phone",

It is, in the modern football vocabulary, 'a process'.The Aston Villa boss, said: \"There is still work, still weeks to get it, but today he did one step forward. \"I feel like I've been getting fitter and playing better football since I've been here. That could rise to 90% if certain performance-related bonuses are met.That, presumably, will include an extended run in the Champions League - Villa have been paired with French heavyweights Paris St-Germain in the quarter-finals - as well as the FA Cup.Unai Emery's side face Crystal Palace at Wembley next month as the next step in their quest to win the trophy for the first time since 1957.",

They bring us joy and seeing them every day brightens our lives,\" says Mr Bhushan.\n\"We like to spoil them,\" adds Ms Gulati. \"Whenever we see [a toy] they might like, we immediately buy it, even knowing it will be destroyed in no time.\"\nIn 2024, Indians spent $3.6bn (\u00a32.78bn) on products and services for their pets, a substantial increase from $1.6bn in 2019, according to the Redseer report.\nThis rapid growth has been fuelled by emerging trends such as pet boarding, insurance and specialised veterinary care.\n\"Twenty years ago, pet care was limited to basic services like vaccination and veterinary care,\" says Pankaj Poddar, chief executive of pet care company Zigly.\n\"Now, people want the best for their pets - whether it's clothing, accessories, or even specialised services,\" he says. \"I have seen parents spend as much as 10% of their incomes on their pets - be it taking them to special parties or even regular checkups.\"\nMs Bapna, for instance, spends between 25,000 rupees ($290; \u00a3220) and 40,000 rupees on Muffin in a month, mostly on his travel and special diet.\nShe takes her dog on a trip every few weeks, whether it's a day outing to a nearby farmhouse or a longer stay at a resort, and stays in pet-friendly accommodation which are pricier than regular hotels.\nWhen she takes the train to Jodhpur every few months to visit her parents, Ms Bapna buys first-class tickets - which are more than double the price of general tickets - as dogs and cats in India are only allowed in first-class coaches. \nMs Bapna doesn't mind the huge bills. When it comes to spending on Muffin, she says, \"This is one area where I make no concessions.\"\nThis kind of spending has propelled sales for pet care companies like Zigly.\n\"In the last eight-to-nine months, we have grown between 7% and 10% month-on-month,\" says Mr Poddar, whose company has reached a monthly gross merchandise value of around 46m rupees per month and is expected to reach 1bn rupees by next year.\nMore companies which offer cheaper services, such as pet care chain The Pet Point, have also sprung up to cater to the increasingly middle-class clientele.\nFor most Indian pet parents these days, \"value for money takes precedence over premiumisation\", says The Pet Point's co-founder Akshay Mahendru. \"A customer is more likely to get grooming services for their pet every week for 600 rupees, rather than somewhere above 1,500 rupees.\"\nMr Mahendru says that sales for comparatively cheaper pet products like toys or snacks has also increased manifold with the emergence of quick commerce platforms like Zepto or Blinkit that do deliveries in 10-15 minutes.\nExperts are optimistic that India's pet care market has room to grow, given global trends. According to Bloomberg Intelligence's Pet Economy Report 2023, the global pet care sector, currently valued at $320bn, could exceed $500bn by the end of this decade.\nRedseer's report estimates India's pet care market to double in the next three years and potentially cross $7bn by 2028.\nBut challenges still remain.\nIndia continues to be dogged by unequal economic growth, slowing consumption and wage stagnation which can dampen the industry's growth. \nMost cities here also lack pet-friendly public spaces, hotels and transport options, presenting a multitude of inconveniences to pet parents.\nWhenever Mr Bhushan and Ms Gulati travel with Mowgli, they bring portable beds and disposable plates and bowls \"so we're always prepared during our stays\", says Mr Bhushan.\n\"However, problems arise when we go for meals during our trips. Many places do not accept pets, which limits our options,\" he adds.\nMs Bapna faces similar challenges when travelling with Muffin. But she is optimistic that things will change.\n\"When I first got him in 2021, there were very few pet-friendly places and activities. But now in Mumbai there are special events, resorts and cafes that welcome pets,\" she said.\nThese days Muffin gets to attend \"socialisation events\", where he gets to play with other dogs, or goes to pet festivals where he can play games and sample special pet food.\n\"It gives me hope,\" Ms Bapna says with a smile.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

He followed the thread as top Trump administration officials discussed upcoming military strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.\nThe Atlantic then on Wednesday published the entire text thread that showed the detailed and potentially classified rundown for a March air raids.\nIn the wake of the controversy, Waltz said he took full responsibility for the group chat. \"I built the group,\" he told Fox News on Tuesday, adding it was \"embarrassing\".\nWaltz was unable to explain in his Fox News interview how Goldberg came to be on the chat but said another, unnamed contact of his was supposed to be there in Goldberg's place.\n\"I can tell you for 100% I don't know this guy,\" Waltz said.\nOn Sunday, Goldberg said on NBC's Meet the Press that Waltz is \"telling everyone that he's never met me or spoken to me - that's simply not true\".\nPresident Trump called the incident a \"glitch\" and said that it had \"no impact at all\" operationally, adding that the military strike against the Houthis was a success.\nBut former national security officials have raised concerns that allowing this to slide could pose major risks and encourage American adversaries.\nSue Gordon, a former Trump administration deputy director of national intelligence, told BBC's US partner CBS News that she was \"glad the operation was successful. Now we need to deal with the fact that this should not have happened\".\n\"I don't think we should rest on the fact that nothing bad happened this time,\" she said. \"We don't know whether that communications path has been penetrated. So we don't know whether the state actors that have lots of resources are just sitting and working now.\"\nThose concerns have led many Democrats to call for greater accountability, with Mark Warner, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, asserting that if a military officer or CIA agent treated classified information in a similar manner they \"would be fired - end of story\".\n\"I believe Secretary Hegseth should resign or be fired. I think Mike Waltz should resign or be fired,\" Warner told CBS News on Sunday. \"If no action is taken, what message does that send to the workforce?\" \nStill, in an interview with NBC News on Saturday, Trump said he would not fire anyone involved in the group chat, and that he still had confidence in Waltz.\n\"I don't fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,\" he said.\nAlong with Waltz and Hegseth, the chat also included Vice-President JD Vance, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA director John Ratcliffe White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and other senior leaders.

We are going to keep getting better. I really think we are going to take it to levels that we've not been to before.\n\"We are just going to keep pushing until we get to a point that we just can't imagine what is next.\"\nTwo of Kildunne's tries were relatively straightforward dot downs, with the third an instinctive finish from a kick-through.\nWhen the whistle sounded for the start of the second half, Kildunne had no tries. By  the 56th minute, her hand was above her head for yet another signature lasso celebration after a third score.\nKildunne made the most carries (16) and metres (145m) in the game, but it was her kicking game which stood out.\nFrom tidy deft chip-kicks to cause havoc in the backfield to grubber-kicks to turn the Wales defence, Kildunne has widened her game to be more than just a lethal counter-attack runner.\n\"She is starting to serve the team in different ways and there are going to be times that teams take away the counter-attack from her,\" England head coach John Mitchell told BBC Two.\n\"She is world-class with that plan A [running it back], but she is going to have to adapt in 2025 as certain teams will not allow her to get ball.\n\"We have to use her in the right way.\"\nWomen's Six Nations: England Thrash Wales\nWomen's Six Nations: Wales 7-26 England - bonus point secured in 27 minutes\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\nKildunne made her England debut in 2018 as an 18-year-old\nKildunne was one of 13 changes Mitchell made to his starting XV from England's opening round victory over Italy, with the majority of his front-line starters returning.\nLike last weekend, the Red Roses ran away with the contest, scoring their bonus-point try inside 27 minutes.\nNumber eight Maddie Feaunati was named player of the match in York and further pressed her case to continue in the back row with two powerful finishes.\nWales-born Meg Jones scored the pick of England's 11 tries when she slalomed her way through her native country, showing incredible balance and footwork.\nJones, who was playing her first Red Roses match since both her parents passed away, pointed to the sky and tapped her chest before diving over the line.\n\"I haven't played here since I was 12 years old,\" Jones, 28, told BBC Two.\n\"When I heard both the anthems it took me a little bit. I have just tried to enjoy it as much as I can, I know they will both be so proud of me.\n\"I said in the week that they will still be in the crowd.

        "article_text": "Beloved by many, despised by others, Thomas Kinkade's quaint rustic scenes and his wholesome image belied a dark and tortured story that contrasts with his 'sugary' artworks.\nThomas Kinkade was one of the best-selling artists in history, as well as one of the most divisive. When he died in 2012, the American painter had been rocked by business problems, but at his commercial peak a decade earlier, his company was bringing in more than $100m a year. And yet his work was despised by many critics \u2013 not because it was blasphemous or obscene, but because, well, he specialised in quaint pictures of thatched-roof rural cottages nestling in leafy groves. \"Thomas Kinkade's style is illustrative saccharine fantasy rather than art with which you can connect at any meaningful level,\" Charlotte Mullins, the author of A Little History of Art, tells the BBC. \"It is schmaltzy pastiches of Disney-style woodland scenes, complete with cutesy animals and fairy tale cottages. They are\u2026 like the images you find on cheap greetings cards \u2013 sugary and forgettable.\" And compared to some critics, Mullins is being polite.\nThese critics don't just consider Kinkade's paintings to be nauseatingly sickly, they detect something disturbing and ominous about them. In her 2003 book on California, Where I Was From, Joan Didion summed up his art by saying. \"It typically featured a cottage or a house of such insistent cosiness as to seem actually sinister, suggestive of a trap designed to attract Hansel and Gretel. Every window was lit, to lurid effect, as if the interior of the structure might be on fire.\" As harsh as that sounds, Didion may have been more perceptive than she realised. Art for Everybody, a new documentary directed by Miranda Yousef, shows that the man who called himself the \"Painter of Light\" did indeed have a dark side. \"His branding was so effective that you didn't know there was this really complicated and I would say tortured artist behind it all,\" Yousef tells the BBC. \"He lived a Greek tragedy of a life.\"\nThe documentary features audio tapes recorded by Kinkade when he was a long-haired, bohemian-looking art student in California in the 1970s \u2013 and even then, he was already fretting over the question of whether he could make an impact as an artist while making a decent living. After a stint in Hollywood, painting backgrounds for Ralph Bakshi's 1983 animated feature film, Fire and Ice, he concentrated on idealised, nostalgic American landscapes, and he and his wife Nanette sold reproductions of them outside a local grocer's shop. In the 1990s, he took the idealism and the nostalgia to new heights, and swapped his rugged vistas for soft-focus pastoral scenes that a Hobbit might deem a bit on the twee side. Old-fashioned lampposts and cottage windows glowed. Streams twinkled beneath slender stone footbridges. Bushes burst with pastel flowers. And cash registers rang. Kinkade didn't sell the paintings themselves, but the hazy idylls they depicted were soon being printed on collectible plates advertised in newspapers and magazines. For many Americans, they were comforting refuges from the modern world.\nIn Art for Everybody, Christopher Knight, the art critic of the Los Angeles Times, is contemptuous of Kinkade's imagery. \"It's a clich\u00e9 piled upon a fantasy piled upon a bad idea,\" he says. \"The colour is juiced and the light coming from inside those cottages is intense and blaring.\" Just as importantly, as far as his critics were concerned, Kinkade's pictures had nothing to them beyond their superficial decorative qualities. \"They are banal and hollow, with no intent to say anything meaningful,\" says Mullins. \"Today we would think they had been produced by AI \u2013 designed as if by algorithm to a certain formula.\" But Yousef insists that Kinkade's skill can't be discounted. \"There were actually other people who were painting cottages and Christmas scenes and putting them on plates and all that stuff,\" she notes, \"and the thing is that Kinkade's were so much better. His works just blew everybody else's out of the water.\"\nShe also believes that Kinkade's paintings, rather than being wholly market-led, were linked to his childhood in Placerville, California, where he was raised by his single mother and only intermittently saw his violent father. \"It's a common criticism that his cottages look like they're on fire on the inside. And then you learn that it was because when he was growing up it was always cold and dark in the house when he got home, because they didn't have the money to keep the heat and the lights on. He was painting the thing that he wanted.\"\nKinkade's deprived upbringing, says Yousef, didn't just inspire his choice of subject matter, but drove him to make as much money as he could. He and his business partners printed pictures on an industrial scale, as well as putting his immediately recognisable imagery on furniture and ornaments, and selling them on the QVC shopping network. They also set up hundreds of faux olde worlde Thomas Kinkade Signature Galleries in shopping malls around the US, and trademarked the \"Painter of Light\" brand. Again, Yousef doesn't see Kinkade as entirely calculating. Having grown up in a house with no pictures on the walls, \"He sincerely believed that art should be accessible to everyone.\"\nWhatever you thought of the paintings, the mass-marketing of the work of a single artist was certainly groundbreaking. In interviews at the time, Kinkade asserted that he was no different from an author selling stacks of novels or a musician selling CDs. He even declared that by industrialising his output, he was doing what Andy Warhol had always dreamt of. But Mullins argues that Kinkade was being \"obfuscatory and disingenuous\" by churning out reproductions by the thousand, paying his assistants to add a few dabs of paint here and there, and then selling these prints for thousands of dollars, as if they were rare and precious works of art. \"Prints offer an affordable way of buying art by great artists,\" she says. \"They retain their value through the limited nature of the edition. This was never Kinkade's strategy.\"\nStill, this sort of disagreement between Kinkade and his critics was one of his selling points. Art for Everybody features news reports and promotional videos, in which he tells adoring audiences that his art could be understood and appreciated by everyone, whereas only the snooty elite could see anything artistic about Chris Ofili putting elephant dung on his canvases, or Tracey Emin presenting her unmade bed to gallery-goers. \"This is not legitimate art,\" he proclaimed. As much a televangelist as a painter, Kinkade was a born-again Christian who assured his devotees that buying his work put them on the right side of a political and spiritual line separating them from decadent metropolitan tastemakers. He trademarked the sobriquet \"Painter of Light\", not just because of all the sunlit clouds and fiery cottages in his pictures, but to signify that he was a force for virtue and Christianity. \"The art world is a world of darkness today,\" he thundered. He, in contrast, was \"someone who stands up for family and God and country and beauty\". A doughy, plaid shirt-wearing fellow with a thick moustache, he often appeared on television with his blonde wife and his four blonde daughters: the embodiment of wholesome, traditional, all-American values. His fans weren't just paying for his pictures; they were paying to associate themselves with this proudly conservative persona.\nBut that persona, like the pictures themselves, was more a fantasy that Kinkade wished for than an accurate representation of reality. He was prone to swearing after the directors of his mawkishvideos called \"cut\". He relied on alcohol to cope with work pressures. And, in the documentary, his daughters say that they were encouraged to smile in videos and personal appearances, but often felt as if their father cared more about his career than about them. \"Thomas Kinkade and his persona and his brand really cast an extraordinarily long, dark shadow over his entire family,\" says Yousef, \"and there was a lot wrapped up in perpetuating the brand and preserving it.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The surprising story of Van Gogh's guardian angel\n\u2022 Five ways to spot a fake masterpiece\n\u2022 Eight images that tell the story of America\nIn order to maintain this brand and the vast business empire that went with it, Kinkade had to present himself as a Christian paragon, and he had to complete a stylistically identical painting every month. That meant that he had to suppress other, more conflicted parts of his psyche. The strain became too much. In the mid-2000s, Kinkade fell out with his business partners, and had legal battles with gallery franchisees. He reinvented himself as a womanising, hard-drinking hellraiser. After some interventions by his friends and family, some time in rehab, and the collapse of his marriage, he died of an accidental overdose of alcohol and diazepam at the age of 54.\nIt was only after his death that his family sorted through the vault containing his artwork, and uncovered a stash of bleak, violent drawings and paintings that seemed to express his inner rage and fear in a way that his cottage paintings never could: a shack in the middle of nowhere on a murky night; a nun pointing a gun at herself; giant monsters and distorted faces. Art for Everybody raises the questions of whether these pictures are more authentic than the ones the public knew about. Do they express how Kinkade really felt about his difficult upbringing and his frightening father? Would it have been healthier for him to explore the shadowy netherworlds in these pictures instead of shutting himself inside his stifling sylvan cottages, year after year? And were his critics right to say that his famous paintings were disturbing all along? \"One of the things that was obvious early on,\" says Yousef, \"was that his fans had a two-dimensional view of him and his critics had another completely different two-dimensional view of him. I knew there was a three-dimensional person in there somewhere, and that's what I wanted to try to find.\"\nIn some ways, Kinkade was ahead of his time. First, he was a culture warrior before culture wars were being fought as fiercely as they are now. As someone who claimed that he was taking a stand for Christianity and patriotism and against the intellectual elite, he was staking out territory occupied by more and more in the US today. He was also ahead of his time as an artist with such a brazen commercial side. \"Today we're seeing all these artist collabs,\" says Yousef. \"There's Yayoi Kusama who's working with Louis Vuitton, and Tom Sachs is working with Nike, and Kehinde Wiley is doing a collab with American Express, whereas you see in the movie an MBNA bank card with a Thomas Kinkade painting on it.

This is not a team that's given up,\" he said.\n\"I think football is the biggest sport in the world because the underdog always has a chance.\"\nOpta's 'supercomputer' prediction model has Chelsea as nailed-on favourites to lift the WSL trophy, with the Blues projected as champions in 99.4% of simulations.\nArsenal, meanwhile, have been given a slither of hope, with Opta giving them a 0.5% chance of winning the title.\nManchester City's bid for European football does not look favourable either, with Cushing's side predicted to finish outside of the top three in 75.5% of simulations.\nAccording to Opta's predictions, Amandine Miquel's Leicester have all but confirmed their stay in the WSL for another season, with only a 0.5% chance of relegation.\nThe stats also favour Aston Villa and tell a worrying tale for Crystal Palace as they suggest the Eagles have a 76.8% chance of sitting bottom of the table on 10 May.",

Eight points from the remaining five games would be enough for United to pip their city rivals to European qualification.Who is at risk of relegation?After winning the Championship last season, Crystal Palace have struggled to adapt during their first season in England's top division.The club looked destined to go straight back down, but a 3-1 win over fellow strugglers Villa earlier this month has given Leif Smerud's side a fighting chance.Villa, billed to break into the top four just 18 months ago, have struggled since Carla Ward's departure and they sit one point above Palace in the danger zone.",

        "article_text": "Usher has kicked off a 10-night residency at London's O2 Arena with a slick, two-hour show that was impressive and frustrating in equal measure.\nThe US pop star played more than 40 songs, including hits like Yeah, Burn, U Remind Me and OMG, with multiple costume changes and buttery-smooth choreography.\nBut the show, which comes to the UK after a 62-date run in the US, felt oddly rough around the edges - including a handful of on-stage stumbles and missed musical cues.\nThe momentum was frequently torpedoed by waffly, overlong video interludes - but Usher's magnetic stage presence just about held the concert together.\nTitled \"Past, Present, Future\", the tour is billed as an \"intimate\" look at Usher Raymond IV's 30-year career, as well as \"a glimpse into the future\".\nIt comes as the star, one of the best-selling artists of the 2000s, is enjoying a career rebirth - following an acclaimed Super Bowl half-time show, and the release of his ninth studio album, Coming Home.\nWith 10 sold-out shows at the O2, he enters an elite group of artists who've played double-digit residencies at the venue, alongside Queen (10 shows in 2022), Bon Jovi (12 nights in 2010) and Prince (21 nights in 2007).\n\nAt its core, Past, Present, Future illustrates the skill with which the 46-year-old has navigated the evolving trends of the music industry.\nWe see a video clip of him, aged 14, dancing to his debut single, Call Me A Mack, then watch as he transforms into a teenage heartthrob, a confessional balladeer, an EDM party-starter, and an elder statesman of R&B.\nHe arrives from under the stage in a fog of dry ice and a cone of laser beams, apparently controlling the lights with his bare hands, before dancing to the middle of the arena with the molten fluidity of his idol, Michael Jackson.\nClad in a sparkly raincoat and wide-brimmed Pharrell hat, he races through hits like Coming Home, Hey Daddy and U Make Me Wanna, backed by a funky 10-piece band and a dance team that echoes his every move.\nThe choreography is a constant highlight. Usher's moves are so effortless that they look unrehearsed, but such ease comes at a cost: Last year, he had to postpone the start of the tour after injuring his neck in practice.\nAt the O2, that pain seemed a distant memory, as he careened around the U-shaped stage on roller skates, pulling off a flawless moonwalk, and even freeze-framing in a handstand.\nHe might have fumbled a hat at one point, but it was one of his dancers who came closest to calamity - losing his balance during an elaborate chair routine, sending the chair spinning across the stage.\nThe band also suffered a mishap, missing Usher's cue to extend the intro to Superstar, and coming in four bars early. Not disastrous, but still unusual for a show on this level.\nThe hits were punctuated by numerous interludes, narrated by Celeste, a glitch-prone \"computer driven by AI technology to help Mr Raymond tell his story\",  from teen wannabe to global superstar, against a backdrop of infidelity, tabloid infamy, redemption and survival.\nThe problem was his songs couldn't support the weight of that story. With a few exceptions, Usher mostly sings about lusting after women in the club, and carnal pleasures in the bedroom.\nThe result was a weirdly disconnected show, where Usher followed a moving video about his absent father with a song about his ex, which he sung while straddling a motorbike.\nPriapism was a running theme. Women in the audience were fed with cocktail cherries (\"oh, it's your first time?\" Usher mugged into the camera)  and part of the stage was turned into a strip club, complete with pole dancers, during Bad Girl.\nThat sort of tongue-in-cheek raunch has been a hallmark of Usher's career, but it felt dated and shallow in a concert that promised an intimate look into his personality. \nPerhaps he just wanted us to know that, deep down, he really, really likes sex.\n\nLuckily, the songs still hold up. A trio of quiet storm ballads - Climax, Burn and Confessions Part II - had couples serenading each other, while a trio of women near me took the opportunity to slow dance a security guard who was mopping the floor.\nTo his credit, Usher sang everything live, with an airy falsetto that's undiminished after 30 years on tour. During U Got It Bad, he held one sustained note for over 10 seconds.\nAt times, he struggled to hold the audience's attention during the slow jams. The UK has always preferred him in club mode - and it was his three biggest-sellers, Yeah, OMG and DJ Got Us Falling In Love that really set the O2 alight.\nStrangely it was one of those empty club anthems, I Am The Party, that ultimately carried the most meaning.\n\"Hopefully my [music] has been something to you,\" Usher said over the introduction.\n\"Maybe we fell in love together, maybe we had a good time together, but something brought you here. And I just want you to know, I appreciate the connection.\"\n\"If I didn't have you to cheer me on, I wouldn't continue to do this.\"\nPop stars say this sort of thing all the time. But as he stood at the O2, drenched in sweat, remembering the father who abandoned him and soaking up the audience's affection, Usher didn't seem to be putting on an act.\nBy the encore, he'd given up all pretence of being a high-rolling playboy. \nInstead, he bounded around the stage, giddily filming the audience on his phone, as they hollered out the chorus to Without You.\nIf only that performer had shown up earlier.",

Atletico then bought him back in 2021 for just \u00a316.5m.\nSpain midfielder Rodri, now a Ballon d'Or winner, was signed for \u00a316.5m in 2018 and sold to Manchester City the following year for \u00a362.5m, while Slovenian goalkeeper Oblak signed from Benfica in 2014 for just \u00a313m. He's now widely regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the world.\nMore recently, forward Julian Alvarez joined from Manchester City last summer for \u00a381.5m and he has scored 23 goals for Atletico this season.\n\"He brought in key players like Griezmann (twice), Luis Suarez, Kieran Trippier, Llorente, De Paul, and Julian Alvarez,\" added Balague. \n\"But he also had some flops, like Joao Felix, Kalinic, Arias, Torreira, but he always worked within the club's financial limits.\n\"In total, he made 52 signings since 2017, spending around 828 million euros (\u00a3692m), leaving a big mark on Atletico's squad. An end of an era for them.\"\nBBC Sport's Arsenal reporter Alex Howell\nThere are a few immediate issues he has to deal with.\nThe main and most obvious task is to ensure that Arsenal bring in a much-needed forward.

It's a big summer for the club with key players Bukayo Saka, William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes entering the last two years of their contracts.\nBerta will need to make sure that those players are locked down so that Arteta can continue to build on the impressive work he has done with the team.\nThere are also players who need to be moved on. Oleksandr Zinchenko has dropped further down the pecking order after the emergence of Myles Lewis-Skelly and the Gunners were willing to let him go in January if they received the right offer.\nIt is an exciting project for any sporting director to come into but with the Gunners challenging for silverware in recent seasons, this summer is not something that they can afford to get wrong.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has imposed a range of tariffs - or import taxes - on billions of dollars worth of goods coming into the US from some of its top trading partners.\nThe tariffs apply to steel and aluminium imported to the US, as well as to some other products from Mexico, Canada and China - prompting announcements of counter-measures from the latter two countries and the European Union. \nTrump has also announced tariffs on cars coming into the US which are due to come into effect on 3 April. Tariffs on certain car parts are set to start in May or later.\nEconomists have warned these tariffs - and those introduced in response by other countries - could put prices up for American consumers. \nThat's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, which may choose to pass the cost on to customers, or to reduce imports, meaning fewer products are available.\nSo which things could become more expensive?\nThe US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade.\nMany US car companies also have operations in Mexico and Canada, set up under the terms of the longstanding free trade agreement between them.\nComponent parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.\nThe new tariffs on car parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt for now while US customs and border patrol set up a system to assess the duties.\nAnderson Economic Group has estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by roughly $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle.\nThe cost of the higher taxes is likely to be passed on to customers.\nAndrew Foran from TD Economics has said that disrupting trade flows through tariffs \"would come with significant costs\".\nHe argues that the \"uninterrupted free trade\" which has \"existed for decades\" in the car-making sector has lowered prices for consumers.\nPopular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.\nHowever, it's also possible that firms could decide to bring in less foreign beer.\nModelo became the number one beer brand in the US in 2023, and remains in the top spot, for now. \nThe picture is more complicated when it comes to spirits, which have been largely free of tariffs since the 1990s. \nIndustry bodies from the US, Canada and Mexico issued a joint statement in advance of the tariffs being announced saying they were \"deeply concerned\". \nThey argue that certain brands, such as Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila and Canadian whisky are \"recognized as distinctive products and can only be produced in their designated countries\".\nSo given the production of these drinks cannot simply be moved, supplies might be impacted, leading to price rises. \nThe bodies also highlighted that many companies own different spirit brands in the US, Canada and Mexico.\nThe US imports about a third of its softwood lumber from Canada each year, and that key building material could be hit by Trump's tariffs. \nTrump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".\nHowever, the National Association of Home Builders urged the president to exempt building materials \"because of their harmful effect on housing affordability\".\nThe industry group has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.\n\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.\nImports from the rest of the world could also be affected. \nOn 1 March, Trump ordered an investigation into whether the US should place additional tariffs on most lumber and timber imports, regardless of their country of origin, or create incentives to boost domestic production. \nFindings are due towards the end of 2025.\nThe \"most obvious\" household impact of a trade war with Canada would be on the price of Canadian maple syrup, according to Thomas Sampson from the London School of Economics.\nCanada's billion-dollar industry accounts for 75% of the world's entire maple syrup production.\nThe majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.\n\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" Mr Sampson said.\n\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but [which use] inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.\nCanada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil. \nAccording to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November 2024 came from Canada.\nWhile the US has introduced a 25% tariff on most goods imported from Canada, Canadian energy faces a lower rate of 10%. \nThe US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but its refineries are designed to process so-called \"heavier\" - or thicker - crude oil, which mostly comes from Canada, with some from Mexico.\n\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.\nThat means if Canada decided to reduce crude oil exports in retaliation against US tariffs, it could push up fuel prices. \nAvocados thrive in in the Mexican climate. \nNearly 90% of the avocados consumed in the US come from Mexico.\nThe US Agriculture Department has warned that tariffs on Mexican fruit and vegetables could increase the cost of avocados.\nRelated dishes like guacamole could also become more expensive. \nAdditional reporting by Lucy Acheson",

        "article_text": "A carpet of flowers has been growing outside Wigan Athletic's stadium in tribute to Darren Orme\nDarren Orme was a familiar figure cycling through the streets to work, the supporter known as 'Mr Wigan Athletic' because of a devotion to his beloved Latics stretching back more than 40 years.\nHe was nearly always first on the supporters' coach travelling to away games, happy to wait in the early hours for the ticket office to open for big occasions such as the club's greatest day - the 2013 FA Cup final win over Manchester City at Wembley.\nWhen he was reported missing on 5 March, supporters, the town and its respective football and rugby league clubs rallied in the search for the 54-year-old amid a huge public response.\nSadly, his body was discovered a fortnight later in the shadow of the Brick Community Stadium where he always took his seat in the East Stand.\nIt is a story both heartbreaking and heartwarming, as it enabled the people of Wigan to prove that the powerful concept of football as an extension of family still exists.\nThe life of this much-loved supporter will be commemorated and celebrated at Wigan Athletic's home game against Barnsley on Saturday (15:00 GMT), when a minute's applause will be held, while a shirt emblazoned with 'Darren 1 Of Our Own' and a scarf will be placed on his seat.\nSince the news of Darren's death a carpet of flowers has grown around the stadium's statue of former Wigan chairman and owner Dave Whelan, while a book of condolence has been opened.\nAmid the sadness, the response from Wigan supporters, and the town as a whole, has shone a light on the pivotal role a football club can play in its community - and how regarding your club as an extension of family is not an emotional exaggeration.\nMick Wimsey, chairman of the club's Travel and Supporters Club, organised a search for Darren in the days following his disappearance, also driving around in the early hours while taking time off work in an attempt to find the friend who had followed Wigan Athletic with him for more than four decades.\n\"We live in a bad world,\" he told BBC Sport. \"But the amount of goodness that's come out of this is amazing. When there was no word on Darren after a few days, we organised a search on the Sunday after he went missing.\n\"I was only expecting a few people to turn up but we had more than 100. All those people searched for Darren from 10am to 4.30pm - then some went back out afterwards after they had a break.\n\"On that Sunday morning, there were people who don't even watch football, but had seen him going to work on his bike and felt compelled to come and look for him. It was heartbreaking, but there was good in it as well.\"\nHe added: \"Football clubs are like your family. He was part of our family at Latics. Once you saw him you'd never forget him. His smile was infectious. If you could bottle what Darren had, Armani would make millions out of it.\n\"Sometimes you saw more of him than you did members of your own family. He was one of my best friends. I've been watching Wigan for 46 seasons and running the supporters' club for 44. I've known Darren for so long. I met him at a game against Walsall when we were both kids about 14 years of age.\n\"I was asked to write a tribute to him in the local paper. It just poured out of me and I found myself with tears streaming down my face. Everyone loved Darren - although he was definitely the worst raffle-ticket seller I ever knew.\"\nThe official Wigan Athletic Supporters Club paid an emotional tribute to \"a recognisable and loved character\" who \"lived and breathed blue and white\". It will pay posthumous tribute with a fan of the month award - a framed certificate passed to Darren's family before Saturday's game.\nIt added: \"He had numerous nominations for our fan of the month, including 'for being the loudest singer in any stadium' and for bringing back programmes from away matches for fans who couldn't attend themselves. Darren was kind-hearted and caring.\"\nThe body of popular Wigan Athletic supporter Darren Orme was found on Monday\nWhen he was reported missing, posters were placed in shop windows around Wigan, while new manager Ryan Lowe made a public appeal. There was also a banner on display at Wigan's training headquarters.\nJamie Allen, head of media marketing and communications at Wigan, said: \"Latics has had its issues on and off the pitch over the last few years. It's been a rollercoaster ride at Wigan Athletic, but this showed what this club and town has at its heart.\n\"This was not the outcome anyone wanted and is devastating, but it united a town and a sporting family across two clubs - Wigan Athletic and Wigan Warriors. The community and clubs come together in times of need and, like families, this is what happened here.\n\"This is a very sad outcome but there is a heartwarming side to this in what it says about our town and the people in it, and how much a football club and its supporters - and of course the rugby league club - can mean.\"\nSaturday will be an emotional day in Wigan when they face Barnsley, but Wimsey says: \"Football supporters are a community regardless of who you support. Bolton Wanderers fans, our big rivals, were sending love and their thoughts.\n\"It will change next Tuesday when we play each other, but for this period of time we were all like one big family. This is what football is -  it is grassroots, working class and the word 'family' is right.\"\nWigan, of course, are not the first club or community to have proved amid tragedy that football has a life and impact stretching beyond 90 minutes.\nWhen six-year-old Bradley Lowery died after a long illness - he was only 18 months when diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a rare type of cancer - he had become known to the whole football community. \nThe Sunderland fan became \"best mates\" with his hero, striker Jermain Defoe, as well as gaining worldwide recognition following an appeal in which he received 250,000 Christmas cards from around the globe.\nHe met then England manager Gareth Southgate and former striker Gary Lineker at BBC Sports Personality of the Year, and won Match of the Day's goal of the month award after he took a penalty before a Sunderland game against Chelsea.\nMeanwhile, earlier this month, Rangers captain James Tavernier, goalkeeper Jack Butland and former Scotland international Robert Snodgrass all contributed to a fundraiser for a fan killed in Turkey after being hit by two cars while crossing a road in Istanbul before the Glasgow side's Europa League match with Fenerbahce.\nOxford United are another club touched by tragedy, when former winger Joey Beauchamp, regarded by many as their greatest player, took his own life aged 50 in February 2022.\nHis younger brother Luke has set up a foundation in his name to help those battling mental health and depression to support their families.\nPaul Peros, chairman of OXVOX, the Independent Supporters Trust for Oxford United, said: \"Fundamentally, as much as everyone wants wins and promotions, we want to feel connected to the club we love, along with the fans who share the experience.\n\"In a slightly different way, when Joey passed away it did feel almost like a member of a family, because in a broader sense football is absolutely a family, especially at your own club.\n\"You spend as much time with those you regularly go to the match with as you do a lot of your family. You build those bonds. The story of the Wigan supporter is so sad but has also shown how football does go beyond the pitch and into the community.\n\"There are people that you may not know, but have just seen around at away games or whatever. You have shared experiences, like members of a family. The minute you sit down, they will bring up things like the non-league days, the experiences, good and bad.\n\"There have been a couple of instances where we have spoken directly to people we are aware of that may be struggling in some way, but it is more a case of us helping to facilitate things like the Joey Beauchamp Foundation, who are doing great work, and the club taking it on.\"",

It means so much to Villa fans because hardly any of us are alive who have seen us win it.\n\"Even my dad wasn't born the last time we won it [in 1957] and winning at Wembley would be very special. \n\"I've been lucky enough to go there a few times with Villa but other than our play-off win when we got promoted in 2019,  it has always ended up in misery.\"\nChris Sutton and Nathan Dawe were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\nGap = league places between the two teams\nCraven Cottage, 12:15 GMT\n8th in Premier League v 12th in Premier League\nGap = 4\nLast major trophy? Fulham: Never. Palace: Never\nBest FA Cup run? Fulham: runners-up in 1975. Palace: runners-up in 1990 & 2016\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.\nCrystal Palace won at Craven Cottage at the end of February and it is a ground where they have a decent record - they haven't lost there in their past six visits, since 2005.\nIt's a boost for Palace that Jean-Philippe Mateta is available to lead their attack - he can play wearing a special mask to protect his ear after his injury against Millwall in the fifth round - but we will have to see how much he has been affected by such a horrific challenge.\nThis video can not be played\nMillwall's Roberts sent off for 'dangerous' tackle on Mateta\nThe Eagles are a well-balanced team who seem to be improving all the time under Oliver Glasner - they have lost only two of their past 14 games in all competitions.\nI've found Fulham hard to predict this season because they've been less reliable than usual at home, but they are still having a strong campaign - they are in the mix for the Champions League places, and are only three points behind fifth-placed City.\nPalace are very strong on the road but they have not played for the past three weeks - their game against Newcastle before the international break was postponed because of the Carabao Cup final.\nWe often talk about teams needing a rest, but my concern is how that break has affected their momentum.\nThis is going to be a close game, but I actually fancy Fulham to edge it. Marco Silva's side have got goals in them, and my gut feeling is that they will get through in 90 minutes.\nI just hope both managers go for it properly, and don't prioritise next week's midweek Premier League games [Fulham are at Arsenal on Tuesday and Palace travel to Southampton on Wednesday] instead of this tie.\nFulham and Palace have shown this season they have got enough quality in their strongest starting XIs to go all the way in the FA Cup, especially this year when the competition appears so open. \nThey are both in a great position to finally win a major trophy, so why not try to make history and give their fans something to celebrate?\nPalace's only previous cup success was winning the Zenith Data Systems Cup in 1991. \nI can imagine their fans enjoyed that day a lot, but lifting the FA Cup would be on a different planet, and the same goes for Fulham, who have not even been in an FA Cup semi-final since 2002.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nNathan's prediction: It feels like Palace always turn into world-beaters in the last couple of months of the season, and I can see them winning this. 1-2\nAmex Stadium, 17:15 GMT\n7th in Premier League v 3rd in Premier League\nGap = 4\nLast major trophy?

Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.\nBrighton will see this as the chance to get revenge for their 7-0 defeat at the City Ground at the start of February.\nI am sure some people felt the wheels had come off for Seagulls boss Fabian Hurzeler after that result, but instead his side have bounced back and gone on a great run of six wins and one draw in all competitions.\nSometimes getting thrashed like that can have a positive effect on a team, and clear the air. \nI remember losing 7-1 at Blackburn Rovers in October 1992, when I was a centre-half for Norwich City, but we had a crate of beer on the coach home to put things right and we were still top of the  Premier League table at Christmas. I did get moved up front after that though.\nAs for Nottingham Forest, they are the only team left in the FA Cup where I could understand it if they rested players this weekend, because of their league position.\nThey play Manchester United on Tuesday and the finish line is in sight for my boyhood team to finish third and secure Champions League football.\nThat's why it's disappointing to hear about Chris Wood getting injured while playing for New Zealand this week.\nHopefully it is not serious, but it is a blow for Forest if they are without their main number nine for any length of time.\nTheir game plan won't change without Wood - they will sit deep and attack on the break, it is just a question on whether it is their A team who face Brighton or not, and my hunch is that Nuno Espirito Santo will make a few changes.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nNathan's prediction: Forest are in such a good position in the league, I have a feeling they are going to be super-focused on that. For that reason, I am going with Brighton. 2-0\nDeepdale, 13:30 BST\n14th in Championship v 9th in Premier League\nGap = 25\nLast major trophy? Preston: 1938 FA Cup.

Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.\nPreston are hard to beat at home and have not lost at Deepdale since 2 November, a run of 15 games.\nI've seen quite a bit of Paul Heckingbottom's team this season and they will defend deep, set up in a 3-5-2 shape and make themselves hard to break down.\nIt's an old football cliche, but in this case it is very true that the first goal will be extremely important.\nAston Villa have got some brilliant attacking players, but I also always feel like teams can score against them.\nIf they go behind, they could have problems but I do feel their quality should see them through - depending on Unai Emery's team selection of course, with a big league game coming up at Brighton on Wednesday.\nVilla have got their eyes on numerous prizes and there probably hasn't been excitement levels like this at the club since Martin O'Neill signed me in 2006.\nI'm still backing them here, but it is going to be a cagey game, and they might have to wait to make the breakthrough before a couple of late goals get the job done.\nI'm going for Emi Martinez to keep a clean sheet, too. His keepie-uppie antics, external to wind up Brazil while playing for Argentina this week were another reminder of why he is the best goalkeeper in the world. Anyone who can produce moments like that in a game of that magnitude deserves all the accolades you can get.\nSutton's prediction: 0-2\nNathan's prediction: The FA Cup has opened up for us this season, and it feels like we are the favourites now. I just really hope our schedule doesn't take too much toll on the players and we fall short because of that, but I am looking forward to the rest of the season for sure. \nBrighton will be tough on Wednesday so what do we prioritise, even with a quality squad like ours? That part is down to Emery, and he will probably rest a couple of first-choice players on Sunday, but I would love us to go to Preston, put out a strong team and win comfortably. I am not super-convinced that is going to happen anyway though, even if we don't make lots of changes, because Preston will throw everything at us. \nIt won't be as easy as people might think, but I do expect us to go through.  0-1\nVitality Stadium, 16:30 BST\n10th in Premier League v 5th in Premier League\nGap = 5\nLast major trophy? Bournemouth: never. City: 2024 Premier League\nBest FA Cup run? Bournemouth: quarter-finals 1957 & 2021. City: winners x7 between 1904 & 2023\nThis is such a difficult tie to call.\nBournemouth were the team who started the rot for Manchester City when they deservedly beat them in November, for what was the defending champions' first league defeat of the season.\nBack then, they were still 'mighty City', the team who were dominating English football, who hardly ever slipped up. \nWho would have imagined that, five months on, they would have lost eight of their next 19 league games and be in the position they are now, with just the FA Cup left as the only thing they can win?\nThis competition is huge for City now, because it feels so crucial for boss Pep Guardiola to finish such a difficult season with a piece of silverware.\nSo, it helps him that the Cherries are not in great form, with only one point from their past four league games, and also that they are without two key defenders here; Milos Kerkez and Dean Huijsen, who are both suspended.\nCity are still far from convincing at the moment, however, and it is hard to know what their strongest line-up is.\nPhil Foden's struggles for England last week were a reminder of how last season's PFA and FWA Player of the Year has been a shadow of his usual self all campaign, but he is not the only City player to have been well below his best.\nStill, there is no chance of Pep saving anyone for Wednesday's league game against Leicester, even though City have got a real fight on their hands to finish in the top five.\nPep always takes the FA Cup seriously anyway, and he has shown that by reaching the semi-finals for each of the past six seasons - something no other team had done before.\nWill City make it to the last four again? Yes... but only just.\nBournemouth are so good with their press that they won't allow City to easily play out from the back - there are going to be plenty of goals, and I can see it being settled in extra-time.\nSutton's prediction: 2-3 after extra-time\nNathan's prediction: Bournemouth are having a good season but I am still backing City to get through. 1-3\nThere were eight Premier League games played in week 29, the last set of fixtures before the international break.\nSo far, Chris and his guest, Divorce singer Felix, have both got four correct results, with one exact score, giving them both 70 points.\nFor now, it goes down as a win for the BBC readers - using the most popular scoreline from your predictions for each game, you got five correct results, with one exact score, leaving you on 80 points.\nThe remaining two games were rearranged because of the Carabao Cup final. \nNo-one picked up any points from Liverpool's draw with Aston Villa, which was moved forward to 19 February, so the weekly winner will be decided when Newcastle host Crystal Palace on 16 April - Felix has gone for a 2-1 Palace win.\nChris and Felix also made a prediction for the Carabao Cup final, and they both wrongly picked Liverpool to win it. \nThey were not alone, because the majority BBC readers also went for a Reds victory - out of almost 38,000 predictions, 73% of you thought Arne Slot's side would prevail.",

There was applause when rescuers pulled a woman alive from the wreckage of a 12-storey apartment block some 30 hours after it collapsed, but the Red Cross says more than 90 people may still be trapped there.\nIn a nearby township, rescue workers found the bodies of 12 preschool children and a teacher under a building housing a kindergarten.\nCracks and surface distortions to the main highway between the biggest city Yangon, the capital Nay Pyi Taw and Mandalay had caused severe transport disruptions, UN humanitarian agency OCHA said.\nThere were also shortages of medical supplies including trauma kits, blood bags, anaesthetics, essential medicines and tents for health workers, it said.\nAlthough rescue teams have been at work since yesterday and international aid has begun to enter the country, help is yet to reach the worst-hit areas and ordinary people have been trying to dig survivors out by hand. \nWidely shared footage shows two men moving rubble to pry out a young woman trapped between two concrete slabs. \nThe BBC has spoken to locals who said that people were screaming for help from under the debris. \nElsewhere, other rescue workers have been listening out for signs of life. ''We can only rescue people when we hear them,'' one said.\nEarlier on Saturday, a rescue team in the Sintkai township in Mandalay's Kyaukse district pulled out a number of people trapped in the debris of a private school. Six of them \u2013 five females and one male \u2013 had died by the time the rescue teams arrived. Among the victims were students, teachers and school staff.\nA lack of equipment is greatly slowing down the rescues, a worker told BBC Burmese: \"We are making do with the equipment we have. We have been trying for hours to pull out a girl trapped under the collapsed school.\"\nAnother worker in Mandalay told a BBC reporter in Yangon that communication had been near impossible.\n\"The main thing is that we don't have internet lines, we don't have phone lines, so it's very difficult to connect with each other. The rescue team has arrived. But we don't know where it will go, because the phone lines are down.\"\nA Mandalay resident said people were doing their best in the chaotic circumstances.\n\"There is no coordination in the rescue efforts, no one to lead them, or tell them what to do. Locals have had to fend for themselves. If they find dead bodies in the debris, they don't even know where to send the bodies; hospitals are overwhelmed and unable to cope,\" the resident said.\nThe junta has put the number of damaged buildings in the Mandalay region, the epicentre of the earthquake, at more than 1,500. Power outages have exacerbated the situation, and according to officials restoring power could take days.\nMandalay airport is not functional as the runways were damaged during the earthquake. The military council said that it had been working to resume operations and a temporary hospital, medical relief camp and shelter have been set up there.\nLess than 25km (15 miles) from Mandalay in Sagaing, the older of two bridges connecting the regions has completely collapsed and the newer one has developed cracks, cutting off access for rescue teams. \n\"Right now, there are not enough people even for emergency rescue. We can't pick up bodies, there are so many people trapped. We can't cross either bridge, so we are all trapped in the rubble. Please help emergency rescuers come and rescue us,\" a local resident told BBC Burmese.\nThe recently constructed capital Nay Pyi Daw, where the military junta is headquartered, has been hit by aftershocks and small tremors. The city has seen extensive damage with high numbers of casualties, collapsed buildings and buckled roads.\nMeanwhile, even while the junta has made a rare international appeal for aid, it has continued air strikes and drone attacks against the ethnic armies and armed groups it has been fighting in the country's four-year civil war. \nBBC Burmese confirmed that seven people were killed in an air strike in Naungcho in northern Shan state. This strike took place around 15:30 local time, less than three hours after the quake struck.\nPro-democracy rebel groups fighting to remove the military from power have reported aerial bombings in Chang-U township in the central Sagaing region, the epicentre of the quake. There are also reports of airstrikes in regions near the Thai border.\nThe UN's special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, urged the junta to cease bombing raids.\n\"The problem is that you still have military operations going on right now... Military strikes by the military junta,\" he told the BBC.\n\"I'm calling upon the junta to just stop, stop any of its military operations. This is completely outrageous and unacceptable.\"",

        "article_text": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says US President Donald Trump \"respected Canada's sovereignty\" in the first call between the pair, who spoke amid an ongoing trade war between the two neighbours.\nTrump has repeatedly suggested that Canada should become the 51st US state - an idea that has sparked widespread backlash among Canadians. \nCarney, currently in the midst of an election campaign, described the call as \"very constructive\", while Trump said the call was \"extremely productive\". \nTrump's planned 25% tariff on vehicle imports is due to come into effect on 2 April, which could prove devastating for the Canadian car industry.\nHistorically, Canadian leaders prioritise an early call with their US counterpart soon after becoming prime minister. \nThe call between Carney and Trump, however, is the first since the new prime minister took office on 14 March. \nThe Canadian prime minister's office said the two leaders agreed to begin comprehensive negotiations about a new economic and security relationship immediately following the election, which will be held on 28 April. \nThe US president's tone on Friday stood in contrast to his past remarks about Canada - particularly his frequent jabs at Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau, whom he mockingly referred to as \"Governor Trudeau\".\n\"I've always loved Canada,\" Trump told reporters after the call. \"We had a very good conversation.

        "article_text": "Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is highlighting its environmental credentials by continuing to put its money on the line.\nBack in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a \"sustainability linked loan\" or SLL.\nThis is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.\nGothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.\nMeet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; \u00a38,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.\nIn 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.\nHowever, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.\nFredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set \"ambitious\" targets.\n\"You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.\n\"We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.\"\nThe improvements to the city's poorest areas \u2013 and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.\nKey initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.\nPublic housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.\n\"For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,\" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.\n\"We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.\n\"I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything.\"\nBut Faduma Awil, a social worker who now provides career coaching at an employment centre in Gothenburg, is concerned that increased cameras and police presence sends the wrong message to youth in Gothenburg's deprived areas - and could see racial profiling increase.\n\"What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?\" she says.\n\"What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.\"\nMs Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.\n\"People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,\" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.\nNegotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.\nSuch is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023, according to data from financial news provider Bloomberg.\nMats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.\nHe says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.\n\"It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,\" he says. \"You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.\n\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"\nOne company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed \u00a310m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.\nIts binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.\nBy meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.\n\"If we didn't meet the goals, we would be landed with interest penalty rates. We also accept that failing to meet sustainability targets could harm the firm's reputation, as we have made a public commitment.\n\"It shouldn't be about committing to the loan to get a discount on financing - there needs to be ambition behind the goals.\"\nBack in Gothenburg, the city's current environmental and social targets run until 2030. Mr Block says that the detailed yearly SLL reporting shows to potential future investors in the city what a difference their money would make.\n\"Banks want to give money to sustainable cities, so packaging up our progress in our SLL reporting is how I make the city beautiful for investors,\" he says.\n\"I can't change the credit worthiness of the city, but I can change how investors look at our sustainability work, and make it more attractive to them.\"",

        "article_text": "On 3 May Australians will head to the polls to vote in their first federal election since 2022. \nThe results will determine who the next prime minister will be, as well as the make-up of the nation's parliament.\nAustralia famously has a unique electoral system - and some quirky polling day traditions. Voting is mandatory for all citizens over 18, the country uses preferential voting, and picking up a \"democracy sausage\" is a polling day custom.\nAlmost 18 million people are registered to vote in this election - roughly 98% of those who are eligible. \nUnlike the First Past the Post system - used in the UK and most US states - which elects candidates based on who has received the greatest number of votes in a single count, regardless of whether they've secured an absolute majority - voters in Australia rank candidates in order of preference. \nIf no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote in the first tally, the votes from the least popular candidates are then redistributed, and that process repeated until someone secures a majority.\nIn races for the House of Representatives, voters are required to mark a preference down for every single candidate listed on the ballot. \nHowever, in Senate races, voters only need to mark down a designated number of preferences. \nIt is the leader of the party that receives the most seats in the House who then becomes prime minister. There is no separate leadership ballot. \nAll of the seats in Australia's House of Representatives - that's 150 in this election -will be up for grabs, as will 40 of the 76 seats in the Senate. \nAustralia has two major parties: the left-leaning Australian Labor Party and the conservative Liberal-National coalition. \nOne party needs to win at least 76 seats in the House to form a majority government.\nIf it cannot do that, it must try to win support from minor parties or independent MPs. \nIn both state and federal elections, the vote share for minor parties and independents has been steadily increasing in Australia for decades. \nThat reached record levels in the 2022 federal election, with one in three Australians casting votes for candidates outside the two major parties.\nLabor formed a majority government after winning the 2022 election, which delivered the biggest loss for the Liberal Party since its inception. \nAs it stands, Labor has 78 seats in the House of Representatives, while the coalition has 57, with minor parties and independents splitting the remainder.\nBut with one House seat abolished, if Labor loses just two seats at this election it will be stripped of its majority in parliament.\nIn order to form a government in its own right, the coalition needs to win 19 seats, likely including many of those it lost to independent candidates during the 2022 vote. \nAnthony Albanese has been the prime minister since the last election, and a stalwart of parliament for almost 30 years.\nWhile he enjoyed a period of broad popularity after coming to power in 2022, he has in recent times come under pressure over his handling of divisive topics like housing, Indigenous affairs and both antisemitism and Islamophobia.\nAlbanese is being challenged by Peter Dutton, who became head of the Liberal-National coalition after their 2022 defeat. He is contesting his first election as opposition leader. \nKnown as a staunch conservative, Dutton has years of experience in important ministerial portfolios - like defence and home affairs - but has been a controversial figure at times, particularly on social issues.\nBoth the polling and the political messaging around this year's election indicate that cost of living is the biggest concern for many voters. \nSince the 2022 election, inflation - which is now slowing - has pushed up the prices of everyday essentials such as food and utilities, leaving many households feeling stretched. \nThe Albanese government has implemented a string of policies that it says are aimed at providing relief, such as keeping the cost of medications down, and offering tax cuts, energy rebates and rental assistance to those eligible.  \nHowever, Australia has raised interest rates 12 times since Albanese was elected in May 2022 - something that is done independently of government but seen to reflect their economic management - and that has put additional pressure on borrowers and those with mortgages across the country.\nHousing affordability will also be a key issue this election cycle, with several Australian cities among the most expensive in the world for homebuyers.\nHistorically, Australians are used to getting a result and knowing who will form government on election night. \nHowever, it is usually not the Australian Election Commission - the official body tasked with manually counting the votes - that declares this. \nInstead, the AEC provides what's known as an \"indicative count\" throughout the day, which media commentators, election experts and sometimes even the parties and candidates themselves then base their calls on.\nThe AEC does not formally declare a seat until it is confident the result will not change based on the number of uncounted votes, which can sometimes take days.

It was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties.Meanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said three Ukrainian drones were either intercepted or shot down over the western Belgorod region.In his video address late on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky again accused Russia of targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure - in violation of a temporary moratorium agreed earlier this month in talks involving the US.Moscow has also repeatedly blamed Ukraine for attacking Russia's energy sector.Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested earlier this week that Ukraine should temporarily be placed under UN control to elect what he called a more \"competent\" government.It was seen as the latest attempt by the Kremlin to challenge the legitimacy of the Kyiv government - a move widely condemned by Ukraine's allies.Ukraine accused Putin of proposing \"crazy\" ideas to delay further movement towards a ceasefire deal being championed by US President Donald Trump.Washington said on Tuesday that the two sides had agreed to a limited truce in the Black Sea.But Russia then put forward a list of conditions, including the lifting of some Western sanctions, prompting concerns that Moscow was trying to derail any moves towards a ceasefire.In a separate development, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that France and the UK were moving forward with plans for a \"reassurance force\" in Ukraine.The proposal was discussed at a summit of the \"coalition of the willing\" - Ukraine's allies from more than 30 countries -  in Paris.Russia has repeatedly warned that the deployment of any European troops in Ukraine would be unacceptable, and such forces would be seen by the Kremlin as a legitimate target.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.Zelensky hopes US will 'stand strong' in face of Russian demandsWhy Trump is struggling to secure fast ceasefire in UkraineEuropeWar in UkraineFranceVolodymyr ZelenskyRussiaVladimir PutinUnited StatesUkraine",

        "article_text": "South Africa's former ambassador to the US has told the BBC it is \u201cself-evident\u201d that there is racism within the Trump administration.\nEbrahim Rasool, 62, was ordered to leave the US last week after Secretary of State Marco Rubio called him a \"race-baiting politician who hates America\". \nThis came after Rasool accused President Donald Trump of trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\".\nAsked by the BBC's Newshour programme whether he believed the Trump administration was racist, Rasool said: \"I think it is self-evident rather than anyone needing to be called out.\u201d\nThe BBC has asked the White House for comment.\nIn one of his first interviews since being expelled from the US, Rasool added: \"I'm saying when a piece of wood has a hinge, you begin to suspect it's a door.\" \nThe diplomat cited the administration's emphasis on deportating migrants as well as the targeting of foreign students who had supported pro-Palestinian protests. He also accused Trump's team of mobilising \"certain far-right communities\".\nThe Trump administration has denied accusations of racism. The president says he has a mandate to deport thousands of migrants who entered the US illegally after it formed a central part of his election campaign last year. Secretary of State Rubio has defended revoking student visas for those who \"cause chaos\" on college campuses.\nUS-South Africa relations have deteriorated sharply since Trump returned to power in mid-January. \nSince taking office, Trump and his ally, South-Africa born Elon Musk, have singled out South Africa for special criticism, in particular over its land reform policies.\nTrump has cut all aid to the country, and despite his hard-line stance on most refugees and asylum seekers he says that members of South Africa's white, Afrikaner community would be granted refugee status in the US, because of the persecution he said they faced at home. \nSouth Africa's government says it is trying to correct the country's racial and economic imbalances following decades of white-minority rule, by passing measures to help the country's black majority.\nRasool denied that the Afrikaner population was facing discrimination.\n\"It is an unadulterated lie because it tries to besmirch the very DNA of a new South Africa that was born under the leadership of someone like Nelson Mandela,\" he told the BBC World Service in one of his first interviews since arriving back in South Africa.\nWhen questioned whether his language was undiplomatic, Mr Rasool said: \"It's not as if being a good boy warded off any punishment. It was that at some point South Africa's dignity is also at stake \u2013 you can't smile through too many untruths being told about your country.\"\nAfter returning home to a hero's welcome on Sunday, Rasool said he had no regrets about his remarks. \nAsked by the BBC on Friday whether he was surprised by the reaction to his utterances, Rasool said the surprise for him was the \"thinness of the skin\" of the US administration and its \"ability to dish out and not to accept an intellectual dissecting of what is [said]\".\n\"We've smiled through a lie about white genocide, we've smiled through the punishment of cutting all aid... we've smiled through all of that. \n\"We've tried all the conventional ways to get [to] them until you hit a brick wall and you begin to say: This is not the normal phenomenon of diplomacy.\"\nWhile he accepted that his role as a diplomat was to try and \"maintain a line of communication\" and integrity, Rasool said: \"Diplomacy is not to flatter your host into into liking you. Diplomacy is not lying along and making as if lies are truth. \n\"I think what I did was to the best of my intellectual capacity to describe a phenomenon back home in order for me to alert them that it cannot be business as usual.\"\nRelations between the US and South African, characterised by ups and downs over the years, hit rock bottom earlier this year when Trump cut aid to the country citing the new Expropriation Law, which allows the government to confiscate land without compensation in certain circumstances.\nAnother bone of contention for the US has been the case lodged by South Africa against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in December 2023.\nSouth Africa has accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians living in Gaza, an allegation Israel denies.\nRasool returned to the US last year after having previously served as US ambassador from 2010 to 2015, when Barack Obama was president.\n\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

So we don't know whether the state actors that have lots of resources are just sitting and working now.\"\nThose concerns have led many Democrats to call for greater accountability, with Mark Warner, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, saying that if a military officer or CIA agent had treated classified information in a similar manner they \"would be fired - end of story\".\n\"I believe Secretary Hegseth should resign or be fired,\" he told CBS News on Sunday. \"I think Mike Waltz should resign or be fired. If no action is taken, what message does that send to the workforce?\" \nTrump had told NBC News a day before that he would not fire anyone involved in the group chat, and that he still had confidence in Waltz.\n\"I don't fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,\" he said.\nAlong with Waltz and Hegseth, the chat also included Vice-President JD Vance, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA director John Ratcliffe, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and other senior leaders.

        "article_text": "The climate action group Just Stop Oil has announced it is to disband at the end of April. Its activists have been derided as attention-seeking zealots and vandals and it is loathed by many for its disruptive direct action tactics. It says it has won because its demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy.  So, did they really win and does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?\nHayley Walsh's heart was racing as she sat in the audience at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 27 January this year. \nThe 42 year-old lecturer and mother of three tried to calm her breathing. Hollywood star Sigourney Weaver was onstage in her West End debut production of Shakespeare's The Tempest. \nBut Hayley, a Just Stop Oil activist, had her own drama planned.\nAs Weaver's Prospero declaimed \"Come forth, I say,\" Hayley sprang from her seat and rushed the stage with Richard Weir, a 60-year-old mechanical engineer from Tyneside. \nThey launched a confetti cannon and unfurled a banner that read \"Over 1.5 Degrees is a Global Shipwreck\" - a reference to the news that 2024 was the first year to pass the symbolic 1.5C threshold in global average temperature rise, and a nod to the shipwreck theme in the play. \nIt was a classic Just Stop Oil (JSO) action. The target was high profile and would guarantee publicity. The message was simple and presented in the group's signature fluorescent orange.\nThe reaction of those affected was also a classic response to JSO.  Amid the boos and whistles you can hear a shout of \"idiots\".  \n\"Drag them off the stage\", one audience member can be heard shouting, \"I hope you [expletive] get arrested,\" another says.\nJSO is a UK-based environmental activist group that aims to end fossil fuel extraction and uses direct action to draw attention to its cause. It has been called a \"criminal cult\" and its activists branded \"eco-loons\" by the Sun. The Daily Mail has described it as \"deranged\" and says its members have \"unleashed misery on thousands of ordinary people though their selfish antics\".\nThe group has thrown soup at a Van Gogh in the National Gallery, exploded a chalk dust bomb during the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, smashed a cabinet containing a copy of the Magna Carta at the British Library, sprayed temporary paint on the stones of Stonehenge and even defaced Charles Darwin's grave.\nBut it is the group's road protests that have probably caused the most disruption \u2013 and public anger. In November 2022, 45 JSO members climbed gantries around the M25 severely disrupting traffic for over four days. People missed flights, medical appointments and exams as thousands of drivers were delayed for hours. The cost to the Metropolitan Police was put at \u00a31.1 million.\nJust Stop Oil was born out of Extinction Rebellion (XR).  XR \u2013 founded in 2018 - brought thousands of people onto the streets in what were dubbed \"festivals of resistance\".  They came to a peak in April 2019, when protestors brought parts of the capital to a halt for more than a week and plonked a large pink boat in the middle of Oxford Circus.\nThe spectacle and disruption XR caused generated massive media attention, but the police were furious.  Hundreds of officers were diverted from frontline duties and by the end of 2019 the bill for policing the protests had reached \u00a337m.\nAnd behind the scenes XR was riven by furious debates about tactics.  Many inside the movement said it should be less confrontational and disruptive but a hard core of activists argued it would be more effective to double down on direct action.\nIt became clear that there was room for what Sarah Lunnon, one of the co-founders of Just Stop Oil, calls \"a more radical flank\".  They decided a new, more focused operation was needed, modelled on earlier civil disobedience movements like the Suffragettes, Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns and the civil rights movement in the US.\nThe group was formally launched on Valentine's Day, 2022. It was a very different animal to XR. Instead of thousands of people taking part in street carnivals, JSO's actions involved a few committed activists. A small strategy group oversaw the campaign and meticulously planned its activities. A mobilisation team worked to recruit new members, and another team focused on supporting activists after they were arrested.\nThe dozens of actions the group has carried out generated lots of publicity, but also massive public opposition. There were confrontations between members of the public and protestors and an outcry from politicians across all the main political parties.\nThe police said they needed more powers to deal with this new form of protest and they got them. New offences were created including interfering with national infrastructure, \"locking on\" \u2013 chaining or gluing yourself to something \u2013 and tunnelling underground. Causing a public nuisance also became a potential crime \u2013 providing the police with a powerful new tool to use against protestors who block roads.\nIn the four years since it was formed dozens of the group's supporters have been jailed. Five activists were handed multi-year sentences for their role in the M25 actions in 2022. Those were reduced on appeal earlier this month but are still the longest jail terms for non-violent civil disobedience ever issued.\nSenior JSO members deny the crackdown had anything to do with the group's decision to \"hang up the hi-vis\" \u2013 as its statement this week announcing the end of campaign put it.\nJSO's public position is that it has won its battle. \"Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history,\" the group claimed.\nThe government has said it does not plan to issue any new licences for oil and gas production but strongly denies its policies have a link to JSO. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson told journalists: \"We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.\"\nAnd the group's wider goal \u2013 to end the production of oil and gas \u2013 has manifestly not been achieved. The members of the group I spoke to for this article all agree the climate crisis has deepened.\nIn the face of stiffer sentences, some climate campaigners have said they will turn to more clandestine activities. One new group says it plans a campaign of sabotage against key infrastructure. In a manifesto published online it says it plans to \"kickstart a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors of the fossil fuel economy.\"\nThat's not a direction the JSO members I spoke to said they wanted to go. Sarah Lunnon said a key principle of JSO and the civil disobedience movement generally was that activists would take responsibility for their actions. One of the first questions new joiners were asked is whether they would be willing to be locked up.\n\"As corporations and billionaires corrupt political systems across the world, we need a different approach. \n\"We are creating a new strategy, to face this reality and to carry our responsibilities at this time,\" the group says, suggesting they may be planning to form a new movement.\nJSO's most high-profile figure, Roger Hallam, is one of the five activists convicted for their role in the M25 protests. In a message from his prison cell he acknowledged that JSO has only had a \"marginal impact\".  \nThat is \"not due to lack of trying,\" he said. The failure lay with the UK's \"elites and our leaders\" who had walked away from their responsibility to tackle the climate crisis, Hallam claimed. A hint perhaps that the group's new focus might be on the political system itself.\nJSO has said its last protest \u2013 to be held at the end of April \u2013 will mark \"the end of soup on Van Goghs, cornstarch on Stonehenge and slow marching in the streets\". But don't believe it. When pressed, the JSO members I spoke to said they may well turn back to disruptive tactics but under a new name and with a new and as yet unspecified objective.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

Charges on businesses importing vehicles are expected on 3 April, and taxes on parts are set to start in May or later.\nWhen asked about what his message was to car bosses, he said: \"The message is congratulations. If you make your car in the United States, you're going to make a lot of money.\"\nHe continued: \"If you don't, you're going to have to probably come to the United States, because if you make your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"\nRecent polling by BBC's US partner CBS News suggests that consumers are worried the tariffs will raise prices, with 72% indicating that they believe costs will increase in the short-term. More than half of respondents said the Trump administration is not focusing enough on lowering costs for Americans.\nAsked about this sentiment on Sunday, Trump's senior counsellor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro asked people to put their trust in the US president.\n\"Trust in Trump,\" Navarro told Fox News, adding that previous tariffs on China by the US have led to \"prosperity and price stability\". \n\"The reason why we will not see inflation is because foreigners are going to eat most of it, they have to,\" he said, adding that the US \"is the biggest market in the world.\" \nShawn Fain, the leader of union United Auto Workers, criticised Trump for his labour and immigration policies on CBS Face the Nation - but he said tariffs were a necessary \"tool in the toolbox\" to return manufacturing to the US.\n\"There is plenty of opportunity. And I've had companies tell us, point blank, that they're going to have to bring product back here if those tariffs are implemented.\"\nThe 25% import tax on carmakers from Canada and Mexico was briefly implemented but then paused at the beginning of March, following pleas from major North American manufacturers like Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.\nBut Trump told NBC that he did not plan to delay the tariffs on cars any longer, saying he would consider negotiating \"only if people are willing to give us something of great value - because countries have things of great value, otherwise, there's no room for negotiation\".\nIn another interview with NBC News on Sunday, he threatened to impose secondary tariffs of 25-50% on Russian oil if he feels Vladimir Putin is stalling progress on Ukraine peace talks.\n\"If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia's fault - which it might not be - but if I think it was Russia's fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,\" he told the outlet.\n\"There will be a 25% tariff on oil and other products sold in the United States, secondary tariffs,\" Trump said, adding that tariffs on Russia would come within a month without a ceasefire deal.\nTrump said Putin knows he is angry, but that he has \"a very good relationship\" with the Russian president.\nHe went on to say that \"the anger dissipates quickly\" but only if Putin \"he does the right thing\".\nTrump said he will speak to Putin again this week.\nAnalysts say the upcoming tariffs that Trump has planned could further strain relations with some of the US's main trading partners.\nTrump's comments come as Downing Street sources said the UK would not hesitate to retaliate against US tariffs if needed.\nThe UK is in last-minute negotiations with the White House and is trying to get an exemption, arguing that - unlike other countries - the UK has a relatively equal trading relationship with the US. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said he does not want to jump into a trade war.\nSeveral major economies have also vowed to retaliate in response to Trump's tariffs.\nGermany has said it \"will not give in\" and that Europe must \"respond firmly\", while France's president branded the move \"a waste of time\" and \"incoherent\". \nCanada has called it a \"direct attack\", and China accused Washington of violating international trade rules.",

He'd even perform in disguise.\nThat changed when he had a breakout hit with End of Beginning \u2013 a synth-heavy slice of psychedelia that went viral on TikTok last year, often the soundtrack to videos about what people would do if they won the lottery.\nThe attention put a rocket under his music career. While his first two albums were DIY affairs, recorded in a couple of days and self-released, his latest, The Crux, was created in New York's fabled Electric Lady studios.\nReleased on Friday, it's packed full of off-kilter lyrics and squiggly synth lines that burrow into your brain. The first two singles, Delete Ya and Basic Being Basic have already been radio hits, and the rest of the album pulls on influences as diverse as Electric Light Orchestra, New Order, Cake, Hall & Oates and Bruce Springsteen (coincidentally, all bands that would work perfectly on the Stranger Things soundtrack).\nThere are a couple of knockouts \u2013 including the crunchy garage rock of Gap Toothed Smile, and the choppy New Wave anthem Link \u2013 but the point of the album is its diversity. Keery envisioned each song as the story of a separate guest at a hotel where everyone is at a spiritual or emotional crossroads.\nSIX the Musical tells the story of the many wives of Henry VIII, as they step out of the shadow of their infamous husband and reclaim the narrative.\nNow, the queens are moving to the screen.\nA filmed stage production of SIX The Musical Live!, featuring the original West End cast, will be released in cinemas on Sunday.\nCreators Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss told me what to expect.\n\u201cIt's not simply a live capture of what's on stage, but an immersive, pop-concert experience,\u201d they said.\n\u201cYou get to witness the incredible performances up close \u2013 noticing little details and subtleties you might miss in the theatre. But you also get exciting, inventive, explosive visuals that make you feel like part of the party.\u201d\nBy Tom Gerken, tech reporter\nThis week has been in the diaries of gaming fans around the world for months, as we finally are about to learn what's coming with the Switch 2, the much-anticipated sequel to the Nintendo Switch, aka the third-best selling console in history.\nSo it's no surprise that we're going to get some news on Wednesday \u2013 but the question is, what?\nAlmost certainly Nintendo will unveil a price and a launch date. But quite what that will be, who knows \u2013 July 2025 feels like a safe bet, but to be fair, would anyone be surprised if it came out in December?\nFans are desperate for news on games. The rumour mill swirls with talks of a new Mario, Zelda and Pok\u00e9mon, but nobody has any proof to back it up. (I'd personally bite your hand off for a new Fire Emblem, but that's just me\u2026)\nWill we see super flashy new graphics? A high quality screen? A better battery life? There are too many questions to list.\nOnly one thing is really certain \u2013 whatever happens, when Nintendo's announcement is over, we'll be left counting down the days to the console's actual release\u2026 whenever that may be.",

Luckily, that didn't come to be,\" he said.\nThree series later and having been Doctor Who's showrunner between 2017 and 2022, Chibnall has used an imagined Dorset as the backdrop for his debut novel, Death at the White Hart.\n\"A landlord is discovered murdered, tied to a chair in the middle of the A35 at 02:00 and he's got deer antlers strapped to his head. The question is who did it and why?\" Chibnall said.\nHe told BBC Radio Solent at West Bay that he still takes inspiration from his adopted county.\n\"The first few years I was living down here, doing that drive between Dorchester and Bridport or Dorchester and Lyme Regis, at that stretch of the A35, if you're doing it at 23:00 or midnight, it's so dark, it's so deserted,\" he said.\n\"It always took me back to Thomas Hardy novels when you think of the coach and horses that would drive along there and the mist and the fog that is along there.\n\"It's incredibly atmospheric, it's incredibly beautiful and terrifying at the same time. That's the sort of atmosphere that I wanted to harness for the novel.\"\nChibnall returned to Bridport Arts Centre on Monday to launch the novel, which ITV has already commissioned for a TV adaptation.\nThe BAFTA-award winning writer said it had always been \"an amazingly supportive community\".\nHe added: \"When Broadchurch was on, people would ask me whoever did it or could they be in it? Could I write a character like them? And I would have to say: 'you know that would be a murder suspect, don't you?'\"\nBut he said writing a book meant he could \"go into the characters' heads a lot more\" than he has been able to in his TV work.\n\"It's so different. Having done TV, you're part of a big operation, a big team,\" Chibnall added.\n\"So if I want to set something in a pub, a location manager has to find that pub and a designer has to dress that pub and I need a cinematographer and a director.\n\"Whereas with the novel, I describe the pub \u2013 we're there as you read it.

They were between the ages of 18 and 30 when they say the abuse occurred.\nThe Fladgate law firm, which represents the estate, has been contacted for comment.\nLeigh Day, the law firm representing the alleged victims, say the women were subjected to \"serious sexual abuse, harassment and mistreatment\". \nSome allege they were threatened when they tried to raise concerns or report the abuse.\nPrevious claims have been brought against Harrods, the department store owned by Al Fayed until 2010. \nRichard Meeran, one of the partners working on the women's case, told the BBC: \"It is important that his estate is also made legally accountable for the widespread abuse he perpetrated against those who may never have had dealings with the famous store.\"\nThe women are pursuing compensation under a personal injury claim. The letters of claim, which have been sent to the representatives of Al Fayed's estate on the women's behalf, signify the first formal step in the civil legal process prior to the start of court proceedings.\nSince the documentary Al Fayed: Predator at Harrods and podcast uncovered widespread allegations of abuse from former Harrods employees, the BBC has heard from close to 80 women who shared their own experiences.\nThe earliest account of abuse heard by the BBC stretched as far back as 1977 and a number of women described being recruited by Al Fayed under false pretences before being sexually exploited by him.\nThe Metropolitan Police have said more than 100 alleged victims have contacted them to say they were sexually abused by Al Fayed. \nThey are currently reviewing a total of 21 allegations made before he died in 2023.\nA number of allegations were made against the businessman while he was still alive, but Al Fayed was never charged over rape and sexual assault allegations. \nIn November, the Met announced an investigation into how it handled allegations relating to Al Fayed.\nMany of the women who have spoken to the BBC about their experiences have raised significant questions regarding how the predatory abuse they say they suffered was able to continue across numerous decades.\nThe five women, being represented by Leigh Day, are also calling for an independent inquiry into the matter.\nA spokesperson for Leigh Day added: \"The letters are sent under the pre-action protocol for personal injury claims and mark the first formal step in the legal process prior to the commencement of court proceedings.\"\nIn January, claims of abuse against Al Fayed and his brother Salah were heard in a UK court for the first time, in a civil case being brought against Harrods.\nTheir only surviving brother, Ali Fayed, has also been accused of sexual assault by former employees of the department store. A spokesperson for Mr Fayed, who lives in the US, said previously that he unequivocally denied any and all the allegations of wrongdoing, adding that \"the incidents simply never took place\".\nHarrods' new owners have previously said they are \"appalled\" by the allegations of sexual abuse and have been investigating since 2023 whether any current members of staff were involved.\nIn November, the Met said it was investigating at least five people it believes may have assisted or enabled Al Fayed's alleged sexual offences.\nIf you have information about this story that you would like to share please get in touch. \nEmail MAFinvestigation@bbc.co.uk.

Its powerful effects could be felt hundreds of miles away in the Thai capital, as well as in China and India.\nThere have been reports of widespread devastation in the Saigaing region and Mandalay, including flattened buildings and temple spires toppled. Officials in Myanmar say over 1,000 have died so far while another 2,376 are injured.\nIn Bangkok, thousands experienced the quake's effects as buildings swayed and water sloshed out of swimming pools. Officials said they received 2,000 reports of cracks appearing in buildings.\nBut the capital has emerged largely unscathed \u2013 except for the unfinished headquarters for the auditor-general's office, which remains the focal point of the damage in Thailand.\nSituated just across from the tourist landmark Chatuchak market, the 30-storey skyscraper once featured a gleaming tower of blue glass and steel.\nThe earthquake has reduced it to a mountain of twisted rebar and shattered concrete, dwarfing the hundreds of rescue workers scurrying around it.\nOut of the more than 400 workers who were at the site, at least 96 are missing, while eight have died and another eight found injured, according to the latest official figures. \nSome are believed to be Burmese. Many Burmese migrants work in Thailand's construction industry.\nThroughout Friday night and into Saturday morning, drones, sniffer dogs, cranes and excavators were brought in to help with the rescue effort.\nBy lunchtime, officials said they had detected at least 15 people alive beneath the rubble, located some 5m to 10m from the top of the pile.\nBurmese construction worker Ko Myint Kyaw was on the scaffolding on the third floor of the building at the time the earthquake struck.\n\"When [the earthquake] got stronger, I just jumped and I escaped. When I hit the ground, I heard a loud bang and the building collapsed,\" he told BBC Burmese.\nThe worker said he was part of a group of Burmese people working on the construction project, and the authorities had already discovered the bodies of two people with whom he had worked with.\nAs the \"building collapsed like a pancake\" \u2013 and is continuing to collapse \u2013 rescue work has been difficult, forcing officials to refrain from using heavy machinery, one official said.\nThey said they were able to make contact with some of the survivors who \"shouted and made noise\". Others were detected by their movements and body heat.\n\"We want to save them as soon as possible,\" said one official. \"Some signs of life we received last night have since gone silent. I want all Thais to pray for them, to be strong.\"\nOfficials have yet to find out why the building collapsed, and have given investigators a week to probe.\nIn a dusty corner of the construction site, tents and desks were set up to register the details of relatives of the missing.\nSolemn-faced groups of people, mostly women, gathered in the tent in the sweltering heat, their faces clouded with worry. Occasionally, some burst out in sobs.\n\"I wanted to come here desperately, I wanted to see my husband,\" wailed one woman, who gave her name as Naruemol, as her friend comforted her.\n\"I just need to see him once, in whatever condition he's in.\"\nOne man named Siew, who was waiting to hear news of two missing cousins, told the BBC: \"I think the chance of them surviving is very slim\u2026 In my heart, I don't know if they will survive.\"\nTop government officials have vowed to continue the search for the missing workers.\nDeputy Prime Minister Anutin Charnweerakul addressed reporters while visiting the site, saying: \"We work tirelessly and are still working around the clock to make sure that everbody is safe.\"\n\"We will keep working until there is no one left inside\u2026 We always have hope.\"\nAdditional reporting by Sawitree Jang, Arunoday Mukharji and Nick Marsh",

        "article_text": "In Jordan, a 50km pilgrimage trail follows the path of a 4th-Century nun who journeyed through the Holy Land \u2013 centuries before Spain's famed Camino de Santiago.\nThe hike begins early in the morning at Mount Nebo, a sacred mountain 610m above sea level in Jordan. On a clear day, panoramic views of the Dead Sea, Bethlehem and Jerusalem stretch across the horizon. According to the Bible, it is the last place Moses gazed upon before his death. Today, it's the first sight walkers see as they set out on their journey along the Camino de Egeria, a pilgrim route first taken by a 4th-Century nun.\u00a0\nThe view is \"magical\", says Silvano Mezzenzana, who recently undertook the three-day hike. He recalls standing atop that peak on the Moab plateau, a dry Sun fanning out over the ridges and farmland beneath, noting that it is fascinating both in the morning when the Sun lights up the Palestinian bank and the city of Jericho, and in the afternoon when the sunset draws the silhouettes of the hills of Judah up to Jerusalem. Up there, \"you do not realise that you are on a mountain\", he adds.\u00a0\nBeginning on the eastern edge of the Great Rift Valley, the 50km route winds through farmland and rugged hills \u2013 a voyage that is far greener than its European equivalent, the 800km Camino de Santiago pilgrim trail undertaken by around 500,000 people each year. Following the January announcement from Jordan and Spain of a merger twinning the Camino de Egeria with the Camino de Santiago to boost their respective cultural heritage, locals hope that the newly-renovated Middle Eastern trail can become a similar phenomenon. The goal is to highlight the significance of the eponymous Egeria, the Spanish nun believed to have travelled by donkey from Jordan through Palestine, Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia and Asia Minor to visit the holy places recounted in the Bible. She is thought to be the first woman to make the journey, which pre-dates the famed Camino de Santiago by five centuries.\u00a0\nThe hike is typically split up into three days (though can be done as quickly as in two, or a leisurely five). The terrain is not particularly challenging, but the distance \u2013 of around 17km per day \u2013 makes the hike unsuitable for total novices.\u00a0Last year, wide paths were fixed between the rocky valleys and hills along much of the route, ushering in what the Ministry of Tourism hopes will mark a new era for international interest in the country.\u00a0\nThe effort is already seeing results. \"Although I have lived in Jordan all my life, walking this trail has shown me parts of the country I've never experienced before,\" says Nadeen Dabbas. She recalls the flow of the water at the Moses Springs and the Jordan Valley, where she was surrounded by fields of bananas and corn, as moments that \"made me feel alive\".\nThe Best of 2025\nJordan was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good.\u00a0See the full list here.\nThe first major landmark on day one features a small monastery built by Egyptian monks in Moses' memory, built in the latter half of the 4th Century, enlarged a century later and rebuilt in the 6th Century to a mosaic-filled basilica that still stands today. The trail then passes through the ancient city of Livias, before reaching its showpiece on day two: Al-Maghatas, or Bethany beyond the Jordan. A Unesco World Heritage site, this is believed to be the location where Jesus was baptised by John the Baptist. Pilgrims can explore Byzantine and Roman remains of chapels, churches and monasteries, along with the cave of John the Baptist, and even \"spend the second night there in one of the pilgrim houses of Bethany, just next to the Jordan River\", explains Oscar Koshebye, a guide who helped formalise the current tourist trail. The route finishes here, or at the King Hussein Bridge at the Jordan-Israel border.\nWhile the hike offers striking natural beauty, the real draw may prove to be the woman who likely inspired it. \"Egeria's account is significant because it is one of the oldest written accounts of pilgrimage to the Holy Land that has survived \u2013 and the first incontrovertibly penned by a woman,\" says Anne McGowan, associate professor of liturgy at the Catholic Theological Union and co-author of Pilgrimage of Egeria. Egeria's work was little-known until the 1880s, McGowan adds, originally written in the form of letters to her \"sisters\" (likely holy women similar to herself). An incomplete manuscript dating to the 11th Century is currently the oldest known record of her route.\nEgeria travelled during the 4th Century, when many Christians took long-distance pilgrimages \u2013 something that fell out of favour from the 7th Century until around the mid-19th (aside from a \"blip\" in the wake of the Crusades, in the 12th-13th Centuries), McGowan explains. At that point, \"travel to the Holy Land became easier once again. Going on pilgrimage aligned well with the Romantic Era's renewed enthusiasm for the personal and the subjective on the one hand and an idealised past on the other; and Protestants as a group became more intrigued by pilgrimage possibilities connected to places associated with the life and death of Jesus in a way they hadn't been previously.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nBut now, with religious appetite dwindling (a study published\u00a0last year\u00a0found that atheists now outnumber theists in the UK), Koshebye is hoping that a new generation can be drawn in. \"We can consider it now, after centuries of abandonment, a route for tolerance between faiths, a way to improve intercultural exchange,\" he says.\u00a0\nPlan your trip\nThe Egeria Way branch office is at the Kawon bookshop in Madaba. From here, registered visitors will be taken to trail's start point, 15km away in Mount Nebo. Packages from different tour operators will soon be offered by the Egeria Way Association. Travel within Jordan is safe, though the UK Foreign Office advises against travel within 3km of the border with Syria.\nThe Spanish national and keen hiker began mulling a walking route to Jerusalem five years ago. Having already walked the Spanish Camino, he mentioned his plans to his father, who likened his son's idea to the devout Egeria \u2013 who he had never heard of. Koshebye began reading about the nun and scouring old maps in search of her original route. He later made a YouTube video about his plans, was contacted by the Jordanian tourist board, and then got in touch with the Spanish embassy in Jordan \u2013 a series of collaborative efforts that led to the merger being born.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The Wadi Rum Trail: Jordan's new long-distance hike\n\u2022 A new love for medieval-style travel\n\u2022 The pilgrimage sites of Iraq's timeless and holy cities\nKoshebye hopes that the partnership leads to a surge of interest in this three-day version of the hike and wants it to be extended a further 30km to Jerusalem, another stop on Egeria's route. Plans for signage along the Jordanian route and more guesthouses where walkers can rest in between are already afoot.\nWhile steeped in religious significance, ancient routes of this kind aren't just for those intent on retracing paths drawn by scripture, McGowan says. \"Taking a very long walk still has the capacity to pull one into an inner journey. Younger people are still spiritual seekers, even if their search is typically less closely tied to traditional religious beliefs and practices,\" she believes. \"Their pilgrimages might be more oriented toward the experience of journeying itself, as it seems Egeria's was as well; she does not so much set out on a round trip to visit one particular place, for example, as to experience as many places as possible.\"\nWith time \u2013 and a few more signposts \u2013 those involved in the project hope that Jordan's historic trail can achieve the same cultural significance as its Spanish counterpart. Mezzenzano, for one, has no doubt. \"I would not only recommend\" the trail, he enthuses, \"but I plan to repeat it\". \n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Charlie Atkinson broke easily through a tackle and with Harris inside he scored next to the posts.\nNothing was going Bristol's way as Byrne's kick to restart into the swirling wind went straight out and from a Cherry and Whites scrum on halfway, the ball was passed out wide to Hathaway who raced downfield. \nHis long ball back inside was expertly picked out of the air one-handed by a jumping Tomos Williams, whose no-look pass then found Seb Atkinson to run under the posts for the crucial fourth score to make it 24-0.\nGloucester's win at Kingsholm followed another high-scoring win at Ashton Gate earlier this season\nBristol director of rugby Pat Lam said during the week that he thought the match-up between two of the most potent sides in the league could be \"one of the best\" and at times both defences could barely keep up.\nBristol got themselves on the board as Benhard Janse Van Rensburg bouldered through and Harry Randall picked the ball quickly, to find Fitz Harding to dive under the posts.\nRich Lane then came within a whisker of the line before Williams scored Bristol's second to close the gap to 24-14.\nYet Gloucester were soon back at the other end as Hathaway darted between two tacklers and found Atkinson in space to slide over. \nThe tries continued to trade back and forth as Max Lahiff  powered over for Bristol's third from close range.\nBut Gloucester were not done and with the clock in red on 42 minutes they created space for Wade to dive over for a sixth in the corner.\nGloucester's intensity did not relent as the second half began and Wales scrum-half Williams caught Bristol's line unawares, throwing a long ball from a penalty to Atkinson who bundled over for his hat-trick.\nWade then chased his own kick past two Bristol players to tap down his own third try, and Barton then got in on the act after coming on as a replacement with Gloucester's ninth.\nThe win was out of Bristol's reach but they scored a crucial fourth to ensure they took something from the trip up the M5 through Williams, who muscled over under a tackle.\nGloucester director of rugby George Skivington told BBC Sport: \n\"I do think we were brilliant in defence, I know we conceded four tries but our defence was brilliant. Set-piece was very clinical. \n\"Attack-wise, we've scored a lot of tries this year but there has been times we've scored four and then the game has sort of gone along, we've not deliberately been conservative but I think scoring those three tries straight after the break was as good as we have been.\n\"I think Lightsy [James Lightfoot-Brown, attack coach] is really paying off there and the boys are really enjoying it. It is hard work, Lightsy's very on his detail - it's not lucky. It's just rewards to James and to all the boys.\"\nBristol director of rugby Pat Lam told BBC Sport:\n\"Well done to Gloucester, they were superb tonight, definitely their night and great to see so many young Gloucester kids and supporters enjoyed the game. \n\"I think we worked our way back 29-21 just before half-time and then we conceded again.\n\"At half-time we talked about how we have got to start fast and we turned the ball over from the kick-off and got a chance to get into it, and if we scored there we're back in the game but we turned the ball over and Gloucester scored.\n\"Not a great night defensively but we'll take the one point, the season ebbs and flows. The journey towards the end of May, June is not always easy one but you learn along the way. Our main thing is we got one point out, we'll dust ourselves off, we've got five more [games] to get into those play-offs.\"\nGloucester: Carreras; Wade, Harris, S. Atkinson, Hathaway; C.

I am excited to see that.\"\nThis video can not be played\nFA Cup highlights: Fulham 0-3 Crystal Palace\nOf course, there could well be a familiar winner of the FA Cup this season, with seven-time champions Manchester City still very much in contention - three of those coming since 2011.\nBut should they be upset by Bournemouth on Sunday then the final four would be absent of City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United - the sides who have hogged the FA Cup trophy in recent decades.\nThe table above shows how such sides have dominated in the modern era, with only Aston Villa of the remaining clubs in the competition able to compete in terms of wins, although all seven of theirs came before 1958.\nIt isn't actually that long ago since a side who hasn't lifted the FA Cup before - or won it for the first time in a long time - last clinched it.\nThat happened just four years ago, when Leicester City triumphed over Chelsea.\nHowever, that Foxes win is just the third time since Everton won the FA Cup 30 years ago that a side other than Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United won it.\nThe others were surprise triumphs for Wigan in 2013 and Portsmouth five years earlier.\nThat 2008 showpiece was also the last time a final did not include one of the aforementioned five Premier League sides, with Harry Redknapp's Portsmouth beating Cardiff.\n\"I think it could happen this season,\" former Everton midfielder Fara Williams said on Football Focus.\n\"If you look how the Premier League has unfolded this season, there have been some real surprise packages.\n\"This may be the year we have two teams in the final we haven't seen in recent seasons.\"\nPreston North End are looking to achieve something no team has managed in 45 years - win the FA Cup as a team playing outside the top flight.\nThey have won twice before - in 1889 and 1938 - and were beaten finalists in 1964.\nThe last team to win the competition who did so when not playing in the top tier of English football was West Ham in 1980.\nIt will be a tough task for Preston, particularly as Aston Villa are the first Premier League team they've come up against in the FA Cup this season, but the way the draw is shaping up their fans will be believing that something special could happen.\n\"It will be a huge ask,\" former Liverpool and Aston Villa full-back Stephen Warnock said on Football Focus.\n\"The only thing is if you can be very difficult to play against, very organised and maybe score a wonder goal or a set piece.

        "article_text": "For two years, Jeannie Dillard has saved what she can on her fixed income to replace the vehicle that was stolen from her home and found totalled a few miles away. \nShe looked around a used car dealership in Virginia on Thursday, peering at sticker prices with a newfound worry: blanket tariffs on foreign cars and car parts that experts warn could drive up prices in the US, which kick in next week.\nShe'd like to buy a car now, she said, but \"I have to wait until my finances improve\".\nMs Dillard is among the plethora of Americans bracing for expected economic turbulence under President Donald Trump's sweeping auto tariffs - an unprecedented US trade policy manoeuvre. \n\"It took me a long time to save up for the last car,\" she said. \"If prices get too high, I'm obviously not going to buy something that I can't afford.\" \nShe added: \"We'll just have to wait and see.\"\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced new import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts entering the US from overseas, which go into effect on 2 April.\nCharges on businesses importing vehicles are expected on 3 April, and taxes on parts are set to start in May or later.\nTrump and members of his administration have argued that the tariffs will lead to \"tremendous growth\" and increase jobs in the US.\nBut experts and automakers have warned in dire terms that tariffs could raise prices for US consumers, amplifying the stress of an already sluggish economy.\nMohamad Husseini, co-owner of a used car dealership in Maryland, said that he expects the additional tariff costs to get passed on to the consumer. \n\"The prices in the wholesale market have skyrocketed already,\" he told the BBC. \n\"It's going to get worse.\" \nA car that would sell for $13,000 (\u00a310,000) might rise to $14,500 (\u00a311,200) because of the tariffs, Mr Husseini said. He predicted that consumers will see prices increase in the next three to six weeks.\nThe auto tariffs will likely force car dealers like Mr Husseini to raise prices.\n\"We all still have bills to pay, mouths to feed and employees to pay,\" he said.\nAt another car dealership, Robin Sloan was hoping to get a deal before prices increased.\nShe said she probably would have waited until the summer to go car shopping, but \"with the tariffs, I decided I should go out and look now\". \nShe rejected the Trump administration's claim that tariffs will cause Americans to buy US cars instead of foreign ones. \n\"I don't think I would buy a car made in the United States just because of the tariffs, I think I would probably wait a few years until things settle down,\" Ms Sloan said.\nFrom buyers to dealers, the effects of the tariffs will be widespread, for better or for worse, experts say. \nIn the US, there are 908 motor vehicles per 1,000 people. About 92% of households own a vehicle.\nCar ownership is typically higher in the US than in Europe, surveys suggest, partly because, in the absence of extensive public transport, many Americans have no other choice of how to get around.\nCars are also more than just a means of transportation. As symbols of both freedom and success, cars have a unique place in the national identity, from the show Pimp My Ride to Janice Joplin singing \"Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz\".\nJohn Heitmann, a University of Dayton professor and automobile historian, who in his free time likes to polish his 1982 Mercedes SL, said that tariffs will have an existential, as well as an economic, impact.\n\"New cars are really out of the reach of a good number of Americans to begin with,\" he told the BBC. \n\"Consumers will not benefit, prices will go up,\" particularly amongst more affordable vehicles made in Korea, like Hyundais, he said.\nAs a vintage-car enthusiast, he said tariffs have added a layer of uncertainty to his hobby.\n\"About 50 minutes ago, I got an email from a part supplier in the UK saying, 'Don't worry... they're not going to go up, probably',\" he said.\n\"'We haven't seen anything in writing yet.' That's what they said.\"\nHigher-end imported vehicles, such as Audis, BMWs and Mercedes, will increase in price, too, Prof Heitmann said, though many of those who buy from such brands might be able to absorb a heftier price tag.\nA 2024 study by the US International Trade Commission predicted that a 25% tariff on imports would reduce imports by almost 75%, while increasing average prices in the US by about 5%.\nThe US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade and roughly half of overall sales. \nDespite efforts from some car makers - including Ford and General Motors - to discourage Trump enacting auto tariffs, the president is forging ahead. \nSome car makers are embracing Trump's tariffs, however.\nOn Tuesday, Hyundai, the South Korean car-marker, announced it would invest $21bn (\u00a316.3bn) in the US by building a new steel plant in Louisiana. \nTrump said the move is a \"clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work\".\nBut the tariffs are likely to impact the domestic car industry as well. \nUS auto manufacturing has been deeply intertwined with industries in Canada and Mexico for decades. Parts criss-cross the borders several times before they are assembled, which means that even a vehicle as iconically American as a Ford pickup truck could see a sticker price increase. \nUltimately, Trump's tariff strategy will thrust the US auto industry into uncharted territory, leaving uncertainty hanging over consumers, dealers and automakers until they go into effect on Wednesday.\n\"Everything's topsy turvy now, you know, and it's also terribly filled with uncertainty, because no one exactly knows what kind of game is really being played by the Trump administration related to all the bluster of these tariffs,\" Prof Heitmann said.\nSome, like Mya Fountain-Bunch, just want to get through the unease. She took her car into a dealership this week to avoid needing a replacement after the tariffs hit. \n\"[I'm] making sure that my car is working and hopefully I won't have to buy another car in the next few years, or at least the next four years until this administration is done with.\" \nAdditional reporting by Meiying Wu",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nPundits on Rashford's MOTM performance against Preston\nMarcus Rashford has got his swagger back.\nThe Aston Villa loanee ended his 120-day goal drought with a second-half double at Preston on Sunday to help Unai Emery's side set up an FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace - and provide another clear sign he is enjoying his football again.\nFrozen out of the first-team picture at Manchester United by head coach Ruben Amorim just weeks after he replaced Erik ten Hag at the helm, even those closest to Rashford accepted he had a major point to prove when he completed his loan move to Aston Villa on 3 February.\nThose working with him can see the improvement in Rashford, maybe not quite to the levels of old but certainly a far cry from the passive figure he appeared at Old Trafford for most of the previous 18 months.\nEngland boss Thomas Tuchel must have felt so too, judging by the speed with which he restored Rashford to the international fold earlier this month.\nYet there were plenty of doubters. They were out in force on social media during the first half of Villa's 3-0 FA Cup quarter-final victory at Preston, as Rashford wasted a couple of free-kicks as the visitors struggled to turn their dominance into goals.\nThe only measure, though, of a striker's success is the regularity they hit the back of the net - and he hadn't done it for 14 games and counting since his double for United against Everton on 1 December.\nBut when Lucas Digne presented the opportunity 13 minutes into the second half at Deepdale, Rashford's innate ability did the rest as he calmly picked his spot before finding the bottom corner. \nFive minutes later, despite a wait for the video assistant referee (VAR) to confirm Villa should be awarded a penalty, and goalkeeper David Cornell offering some 'advice' as he walked past to take up his position, Rashford's nerve held. He took his time, did an extended stuttering run-up, and found the net.\n\"The swagger is back,\" gushed Guy Mowbray in his Match of the Day commentary. \"The confidence and the pose.\"\n\"It's a great feeling,\" Rashford told BBC Sport afterwards: \"It's always nice for a forward to get a goal, so hopefully it continues.\n\"I feel like I've been getting fitter and playing better football since I've been here. I missed a lot of football before joining up with them. My body feels good and I'm enjoying my football for now.\"\nFA Cup 'sparkle' returns - but will there be a 'fairytale ending'?\nRashford scores double as Aston Villa beat Preston in FA Cup quarters\nForest draw Bournemouth or Man City, Palace v Villa\nThis video can not be played\nRashford scores first Villa goals within space of five minutes\nThe deal United struck with Villa to let Rashford leave is not straightforward.\nThe precise nature of the loan deal is complicated. United have said 75% of Rashford's wages are being covered, although they have not explained exactly how. \nThat could rise to 90% if certain performance-related bonuses are met.\nThat, presumably, will include an extended run in the Champions League - Villa have been paired with French heavyweights Paris St-Germain in the quarter-finals - as well as the FA Cup.\nUnai Emery's side face Crystal Palace at Wembley next month as the next step in their quest to win the trophy for the first time since 1957. \nIn addition, they are ninth in the Premier League, three points behind fifth-placed Manchester City, who occupy what is virtually certain to be the final Champions League spot.\nThat proliferation of targets underscores why Emery did not really want to talk about the likelihood of Villa triggering their \u00a340m option to turn Rashford's move into a permanent deal.\n\"We can't waste time speaking about that,\" he said\n\"If next year we are in the Champions League, in the Europa, or Conference League or not. Or we don't win a trophy - it is completely different.\"\nMarcus Rashford (left) celebrates his second goal for Aston Villa at Preston\nUnlike Villa, Rashford has won the FA Cup twice in recent memory, including last season. He has also been part of teams who have won the Europa League and EFL Cup. In addition, he has 60 England caps. His past playbook means if he can reach the standards he has previously set, he would be an asset to any side in the world.\nIt is that talent Emery is trying to coax out of the player. It is, in the modern football vocabulary, 'a process'.\nThe Aston Villa boss, said: \"There is still work, still weeks to get it, but today he did one step forward. He is feeling comfortable, getting confident and scoring goals. He was obviously getting better, but today it was more in his adaptation and helping us.\n\"He's playing in the idea, in the plan we did with him. He has played more as a winger on the left side but he's played in some moments as a striker. Today we decided to play him as a striker to his quality, his power and the way he exploits things. \n\"The process we have with him is more or less not changing. There is still work to do because he came here after not training consistently and not feeling in his best fitness. Progressively playing more and with the national team will help him to feel better and today was confirmation of that, which is good.\"\nThe painful divorce of Marcus Rashford and Manchester United\nThe good thing from Rashford's perspective is he is beginning to put together a positive body of work to counter the extended period of drift he experienced at United.\nIt still feels bizarre he has left his boyhood club for a perceived smaller rival, yet finds himself entering the final two months of the campaign with substantially more to play for - both in number and prestige of competitions - than he would have had if he remained at Old Trafford.\nNo professional career is a straight line ascent, which is why insight from those who have been there and done it is so valuable.\n\"You are constantly being asked questions at the top,\" said former England keeper Joe Hart on Match of the Day.\n\"Maybe Rashford found himself in a lull but he has come to Villa with people around him that know what they are doing. He hasn't come here with question marks about how he is going to behave and what he is going to do and how he can change the team.\"\nHart found himself frozen out for a time at Manchester City and Micah Richards did not have the greatest time at Aston Villa.\nBut, like Hart, Rashford can see how a change of scenery has provided the impetus for improvement.\n\"He looks confident and happy,\" said Richards.\n\"It was a big move going to Villa. But when you've got a manager that believes in you, you can do special things.\n\"His whole body language looks a lot better and his all-round game was brilliant. That is the best way to shut people up. People were asking questions about not fulfilling his potential but that is the way to answer.\n\"I really like Rashford in these wide areas because he's always looking to run in behind.\nWhen I talk about body language and his movement - his all round game today was brilliant.\"\nGet Aston Villa news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Moving endangered rhinos to new areas is a vital part of their conservation. War-torn helicopters from the Vietnam war are airlifting the creatures to safety.\nZipping through the skies over South Africa, a 1,300kg (2,865lbs) horned herbivore is dangling by its feet from a helicopter. It may be a shocking sight to behold but, within the last decade, the use of helicopters in rhinoceros conservation\u00a0has been gaining momentum in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana.\u00a0\nBlack rhinos are\u00a0critically endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, thanks to\u00a0conservation efforts, their numbers are on the rise. Today, black rhinos have a population of roughly\u00a06,500 \u2013 up from the 1990s' low point of\u00a0less than 2,500, when poaching and habitat loss\u00a0drove the species to the edge of extinction.\nBlack rhinos are moved around for three reasons, says Ursina Rusch, population manager for the WWF South Africa Black Rhino Range Expansion Project. First, to protect them from poaching. Secondly, for monitoring purposes \u2013 rhino researchers often take the opportunity to insert satellite GPS telemetry into the rhinos' horns. And, thirdly, to ensure their genetic population is as diverse as possible. The species mostly exists within protected pockets on public and private reserves, so translocation is one of the only available methods to increase their range.\n\"If we don't translocate rhinos and create new populations, they will inbreed enough that they crash, or run out of resources and stop breeding,\" says Rusch. Black rhino population growth rates are density dependent. This means if a rhino community is too crowded, the females will start having longer intercalving periods \u2013 the time between the birth of one calf and the next \u2013 and so produce fewer calves, an evolutionary response and adaptation to resource management.\nWhile the transport of animals for population regrowth and genetic diversity isn't new, the regular use of helicopters in this fight is. Beginning in the 1990s but refining methods since the 2010s, helicopters have \"revolutionised the world of rhino conservation\", says Rusch. Her WWF project has translocated around 270 rhinos, of which about 160 have been airlifted.\u00a0\nLeaning from an airborne helicopter, a veterinarian \"darts the rhino in the bum\" with immobilising drugs, typically targeting youngsters or dominant bulls that need to be removed to prevent inbreeding, says Rusch. Rhino immobilisation typically involves a potent opioid and a tranquilliser.\nWhereas before veterinarians would have spent 20 minutes on-foot tracking a half-way-sedated rhino, the helicopter team now saves precious time by aerially tracking the rhino \u2013 and within four minutes, the rhino falls unconscious, says Rusch. By the time the rhino goes down, the ground team and the helicopter team spring into action: quickly approaching the rhino for processing. They take biological samples and measurements and insert microchips for monitoring.\nNext, the crew ties big, soft straps around the rhino's four ankles. The straps connect to a single rope which is hooked to the underside of the helicopter.\nThen the move happens. The helicopter airlifts the rhino, which dangles below, to a central location \u2013 generally an open field \u2013 where ground crews are waiting, says Rusch.\nHistorically, the rhino would have been woken up from the immobilising drug and walked into a crate, before being hoisted onto the back of a truck headed for a conservancy. But these road trips could be stressful for the rhino passengers; they're awake for the journey (albeit, sometimes, anaesthetised) and standing in a crate, which can cause muscle or horn damage \u2013 or even occlude their airways, which can be fatal. Moreover, the limited road network in the region and difficult terrain made it hard to reach the remote final locations using ground transport.\u00a0\nThis is where airlifting comes in. The health risks of crate travel and lack of roads \u2013 for instance, in\u00a0Namibia's Kunene region \u2013 mean that nowadays, helicopters are increasingly used for the translocation of rhinos, explains Robin Radcliffe, associate professor of wildlife and conservation medicine at Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York. Conservationists \"really only consider slinging\" as a solution when the capture or release site is inaccessible by road, he says, or when slinging significantly cuts down on transport time.\nIn Rusch's experience, researchers and conservationists employ two main helicopters to transport black rhinos: the Airbus AS350 Astar and the UH1-H Huey.\nThe Airbus AS350 Astar, nicknamed the \"Squirrel,\" has been used since 2021, says Rusch. This helicopter is small, cost-effective and readily available in South Africa, she adds.\nUH1-H Hueys, on the other hand, are designed for lifting large loads. Famously used during the Vietnam War, some of these \"iconic helicopters\" still exhibit bullet hole patches and floor installations for mounted gun covers, says Rusch. Nowadays, these military-grade helicopters \u2013 complete with windows under the cockpit so the pilot can see the ground below\u00a0 \u2013 are valuable for civilians in firefighting and rhino conservation.\u00a0\n\"The Hueys' blades have a unique flap \u2013 they really slap the air,\" Rusch says. \"That was the sound\u00a0soldiers in the Vietnam war wanted to hear, feeling that relief of someone rescuing them.\" The Huey \u2013 made famous by Hollywood films including Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket \u2013 has become synonymous with the Vietnam War and provided close heliborne support to US soldiers, evacuating the wounded and the dead.\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nThe fateful twist of using a machine of war to save lives is not lost on the conservationists who fly in the helicopters. \"Ironically, in the 80s,\u00a0helicopters were used by some poachers to kill rhinos,\" says Radcliffe. \"The fact that helicopters are now being used to save them is a wonderful example of conservation.\" Translocation is one of the most valuable tools of rhino conservation, he adds.\nWWF's Black Rhino Range Expansion Project has 18 project sites, with over 400 black rhinos spread across the site, making up 15% of all black rhinos in South Africa, says Rusch. \"Really none of this would be possible without helicopters, both in terms of darting and transferring rhinos out of inaccessible areas,\" she says.\u00a0\nRadcliffe's team, which partnered with Namibia's government, pioneered the netless, slinging method of moving rhinos upside down under a helicopter. In 2021, Radcliffe and his colleagues won an\u00a0Ig Nobel Prize \u2013 an award satirising the Nobel Prize given to \"research that makes people laugh and then think\" \u2013 for their work on hanging black rhino upside down.\nAs the opioid used\u00a0reduces the rhinos' blood oxygen levels, it's all the more crucial to determine which flight position is best for breathing. Before settling on the upside-down position, Radcliffe and his fellow researchers tried laying the flying rhinos on boards tethered to the helicopter, which wasn't aerodynamic as the board caused excess swaying in mid-air, says Radcliffe.\nThen, his team tested rhinos in nets, which \"aerodynamically worked a bit better, but still wasn't ideal\". The net's positioning compromised the rhino's breathing. Plus, the net's metal frame added considerable weight and required even more ground personnel to place the rhinos into the net, \"which defeated the purpose of having a quick and efficient transport method\", explained Radcliffe.\nAirborne inversion is the safest option, says Radcliffe. The anatomy of the rhino means it is, remarkably, able to breathe comfortably upside down, Radcliffe says. Hanging by their legs, the weight and build of rhinos allow them to extend their head and neck downwards, straightening the spine. Also, a \"safer, smoother flight\" occurs because the rhino horn acts as a \"tail feather or wind vane,\" reducing the risk of spinning. \"The great thing about lifting the rhinos upside down by their feet is that they're aerodynamic themselves,\" says Radcliffe.\n\nWhile the image of an upside-down rhino may initially seem \"cruel\", the rhino's well-being is always \"paramount\" before, during and after the 10-30 minutes of airborne time, says Rusch. \"The rhino is constantly under supervision of experienced veterinarians and pilots, who can tell if the rhino is comfortable or straining,\" she says.\nNonetheless, conservation is not without some cost. Helicopter-use creates air and noise pollution. \"In a perfect world we'd have a zero-carbon footprint,\" says Radcliffe. \"But we, as humans, are obligated to make a concerted effort to save species like the rhinoceros. They are in serious decline, not because of normal ecological processes, but because of our own actions.\"\nRhinos have existed for\u00a050 million years and fossil evidence indicates that there were once\u00a0upwards of 150 rhino species. Now there are five.\n\"I don't want to tell my grandchildren that we did have rhinos when I was growing up, but they're no longer here because humans poached them and destroyed their habitat,\" says Radcliffe.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The rhino that became a conservation icon\n\u2022\u00a0Elephants hate bees \u2013 here's why that's good news for Kenyan farmers\n\u2022\u00a0How a million kilometres of invisible borders are harming wildlife\nSlowly but surely, helicopters are making a difference. Thirty years ago, the black rhino population in Kunene, in the north-west of Namibia, was depleted, explains Radcliffe. However, in 2010, Namibia's first rhino airlift has allowed these animals to return to the region. Due to the impassable, vast mountain ranges in the region, the airlift allowed the introduction of rhinos into areas that otherwise would have been beyond reach. Scientists, like Radcliffe, are committed to\u00a0continually studying and\u00a0honing these heli-moves, and they plan to incorporate emerging technologies such as drones and satellites into rhino conservation too.\nRadcliffe envisions that in the future, this innovative method of rhino conservation could even be applied to the rainforest environments of Indonesia, where Sumatran rhinos are critically endangered. And beyond rhino, the technique of lifting large ungulates \u2013 or large mammals with hooves \u2013 upside down has also been applied to other species such as elephants and some endangered antelope, Radcliffe adds.\nIn the meantime, according to Rusch, South Africa's\u00a0translocated rhinos seem to be thriving \u2013 grazing and breeding in their new homes.\n\"You get to know the rhinos, their individualities, their personalities,\" says Rusch. \"They get released on the other side, and then you get to watch these populations grow \u2013 from first to second to third-generation offspring.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "We are down to the last eight teams in this season's FA Cup, but which of them will lift the famous old trophy at Wembley in May?\nApart from defending Premier League champions Manchester City, none of the quarter-finalists have won any major silverware since the turn of the millennium, and four of them have never won the FA Cup at all.\n\"We all saw how much winning the Carabao Cup meant to Newcastle fans after their long wait for a trophy,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\"Liverpool and Arsenal are out, and City are clearly not the force they were, so this feels like a big chance for the other teams left in it to get some glory - I just hope they try to take it.\"\nSutton has made his predictions for all four sixth-round ties and for this weekend's matches he is up against Brit-nominated DJ and producer Nathan Dawe, who is an Aston Villa fan.\nDawe's new single featuring vocalist Abi Flynn, Here In Your Arms, is out now.\nDo you agree with their predictions? You can choose who you think will win each tie, below.\nDawe has had three UK top-10 singles and another four have reached the top 40. He made a surprise appearance on last month's Love Island All Stars final, playing Here In Your Arms at a pool party for the remaining couples\nVilla have not won a major trophy since the 1996 League Cup but are chasing silverware on two fronts this season and are into the last eight of the Champions League [where they play Paris St-Germain] as well as the FA Cup.\n\"I'm still in dreamland,\" Nathan told BBC Sport. \"I still can't believe I am going to Paris in a couple of weeks to watch us in a Champions League quarter-final.\n\"Honestly, it has not sunk in. I only ever used to hear about these glory days from my dad, but now we are actually able to experience it together. It's just unbelievable.\n\"What Unai Emery has done since taking charge in 2022 is just astronomical, and the players and fans are fully on board with what he is doing.\n\"Even when things are not going so well, it is clear that the team still has full confidence in the manager to have a Plan B or C to turn games around, and we have seen that happen on multiple occasions this season.\"\nAllow TikTok content?\nThis article contains content provided by TikTok.

It means so much to Villa fans because hardly any of us are alive who have seen us win it.\n\"Even my dad wasn't born the last time we won it [in 1957] and winning at Wembley would be very special. \n\"I've been lucky enough to go there a few times with Villa but other than our play-off win when we got promoted in 2019,  it has always ended up in misery.\"\nChris Sutton and Nathan Dawe were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nThere are no replays.

Fulham: Never. Palace: Never\nBest FA Cup run? Fulham: runners-up in 1975. Palace: runners-up in 1990 & 2016\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.\nCrystal Palace won at Craven Cottage at the end of February and it is a ground where they have a decent record - they haven't lost there in their past six visits, since 2005.\nIt's a boost for Palace that Jean-Philippe Mateta is available to lead their attack - he can play wearing a special mask to protect his ear after his injury against Millwall in the fifth round - but we will have to see how much he has been affected by such a horrific challenge.\nThis video can not be played\nMillwall's Roberts sent off for 'dangerous' tackle on Mateta\nThe Eagles are a well-balanced team who seem to be improving all the time under Oliver Glasner - they have lost only two of their past 14 games in all competitions.\nI've found Fulham hard to predict this season because they've been less reliable than usual at home, but they are still having a strong campaign - they are in the mix for the Champions League places, and are only three points behind fifth-placed City.\nPalace are very strong on the road but they have not played for the past three weeks - their game against Newcastle before the international break was postponed because of the Carabao Cup final.\nWe often talk about teams needing a rest, but my concern is how that break has affected their momentum.\nThis is going to be a close game, but I actually fancy Fulham to edge it. Marco Silva's side have got goals in them, and my gut feeling is that they will get through in 90 minutes.\nI just hope both managers go for it properly, and don't prioritise next week's midweek Premier League games [Fulham are at Arsenal on Tuesday and Palace travel to Southampton on Wednesday] instead of this tie.\nFulham and Palace have shown this season they have got enough quality in their strongest starting XIs to go all the way in the FA Cup, especially this year when the competition appears so open. \nThey are both in a great position to finally win a major trophy, so why not try to make history and give their fans something to celebrate?\nPalace's only previous cup success was winning the Zenith Data Systems Cup in 1991. \nI can imagine their fans enjoyed that day a lot, but lifting the FA Cup would be on a different planet, and the same goes for Fulham, who have not even been in an FA Cup semi-final since 2002.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nNathan's prediction: It feels like Palace always turn into world-beaters in the last couple of months of the season, and I can see them winning this. 1-2\nAmex Stadium, 17:15 GMT\n7th in Premier League v 3rd in Premier League\nGap = 4\nLast major trophy?

Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.\nBrighton will see this as the chance to get revenge for their 7-0 defeat at the City Ground at the start of February.\nI am sure some people felt the wheels had come off for Seagulls boss Fabian Hurzeler after that result, but instead his side have bounced back and gone on a great run of six wins and one draw in all competitions.\nSometimes getting thrashed like that can have a positive effect on a team, and clear the air. \nI remember losing 7-1 at Blackburn Rovers in October 1992, when I was a centre-half for Norwich City, but we had a crate of beer on the coach home to put things right and we were still top of the  Premier League table at Christmas. I did get moved up front after that though.\nAs for Nottingham Forest, they are the only team left in the FA Cup where I could understand it if they rested players this weekend, because of their league position.\nThey play Manchester United on Tuesday and the finish line is in sight for my boyhood team to finish third and secure Champions League football.\nThat's why it's disappointing to hear about Chris Wood getting injured while playing for New Zealand this week.\nHopefully it is not serious, but it is a blow for Forest if they are without their main number nine for any length of time.\nTheir game plan won't change without Wood - they will sit deep and attack on the break, it is just a question on whether it is their A team who face Brighton or not, and my hunch is that Nuno Espirito Santo will make a few changes.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nNathan's prediction: Forest are in such a good position in the league, I have a feeling they are going to be super-focused on that. For that reason, I am going with Brighton. 2-0\nDeepdale, 13:30 BST\n14th in Championship v 9th in Premier League\nGap = 25\nLast major trophy? Preston: 1938 FA Cup.

His keepie-uppie antics, external to wind up Brazil while playing for Argentina this week were another reminder of why he is the best goalkeeper in the world. Anyone who can produce moments like that in a game of that magnitude deserves all the accolades you can get.\nSutton's prediction: 0-2\nNathan's prediction: The FA Cup has opened up for us this season, and it feels like we are the favourites now. I just really hope our schedule doesn't take too much toll on the players and we fall short because of that, but I am looking forward to the rest of the season for sure. \nBrighton will be tough on Wednesday so what do we prioritise, even with a quality squad like ours? That part is down to Emery, and he will probably rest a couple of first-choice players on Sunday, but I would love us to go to Preston, put out a strong team and win comfortably. I am not super-convinced that is going to happen anyway though, even if we don't make lots of changes, because Preston will throw everything at us. \nIt won't be as easy as people might think, but I do expect us to go through.  0-1\nVitality Stadium, 16:30 BST\n10th in Premier League v 5th in Premier League\nGap = 5\nLast major trophy?

Yes... but only just.\nBournemouth are so good with their press that they won't allow City to easily play out from the back - there are going to be plenty of goals, and I can see it being settled in extra-time.\nSutton's prediction: 2-3 after extra-time\nNathan's prediction: Bournemouth are having a good season but I am still backing City to get through. 1-3\nThere were eight Premier League games played in week 29, the last set of fixtures before the international break.\nSo far, Chris and his guest, Divorce singer Felix, have both got four correct results, with one exact score, giving them both 70 points.\nFor now, it goes down as a win for the BBC readers - using the most popular scoreline from your predictions for each game, you got five correct results, with one exact score, leaving you on 80 points.\nThe remaining two games were rearranged because of the Carabao Cup final. \nNo-one picked up any points from Liverpool's draw with Aston Villa, which was moved forward to 19 February, so the weekly winner will be decided when Newcastle host Crystal Palace on 16 April - Felix has gone for a 2-1 Palace win.\nChris and Felix also made a prediction for the Carabao Cup final, and they both wrongly picked Liverpool to win it. \nThey were not alone, because the majority BBC readers also went for a Reds victory - out of almost 38,000 predictions, 73% of you thought Arne Slot's side would prevail.",

But not in that way.\"\nOn Thursday, Rangers' interim boss Barry Ferguson said Cerny had got a \"wee bit over-excited\", adding: \"I have no issues with that\".\nBut Rodgers was clear he would not stand for similar actions.\nHe continued: \"It's respect, isn't it? I think it's a lack of respect if somehow a player runs up a touchline and he's squirting a water bottle in a supporter's face. I certainly wouldn't want my players to do it.\n\"Listen, it works both ways, a lot comes into players as well, from the stands, to coaches, managers and players.\n\"But I think we all know there's a line that we shouldn't cross. It is a very emotive game, an amazing fixture, and I thought it was great to have the [away] fans back in, I think that gave it that extra bit as well.\n\"But I just think there's lines we can't antagonise because in this fixture in particular, that can lead to an issue.\"\nRodgers waits for news on 'top-class' Schmeichel's injury\nFerguson 'would love' extended Cerny stay at Ibrox\nRangers' 3-2 win at Celtic Park, was the first domestic home defeat of the season for the runaway league leaders.\nIt was also a second successive derby success for Rangers, who were 3-0 victors at Ibrox in January.\n\"In both of those Rangers games, we haven't started well at all,\" said Rodgers.\n\"Whether it is a subconscious thing, I'm not sure. It's been 13 points clear, 16 points clear. Whether that does have a deep effect on how you enter into the game\u2026 It shouldn't, because our mantra is always to start very quick.\n\"But we didn't and credit to Rangers because they did. They got 2-0 up and then we had to bounce back. But from that second half, we shouldn't lose the game. It's as simple as that.\n\"The analysis is pretty easy, but that's my responsibility to make us better the next time.\"\nRodgers added: \"We were obviously disappointed with the result. However, I can't forget what this team has done over the course of the season.\n\"We've been tremendous through large parts of the season and now we sit 13 points clear.

He described himself as a \"shy, serious, lugubrious kid, painfully thin, with a long, sad face\".\nHe admitted to being the most \"uncooperative kid in school\" but discovered a taste and a talent for athletics. \nAt Pomona College, he was bitten by the acting bug - and a role in Bernard Shaw's Arms and the Man convinced him he had found his calling.\nParamount Studios was interested in him, but thoughts of an acting career were put on hold after he was called up, serving 16 months with the US Army, rising to the rank of sergeant while stationed in Korea.\nOn his discharge, he made a number of cameos in TV shows, including an episode of the popular Western, Gunsmoke.\nNot everyone had Chamberlain picked as a future star.\nHe was handsome enough: with profiles at the time gushing over his \"fine-lined aristocratic face, suggesting a young Florentine noble - straight out of the Renaissance\".\nBut, he was naturally diffident - which worked in his favour when he auditioned to play Dr James Kildare, a medical intern struggling to learn his profession, in NBC's new primetime medical drama. \n\"Perhaps it was inevitable,\" said one friend-and-rival. \"Who else could look so anti-sceptic as Dick?\"\nThe series ran for nearly 200 programmes across five seasons.\nIt broke new ground, by raising matters such as drug addiction - which had not previously been shown on US TV.\nThere was a huge reaction from female fans.\nChamberlain got 12,000 letters a week. In Pittsburgh, 450,000 people turned out to see him at a parade, and in New York, he nearly caused a riot when a child spotted him and called his name. \nThe studio made the most of this attention, releasing novels, comics and games featuring Chamberlain's image.\nFans would even write in asking \"Dr Kildare\" to solve their various medical problems. \nAnd Chamberlain had an unlikely hit single: Three Stars Will Shine Tonight, where romantic words were added to the show's distinctive opening theme tune.\nHe won a Golden Globe Award for best TV actor in 1963. But, three years later audiences began to wane, and NBC pulled the plug.\nNow an international star, Chamberlain struggled to leave Kildare behind. \nIn 1966, he hoped to break into films, but reviews slated his performance in the light romantic comedy, Joy in the Morning.\nAudiences, they said, laughed in \"all the wrong places\". So, he resolved to ignore Hollywood and make a living on the stage. \nHe got off to a rocky start when a musical version of Breakfast at Tiffany's - in which he starred opposite Mary Tyler Moore - closed after just four shows.\nThe production is still seen as one of Broadway's biggest ever turkeys. But a move to England gave him a chance of reinventing himself as a 'serious actor.' \nIn 1967, there were starring roles in Henry James' Portrait of a Lady and opposite Katherine Hepburn in a satirical comedy called The Madwoman of Chaillot.\nAnd, two years later, he became the first American to play Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre since the great John Barrymore in 1925.\nThis time, the reviews were excellent and he revisited the role of Denmark's most tortured prince for a television version for Hallmark. \nBut Chamberlain was cast as Tchaikovsky in Ken Russell's overblown biopic, The Music Lovers, in which he starred opposite Glenda Jackson. \nThe critics rubbished the film, in which great play was made of the relationship between a composer with repressed homosexual tendencies and his nymphomaniac wife, although it later became something of a cult success.\nChamberlain went on to play Lord Byron opposite Sarah Miles in Lady Caroline Lamb and the swashbuckling French swordsman Aramis in Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers.\nHe also appeared - along with half of Hollywood - in the Towering Inferno, as a crooked electrical engineer whose corner-cutting leads to the spectacular destruction of a 138 floor building. \nIn 1977, the TV series Roots - set in the era of American slavery - drew huge audiences and was nominated for nearly 40 Emmy awards.\nIt sparked a revival of the mini-series which drew Chamberlain back to television.\nHe beat Roger Moore and Albert Finney to be cast as John Blackthorn - a captive English navigator in 17th Century Japan - in Shogun.\nThe series was shown on NBC over five nights in 1980, with audiences reaching nearly 30 million.  \nHaving won a Golden Globe, Chamberlain then picked up another as Father Ralph de Bricassart in The Thorn Birds, a priest torn between God and his sexual longing afor the actress, Rachel Ward.\nIt was even more successful than Shogun, winning an audience of 60% of television viewers and 16 Emmy nominations.\nIn the 1990s, Chamberlain's career began to wane.\nThere were a succession of solid, rather than outstanding, performances in made-for-TV films and endless guest appearances in other people's shows.\nThese included a sequel to The Thorn Birds called The Missing Years, with Amanda Donohoe replacing Rachel Ward.\nIn 2003, long after he had stopped playing romantic leading men, Chamberlain published his biography Shattered Love, in which, for the first time, he confirmed he was gay.\nDespite a relationship of more than 30 years with the actor and director Martin Rabbett, with whom he'd once starred in the film Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, they had kept their private life private.\n\"I thought there was something very, very deeply wrong with me,\" he said, \"and I wanted to cover it up. I remember making a pact with myself that I would never, ever reveal this secret, ever.\"\nChamberlain and Rabbett went their separate ways in 2010.\nIn later years, Chamberlain was happy to play a gay man, notably in Desperate Housewives and Will & Grace. \nHe continued to perform in musical theatre, including touring productions of Spamalot, My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music.\nBut he never regretted hiding his sexuality to protect his career.\n\"I would have been a happier person being out of the closet and being free,\" he told El Pais in 2024. \"But I had other motives that made me happy. I was a working actor and for me, that was most important.\"\nHe will be remembered as the king of the TV mini-series: the dashing leading man in everything from Dr Kildare to The Thorn Birds.\nDespite attempts to reinvent himself as a serious stage actor, he was at his best on the small screen, entertaining millions watching at home on the sofa.\nFor, although there were always better actors than Richard Chamberlain, few rivalled his ability to hold a television audience.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nPundits on Rashford's MOTM performance against Preston\nMarcus Rashford has got his swagger back.\nThe Aston Villa loanee ended his 120-day goal drought with a second-half double at Preston on Sunday to help Unai Emery's side set up an FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace - and provide another clear sign he is enjoying his football again.\nFrozen out of the first-team picture at Manchester United by head coach Ruben Amorim just weeks after he replaced Erik ten Hag at the helm, even those closest to Rashford accepted he had a major point to prove when he completed his loan move to Aston Villa on 3 February.\nThose working with him can see the improvement in Rashford, maybe not quite to the levels of old but certainly a far cry from the passive figure he appeared at Old Trafford for most of the previous 18 months.\nEngland boss Thomas Tuchel must have felt so too, judging by the speed with which he restored Rashford to the international fold earlier this month.\nYet there were plenty of doubters. They were out in force on social media during the first half of Villa's 3-0 FA Cup quarter-final victory at Preston, as Rashford wasted a couple of free-kicks as the visitors struggled to turn their dominance into goals.\nThe only measure, though, of a striker's success is the regularity they hit the back of the net - and he hadn't done it for 14 games and counting since his double for United against Everton on 1 December.\nBut when Lucas Digne presented the opportunity 13 minutes into the second half at Deepdale, Rashford's innate ability did the rest as he calmly picked his spot before finding the bottom corner. \nFive minutes later, despite a wait for the video assistant referee (VAR) to confirm Villa should be awarded a penalty, and goalkeeper David Cornell offering some 'advice' as he walked past to take up his position, Rashford's nerve held. He took his time, did an extended stuttering run-up, and found the net.\n\"The swagger is back,\" gushed Guy Mowbray in his Match of the Day commentary. \"The confidence and the pose.\"\n\"It's a great feeling,\" Rashford told BBC Sport afterwards: \"It's always nice for a forward to get a goal, so hopefully it continues.\n\"I feel like I've been getting fitter and playing better football since I've been here. I missed a lot of football before joining up with them. My body feels good and I'm enjoying my football for now.\"\nFA Cup 'sparkle' returns - but will there be a 'fairytale ending'?\nRashford scores double as Aston Villa beat Preston in FA Cup quarters\nForest draw Bournemouth or Man City, Palace v Villa\nThis video can not be played\nRashford scores first Villa goals within space of five minutes\nThe deal United struck with Villa to let Rashford leave is not straightforward.\nThe precise nature of the loan deal is complicated. United have said 75% of Rashford's wages are being covered, although they have not explained exactly how. \nThat could rise to 90% if certain performance-related bonuses are met.\nThat, presumably, will include an extended run in the Champions League - Villa have been paired with French heavyweights Paris St-Germain in the quarter-finals - as well as the FA Cup.\nUnai Emery's side face Crystal Palace at Wembley next month as the next step in their quest to win the trophy for the first time since 1957. \nIn addition, they are ninth in the Premier League, three points behind fifth-placed Manchester City, who occupy what is virtually certain to be the final Champions League spot.\nThat proliferation of targets underscores why Emery did not really want to talk about the likelihood of Villa triggering their \u00a340m option to turn Rashford's move into a permanent deal.\n\"We can't waste time speaking about that,\" he said\n\"If next year we are in the Champions League, in the Europa, or Conference League or not. Or we don't win a trophy - it is completely different.\"\nMarcus Rashford (left) celebrates his second goal for Aston Villa at Preston\nUnlike Villa, Rashford has won the FA Cup twice in recent memory, including last season. He has also been part of teams who have won the Europa League and EFL Cup. In addition, he has 60 England caps. His past playbook means if he can reach the standards he has previously set, he would be an asset to any side in the world.\nIt is that talent Emery is trying to coax out of the player. It is, in the modern football vocabulary, 'a process'.\nThe Aston Villa boss, said: \"There is still work, still weeks to get it, but today he did one step forward. He is feeling comfortable, getting confident and scoring goals. He was obviously getting better, but today it was more in his adaptation and helping us.\n\"He's playing in the idea, in the plan we did with him. He has played more as a winger on the left side but he's played in some moments as a striker. Today we decided to play him as a striker to his quality, his power and the way he exploits things. \n\"The process we have with him is more or less not changing. There is still work to do because he came here after not training consistently and not feeling in his best fitness. Progressively playing more and with the national team will help him to feel better and today was confirmation of that, which is good.\"\nThe painful divorce of Marcus Rashford and Manchester United\nThe good thing from Rashford's perspective is he is beginning to put together a positive body of work to counter the extended period of drift he experienced at United.\nIt still feels bizarre he has left his boyhood club for a perceived smaller rival, yet finds himself entering the final two months of the campaign with substantially more to play for - both in number and prestige of competitions - than he would have had if he remained at Old Trafford.\nNo professional career is a straight line ascent, which is why insight from those who have been there and done it is so valuable.\n\"You are constantly being asked questions at the top,\" said former England keeper Joe Hart on Match of the Day.\n\"Maybe Rashford found himself in a lull but he has come to Villa with people around him that know what they are doing. He hasn't come here with question marks about how he is going to behave and what he is going to do and how he can change the team.\"\nHart found himself frozen out for a time at Manchester City and Micah Richards did not have the greatest time at Aston Villa.\nBut, like Hart, Rashford can see how a change of scenery has provided the impetus for improvement.\n\"He looks confident and happy,\" said Richards.\n\"It was a big move going to Villa. But when you've got a manager that believes in you, you can do special things.\n\"His whole body language looks a lot better and his all-round game was brilliant. That is the best way to shut people up. People were asking questions about not fulfilling his potential but that is the way to answer.\n\"I really like Rashford in these wide areas because he's always looking to run in behind.\nWhen I talk about body language and his movement - his all round game today was brilliant.\"\nGet Aston Villa news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Author LJ Smith, whose best-selling Vampire Diaries novels were turned into a hit TV show, has died at the age of 66.\nLisa Jane Smith published the original four-book series, about a love triangle involving two vampire brothers and an orphaned young woman, in 1991 and 92, before releasing another Vampire Diaries trilogy in 2009-11.\nHowever, she was dropped from her own book series and replaced by new authors by publishers, but Smith continued releasing new instalments unofficially as fan fiction.\nThe official books were adapted for TV in 2009 and the show became a teen favourite over its eight years.\nDescribed by the Guardian as a \"deliciously pulpy supernatural soap opera\", the TV version was part of a craze for vampire stories that also included Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Twilight and True Blood.\nThe show won a total of 30 Teen Choice Awards including six consecutive prizes for best fantasy/sci-fi actress for Nina Dobrev, who played Elena for the first six seasons.\nDobrev starred alongside Paul Wesley and Ian Somerhalder as brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore.\nSmith had originally been hired to write the novel series by a book packager - who sold them to a publisher - under a deal where they, not she, owned the rights.\nShe said the packager dropped her in 2011 and handed over her unpublished eighth instalment to an anonymous ghostwriter, who went on to publish two further Vampire Diaries books.\nThe series was then handed on to an author using the pen name Aubrey Clark for three more. However, Smith's remained the most prominent name on the book covers as the series creator.\nThe author said the situation left her feeling \"trashed\" and \"mutilated\".\nHowever, she went some way to reclaiming her creation when the Vampire Diaries was added to an Amazon Kindle scheme granting official permission for anyone to publish fan fiction linked to existing books.\nSmith launched a new unofficial Vampire Diaries trilogy through that scheme, which picked up where her last official book left off.\nShe was also known for the Night World novels, which also feature vampires as well as witches, werewolves and shapeshifters, who secretly live among the human race.\nNine Night World volumes were published between 1996 and 98, before Smith took a decade-long break from writing. She said it was a result of writer's block while two family members dealt with cancer.\nSmith's The Secret Circle trilogy, published in 1992, was also turned into a TV drama in 2011.

        "article_text": "\"Incredible.\" That was the single word uttered under her breath by Marine Le Pen as she stormed out of a Paris courtroom on Monday morning.\nShe left the court early \u2013 just before hearing that she was barred from running for office for five years after being found guilty of embezzlement of EU funds \u2013 almost certainly ruling her out from standing in the 2027 French presidential election.\nWithout even waiting for the judge to pronounce the full details of the sentence, the head of the National Rally knew that her political goose was cooked.\nThere would be no reprieve pending appeal. The bar on running for office was real and immediate.\nA four-year prison sentence, of which two will be suspended, will be on hold pending appeal.\nBut her political plans are dead.\nLe Pen's incredulity can be better excused, perhaps, in the context of the moment.\nA consensus had almost established itself across France's political world that this ultimate sanction by the court could not, would not \u2013 in the end \u2013 take place.\nIt was not just Le Pen's followers who said it. Her enemies agreed, from Jean-Luc Melenchon on the far left to Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou in the centre and Justice Minister G\u00e9rard Darmanin on the right.\nBut they were all wrong.  The judge said that the law was the law.\nThe law had in fact recently been toughened \u2013 by the very politicians who were now complaining about its application \u2013 to make the penalty for misuse of public funds very severe indeed.  Well, said the judge in so many words, now let politicians suck up their own medicine.\nMaybe Marine Le Pen was naive in not predicting this outcome. It certainly appears as if her National Rally party was singularly unprepared for it.\nSo as they met in an emergency session after the verdict, party leaders were in a dilemma.\nDo they continue as if there is still a chance Marine Le Pen will run in 2027?\nIn theory there is still a (small) possibility.  She has launched an appeal. The appeal could be accelerated and take place at the end of this year or early 2026. A verdict would follow in the spring.\nA different decision at the appeal hearing could lessen the period of ineligibility, or remove it altogether \u2013 in which case she could still run.  But the chances must be regarded as slim.\nOr, should they proceed with plan B \u2013 that is to say, with naming party president Jordan Bardella as de facto the man who will run in Marine Le Pen's place?\nThat might be a more realistic assessment of what lies ahead. But to turn to Bardella too quickly would be unseemly.  And anyway, not everyone in the party is a fan.\nBy the evening the choice had been made: in a TV appearance Marine Le Pen came out fighting, saying she had no plans to retreat from the political scene.\nDenouncing what she called a \"political\" decision by the judge and a \"violation of the state of law\", she called for a swift appeal trial, so that her name could be cleared \u2013 or at least the ineligibility lifted \u2013 in time for the 2027 vote.\n\"There are millions of French people who believe in me. For 30 years I have been fighting against injustice. It is what I shall continue to do right to the end,\" she said.\nFighting words \u2013 but in reality the future looks very unclear. And there are many unanswered questions.\nWhat, for example, will the effect of the court decision be on the RN vote?\nIn the short term we can expect an outcry, and a boost to the party's support.  Why? Because what has happened fits so neatly into the RN narrative that the populist right is a victim of the \"system\".\nNo-one likely to vote for the RN seriously holds it against Marine Le Pen for illegally financing her party using EU parliament funds.  They all know that practically every French political party has resorted to similar underhand methods in the past.\nBy the same token,  her \"draconian\" punishment \u2013 being banned from standing for the presidency \u2013 will be interpreted as a badge of honour: proof that she alone is standing up to the powers-that-be.\nLonger term, though, the boost may not be so powerful.  The truth is that Marine Le Pen is a huge asset to the RN.  This battle-hardened, sentimental, cat-loving,  tough-talking,  long-suffering woman is held in affection by her supporters, who feel they know her personally.\nJordan Bardella is a popular figure too, but at just 29 it is hard to see him filling her shoes. If Marine Le Pen is indeed unable to run in 2027, the RN loses much of its appeal.\nWhat is certain is that many would-be candidates on the non-RN right \u2013 Laurent Wauquiez, Bruno Retailleau for example \u2013 would see in a Bardella candidacy a big opportunity for themselves.\nThe other unknown is vengeance.\nMarine Le Pen remains a member of the National Assembly, where she leads a bloc of 125 \u2013 the parliament's biggest.  Till now she had been benign towards the beleaguered prime minister Francois Bayrou, who struggles on despite having no majority.\nThose days may be over.   \nWhy should we do anyone any favours now, they will be saying at RN HQ. Why not bring the house down?",

        "article_text": "Why won't India buy even a single bushel of American corn?\nThat's the question US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick raised recently while criticising India's trade policies, taking a swipe at its market restrictions.\nIn another interview, Lutnick accused India of blocking US farmers and urged it to open its agricultural market - suggesting quotas or limits as a possible approach.\nAgriculture is a key battleground in US President Donald Trump's escalating trade war, with tit-for-tat or reciprocal tariffs set to kick in on 2 April. \nTariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.Trump has repeatedly branded India a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties.\nFor years, Washington has pushed for greater access to India's farm sector, seeing it as a major untapped market. But India has fiercely protected it, citing food security, livelihoods and interests of millions of small farmers.\nTo be sure, India's transformation from a food-deficient nation to a food-surplus powerhouse is one of its biggest success stories.\nIn the 1950s and '60s, the country relied on food aid to feed its population, but a series of agricultural breakthroughs changed that. India became self-sufficient in staples, and became the world's largest milk producer. Rapid growth in  horticulture, poultry and aquaculture expanded its food basket.\nToday, India is not just feeding its 1.4 billion people but, as the world's eighth-largest agri-produce exporter, also shipping grains, fruits and dairy worldwide.\nYet, despite such major gains, Indian agriculture still lags in productivity, infrastructure and market access. Global price volatility and climate change add to the challenge. Crop yields lag far behind the global best. Small landholdings worsen the problem - Indian farmers work with less than a hectare on average, while their American counterparts had over 46 hectares in 2020.\nNo surprise then that productivity remains low, even though farming remains India's backbone, supporting over 700 million people, nearly half the country's population. Agriculture employs nearly half of India's workforce but accounts for just 15% of GDP. In comparison, less than 2% of the US population depends on farming. With limited manufacturing jobs, more people are stuck in low-paying farm work, an unusual trend for a developing country.\nThis structural imbalance also shapes India's trade policies. Despite its farm surplus, India keeps tariffs high to shield its farmers from cheap imports. It maintains moderate to high tariffs - ranging from zero to 150% - on farm imports.\nThe weighted average tariff - the average duty rate per imported product - in India on US farm products is 37.7%, compared to 5.3% on Indian agricultural goods in the US, according to the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).  \nBilateral farm trade between India and the US is modest, at just $8bn (\u00a36.2bn).\nIndia mainly exports rice, shrimp, honey, vegetable extracts, castor oil and black pepper, while the US sends almonds, walnuts, pistachios, apples and lentils. \nBut as the two countries work on a trade deal, experts say Washington now wants to push \"big-ticket\" farm exports - wheat, cotton, corn and maize - to narrow its $45bn trade deficit with India.\n\"They're not looking to export berries and stuff this time. The game is much bigger,\" says Biswajit Dhar, a trade expert from the Delhi-based Council for Social Development think tank. \nPushing India to lower farm tariffs, cut price support and open up to genetically modified (GM) crops and dairy ignores the fundamental asymmetry in global agriculture, experts argue. \nThe US, for instance, heavily subsidises its agriculture and protects farmers through crop insurance. \n\"In some cases,\" says Ajay Srivastava of GTRI, \"US subsidies exceed 100% of production costs, creating an uneven playing field that could devastate India's smallholder farmers.\"\nAbhijit Das, former head of the Centre for WTO Studies at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, says \"the key thing to remember is that agriculture in the two countries is entirely different\".\n\"The US has commercial agriculture, while India relies on intensive, subsistence farming. It's a question of the livelihoods of millions of Indians versus the interests of US agribusiness.\"\nBut India's agricultural challenges aren't just external. Mr Dhar says much of the sector's struggles are \"its own doing\". Smallholder farmers, owning over 85% of holdings, lack investment capacity, while the private sector shows little interest. Farming receives less than 6% of India's total government and private infrastructure investment, leaving irrigation and storage facilities underfunded.\nTo protect millions of livelihoods, the government shields key crops like wheat, rice and dairy with import duties and price support. \"But even that doesn't inspire confidence,\" he says.\nFour years ago, tens of thousands of farmers held protests demanding better prices and legal guarantees of minimum government support-price for staples, mainly wheat and rice. \n\"Even relatively well-off farmers selling surpluses don't see a turnaround anytime soon. And if they feel that way, imagine the plight of subsistence farmers,\" says Mr Dhar.\nBeyond domestic discontent, trade negotiations add another layer of complexity. \nMr Das says the real challenge for India will be how \"to have an agreement with the US that takes into account US export interest in agriculture while balancing India's interests in the farm sector\".\nSo what's the way forward?\n\"India must not yield to US pressure to open its agriculture sector,\" says Mr Srivastava. He warns that doing so would disrupt millions of livelihoods, threaten food security and flood local markets with cheap imports. \n\"India must prioritise its national interest and protect its rural economy. Trade cooperation should not come at the cost of our farmers, food sovereignty or policy autonomy.\" \nIn the long run, experts say India must modernise its agriculture, making farming more remunerative, and become more competitive to boost exports. Unupom Kausik of agri-business Olam estimates that with top global yields, India could generate a surplus of 200 million metric tonnes of paddy - enough to supply global trade and combat hunger.\n\"In a way, Trump is holding up a mirror to us. We've done little to invest in agriculture's productive capacity,\" says Mr Dhar. \"For now, buying time is the best strategy - maybe offering the US cheaper imports of industrial goods as a trade-off.\"\nBut for the best outcome, he says, India will have to \"play hardball. Basically, tell the US - we're open to negotiations on other fronts, but don't destabilise our agriculture\".\nClearly India's challenge is to negotiate from a position of strength - offering just enough to keep Washington at the table while safeguarding its rural backbone. After all, in global trade as in farming, timing and patience often yield the best harvest. The jury is out on whether Trump is willing to wait.",

        "article_text": "The detention of South Sudan's First Vice-President Riek Machar has effectively collapsed the 2018 peace deal that ended the country's five-year civil war, his party has said. \nAn armed convoy led by top security officials, including the defence minister, entered Machar's residence in the capital, Juba, and disarmed his bodyguards late on Wednesday, said the Sudan People's Liberation Movement In Opposition (SPLM/IO). \nMachar was detained alongside his wife Angelina Teny, who is also the country's interior minister, the party added. \nThe US has urged the authorities to free Machar, while the UN, African Union and neighbouring countries have all expressed their concern.\n\nThe UN Mission in South Sudan, Unmiss, warned that the world's newest nation risked losing the \"hard-won gains of the past seven years\" if it returned to \"a state of war\". \n\"Tonight, the country's leaders stand on the brink of relapsing into widespread conflict,\" the mission said in a statement on Wednesday. \nThe government is yet to comment on Machar's reported house-arrest.\nBut addressing religious leaders on Wednesday, President Salva Kiir said \"he will never return the country to war\". \nTensions have been building between Machar and the president for several weeks. \nThe two leaders agreed in August 2018 to end the civil war between their forces that killed nearly 400,000 people. But over the last seven years their relationship has become increasingly strained amid ethnic tensions and sporadic violence.\nEarlier this week, the UN said that barrel bombs believed to contain a highly flammable liquid had been used in airstrikes during fighting between the army and a rebel group previously linked to Machar.\n\"The arrest and detention of H.E. Dr Riek Machar effectively brings the [peace] agreement to a collapse,\" SPLM/IO deputy leader Oyet Nathaniel Pierino told journalists on Thursday.\n\"The prospect for peace and stability in South Sudan has now been put into serious jeopardy,\" he added.\nA similar warning was issued by the UN mission in the country, which said the country's leaders \"stand on the brink of relapsing into widespread conflict\". \nThe situation has been exacerbated by the deployment of Ugandan troops and their battle tanks into South Sudan, following a request by the country's president, according to the UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan chair Yasmin Sooka.\nShe says this raises serious concerns over potential violations of the UN arms embargo and the growing partisan role of foreign forces, which further endangers civilians and risks regional escalation.\nTension remains high in Juba with a heavy military presence reported around Machar's home.\n\"The public are in a panic,\" civil society leader Edmund Yakani told the AFP news agency.\n\"There is a high chance of full-scale war but it will be more deadly and more violent because of [the need] for revenge,\" he added.\nPierino called on SPLM/IO members and the public to remain calm as diplomatic efforts continue to resolve the situation.\nThe BBC understands that the African Union and the regional body, Igad, are expected to send high-level delegations to Juba on Friday, to help curb the escalating crisis.\nReath Muoch Tang, chairman of the party's foreign relations committee, said Machar was under house-arrest, but that security officials initially tried to take him away.\n\"An arrest warrant was delivered to him under unclear charges,\" Tang said in a statement, calling the action a \"blatant violation of the constitution and the Revitalized Peace Agreement\".\nThe UN mission warned that violations of the 2018 peace deal \"will not only devastate South Sudan but also affect the entire region\". \nThe British and US embassies have scaled down their diplomatic staff and urged their citizens to leave the country while the Norwegian and German embassies have closed their operations in Juba. \nThe US has called on President Kiir to free his rival from the reported house-arrest, urging the two leaders to show commitment to peace.\n\"We urge President Kiir to reverse this action & prevent further escalation of the situation,\" the US Bureau of African Affairs wrote on X. \nThe escalating tensions come amid renewed clashes between forces loyal to the two rivals in the northern town of Nasir in the oil-rich Upper Nile State.\nAdditional reporting by Nichola Mandil in Juba\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Bill Sweeney has survived a vote of no confidence in his leadership\n\"The time for division is behind us. The time for collaboration is now.\"\nRFU interim chair Sir Bill Beaumont was quick to look to the future after the special general meeting (SGM) where chief executive Bill Sweeney faced - and survived - a vote of no confidence.\nThe meeting was a highly significant event for English rugby - the first of its kind in 20 years and an opportunity for the game at all levels to hold the powers-that-be to account.\nBut despite the uproar inside and outside Twickenham that followed Sweeney's \u00a31.1m pay packet in the autumn - and the various perceived governance failures of the past few years - the 67-year-old has been given a clear mandate by the game to continue in his role.\nBut what happens next and what does the future hold for the game at all levels?\nBBC Sport answers some of the key questions.\nWith more than 700 votes cast on Thursday - from clubs at all levels, constituent bodies, unions and various individuals - this was one of the biggest turnouts in recent memory, with just under 66% of the votes opposing the motion and backing Sweeney.\nThe embattled chief executive had some big-hitters in his corner. Since coming in as interim chair just before Christmas, former England captain Beaumont has been on a mission to convince the game Sweeney must stay - and the roadshows the pair have been on in the community game have paid off.\nHighly-respected board member Wayne Barnes was another to strenuously defend Sweeney's record. Barnes opposed the motion at the SGM and told the BBC afterwards losing Sweeney would have \"damaged the game\".\nMeanwhile, the RFU president Rob Udwin, who chaired the meeting, made it clear where his loyalties lay. \nHowever, whether an RFU president should be quite as openly and determinedly partial was a matter of consternation for some in attendance.\nThis video can not be played\nTo lose Sweeney would have damaged our game - Barnes\nDespite suggestions before the SGM that it would be just the start, not the end, of the rebellion, Sweeney's opponents struck a more conciliatory tone when they spoke to the BBC afterwards.\nThey stressed that forcing the SGM and making the RFU board answerable to the game at large was a victory in itself.\nMeanwhile, a second motion, which the board brought forward, to devolve more responsibility to the community game seems to have gone a long way to quelling the uprising.\n\"We want to work together,\" said Paddy McAlpine, chair of Chichester Rugby Club and co-chair of the Whole Game Union (WGU).\n\"What is really encouraging about tonight is that all those rugby players across the nation from the smallest club up to the Championship now have a voice.\n\"And we will hold those responsible for the leadership of our game to account. We look forward to all the changes and improvements that they are going to put in place.\"\n\"This was never really about one individual,\" added Alistair Bow, chairman of Championship club Nottingham and co-chair of the WGU.\n\"We felt the game was suffering to the point that we needed to have a look at the top. We went to the game and the vote has been cast.\n\"But actually we got what we needed. There was no winner and loser from the outset, but what we have done is we have taken our plight to the whole game.\n\"The game has had an opportunity [to voice concerns] and there were some very interesting questions raised in there tonight.\n\"And you could see there was a good percentage of people voted for him to go.\"\nSurprisingly, Sweeney's whopping pay packet and bonus was barely discussed throughout the 90-minute meeting, despite it being the catalyst that rallied the grassroots in the first place.\nA report by consultants Freshfields into the controversial bonus plan was published by the RFU in February and while this report threw up more questions than answers, especially around the metrics and methods of the scheme, it has done enough to turn attention elsewhere.\nWhat is clear from the questions raised at the meeting and from the nationwide roadshows of the past few months is how the grievances vary - from the Championship clubs unhappy at their funding cuts and blocked routes to the Premiership, to the rank-and-file referees put in an invidious position by the union's bungled tackle-height change.\nMeanwhile, some community clubs have spoken about how they don't feel represented while other clubs have cited the lack of rugby expertise \u2013 in their opinion \u2013 on the RFU board, as well as ongoing concerns about the sustainability of the professional game.\nIdeological conflicts over what the RFU is, who it serves and who should make decisions still remain.\nBut without the revolt, Sweeney and Beaumont wouldn't have embarked on the roadshow and may have remained shielded to the various gripes felt up and down the English rugby pyramid.\n\"We have had thousands of conversations in clubhouses up and down the country in recent weeks,\" explained Beaumont.\n\"Some feedback has been hard to hear but most of it has been constructive. We have listened. We have responded.\n\"It is absolutely right that members should always have the opportunity to hold the leadership of the RFU to account. That is part of our democratic process as a membership-owned organisation.\"\nA decision on Sir Bill Beaumont's successor is expected by June\nAccording to Barnes, an RFU board member since September, Sweeney is valuable to the point of being irreplaceable.\n\"The question I have asked myself over the last few months is: is Bill the right person to lead this organisation?\" the former World Cup referee added.\n\"The answer is categorically yes. That's what I said to the members today. He is someone who leads our game, who leads the game across the world. To lose him would have damaged our game.\"\nSo with the RFU board squarely behind him and the wider game backing him too, Sweeney's hand has been strengthened, although the Twickenham executive team would be wise to heed the residual resentment from RFU foot soldiers, who faced stressful job losses while their bosses pocketed record bonuses.\nMeanwhile, the appointment of the next permanent chair is crucial, with Beaumont's interim role ending in the coming months. The RFU have a shortlist for his successor, with a decision expected in time for June's annual general meeting.\nThe previous chairman, Tom Ilube, is a highly-impressive businessman but was an aloof figure to many. The genial Beaumont, an English rugby grandee, has done his job in building bridges with the community game. \nWho is appointed to chair the organisation long-term - and in the process hold the RFU board and CEO to account - will be critical.\nAccording to senior RFU figures, these governance reforms are a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\" to revolutionise the running of the game.\nCurrently, almost all decisions that impact clubs are made in Twickenham but the RFU believes it now has a mandate to modernise the governance and give far greater flexibility for local areas to run the game as they see fit, with less centralised control over matters including where money is invested and league structures.\n\"We will give local clubs a more direct voice and influence in a new devolved structure,\" explained Beaumont.\n\"We will embark upon this process with renewed vigour in the months between now and the Annual General Meeting.\"\n\"I am encouraged because the RFU have committed themselves to a period of change, proper change,\" said the WGU's McAlpine.\n\"They are going to commit to that change and consult about that change and we are going to be involved in that change. So that has to be a good thing.\"\nAway from the grassroots, Beaumont also pledged a renewed focus on making the professional game sustainable and working with the Championship, whose clubs were a driving force behind the rebellion.\n\"We are all going to have to work very hard together because this is being monitored,\" added Nottingham's Bow.\n\"I am not downhearted. At the end of the day we have something to work with. The RFU have made some big commitments tonight.\n\"I have heard some positives but time will tell about whether they are going to be able to deliver.\"\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

However, whether an RFU president should be quite as openly and determinedly partial was a matter of consternation for some in attendance.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, To lose Sweeney would have damaged our game - BarnesAbout 35% of members didn't support Sweeney - what can they do now?Despite suggestions before the SGM that it would be just the start, not the end, of the rebellion, Sweeney's opponents struck a more conciliatory tone when they spoke to the BBC afterwards.They stressed that forcing the SGM and making the RFU board answerable to the game at large was a victory in itself.Meanwhile, a second motion, which the board brought forward, to devolve more responsibility to the community game seems to have gone a long way to quelling the uprising. \"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, A decision on Sir Bill Beaumont's successor is expected by JuneCan the RFU recover from this - and who are the key players to make it work?According to Barnes, an RFU board member since September, Sweeney is valuable to the point of being irreplaceable. \"Why wasn't Sweeney's bonus discussed?Surprisingly, Sweeney's whopping pay packet and bonus was barely discussed throughout the 90-minute meeting, despite it being the catalyst that rallied the grassroots in the first place.A report by consultants Freshfields into the controversial bonus plan was published by the RFU in February and while this report threw up more questions than answers, especially around the metrics and methods of the scheme, it has done enough to turn attention elsewhere.What is clear from the questions raised at the meeting and from the nationwide roadshows of the past few months is how the grievances vary - from the Championship clubs unhappy at their funding cuts and blocked routes to the Premiership, to the rank-and-file referees put in an invidious position by the union's bungled tackle-height change.Meanwhile, some community clubs have spoken about how they don't feel represented while other clubs have cited the lack of rugby expertise \u2013 in their opinion \u2013 on the RFU board, as well as ongoing concerns about the sustainability of the professional game.Ideological conflicts over what the RFU is, who it serves and who should make decisions still remain.But without the revolt, Sweeney and Beaumont wouldn't have embarked on the roadshow and may have remained shielded to the various gripes felt up and down the English rugby pyramid.",

He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us.\"\nRabbett added: \"Love never dies. And our love is under his wings, lifting him to his next great adventure.\"\nChamberlain's big break came in 1961, when he became a household name as Dr James Kildare in Dr Kildare. \nThe show, based on a popular 1930s and 40s film series, attracted millions of viewers, turning Chamberlain into a beloved leading man and a teen idol.\nThe popularity Dr Kildare earnt Chamberlain meant that, for three consecutive years between 1963 and 1965, he was named the most popular male star by Photoplay magazine.\nHe went on to become the king of the 1980s TV mini-series, playing a western prisoner in Shogun and a catholic priest tempted by love in The Thorn Birds.\nThe latter won 60% of the US television audience and earned 16 Emmy nominations.\nThough widely recognised as a romantic leading man, Chamberlain's private life remained largely a mystery until later in his life.\nHe did not publicly address his sexuality until the release of his memoir, Shattered Love, in 2003, where he revealed that he was gay.\nThroughout his 30-year relationship with actor-director Rabbett, they had kept their private life secret.\nIn his memoir, he recalled escorting glamorous actresses to premieres, explaining that he had been \"desperately afraid\" his sexuality would derail his career.\n\"I used to get chased by hot teenage girls,\" he once told TV Guide. \"I got 12,000 fan letters a week. And I felt somewhat besieged.\"\nRabbett and Chamberlain separated in 2010 but remained close. \nBorn on 31 March 1934 in Beverly Hills, California, Chamberlain grew up on what he called \"the wrong side of Wilshire Boulevard\" - far from the wealth of Hollywood's star-studded district.\nThe younger of two boys, his father, Charles, was a salesman who struggled with alcoholism and became a prominent figure in Alcoholics Anonymous, travelling the world to speak at conventions. His mother, Elsa, was a homemaker.\nHe initially studied painting at Pomona College, but a student theatre performance inspired him to pursue acting.\nInterest from a Hollywood scout was put on hold as he was drafted into the US Army, where he rose to the rank of sergeant while stationed in South Korea.\nUpon returning to California, Chamberlain took acting classes, landing several small TV roles before his breakout role as Dr Kildare.\nYears later, Chamberlain recounted the psychological abuse he endured during his childhood. \nHe described how his father's \"lethal sneer\" and emotionally abusive behaviour made him feel as if he were being \"slashed with a machete\". \nChamberlain also spoke about the relief he experienced in finally not having to hide his sexuality later in life.",

He has vast knowledge of the game, a great track record, a strong network and an insatiable desire to build winning teams.\n\"We undertook a thorough recruitment process and we were hugely impressed with the level of all the other candidates, but it was Andrea's experience and the success he has enjoyed that stood out.\"\nKieran Trippier helped Atletico win La Liga in the 2020-21 season\nSpanish football expert Guillem Balague told BBC Sport: \"He's quite unique compared to other sporting directors.\n\"He had no playing career, started in banking, and only got into football later, first at Carpenedolo, an amateur club, then at Parma and Genoa, where he built key connections with Peter Kenyon and Jorge Mendes.\n\"Under his watch, Atletico won two La Liga titles (2013-14, 2020-21), a Copa del Rey (2013), a Europa League (2017-18), and a Uefa Super Cup (2018). \n\"He's seen as the architect of the squad rebuild after the 2014 title-winning team faded.\"\nWorking with manager Diego Simeone, Berta helped Atletico make some astute acquisitions during that rebuild.\nFrance striker Griezmann was signed from Real Sociedad for \u00a324.8m in 2014 and five years later was sold to Barcelona for \u00a3103m. Atletico then bought him back in 2021 for just \u00a316.5m.\nSpain midfielder Rodri, now a Ballon d'Or winner, was signed for \u00a316.5m in 2018 and sold to Manchester City the following year for \u00a362.5m, while Slovenian goalkeeper Oblak signed from Benfica in 2014 for just \u00a313m. He's now widely regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the world.\nMore recently, forward Julian Alvarez joined from Manchester City last summer for \u00a381.5m and he has scored 23 goals for Atletico this season.\n\"He brought in key players like Griezmann (twice), Luis Suarez, Kieran Trippier, Llorente, De Paul, and Julian Alvarez,\" added Balague. \n\"But he also had some flops, like Joao Felix, Kalinic, Arias, Torreira, but he always worked within the club's financial limits.\n\"In total, he made 52 signings since 2017, spending around 828 million euros (\u00a3692m), leaving a big mark on Atletico's squad.

        "summary": "The prisoners were joined The Trump administration has deported 17 more alleged gang members to El Salvador, the US state department said Monday, despite legal battles over removing people to the Central American country's supermax prison.In a statement the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the deportees included members of the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs.Salvadoran officials told the BBC that there was a mix of Venezuelans and Salvadorans in the group.Earlier this month a court ordered a halt to deportations carried out under the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that has only previously been used in wartime. \"Video shows alleged gang members deported by US in El Salvador mega-jailEl Salvador has agreed to take in deportees in exchange for $6m (\u00a34.62m).Family members of some of those who were previously sent to the maximum security prison have denied that they have any gang ties.After Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to remove more than 100 Venezuelans from the US earlier this month, groups including the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward filed a legal challenge alleging the administration illegally denied the immigrants due process.In a hearing on 15 March, James Boasberg, the top federal judge in Washington DC, imposed a temporary restraining order on the use of the law and ordered deportation flights that were in the air to be turned around.However, the deportations continued. It is unclear what law was used to deport the 17 people.In a statement, Rubio said the group included \"murderers and rapists\" but did not provide names or details of the alleged crimes or of any convictions.In a post on X, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele shared a dramatically edited video showing men being loaded off of a plane and into prison cells. \"This operation is another step in the fight against terrorism and organized crime.

        "article_text": "In Jordan, a 50km pilgrimage trail follows the path of a 4th-Century nun who journeyed through the Holy Land \u2013 centuries before Spain's famed Camino de Santiago.\nThe hike begins early in the morning at Mount Nebo, a sacred mountain 610m above sea level in Jordan. On a clear day, panoramic views of the Dead Sea, Bethlehem and Jerusalem stretch across the horizon. According to the Bible, it is the last place Moses gazed upon before his death. Today, it's the first sight walkers see as they set out on their journey along the Camino de Egeria, a pilgrim route first taken by a 4th-Century nun.\u00a0\nThe view is \"magical\", says Silvano Mezzenzana, who recently undertook the three-day hike. He recalls standing atop that peak on the Moab plateau, a dry Sun fanning out over the ridges and farmland beneath, noting that it is fascinating both in the morning when the Sun lights up the Palestinian bank and the city of Jericho, and in the afternoon when the sunset draws the silhouettes of the hills of Judah up to Jerusalem. Up there, \"you do not realise that you are on a mountain\", he adds.\u00a0\nBeginning on the eastern edge of the Great Rift Valley, the 50km route winds through farmland and rugged hills \u2013 a voyage that is far greener than its European equivalent, the 800km Camino de Santiago pilgrim trail undertaken by around 500,000 people each year. Following the January announcement from Jordan and Spain of a merger twinning the Camino de Egeria with the Camino de Santiago to boost their respective cultural heritage, locals hope that the newly-renovated Middle Eastern trail can become a similar phenomenon. The goal is to highlight the significance of the eponymous Egeria, the Spanish nun believed to have travelled by donkey from Jordan through Palestine, Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia and Asia Minor to visit the holy places recounted in the Bible. She is thought to be the first woman to make the journey, which pre-dates the famed Camino de Santiago by five centuries.\u00a0\nThe hike is typically split up into three days (though can be done as quickly as in two, or a leisurely five). The terrain is not particularly challenging, but the distance \u2013 of around 17km per day \u2013 makes the hike unsuitable for total novices.\u00a0Last year, wide paths were fixed between the rocky valleys and hills along much of the route, ushering in what the Ministry of Tourism hopes will mark a new era for international interest in the country.\u00a0\nThe effort is already seeing results. \"Although I have lived in Jordan all my life, walking this trail has shown me parts of the country I've never experienced before,\" says Nadeen Dabbas. She recalls the flow of the water at the Moses Springs and the Jordan Valley, where she was surrounded by fields of bananas and corn, as moments that \"made me feel alive\".\nThe Best of 2025\nJordan was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good.\u00a0See the full list here.\nThe first major landmark on day one features a small monastery built by Egyptian monks in Moses' memory, built in the latter half of the 4th Century, enlarged a century later and rebuilt in the 6th Century to a mosaic-filled basilica that still stands today. The trail then passes through the ancient city of Livias, before reaching its showpiece on day two: Al-Maghatas, or Bethany beyond the Jordan. A Unesco World Heritage site, this is believed to be the location where Jesus was baptised by John the Baptist. Pilgrims can explore Byzantine and Roman remains of chapels, churches and monasteries, along with the cave of John the Baptist, and even \"spend the second night there in one of the pilgrim houses of Bethany, just next to the Jordan River\", explains Oscar Koshebye, a guide who helped formalise the current tourist trail. The route finishes here, or at the King Hussein Bridge at the Jordan-Israel border.\nWhile the hike offers striking natural beauty, the real draw may prove to be the woman who likely inspired it. \"Egeria's account is significant because it is one of the oldest written accounts of pilgrimage to the Holy Land that has survived \u2013 and the first incontrovertibly penned by a woman,\" says Anne McGowan, associate professor of liturgy at the Catholic Theological Union and co-author of Pilgrimage of Egeria. Egeria's work was little-known until the 1880s, McGowan adds, originally written in the form of letters to her \"sisters\" (likely holy women similar to herself). An incomplete manuscript dating to the 11th Century is currently the oldest known record of her route.\nEgeria travelled during the 4th Century, when many Christians took long-distance pilgrimages \u2013 something that fell out of favour from the 7th Century until around the mid-19th (aside from a \"blip\" in the wake of the Crusades, in the 12th-13th Centuries), McGowan explains. At that point, \"travel to the Holy Land became easier once again. Going on pilgrimage aligned well with the Romantic Era's renewed enthusiasm for the personal and the subjective on the one hand and an idealised past on the other; and Protestants as a group became more intrigued by pilgrimage possibilities connected to places associated with the life and death of Jesus in a way they hadn't been previously.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nBut now, with religious appetite dwindling (a study published\u00a0last year\u00a0found that atheists now outnumber theists in the UK), Koshebye is hoping that a new generation can be drawn in. \"We can consider it now, after centuries of abandonment, a route for tolerance between faiths, a way to improve intercultural exchange,\" he says.\u00a0\nPlan your trip\nThe Egeria Way branch office is at the Kawon bookshop in Madaba. From here, registered visitors will be taken to trail's start point, 15km away in Mount Nebo. Packages from different tour operators will soon be offered by the Egeria Way Association. Travel within Jordan is safe, though the UK Foreign Office advises against travel within 3km of the border with Syria.\nThe Spanish national and keen hiker began mulling a walking route to Jerusalem five years ago. Having already walked the Spanish Camino, he mentioned his plans to his father, who likened his son's idea to the devout Egeria \u2013 who he had never heard of. Koshebye began reading about the nun and scouring old maps in search of her original route. He later made a YouTube video about his plans, was contacted by the Jordanian tourist board, and then got in touch with the Spanish embassy in Jordan \u2013 a series of collaborative efforts that led to the merger being born.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The Wadi Rum Trail: Jordan's new long-distance hike\n\u2022 A new love for medieval-style travel\n\u2022 The pilgrimage sites of Iraq's timeless and holy cities\nKoshebye hopes that the partnership leads to a surge of interest in this three-day version of the hike and wants it to be extended a further 30km to Jerusalem, another stop on Egeria's route. Plans for signage along the Jordanian route and more guesthouses where walkers can rest in between are already afoot.\nWhile steeped in religious significance, ancient routes of this kind aren't just for those intent on retracing paths drawn by scripture, McGowan says. \"Taking a very long walk still has the capacity to pull one into an inner journey. Younger people are still spiritual seekers, even if their search is typically less closely tied to traditional religious beliefs and practices,\" she believes. \"Their pilgrimages might be more oriented toward the experience of journeying itself, as it seems Egeria's was as well; she does not so much set out on a round trip to visit one particular place, for example, as to experience as many places as possible.\"\nWith time \u2013 and a few more signposts \u2013 those involved in the project hope that Jordan's historic trail can achieve the same cultural significance as its Spanish counterpart. Mezzenzano, for one, has no doubt. \"I would not only recommend\" the trail, he enthuses, \"but I plan to repeat it\". \n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "A professor has published details of a rare \"inside-out, legless, headless wonder\" fossil from 444 million years ago, which belonged to a previously undiscovered species.\nProf Sarah Gabbott has been studying the arthropod fossil for 25 years after she found it in a small quarry in South Africa. \nHer findings, published on Thursday, reveal the discovery is very rare, as most fossils are of an animal's external features, whereas the internal organs are preserved in this case. \nProf Gabbott uncovered the fossil, which she has named Sue after her mother, at the start of her career. She had hoped to find another example in the years which followed, but had no joy. \nThe University of Leicester academic said she had decided to finally make her findings public after her mum said if she intended to name the fossil after her, she ought to \"get on and do it before she becomes a fossil herself\".\nSue was found in the Soom Shale, a band of silt and clay at a location 250 miles north of Cape Town, which was laid on the seafloor more than 440 million years ago after a devastating glaciation had wiped out about 85% of Earth's species.\nIt is believed the marine basin where the arthropod swam was somehow protected from the worst of the freezing conditions. \nThe sediments where Sue came to rest were also toxic, with no oxygen and hydrogen sulphide dissolved in the water, which the researchers suspect might have led to her unusual inside-out preservation.\nIt is, however, difficult to compare her to other fossils from the same era due to the unique way Sue was preserved. \nProf Gabbott, who is based at the university's school of geography, geology and the environment, added: \"Sue is an inside-out, legless, headless wonder. \n\"Remarkably her insides are a mineralised time-capsule: muscles, sinews, tendons and even guts all preserved in unimaginable detail. \n\"And yet her durable carapace, legs and head are missing \u2013 lost to decay over 440 million years ago.\n\"We are now sure she was a primitive marine arthropod but her precise evolutionary relationships remain frustratingly elusive.\"\nThe small quarry where the fossil was found has now virtually disappeared, which means another example is unlikely to be discovered. \nProf Gabbott said: \"This has been an ultramarathon of a research effort. In a large part because this fossil is just so beautifully preserved, there's so much anatomy there that needs interpreting. Layer upon layer of exquisite detail and complexity. \n\"I'd always hoped to find new specimens but it seems after 25 years of searching, this fossil is vanishingly rare \u2013 so I can hang on no longer. \n\"Recently my mum said to me, 'Sarah, if you are going to name this fossil after me, you'd better get on and do it before I am in the ground and fossilised myself'.\n\"I tell my mum in jest that I named the fossil Sue after her because she is a well-preserved specimen.\n\"But, in truth, I named her Sue because my mum always said I should follow a career that makes me happy \u2013 whatever that may be. \n\"For me, that is digging rocks, finding fossils and then trying to figure out how they lived and what they tell us about ancient life and evolution on Earth.\"\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

        "article_text": "Jay Springett, a tech strategist and podcast host, joined the social media app Butterflies AI out of curiosity, and ended up staying for more than six months.\nThe idea of Butterflies is to allow human and AI personas to interact.\nMr Springett's online persona developed over time, interacting with other artificial characters, and even went as far as to start its own Beanie Babies [a line of soft toys] collection.\nHe said it was like AIs were writing their own soap operas inside a simulation.\n\"I didn't engage with Butterflies in the same way I do with other platforms,\" Mr Springett told BBC.\n\"It felt more like observing than participating. I wouldn't pay for it, but it was interesting enough to keep watching.\"\nA host of social media services, like Butterflies, are trying to expand at a time when there is dissatisfaction with the social media giants.\nAccording to data from Similarweb, a digital market intelligence company, X's daily active users in the UK have dropped by nearly 25% since January 2024.\nAnd it's not just X that has been suffering, mobile and desktop traffic to Facebook has declined over the last few years according to Similarweb.\nA report by the Pew Research Centre found that a third of teens use Facebook and X, compared with three quarters a decade ago.\nBluesky is one of the social media firms gaining ground.\nOver the past year, Bluesky has gained tens of millions of new users, often at the expense of X.\nApart from just timing, though, BlueSky's success can be largely attributed to its novel architecture, which pairs an X-like experience with a high degree of customization.\nUnlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community.\nDon't like the broader discourse on Bluesky? Jump on the \"popular with friends\" feed to see what the people you follow specifically are talking about.\nIt will not be simple for Bluesky to scale up to the size of X and Facebook, says Andy Tattersall, an information specialist at the University of Sheffield.\nHe ways it will have to strike a balance between \"generating revenue, keeping users safe, and moderating content, which is much easier said than done\".\nCelebrity-backed foundation, Free Our Feeds, hopes to do that.\nIt's backed some notable names, including musician Brian Eno and actor Mark Ruffalo, and plans to raise $30m (\u00a323m) over the next three years to support an open social media ecosystem powered by the AT Protocol, the decentralized network powering Bluesky.\n\"Bluesky has created a strong foundation for shared social media infrastructure,\" says Robin Berjonone, one of Free Our Feeds' nine custodians, \"but so long as they are the primary operator of this infrastructure the risk remains that it will stop operating in the public interest\".\nA bigger worry for these emerging platforms, though, is the network barrier. This can be summed up with Metcalfe's Law, explains Evan Prodromou, co-author and current editor of ActivityPub, another open social media architecture, which is behind popular platforms like Meta's Threads.\nThe law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services.\nNon-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe's Law.\nThey hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services. \nInstead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them.\nThreads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance.\nUsing this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms.\nIt's not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol.\nBut there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech.\n\"One thing we've learnt from the past decades is that the last thing the world needs is a one-size-fits all solution for eight billion people,\" says Robin Berjon, one of Free Our Feeds' custodians.\nAt the other end of the spectrum are those that want to carve a niche out for themselves, rather than replace the incumbents.\nIn the last couple of years, a cottage industry of unique, new social apps has cropped.\nOne of those is Mozi, created by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. Mozi doesn't want you to socialise online at all.\nInstead it informs you when you're going to be in the same place (city or event) as someone you know and encourages you to connect with people more often in person.\n\"Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,\" says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson.\nMike McCue, the CEO of Flipboard, is convinced such innovation will result in a new era of social networking, where numerous new, more interesting types of social networks will emerge and offer people more choices.\nHe hopes that Flipboard's app, Surf will help people manage a messy social media ecosystem.

Instead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them.Threads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance.Using this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms.It's not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol.But there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech. \"Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,\" says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson.Mike McCue, the CEO of Flipboard, is convinced such innovation will result in a new era of social networking, where numerous new, more interesting types of social networks will emerge and offer people more choices.He hopes that Flipboard's app, Surf will help people manage a messy social media ecosystem.

        "article_text": "It's mentioned 17 times in the Bible and was harvested in the Mediterranean for more than a millennium. Now, a farmer is reviving this ancient \"superfood\".\nIt's a hot and muggy summer day in Sicily's Madonie mountains, a rugged range of ridges about 65km east of Palermo. In a field of ash trees, the buzzing of cicadas is interrupted by a voice. \"You came at the right time,\" says Giulio Gelardi, a local farmer pointing towards a white-streaked branch. \"This is the famous manna.\"\nAlong the bark of each tree are thick lines of manna, a white mineral-rich resin referenced in the Bible 17 times that has been used as a natural sweetener and medicinal aid for centuries. Manna harvesting (the practice of cutting the bark of Fraxinus ornus trees to collect their sap), used to be a common practice throughout the Mediterranean. But in the past 80 years, urbanisation and industrialisation have led to it nearly vanishing.\nFor the past 30 years, Gelardi has made it his mission to put this Biblical superfood back on our tables, and today, this once-forgotten sap is being used by chefs and pastry makers in innovative ways.\nEven if you've never tasted manna, you may have heard of it. The phrase \"manna from heaven\" refers to a Biblical story where a food falls from the sky to nourish the Israelites as they crossed the Sinai desert. In Exodus, manna is described as a \"flaky substance as fine as frost blanketed on the ground\". While experts disagree what substance, specifically, this passage refers to, a honey-like, flaky and frost-coloured resin named manna has been extracted from the bark of ash trees in the Mediterranean region for more than a millennium.\nIn the Madonie mountains \u2013 home to the 40,000-hectare Madonie Natural Park \u2013 manna harvesting dates back to at least the 9th Century when the island was under Arab rule. During the Renaissance, Sicilian farmers used to collect this sweet sap \u2013 which tastes like cane sugar with almond undertones \u2013 and sell it to merchants from around the Mediterranean, a highly profitable trade that led the Kingdom of Naples to put taxes on it during the 16th Century.\nUntil World War Two, manna farming was a way of life for many Sicilian families. Footage from 1936 shows local farmers harvesting the substance, which was commonly sold to pharmaceutical companies to extract mannitol, a sugar alcohol used as a sweetener and a diuretic. In the 1950s, scientists found a way to synthesise mannitol, and in the decades that followed, manna harvesting virtually disappeared.\nWhen Gelardi came back to his hometown of Pollina in 1985 after 15 years away, he realised that one of the core components of his local culture was vanishing. \"When I was growing up, everyone knew how to extract manna,\" he explains. \"When I came back, there were less than 100 farmers who could still do it.\"\nPollina is a 3,000-person medieval town that seems sculpted out of the surrounding limestone hills. As a child, Gelardi learned to harvest manna in the summer from his parents. \"Manna harvesting involved the whole family,\" he explains. Men used handmade billhooks to make thin cuts along the bark, women collected the overflowing sap using dried prickly pear stems and children turned the goopy nectar into cylindrical cones called cannoli, due to their resemblance to the popular Sicilian sweet.\nAccording to Gelardi, the hardest part of manna harvesting is knowing when to cut the bark. Ash trees produce sap year-round but only produce enough resin to harvest during the hottest days of the year. Gelardi says if you cut the bark too early, it can cause the trees to stop making manna altogether. \"Finding out when the moment for cutting has come is a unique skill based on observation and intuition,\" he says, explaining: \"[It's necessary to] listen to each plant.\"\nFor example, leaves turning from dark green to lighter green with yellow marks may mean that a tree has reached peak manna production. Spotting cracks in the ground near the roots can also mean it's ready for harvest, as plants produce surplus sap to overcome dry spells. When the tree looks ready, manna farmers make a shallow cut in the bark and observe the plant's reaction. If a plant is mature enough, a small amount of resin will ooze from the cut. Farmers can then proceed to make deeper carvings, as small streams of sticky manna will flow towards the roots.\n\"Manna harvesting is not something you can learn from a book,\" Gelardi explains. \"If we don't pass these skills down to the next generation, we would lose centuries-old local farming knowledge.\"\nA few months after returning to Pollina, Gelardi set out to revive the waning tradition. At first, most locals did not meet his \"manna renaissance\" with enthusiasm. \"My friends thought I was crazy. They said manna was a thing of the past,\" he says. Undeterred, Gerardi spent months learning all he could about it.\u00a0\nHe spent time with elder farmers to refine his harvesting skills and visited Palermo's public library to study manna. \"I knew manna was used locally as a sweetener, a moisturiser and a diuretic,\" he says. \"But I learned that it could also be used to treat food intoxication, a variety of skin conditions, arthritis and cold symptoms.\"\nGelardi also started to realise how manna shaped local geography and culture. For example, Gibilmanna, a nearby hill home to a famous sanctuary, owes its name to the Arab words \"gibil\" (mountain) and \"manna\". Local expressions are also shaped by manna, like the local phrase, \"vivere di mieli e manna\" (\"to live of honey and manna\"), meaning living an affluent life.\nIn 1986 Gelardi began handing out pamphlets containing facts about manna to tourists staying at a nearby resort. \"People were captivated by manna's\u00a0healing properties and its impact on local culture,\" he recalls. By the 1990s, he was leading tours demonstrating how to harvest manna to international travellers. \"They started to see it as our local superfood,\" he says.\nManna is mostly composed of mannitol, a naturally sweet crystal compound,\u00a0as well as minerals like potassium, magnesium and calcium. According to Vivienne Spadaro, a professor of botany at the University of Palermo, this thick white resin can be used as a dietary supplement to reintegrate minerals, especially potassium, and as a base for several medicines. \"Manna has been used to treat constipation, cough, sore-throats and skin wounds due to its decongestant and soothing properties,\" she says. And because of its\u00a0low glycemic index, Spadaro says some manna can be used as a sweetener for diabetic people or those on hypo-caloric diets.\nWhere to find manna\nIn addition to Hostaria Cycas and Nangalarruni, look for manna at La Manna di Zabbra. This family-owned B&B and restaurant in Pollina offers a salad of local edible flowers sprinkled with manna flakes as well as jams. If you visit between July and August, you can witness the century-old process of manna harvesting in the family\u2019s ash tree field.\nWhile leading manna tours, Gelardi developed a more efficient way to harvest the substance with far less risk of contamination from bark or insects. He created a \"clean manna\" technique by attaching a small aluminum spout to the tree so that manna flows away from the trunk along a fishing line attached to the spout. This allowed Gelardi to nearly double his manna production.\nIn the following years, Gelardi started selling his manna to bakers and pastry chefs, who incorporated it into everything from cannoli, wafers, flakes and chocolates.\u00a0He also sold manna to pharmacies to make laxatives, minerals supplements and skin products. In recent years French skincare companies Biotherm and Yves Roche have used it to make skin moisturisers.\u00a0\nIn 2002, manna from the Madonie was declared a protected ingredient by Slow Food, an international organisation that promotes endangered food traditions. By the mid-2000s, manna became a sought-after ingredient for local chefs and pastry-makers.\n\"I started using manna to make pandolce (fruitcake) with manna and almonds, but then realised it goes well with savoury dishes, too,\" says Giuseppe Zingales, chef at Hostaria Cycas in the nearby medieval village of Castelbuono. The restaurant offers many manna-infused dishes, including manna-crusted pork tenderloin; risotto with asparagus, bacon and manna; and wild thistle flan with manna fondue. At another Castelbuono eatery, Ristorante Nangalarruni, chefs Peppe Carollo and his daughter Francesca use crushed manna to create one of the restaurant's signature dishes: suckling pig with almonds, pistachio and manna crust.\n\"The key is to [use] it well,\" Francesca Carollo explains, \"A small portion of sweet-tasting manna offers a nice contrast to roast meat flavour, but too much manna can make this dish too sweet.\"\nPastry chefs are particularly interested in manna. Nicola Fiasconaro, one of Italy's most famous patissiers, now produces a special edition of panettone, Italy's traditional Christmas fruitcake, made with chocolate and frosted manna, while Michelin-starred chef Davide Oldani featured chocolate-covered manna sticks as part of the menu of his Milan-area restaurant D'O from 2014 to 2016. In recent years, the Madonie's \"white gold\", as it is sometimes called, has reached a price of \u20ac200 per kg and has been used to make a variety of sugar-free baked goods, from muffins to biscotti.\nMost chefs buy manna from the Madonie's Manna Consortium, a cooperative created in 2015 by Gerardi and other farmers to market manna products and promote manna harvesting to younger farmers.\n\"I grew up hearing about manna but had never learned how to harvest it,\" says Mario Cicero, who belongs to the Consortium. Born in Castelbuono, he spent years working around the world as a chef before returning to the Madonie. As part of his training, Cicero spent months with older farmers, including Gerardi. \"Giulio's taught me many tricks,\" he says, \"but he mostly passed on a contagious passion for manna harvesting.\" Cicero now tends 200 ash trees in his farm near Castelbuono and hopes that more young people will take up manna harvesting.\nSeeing young farmers like Cicero becoming ntaccaluori (Sicilian for \"cutters\") is what Gelardi is most proud about. As he explains: \"Every young person that learns how to harvest manna will ensure the survival of a centuries-old tradition.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Countries around the world are braced for Donald Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day in America!!!\" next week.\nThe US president's deadline to impose reciprocal tariffs on trading partners will come just days after he hit foreign carmakers with 25% import taxes.\nVietnam could be particularly vulnerable to Trump's latest salvo of levies. It has a large trade deficit with the US and has been a beneficiary of firms moving factories out of China to avoid measures announced during his first term in office.\nWhile some countries have hit back at Washington, Vietnam's Prime Minister, Pham Minh Chinh, has suggested that he may take a more diplomatic approach.\nSpeaking in January, he said he was willing to visit Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and \"golf all day long\" if it benefits his country, drawing laughter in the room.\nAnd that idea may not be too far-fetched. The Trump Organization is planning to invest billions of dollars in golf courses, hotels and real estate in Vietnam, according to the Reuters news agency.\nThe first project will reportedly be a residential complex with three 18-hole golf courses, which will break ground in May. \nThe BBC has contacted the company and its Vietnamese partner for comment.\nBut could golf diplomacy really work?\nTrump has previously said Vietnam was \"worse than China\" and \"almost the single worst abuser of anybody\". \nBut he has not yet specifically targeted Vietnam with tariffs, even though it has the third largest trade deficit with the US, after China and Mexico. \nAnalysts say Vietnam is doing well at engaging with Washington - but its efforts may still not be enough to avoid most of Trump's tariff plans.\n\"The Vietnam PM seems to be taking a page from the book of [former Japanese PM] Shinzo Abe, who built a close personal relationship with Trump over their shared love of golf,\" said Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator.\n\"I would not however expect any special treatment of Vietnam from a policy point of view. Personal relationships are important to Trump, but in this case, I believe his desire to appear tough on trade will win out.\"\nVietnam has said it doesn't plan to \"restrict trade\" with the US, although it currently taxes some imports from there.\nThe government said this week that it will allow SpaceX, which is owned by close Trump ally Elon Musk, to operate its Starlink satellite internet service in the country on a trial basis.\nSome analysts see this as one of the measures Vietnam has taken to avoid being hit with US tariffs.\nHanoi also said it will lower tariffs on several US imports, including energy and cars, a move aimed at \"improving trade balances\".\nIt came less than two weeks after Vietnamese and US companies signed more than $4bn (\u00a35.4bn) in deals, in areas including oil and gas exploration.\nSteve Norris from the consultancy Control Risks said \"Vietnam is being careful to avoid any moves which would signal any non-cooperation on trade issues\".\nThis strategy is in line with its foreign policy approach - known as \"bamboo diplomacy\". Like shoots of plants that sway with the wind, Vietnam hopes to be adaptable to foreign pressures.\n\"If the US were to increase pressure on Vietnam, the government might respond with offers to facilitate investments in the hospitality and casino industries, undertake advanced machinery purchases, and \u2013 capturing the moment \u2013 consider access to Vietnam's rare earth minerals,\" Mr Norris said.\nOne big factor working against Vietnam is concerns about China's influence.\nVietnam was one of the biggest beneficiaries of US-China tensions during Trump's first term.\nIn 2018, he hit China with tariffs, causing some businesses to rethink where they made their products. Some chose to shift manufacturing to Vietnam. \nThis has led to an increase of exports from Vietnam to the US, with Chinese companies that have moved production there contributing to that figure.\nFormer US trade negotiator Wendy Cutler said Vietnam has emerged as a \"destination for major Chinese investment\".\nWhile the US remains Vietnam's biggest export market, China is its largest supplier of goods, accounting for more than a third of imports, according to the latest official data. \nChinese firms were also behind nearly one in every three new investments in Vietnam last year.\n\"These are huge red flags for Trump. My expectation is that Vietnam will at some point be hit hard by tariffs,\" Mr Olson said.\nHowever, tariffs on Vietnam could impact US businesses such as tech firms Apple and Intel, and sportswear giant Nike, which have moved production lines from China to Vietnam.\nA recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam found that most US manufacturers there expect to lay off staff if tariffs are imposed.\nThe US president believes the levies will boost his country's economy by encouraging more businesses to make goods in the US and bring in billions of dollars of taxes. \nBut many economists have warned that it could force up prices for American consumers and negatively impact global trade.\nWashington is also concerned about so-called \"trans-shipments\" - Chinese goods passing through Vietnam on their way to other countries. \nUS officials have been \"quietly stressing to Vietnam that it must reduce its trade surplus over time and combat the trans-shipment of Chinese goods through the country,\" Mr Norris said.\nVietnam's prime minister has said he is confident that his administration can \"handle the relationship with the US\".\nNow that the South East Asian nation has cut some tariffs on US goods they may be more attractive to Vietnamese consumers, increasing America's share of trade with the country.\nAnd then there is golf - playing a game with Trump had worked for the late Japanese leader Shinzo Abe.\nAbe and Trump established a friendship, which included many golf games over several years. The friendship arguably helped Abe secure tariff exemptions for Japan's critical car industry at the time.\nFor now, it is unclear if Vietnam would really give golf diplomacy a swing.\nThe real test will come next week, when a new slate of Trump's taxes are set to take effect.

        "article_text": "Some coach operators say they will no longer visit a village in the Cotswolds due to new \"ill-thought-through\" drop-off and parking zones.\nA coach ban was considered in Bourton-on-the-Water after it became \"choked\" with vehicles when a private car park stopped accepting coaches in December 2023.\nBusinesses argued an outright ban would cost them money, and now a trial will see a drop-off point created. However, some operators fear the Meadow Way location is \"not safe\" and is too far to walk to the village centre.\nGloucestershire County Council insists the walk is \"short\", saying feedback will be \"welcome\" during the trial as it will be able to \"make changes\".\nThe six-month trial is set to begin around Easter and will allow coaches to stop at Meadow Way for 10 minutes to drop off and pick up passengers. Parking will then be available at the Pulhams Coaches site between 09:00 and 16:00 each day.\nA long-term plan is in the works, which would involve coaches parking in Cotswold School, although it has yet to be confirmed.\nArea director at Pulhams, Alex Chutter, said he is optimistic about the trial.\n\"It's welcome relief really,\" he said.\n\"I think there was a level of uncertainty in previous seasons and at least operators now know what the plans are and what options they have available. \n\"Hopefully that can entice them back to the area.\"\nThe council has shared Mr Chutter's hopes the scheme will encourage coach companies who stopped offering trips to Bourton-on-the-Water to return.\nHowever, multiple firms told the BBC they are not convinced by the plans.\nJason Edwards is the deputy chair of the Coach Tourism Association, a trade body representing coach tour operators. \nHe said: \"In a sort of way, it's a positive step because they have realised how important tourism is. But do we think they have got it right, no we don't.\"\nHe said the biggest sticking point is the 0.7 mile (1.1km) distance between the proposed drop-off point and the village's shops and attractions, particularly for older customers.\n\"We've got a higher-end age demographic, certainly when it comes to UK domestic coach passengers,\" he said.\n\"And for them to have a 15 to 20-minute walk, laden with shopping bags, with the British weather as unpredictable as it is, it just wouldn't work.\"\n\"They vote with their feet,\" he added. \"If there is any problems with walking distance or not having weatherproof facilities, they won't book that trip.\"\nMr Edwards, from South Wales, also runs his own coach tour business which offers tours to the Cotswolds. \n\"We dropped Bourton-on-the-Water completely,\" he said. \"We went to Stow-on-the-Wold and other areas around the Cotswolds.\n\"We wouldn't want to expose our customers to areas that aren't coach-friendly or welcoming. It has a detrimental effect to our business.\"\nHe said many operators represented by the Coach Travel Association also made the decision to avoid Bourton-on-the-Water or reduce the frequency of trips there.\nAmong the operators who continued to visit the village regularly last year was Middleton Tours. \nBut the firm said it had been forced to rethink its plans due to concerns over the trial and a recent incident where a resident shouted at one of its tour guides and passengers.\nTour manager Richard Smith said: \"The site that they have chosen is right at the junction so it's not safe. \n\"There is no shelter and no signage. There is apparently the provision for three coaches. Anybody that knows Bourton-on-the-Water, particularly during the main season, knows how busy it can get.\n\"It's ill-thought-through and could be prone to operational disasters. Until there is a  solution that works for the customer and coach operators, we have made the decision not to return to Bourton-on-the-Water.\"\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Gloucestershire County Council said the trial will give coaches a \"dedicated area\" to drop off and pick up customers which is a \"short walk\" from the centre of the village.\n\"The parish council would welcome feedback on the scheme from residents, visitors and coach operators,\" they added.\n\"The county council will be able to make changes to the scheme during the trial to ensure the best possible results.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "Richard Chamberlain, who has died today at the age of 90, shot to fame as TV heartthrob Dr Kildare in the 1960s.\nHis dashing good looks won him legions of female fans, and guaranteed him work in a plethora of rather forgettable television movies.\nBut, in middle age, his career spiked again.\nChamberlain became king of the 1980's TV mini-series: playing a western prisoner in Shogun and a catholic priest tempted by love in The Thorn Birds.\nHe denied being gay when confronted by a French magazine in 1989, and did not speak publicly about his homosexuality until he turned 70.\nIn interviews promoting his 2003 memoir, he advised other handsome leading actors to keep their sexuality to themselves.\n\"There's still a tremendous amount of homophobia in our culture,\" he said. \"Please, don't pretend that we're suddenly all wonderfully, blissfully accepted.\"\nGeorge Richard Chamberlain was born on 31 March 1934, in Beverly Hills, California. He died one day before his 91st birthday.\nHis salesman father had a problem with drink, which affected young Richard's childhood. He described himself as a \"shy, serious, lugubrious kid, painfully thin, with a long, sad face\".\nHe admitted to being the most \"uncooperative kid in school\" but discovered a taste and a talent for athletics. \nAt Pomona College, he was bitten by the acting bug - and a role in Bernard Shaw's Arms and the Man convinced him he had found his calling.\nParamount Studios was interested in him, but thoughts of an acting career were put on hold after he was called up, serving 16 months with the US Army, rising to the rank of sergeant while stationed in Korea.\nOn his discharge, he made a number of cameos in TV shows, including an episode of the popular Western, Gunsmoke.\nNot everyone had Chamberlain picked as a future star.\nHe was handsome enough: with profiles at the time gushing over his \"fine-lined aristocratic face, suggesting a young Florentine noble - straight out of the Renaissance\".\nBut, he was naturally diffident - which worked in his favour when he auditioned to play Dr James Kildare, a medical intern struggling to learn his profession, in NBC's new primetime medical drama. \n\"Perhaps it was inevitable,\" said one friend-and-rival. \"Who else could look so anti-sceptic as Dick?\"\nThe series ran for nearly 200 programmes across five seasons.\nIt broke new ground, by raising matters such as drug addiction - which had not previously been shown on US TV.\nThere was a huge reaction from female fans.\nChamberlain got 12,000 letters a week. In Pittsburgh, 450,000 people turned out to see him at a parade, and in New York, he nearly caused a riot when a child spotted him and called his name. \nThe studio made the most of this attention, releasing novels, comics and games featuring Chamberlain's image.\nFans would even write in asking \"Dr Kildare\" to solve their various medical problems. \nAnd Chamberlain had an unlikely hit single: Three Stars Will Shine Tonight, where romantic words were added to the show's distinctive opening theme tune.\nHe won a Golden Globe Award for best TV actor in 1963. But, three years later audiences began to wane, and NBC pulled the plug.\nNow an international star, Chamberlain struggled to leave Kildare behind. \nIn 1966, he hoped to break into films, but reviews slated his performance in the light romantic comedy, Joy in the Morning.\nAudiences, they said, laughed in \"all the wrong places\". So, he resolved to ignore Hollywood and make a living on the stage. \nHe got off to a rocky start when a musical version of Breakfast at Tiffany's - in which he starred opposite Mary Tyler Moore - closed after just four shows.\nThe production is still seen as one of Broadway's biggest ever turkeys. But a move to England gave him a chance of reinventing himself as a 'serious actor.' \nIn 1967, there were starring roles in Henry James' Portrait of a Lady and opposite Katherine Hepburn in a satirical comedy called The Madwoman of Chaillot.\nAnd, two years later, he became the first American to play Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre since the great John Barrymore in 1925.\nThis time, the reviews were excellent and he revisited the role of Denmark's most tortured prince for a television version for Hallmark. \nBut Chamberlain was cast as Tchaikovsky in Ken Russell's overblown biopic, The Music Lovers, in which he starred opposite Glenda Jackson. \nThe critics rubbished the film, in which great play was made of the relationship between a composer with repressed homosexual tendencies and his nymphomaniac wife, although it later became something of a cult success.\nChamberlain went on to play Lord Byron opposite Sarah Miles in Lady Caroline Lamb and the swashbuckling French swordsman Aramis in Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers.\nHe also appeared - along with half of Hollywood - in the Towering Inferno, as a crooked electrical engineer whose corner-cutting leads to the spectacular destruction of a 138 floor building. \nIn 1977, the TV series Roots - set in the era of American slavery - drew huge audiences and was nominated for nearly 40 Emmy awards.\nIt sparked a revival of the mini-series which drew Chamberlain back to television.\nHe beat Roger Moore and Albert Finney to be cast as John Blackthorn - a captive English navigator in 17th Century Japan - in Shogun.\nThe series was shown on NBC over five nights in 1980, with audiences reaching nearly 30 million.  \nHaving won a Golden Globe, Chamberlain then picked up another as Father Ralph de Bricassart in The Thorn Birds, a priest torn between God and his sexual longing afor the actress, Rachel Ward.\nIt was even more successful than Shogun, winning an audience of 60% of television viewers and 16 Emmy nominations.\nIn the 1990s, Chamberlain's career began to wane.\nThere were a succession of solid, rather than outstanding, performances in made-for-TV films and endless guest appearances in other people's shows.\nThese included a sequel to The Thorn Birds called The Missing Years, with Amanda Donohoe replacing Rachel Ward.\nIn 2003, long after he had stopped playing romantic leading men, Chamberlain published his biography Shattered Love, in which, for the first time, he confirmed he was gay.\nDespite a relationship of more than 30 years with the actor and director Martin Rabbett, with whom he'd once starred in the film Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, they had kept their private life private.\n\"I thought there was something very, very deeply wrong with me,\" he said, \"and I wanted to cover it up. I remember making a pact with myself that I would never, ever reveal this secret, ever.\"\nChamberlain and Rabbett went their separate ways in 2010.\nIn later years, Chamberlain was happy to play a gay man, notably in Desperate Housewives and Will & Grace. \nHe continued to perform in musical theatre, including touring productions of Spamalot, My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music.\nBut he never regretted hiding his sexuality to protect his career.\n\"I would have been a happier person being out of the closet and being free,\" he told El Pais in 2024. \"But I had other motives that made me happy. I was a working actor and for me, that was most important.\"\nHe will be remembered as the king of the TV mini-series: the dashing leading man in everything from Dr Kildare to The Thorn Birds.\nDespite attempts to reinvent himself as a serious stage actor, he was at his best on the small screen, entertaining millions watching at home on the sofa.\nFor, although there were always better actors than Richard Chamberlain, few rivalled his ability to hold a television audience.",

        "article_text": "South Africa's former ambassador to the US has told the BBC it was \"self-evident\" that there was racism within the Trump administration.\nEbrahim Rasool, 62, was ordered to leave the US last week after Secretary of State Marco Rubio called him a \"race-baiting politician who hates America\". \nThis came after Rasool accused US President Donald Trump of trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\".\nAsked by the BBC's Newshour whether he believed the Trump administration was racist, Rasool said: \"I think it is self-evident rather than anyone needing to be called out.\"\nThe BBC has approached the White House for comment.\nIn one of his first interviews since being expelled from the US, Rasool added: \"I'm saying when a piece of wood has a hinge, you begin to suspect it's a door.\" \nThe diplomat cited the administration's emphasis on deporting migrants as well as the targeting of foreign students who had supported pro-Palestinian protests. He also accused Trump's team of mobilising \"certain far-right communities\".\nThe Trump administration has denied accusations of racism. The president says he has a mandate to deport thousands of migrants who entered the US illegally after it formed a central part of his election campaign last year. Rubio has defended revoking visas for students who \"cause chaos\" on college campuses.\nUS-South Africa relations have deteriorated sharply since Trump returned to power in mid-January. \nSince taking office, Trump and his ally, South-Africa born Elon Musk, have singled out South Africa, in particular criticising it over its land reform policies.\nTrump has cut all aid to the country and, despite his hard-line stance on most refugees and asylum seekers, says that members of South Africa's white, Afrikaner community would be granted refugee status in the US because of the persecution he says they face at home. \nSouth Africa's government says it is trying to correct the country's racial and economic imbalances following decades of white-minority rule by passing measures to help the country's black majority.\nRasool denied that the Afrikaner population was facing discrimination.\n\"It is an unadulterated lie because it tries to besmirch the very DNA of a new South Africa that was born under the leadership of someone like Nelson Mandela,\" he told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme.\nWhen questioned whether his language was undiplomatic, Rasool said: \"It's not as if being a good boy warded off any punishment. It was that at some point South Africa's dignity is also at stake - you can't smile through too many untruths being told about your country.\"\nAfter returning home to a hero's welcome on Sunday, Rasool said that he had no regrets about his remarks. \nAsked whether he was surprised by the reaction to his remarks, Rasool said he was surprised by the \"thinness of the skin\" of the US administration and its \"ability to dish out and not to accept an intellectual dissecting of what is [said]\".\nHe added: \"We've smiled through a lie about white genocide, we've smiled through the punishment of cutting all aid... we've smiled through all of that. \n\"We've tried all the conventional ways to get [to] them, until you hit a brick wall and you begin to say: This is not the normal phenomenon of diplomacy.\"\nWhile he accepted that his role as a diplomat was to try and \"maintain a line of communication\", Rasool said: \"Diplomacy is not to flatter your host into into liking you. Diplomacy is not lying along and making as if lies are truth. \n\"I think what I did was to the best of my intellectual capacity to describe a phenomenon back home in order for me to alert them that it cannot be business as usual.\"\nRelations between the US and South Africa, characterised by ups and downs over the years, hit rock bottom earlier this year, with Trump's cutting of aid to the country, citing the new Expropriation Law, which allows the government to confiscate land without compensation in certain circumstances.\nAnother bone of contention for the US has been the case lodged by South Africa against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in December 2023.\nSouth Africa has accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians living in Gaza, an allegation Israel denies.\nRasool returned to the US last year, having previously served as US ambassador from 2010 to 2015, when Barack Obama was president.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

Napoli. Lazio. Roma. These institutions roll off the tongue.\nFor many English fans of Italian football, particularly those whose love of calcio can be traced back to Channel 4's 'Football Italia', Sampdoria belong on that list.\nIn the decade between 1984 and 1994 Sampdoria won six major titles, while modern greats Trevor Francis, Roberto Mancini, Gianluca Vialli, Ruud Gullit and David Platt all wore the club's iconic strip.\nThe Blucerchiati of that period acquired a cultural cachet that was hard to match.\nYet Sampdoria now find themselves struggling in Serie B - and facing the real threat of relegation to the third tier for the first time.\nWhere did it all go wrong?\nUnusually for a club with such a large cult following, Sampdoria are a relative newcomer to the Italian football landscape.\nThe northern Italian port city of Genoa has a proud footballing heritage -Sampdoria's city rivals Genoa Cricket and Football Club were founded in 1893 and are the oldest active team in Italy.\nThe most recent of Genoa's nine top-flight titles came 21 years before Sampdoria were formed in 1946, following a merger of middling Genoese clubs Sampierdarenese and Andrea Doria.\nThat unification produced their iconic home shirts - the blue represents Andrea Doria while the white, red and black mid-section came from Sampierdarenese.\nSampdoria have always shared a ground - the Stadio Luigi Ferraris - with neighbours Genoa, but for 38 years did not enjoy the kind of success befitting of one of Italy's grandest arenas. Everything changed in 1984.\nBefore the 1984-85 season, Sampdoria's only honour was the 1966-67 second division title.\nYet over the next decade, the club won the Coppa Italia four times - more than any other side during that period - were crowned Serie A champions, won the European Cup Winners' Cup and played in a European Cup final.\nAfter assuming the club presidency in 1979, Paolo Mantovani was the man who turned an unfashionable mid-table team into serial winners.\nHaving made his money in the oil business, Mantovani spent heavily but smartly to propel Sampdoria to unprecedented heights.\nBig names like Francis, Graeme Souness and Liam Brady were signed, but it was the recruitment of some of the best young Italian talents that really paid off.\nA 17-year-old Mancini arrived from Bologna in 1982, followed two years later by a 19-year-old Vialli from Cremonese.\nNicknamed the 'goal twins' because of their prolific attacking partnership, both scored in the second leg of the 1984-95 Coppa Italia final, the first major title in Sampdoria's history.\nMancini and Vialli first met at 16 playing for Italy's youth teams and formed a close friendship that characterised the unity in the Sampdoria squad.\n\"We have a relationship that goes way beyond friendship,\" Mancini said before Vialli's death from pancreatic cancer in 2023. \"He's almost like a brother to me.\"\nAlong with goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca, defender Pietro Vierchowod, attacking right-back Moreno Mannini, midfield anchor Fausto Pari and electric winger Attilio Lombardo, the duo formed the backbone of a team that won three more Coppa Italia titles - and the club's first and only Scudetto in 1990-91 under legendary manager Vujadin Boskov.\n\"Mantovani cultivated a remarkable camaraderie among a uniquely talented group,\" says Italian football writer Stephen Kasiewicz.\n\"Despite more lucrative offers the core of the team stayed together.\"\nBoskov's side won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1990, while only a Ronald Koeman free-kick saw them lose to Johan Cruyff's Barcelona 'dream team' in the European Cup final two years later.\nBut nothing lasts forever.\nSampdoria won six major titles between 1984 and 1994\nMantovani's death in 1993 was \"the beginning of the end at Sampdoria\", according to Italian football journalist David Ferrini.\nHe added: \"Mantovani's reign attracted talent and kept them happy in Genoa, but his passing - combined with the hangover of the Scudetto success - meant that Sampdoria's best players became prime transfer targets.\"\nIn 1992 they had lost Vialli to Juventus for a then-world record \u00a312m, while Inter Milan paid \u00a37m for Pagliuca in 1994, a record for a goalkeeper at the time. \nVierchowod joined Juventus 12 months later before Mancini followed Sven Goran Eriksson - who had replaced Boskov as manager in 1992 - to Lazio in 1997.\nExperienced stars like Gullit and Platt joined for brief spells, but Sampdoria no longer had the same appeal they once did.\nEnrico Mantovani took over as president but failed to replicate his father's success - and a steady decline followed the Coppa Italia triumph of 1993-94. In 1999 the club were relegated to Serie B.\nThings improved under the presidency of local entrepreneur Riccardo Garrone, who guided the club back to Serie A in 2003 and signed future cult heroes Fabio Quagliarella and Antonio Cassano.\nYet the highlights of the 21st Century have been losing the Coppa Italia final in 2008-09 and a fourth-place league finish the following year. \nOutspoken film producer Massimo Ferrero bought the club in 2014 - taking on its growing debts - but what followed was seven years of selling their best players, spending little on replacements and flirting with relegation on a regular basis.\n\"He seemed more concerned with bolstering his own image, as the bizarre star of his own one-man reality football show, than making sure Samp prospered,\" says Kasiewicz.\nIn December 2021 Ferrero was arrested and jailed as part of an investigation into corporate crimes and bankruptcy, unrelated to the club. He resigned as president.\n\"The club effectively ceased to function. It's been like a house of cards,\" says Nima Tavallaey, Italian football journalist and co-host of The Italian Football Podcast.\nWith no funds available and Ferrero refusing to relinquish control, Sampdoria narrowly avoided relegation from Serie A in 2022. But in 2023 they did go down, amid reports of unpaid player wages.\nWith the club staring down the barrel of bankruptcy and demotion to the fourth tier, a consortium led by former Leeds United owner Andrea Radrizzani and London-based financier Matteo Manfredi - and his company Gestio Capital - bought the club, though Radrizzani has since divested his shares.\nGestio Capital say they and their investors now own 99.96% of the club and deny reports in Genovese newspaper Il Secolo XIX, external that Singaporean businessman Joseph Tey Wei Jin - named in the 2015 Panama Papers - actually owns the majority of shares through his company Kickoff Ventures.\nMatteo Manfredi has invested significantly since becoming Sampdoria owner\nItalian World Cup winner Andrea Pirlo was hired as coach in 2023-24. \nAfter a dismal start to the campaign his side won seven of their final 11 games to secure a seventh-place finish in Serie B and a spot in the promotion play-offs, where they lost 2-0 to Palermo in the preliminary round.\nGestio invested about \u00a345m during their first season, but things have not gone according to plan this term.\nThe month before Sampdoria's play-off exit Manfredi had described Pirlo as \"a key part of the project\" - yet three games into the current campaign he was dismissed following two defeats and a draw.\nAndrea Sottil replaced him and, although he oversaw a Coppa Italia penalty shootout victory against Genoa in the first Derby della Lanterna in two years, he was jettisoned too after just four wins in 14 games. \nLeonardo Semplici arrived in December and remains in position despite overseeing just two wins in 14 league games, both coming at the start of February.\nSampdoria find themselves 16th in the table - the final relegation play-off spot - with eight games left to play, and just two points above automatic relegation.\nAs things stand, a two-legged play-off will decide if they sink to the third tier for the first time.\n\"Dropping down into Serie C is unthinkable after all the efforts to keep the club in business,\" says Ferrini.\n\"Manfredi won't want to go down in history as the owner who took them down into the third division.\"\nFor Tavallaey, just avoiding relegation won't be enough.\n\"They have to build a proper project with a proper sporting directorship and a proper manager to help them back to Serie A.

She had hoped to find another example in the years which followed, but had no joy. \nThe University of Leicester academic said she had decided to finally make her findings public after her mum said if she intended to name the fossil after her, she ought to \"get on and do it before she becomes a fossil herself\".\nSue was found in the Soom Shale, a band of silt and clay at a location 250 miles north of Cape Town, which was laid on the seafloor more than 440 million years ago after a devastating glaciation had wiped out about 85% of Earth's species.\nIt is believed the marine basin where the arthropod swam was somehow protected from the worst of the freezing conditions. \nThe sediments where Sue came to rest were also toxic, with no oxygen and hydrogen sulphide dissolved in the water, which the researchers suspect might have led to her unusual inside-out preservation.\nIt is, however, difficult to compare her to other fossils from the same era due to the unique way Sue was preserved. \nProf Gabbott, who is based at the university's school of geography, geology and the environment, added: \"Sue is an inside-out, legless, headless wonder. \n\"Remarkably her insides are a mineralised time-capsule: muscles, sinews, tendons and even guts all preserved in unimaginable detail. \n\"And yet her durable carapace, legs and head are missing \u2013 lost to decay over 440 million years ago.\n\"We are now sure she was a primitive marine arthropod but her precise evolutionary relationships remain frustratingly elusive.\"\nThe small quarry where the fossil was found has now virtually disappeared, which means another example is unlikely to be discovered. \nProf Gabbott said: \"This has been an ultramarathon of a research effort. In a large part because this fossil is just so beautifully preserved, there's so much anatomy there that needs interpreting. Layer upon layer of exquisite detail and complexity. \n\"I'd always hoped to find new specimens but it seems after 25 years of searching, this fossil is vanishingly rare \u2013 so I can hang on no longer. \n\"Recently my mum said to me, 'Sarah, if you are going to name this fossil after me, you'd better get on and do it before I am in the ground and fossilised myself'.\n\"I tell my mum in jest that I named the fossil Sue after her because she is a well-preserved specimen.\n\"But, in truth, I named her Sue because my mum always said I should follow a career that makes me happy \u2013 whatever that may be. \n\"For me, that is digging rocks, finding fossils and then trying to figure out how they lived and what they tell us about ancient life and evolution on Earth.\"\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

        "article_text": "Emma Raducanu will move back into the world's top 50 following her Miami Open run\nEmma Raducanu is starting to play like it is 2021.\nThe Briton, who won 10 matches in straight sets to clinch the US Open title, had not been able to win more than three in a row until this week\u2019s Miami Open.\nHer run was ended by world number four Jessica Pegula in the quarter-finals, but on Monday Raducanu will return to the world\u2019s top 50 for the first time since September 2022.\nSuccess has come despite a constantly changing sea of faces in the coaching box and a typically challenging start to the year.\nThe 22-year-old has not had a full-time coach since January, but played with great freedom in Miami.\nSo what kind of support might Raducanu need to be able to produce form like this on a more consistent basis?\nAfter the early promise of two Australian Open wins against higher-ranked opponents, Raducanu lost heavily to Iga Swiatek in January before coach Nick Cavaday informed her his health would prevent him from continuing.\nFebruary's spell in the Middle East ended in distressing fashion, as a man who had been following Raducanu around the circuit was evicted from her second-round match and given a restraining order.\nRaducanu appeared rudderless for much of that period, although she was rarely short of support. Her strength and conditioning coach Yutaka Nakamura has barely left her side since starting in early December.\nRoman Kelecic, a coach from her teenage days, helped out in Abu Dhabi. Jane O'Donoghue, a friend and former LTA coach, was in Doha and Dubai. Tom Welsh was drafted in from the Loughborough Academy as a short-term hire for Indian Wells, only for Vladimir Platenik to usurp him by arriving in California for a hastily arranged trial.\nAfter only two weeks that trial was ended by Raducanu on the eve of her first-round victory in Miami - and a seat offered once again to O\u2019Donoghue and the broadcaster and coach Mark Petchey.\nHow 'free spirit' Raducanu is thriving without coach\nSecond Serve: Your new weekly tennis briefing\nPetchey coached an 18-year-old Andy Murray for 10 months - during which he won his first ATP title - and trained with Raducanu during the pandemic summer of 2020.\nThose weeks at the National Tennis Centre in London appear to have left quite an impression on Raducanu. There is a mutual respect and rapport between the two.\nO'Donoghue has been a regular confidante for Raducanu, and was the LTA\u2019s national women\u2019s coach until 2019, when she left the sport for pastures new.\nRaducanu trusts them and is able to relax in their company, but they both have day jobs.\nPetchey is in broadcasting - most notably with the Tennis Channel - and O\u2019Donoghue in finance. She is currently on a sabbatical, but there is no suggestion she wants to return to the far less secure world of tennis coaching on a permanent basis.\nBoth could offer input but, as things stand, not the type of support Raducanu said she was seeking when speaking to the BBC at Indian Wells.\n\"Once I have a structure in place and I can fall back on the process again I will feel very set,\" she said this month.\n\"In the Middle East it was very difficult for me because I didn't really have any direction or structure or which tournaments to play and it was very difficult doing it all on my own.\n\"I'm that kind of person who needs a plan and needs preparation. That's what I'm building and that's making me feel more comfortable.\"\nJane O'Donoghue (left) was with Emma Raducanu in Miami\nRaducanu is part of the Great Britain team which will compete in the Billie Jean King Cup qualifying round in early April, and will be able to spend the next two weeks working with the LTA coaching team.\nBut she will need a more lasting plan swiftly.\nHer clay-court season could take in Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome before thre French Open, and there will be very little respite in the schedule before the end of October.\nThat plan does not need to revolve around one person.\nMany top players employ more than one coach, usually because it is very hard for any one individual to commit to more than 30 weeks on the road each year.\nJack Draper ended last summer\u2019s partnership with Wayne Ferreira as he preferred the \"one voice\" of James Trotman, but now travels to some events with Alex Ward.\nPerhaps things could have worked out differently with Cavaday if an additional coach had been brought into the team when his health problems first arose in the spring of 2024.\nExposure to different personalities and ways of thinking has always been appealing to Raducanu, but the period with Cavaday offered her stability and calmness.\nThey liked each other, having first established a coaching partnership when Raducanu was a girl. Cavaday was a good sounding board, and there was evidence from her play last spring and summer that the two could flourish in future.\nOther partnerships fizzled out much more quickly.\nPlatenik lasted only two weeks. His coaching acumen is widely admired, but his personality did not seem a good match for Raducanu.\nOne former player compared him to a \"freight train\", saying he was intense and opinionated. Platenik says Raducanu told him she was feeling \u201cstressed\u201d when ending the brief collaboration.\nTorben Beltz looked an excellent choice, given his Grand Slam success with Angelique Kerber, but Raducanu did not feel he had enough to offer.\nDmitry Tursunov ended their partnership because he thought Raducanu needed to listen to just \"one voice\". He referred to \"red flags\" and a feeling there may be further problems down the line.\nHer spell with Sebastian Sachs concluded after operations on both hands and left ankle, which kept her on the sidelines for the second half of 2023.\nThere did not seem much logic in dispensing of the services of Nigel Sears after Wimbledon 2021, but it is hard to argue with the choice of Andrew Richardson, who then steered her to that historic triumph at the US Open.\nHowever, that partnership ended there.\nWould Raducanu go back to a coach she has previously let go? Sears still looks a good bet and has a proven track record of success with Daniela Hantuchova, Ana Ivanovic and Anett Kontaveit.\nHe is no longer working with the Australian Olivia Gadecki, and is a regular at the National Tennis Centre in London, where he works with the LTA's women's team.\nFor all her progress in Miami, Raducanu may have a difficult spring and summer without the right personnel around her.\nDoes she ever throws a covetous glance at Draper's set-up?\nHis team looks a thoroughly professional outfit, and some hard decisions have recently been made.\nPhysio Will Herbert and strength and conditioning coach Steve Kotze are no longer involved. They have been replaced by Shane Annun and Matt Little, who were so integral to Andy Murray's team.\nAnd Trotman remains as head coach. He has been working full-time with the new Indian Wells champion since the end of 2021, in which time Draper has risen from outside the top 250 and into the world's top 10.",

        "article_text": "Some coach operators say they will no longer visit a village in the Cotswolds due to new \"ill-thought-through\" drop-off and parking zones.\nA coach ban was considered in Bourton-on-the-Water after it became \"choked\" with vehicles when a private car park stopped accepting coaches in December 2023.\nBusinesses argued an outright ban would cost them money, and now a trial will see a drop-off point created. However, some operators fear the Meadow Way location is \"not safe\" and is too far to walk to the village centre.\nGloucestershire County Council insists the walk is \"short\", saying feedback will be \"welcome\" during the trial as it will be able to \"make changes\".\nThe six-month trial is set to begin around Easter and will allow coaches to stop at Meadow Way for 10 minutes to drop off and pick up passengers. Parking will then be available at the Pulhams Coaches site between 09:00 and 16:00 each day.\nA long-term plan is in the works, which would involve coaches parking in Cotswold School, although it has yet to be confirmed.\nArea director at Pulhams, Alex Chutter, said he is optimistic about the trial.\n\"It's welcome relief really,\" he said.\n\"I think there was a level of uncertainty in previous seasons and at least operators now know what the plans are and what options they have available. \n\"Hopefully that can entice them back to the area.\"\nThe council has shared Mr Chutter's hopes the scheme will encourage coach companies who stopped offering trips to Bourton-on-the-Water to return.\nHowever, multiple firms told the BBC they are not convinced by the plans.\nJason Edwards is the deputy chair of the Coach Tourism Association, a trade body representing coach tour operators. \nHe said: \"In a sort of way, it's a positive step because they have realised how important tourism is. But do we think they have got it right, no we don't.\"\nHe said the biggest sticking point is the 0.7 mile (1.1km) distance between the proposed drop-off point and the village's shops and attractions, particularly for older customers.\n\"We've got a higher-end age demographic, certainly when it comes to UK domestic coach passengers,\" he said.\n\"And for them to have a 15 to 20-minute walk, laden with shopping bags, with the British weather as unpredictable as it is, it just wouldn't work.\"\n\"They vote with their feet,\" he added. \"If there is any problems with walking distance or not having weatherproof facilities, they won't book that trip.\"\nMr Edwards, from South Wales, also runs his own coach tour business which offers tours to the Cotswolds. \n\"We dropped Bourton-on-the-Water completely,\" he said. \"We went to Stow-on-the-Wold and other areas around the Cotswolds.\n\"We wouldn't want to expose our customers to areas that aren't coach-friendly or welcoming. It has a detrimental effect to our business.\"\nHe said many operators represented by the Coach Travel Association also made the decision to avoid Bourton-on-the-Water or reduce the frequency of trips there.\nAmong the operators who continued to visit the village regularly last year was Middleton Tours. \nBut the firm said it had been forced to rethink its plans due to concerns over the trial and a recent incident where a resident shouted at one of its tour guides and passengers.\nTour manager Richard Smith said: \"The site that they have chosen is right at the junction so it's not safe. \n\"There is no shelter and no signage. There is apparently the provision for three coaches. Anybody that knows Bourton-on-the-Water, particularly during the main season, knows how busy it can get.\n\"It's ill-thought-through and could be prone to operational disasters. Until there is a  solution that works for the customer and coach operators, we have made the decision not to return to Bourton-on-the-Water.\"\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Gloucestershire County Council said the trial will give coaches a \"dedicated area\" to drop off and pick up customers which is a \"short walk\" from the centre of the village.\n\"The parish council would welcome feedback on the scheme from residents, visitors and coach operators,\" they added.\n\"The county council will be able to make changes to the scheme during the trial to ensure the best possible results.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Taxes on parts are set to start in May or later.\nThe latest move threatens to widen the global trade war and is part of the president's drive to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing within the US.\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.

In China last weekend, he qualified last for both the sprint and the grand prix, and finished 14th and 12th.\nWorld champion Verstappen was second in Melbourne and fourth in Shanghai. The next race is the Japanese Grand Prix, from 4-6 April.\nLawson, 23, admitted he found his demotion \"tough\" but said he is excited to work with his former team Racing Bulls.\n\"Being a Red Bull Racing driver has been my dream since I was a kid, it's what I've worked towards my whole life,\" he wrote on Instagram.\n\"I'm grateful for everything that's brought me to this point. To every one of you who's stood by me, thank you for all the support. It means the world.\"\nMarko said that Tsunoda, 24, would be given \"to the end of the season\" at Red Bull to prove himself \"because we believe he can do the job\".\nAsked why the Japanese was the right driver now, when they had decided at the end of last season that Lawson was a better bet, Marko said: \"Tsunoda made a big step. It's strange after four years, now in his fifth year, he is a much stronger personality, he has more confidence and he did two very good races, it's just his strategy didn't work at Racing Bulls.\n\"In this case, a very difficult car experience is something that will help. That was our thoughts.\"\nMarko said that Red Bull decided not to give Lawson another chance at the Japanese Grand Prix, which is the first race this season to be held on a circuit Lawson has experienced before, because \"we were worried that his self-confidence is so damaged that he couldn't bring his normal performance\".\nHe added: \"And on the other hand we have two drivers for the constructors' championship but also to support Max strategy-wise, if you have two drivers top five or eight it is easier to max a strategy that favours the number-one driver.\"\nMarko insisted that the swap with Tsunoda was \"not a demotion\" for Lawson.\n\"He's not kicked out of F1 and Racing Bulls will give him the chance to recover and his career will start again,\" Marko said.\nHe pointed to the experience of drivers Red Bull had previously dropped as evidence that Lawson could rebuild his career.\nMarko said: \"For the benefit for him, he goes back to Racing Bulls, which has a car capable to be top 10 in qualifying and the race.\n\"Just look in the past, it was [Pierre] Gasly, it happened the same, also to [Alex] Albon and they recovered and they are now competitive F1 drivers.\n\"On top of it, the RB21 is a car which is not the fastest car but nevertheless very difficult to drive and Max can handle but not at this stage Liam.\"\nRed Bull confirm Tsunoda to replace Lawson\nAndrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions\nRed Bull's driver errors go back to last spring, when they decided to re-sign Sergio Perez on a new contract to the end of 2026 rather than take Carlos Sainz, who was a free agent following Ferrari's decision to sign Lewis Hamilton for 2025.\nPerez's performances slumped and at the end of last season Red Bull paid him off and took Lawson instead.\nMarko said: \"In hindsight it is always easy to say but when he was available it was a different situation with Red Bull Racing. \n\"In the beginning of the year, Sergio Perez finished second twice and was performing and it just came later that Sergio had problems with the car and his performance dropped.\"\nMarko said he believed Red Bull could fix the problems with their car and deliver a fifth title for Verstappen.\nBut he admitted the Dutchman could consider leaving if the car's pace did not improve.\n\"We have this huge motivation to achieve this fifth title,\" Marko said. \"We also know that if we don't deliver for Max, all the top drivers have performance clauses in their contract.\n\"So we have to make sure he gets a car where he can win and there was a very constructive meeting last Thursday, Max with the engineers, and they discussed how to go forward to improve the car and make it more drivable and to have a wider range of drivability, and all that went very positive.\n\"So it's just two races, we are eight points behind. And the whole team is focused to achieve this fifth title which we didn't make with [Sebastian] Vettel but this time there is a possibility.\n\"And if you look at the lap times from Max on the hard tyre [in the Chinese Grand Prix], we were competitive but not everywhere like on the McLaren but we are not so much off as it looks sometimes.\"\nMeanwhile, Verstappen appeared to offer his opinion on Lawson's demotion by 'liking' an Instagram, external post from former F1 driver Giedo van der Garde that described it as a \"panic move\".\nWhat's the future for F1 engines and why is it up for debate?\nWere Ferrari at fault or unlucky with disqualifications?",

I've made mistakes along the way and I know what not to do,\" said Mr McCorkindale. \n\"I lost a full stone on the last expedition so have gained a lot of weight for this on purpose as bodyweight is crucial when pulling a sled \u2013 plus the extra insulation from body fat is handy.\n\"You burn in excess of 6,000 calories a day but only consume around 3,000 - that includes porridge breakfast, 500-1,000 calorie ration packs twice a day and a few snacks during the daily distances with stops every 45 minutes to replenish energy levels and hydration.\"\nJames, who was a contestant on BBC's SAS: Are You Tough Enough?, said being rescued could cost around \u00a330,000.\n\"You have to deal with absolutely everything yourselves. You come across all sorts of problems,\" he said. \n\"The stoves were packing up last time because it was so cold... and once you don't have a stove you will not survive out there.\"\nMr McCorkindale has raised money for other charities in the past including Nacoa, a charity which supports people affected by a parent's drinking, on his last expedition. \nThe father-of-three said this time he wanted to support the children's hospice Hope House T\u0177 Gobaith which he was invited to visit. \n\"I wanted to do something for the children. My youngest is just nine months old and I had a bit of a moment seeing the children in the hospice,\" he said. \n\"It's such a lovely place. So bright and cheerful and not clinical like I expected.\"\nThe pair have currently raised over \u00a33,000.\nHope House Ty Gobaith fundraiser Nicky Eyes said the charity was \"bowled over by James and Lee's bravery and strength\".\n\"They really are amazing and we wish them so well on their expedition and a safe return back home. We'll be rooting for them every step of the way,\" she said.",

        "article_text": "In Murmansk, the largest city north of the Arctic circle, President Vladimir Putin vowed to \"strengthen Russia's global leadership in the Arctic\", while warning that \"geopolitical competition in the region\" was intensifying.\nThe first example he gave was Donald Trump's idea to acquire Greenland.\nBut from the Kremlin leader there was no criticism of his US counterpart.\nAnd that's telling, as the White House and the Kremlin try to rebuild relations.\n\"In short, America's plans in relation to Greenland are serious,\" President Putin said in an address to Russia's Arctic Forum in Murmansk.\n\"These plans have deep historical roots. And it's clear that the US will continue to systematically pursue its geo-strategic, military-political and economic interests in the \u0410rctic. \n\"As for Greenland this is a matter for two specific countries. It has nothing to do with us.\"\nSo said the president who had launched a full-scale invasion of a sovereign neighbouring country and claims to have annexed whole swathes of Ukraine.\nWhen Joe Biden was in the White House, Moscow and Washington were vocal in their criticism of one another.\nHow things have changed.\nToday Russia is promoting the idea of economic cooperation with the United States in an Arctic region packed with natural resources.\n\"We are open to considering different investment opportunities that we can do jointly with the US, in certain sectors approved by the Russian government,\" says Kirill Dmitriev, President Putin's envoy for foreign investment and economic cooperation.\nMr Dmitriev, who is also chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, has already been in talks with US officials.\n\"We are open for investment cooperation in the Arctic. That could be in logistics, or other areas beneficial to Russia and to the US,\" Mr Dmitriev adds.\n\"But before deals can be done the war in Ukraine needs to end,\" I suggest. \n\"Many people in the West accuse Russia of dragging its feet, showing no compromise or concessions, and just laying down conditions.\"\n\"I am focused on economics and investments, so I don't comment on political issues,\" Mr Dmitriev responds. \n\"The only thing I can say is we have a very good dialogue, and I think it's very important that the US is trying to understand Russia's position.\"\nMoscow seems confident that it can woo Washington with promises of lucrative deals in the Arctic and across Russia.\nThat confidence is understandable considering how senior US officials have been repeating Kremlin talking points about the war in Ukraine and about Europe.\nIn a recent interview with former Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson, Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff appeared to accept the results of Moscow-organised referenda that were held in Ukrainian territories seized and occupied by Russia. \nThese votes that have not been recognised by the international community.\nIn the words of one recent Russian newspaper headline: \"US and Russian officials are now talking the same language.\"\nAre the Russian authorities at all surprised by the sea change in America's Russia policy?\n\"[In America] there are two parties that compete with one another,\" says Nikolai Patrushev, former head of Russia's FSB domestic security service. \nMr Patrushev, who is now an aide to President Putin, is one of the most powerful figures in Russia. \nWhile on the side lines of the Arctic Forum he tells me: \"When the Democrats were in power, they took one view. The Republicans have another. \n\"It doesn't mean that they agree with Russia's standpoint. Only that they have their own, which they promote, and we can cooperate with them.\"\nI ask Mr Patrushev: \"Do you have a sense that a new world order is being forged?\".\n\"We used to have a system where two powers dominated in the world. Then it was just one. Now we're building a multi-polar world. But with its own peculiarities,\" says Mr Patrushev.\nIn the centre of Murmansk, a giant inflatable whale has taken over one of the city's squares. \nAttached to wires, it's bobbing over a sea of silver balloons designed to look like waves. The balloons are dancing in the wind beneath the blow-up beast.\nIt's a giant installation. But then Russia has enormous ambitions, both for the Arctic and for the country's relations with America.\nThe whale is attracting a great deal of interest with lots of families posing for photos. \nIt's an opportunity to ask Russians whether they support the idea of economic cooperation with America in the Arctic and whether they're surprised when Washington appears to take Moscow's side?\nElina isn't.\n\"Russia is strong,\" she says. \"You should always back the strong ones and go along with them.\"\n\"We need to develop the Arctic,\" Olga tells me. \"Cooperation with 'friendly countries' is a good thing.\"\n\"And do you see America as a 'friendly country'?\" I ask.\n\"You know what? I can't decide.\" replies Olga.\nMeanwhile presidential envoy Mr Dmitriev is singing the praises of one particular American - Elon Musk \u2013 and counting on cooperation.\n\"We believe Elon Musk is a great visionary, a great leader and a very successful person,\" Mr Dmitriev tells me. \"Russia has a lot to offer for a mission to Mars because we have some nuclear technologies which can be applicable.\n\"There are some video conferences we believe will be upcoming with, let's say, the Musk team.\"",

        "article_text": "Gates and Paul Allen launched computing giant Microsoft 50 years ago. In 1993, he talked to the BBC about the online innovations that would define the 21st Century.\nWhen the BBC first broadcast an interview with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates in June 1993, there were thought to be only 130 websites in total. The BBC's venerable science programme Horizon was investigating the new \"Electronic Frontier\", in an era where \"information is starting to redefine our world, its geography and its economy\". Gates told the programme: \"This is the information age, and the computer is the tool of the information age and software is what will determine how easily we can get at all of that information.\" Viewers could send off a cheque for \u00a32 and receive a transcript of the programme in the post.\u00a0\nThe computer industry had already grown faster than any in history, but the key to future profits was creating something portable and user-friendly. The programme asked: \"Do we need endless information, or do they just need to sell it to us?\" In a world where a list of almost every website could fit on two sides of a sheet of paper, the world wide web did not even get a mention. However, the ideas explored in the programme are often far ahead of their time.\nIn the early days of Microsoft, Bill Gates and Paul Allen set a goal of having a computer on every desk and in every home \u2013 all running Microsoft products, of course. They first met as children at a private school in Seattle, where they discovered a shared love of computers. Both went on to college but dropped out and created Microsoft, so-called because it provided microcomputer software.\u00a0\nThe company's big break came in 1980 when Microsoft agreed to produce the operating system for the personal computer being developed by IBM, the world's leading computer company at the time. In a stroke of business genius, Microsoft was allowed to license the operating system to other manufacturers, spawning an industry of \"IBM-compatible\" personal computers which depended on its MS-DOS product. The money had begun to roll in \u2013 and to this day it has not yet stopped.\nWhile Gates was the serious-minded computer nerd, Allen was his offbeat big brother. Allen worked at Microsoft until 1983, stepping away from the frontline following a diagnosis of blood cancer. He recovered to become a successful venture capitalist and, having held onto his share of the company, he was a fixture on the world's rich lists until his death in 2018 at the age of 65. He used his vast fortune to invest in his personal passions, owning both the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team and Seattle Seahawks NFL team, who won the Super Bowl in 2013.\nHis departure from Microsoft also meant that he had more time to perfect his guitar moves. Legendary music producer Quincy Jones even claimed in a magazine interview that Allen \"sings and plays just like Hendrix\". He said: \"I went on a trip on his yacht, and he had David Crosby, Joe Walsh, Sean Lennon... then on the last two days, Stevie Wonder came on with his band and made Paul come up and play with him \u2013 he's good, man.\" The design of Seattle's Museum of Pop Culture, which he founded, has been likened to a smashed guitar and was created by superstar architect Frank Gehry.\nAllen jumped ship from Microsoft before products such as Windows, Excel and Word ever made it into the world's homes and offices. By the early 1990s, Gates' vision for networked computers sent sales and profits soaring. However, the pair's early dream of putting a computer running Microsoft software in every home and business was only half complete. Word processing and spreadsheets were lucrative, but Microsoft's relentless drive to expand needed new worlds to explore. The next step was to bring multimedia into people's homes, turning the personal computer into a communication device. It was the world of leisure so beloved by Allen that Gates needed to tap into.\nGates acknowledged to the BBC in 1993 that \"the home will be a tougher frontier to conquer\". However, he was confident that Microsoft would succeed. \"If you take a time frame like 15 years or certainly 20 years, I have no doubt that the vision of a computer in every home, although it won't look like today's computer, will absolutely be achieved,\" he said.\nA year earlier, Bruce Springsteen had a hit grumbling about having \"57 Channels (And Nothin' On)\". Undeterred by the Boss's cynicism, Microsoft's Nathan Myhrvold talked of a future where we would have up to 1,000 television channels. He said: \"That might sound like a nightmare, but I think it's a wonderful thing. Imagine what your favourite bookstore would be like if there were only five books.\" Describing a system resembling today's streaming services, he spoke of an \"online interactive guide, which uses computer technology to organise the channels, show them to you by topic, even learn of the material that you like to watch, and then present it to you in an online fashion right on the television\".\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nMyhrvold was providing a tantalising glimpse of the future: a world at your fingertips where you could order an En Vogue CD or Prince tickets instantly. But what would this mean for personal privacy?\nThere was a warning in the 1993 programme from Denise Caruso, editor of the magazine Digital Media: \"The ease of sitting in front of your interactive TV five years hence and being able to order something by pushing your remote control means information about you is going through a network. That means that whoever is on the other end of that network knows what you're watching on television, can get your credit card number, can know lots of things about you that maybe you don't want them to know.\"\nCaruso raised issues echoed in the current debate about Generative AI models being trained by devouring copyrighted material. She said: \"By making information a commodity, you really change the nature of how people think about ideas and their work and what they do. I am a writer. My stock in trade is ideas, and when you try to draw lines around what information is and where did an idea come from and who had that idea originally and what napkin was it originally drawn on, when you start moving information into that realm, it starts to get very fuzzy about where one person's idea stops and another one starts.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0A 36-year-old Jeff Bezos talks about 'unprofitable' Amazon\n\u2022\u00a0The rocky 1960s origins of online dating\n\u2022\u00a0How Russia launched a giant space mirror in 1993\nShe said that while information was an incredible commodity, it had no value at all unless it could be protected. But how could you protect something that has no physical existence and could be copied or changed undetectably?\n\"The problem is that the solutions are as complex as the problems themselves. Do you want to lock up all the information? Absolutely not. We would have no scientific progress if scientists weren't able to freely exchange ideas and information. Do you just have a free-for-all and say all information is free? Well, you can't do that either because people do actually make their livings upon the fruit of their work, [which] is information, whether it's a book or it's a movie or it's music. I think technology is an incredible thing and it's very powerful, but it's powerful in both ways, and it's very important that we all understand that before we just embrace it.\"\u00a0\nWhile the world wide web did not feature in the programme, it was many viewers' first introduction to the concept of electronic mail, or email. As Microsoft continued its voracious expansion, the company's human resources vice-president Mike Murray said that email \"creates an electronic village [which] allows us to transcend the borders of time or geographic barriers\". His words may seem grandiose now, but at the time it would have been a revolutionary idea that one could communicate instantly with someone or many people on the other side of the world without the need for an expensive international phone call.\nBy the end of 1993, the number of websites was estimated at 623, having doubled every three months. By the end of 1994, the figure was 10,022. Microsoft was seen by some commentators as being slow to acknowledge the possibilities and growth of the web, but in May 1995 Gates sent a memo to his senior staff titled \"The Internet Tidal Wave\", calling it \"the most important single development to come along since the IBM PC was introduced in 1981\".\u00a0Three months later, Microsoft launched its web portal MSN alongside the release of Windows 95. Some versions had its brand-new Internet Explorer browser controversially bundled in. The future was again up for grabs, and Gates once again had some big thoughts on how he might conquer it.\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The famed chef and author tells the BBC's Katty Kay that it was finding academia too \u201cesoteric\u201d that led him to seek out a simpler path: to help the world simplify its food.\nYotam Ottolenghi's singular style of cooking has been embraced across the globe. Focusing on simple ingredients and treating food as a way to bring friends and family together, he's become a renowned chef, a best-selling author and a touchstone for home cooks looking to incorporate global flavours into their everyday rotations.\nThe chef, father and former philosophy student explains to BBC special correspondent Katty Kay, in her interview series Influential, that having parents who cooked helped shape his path. However, he says that it was the sense of belonging that came with cooking \u2013 not family expectations \u2013 that truly drew him in.\n\"There was a quiet expectation that I would probably become an academic,\" he says. \"I don't remember having a conversation, which must have happened. 'What do you want to be when you grow up?' I don't remember that.\"\nHis parents were both in education \u2013 his father, Michael, was a chemistry professor at Jerusalem's Hebrew University \u2013 but Ottolenghi notes that his folks both had experience in the kitchen.\n\"Food was very important. We had good ingredients, good cooking. Both my parents were good cooks,\" he says. \"My father used to cook a lot because he worked more flexible hours. My mother was a head teacher at school [...] She also cooked but he cooked even more.\"\nThe 56-year-old chef \u2013 who has authored 11 cookbooks \u2013 tells Kay that rather than having an epiphany about his future path, he saw the kitchen as a space for curiosity and play, something that he's now passed onto his own children.\n\"My kids \u2013 I've got a 9 year old [and an] 11 year old \u2013 they play, you know?\" he says. \"They go in the kitchen and they make an omelette and this and that. I call it cooking as play. So, I used to do a bit of that but I wasn't obsessive about cooking.\"\nBefore making his name in the culinary world, Ottolenghi dabbled in philosophy but found the subject matter too isolating and \"esoteric\".\n\"The conversation was being held amongst a group of, like, four people, you know like groundbreaking stuff but actually nobody was participating,\" he said of his time in university, where he tackled topics like the meaning of photography and what images mean to their viewers. Instead of that very specialised field, he turned his focus to something simpler, literally.\nIn 2018, following the success of his eponymous Notting Hill caf\u00e9 and shop, Ottolenghi published his fifth cookbook, Simple, distilling all the techniques and preparations that he'd become known for into something accessible and approachable.\n\"Food is a language that everybody understands,\" he says. What surprised him about that, however, was that the books started to eclipse the food. \"Rather than just being a book to sell and share, the publishing arm of Ottolenghi became the dog wagging the tail in this respect. The books became the main thing, almost.\"\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay\nWatch\u00a0Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on\u202fYouTube.\nThe books were a way for fans of the restaurant and of Ottolenghi's pared-down, flavour-forward recipes to access that world at home. He tells Kay that he hopes to be part of a movement to take cooking from being a chore into something healing and restorative.\n\"Home-style cooking and family-style serving are way more popular now than they used to be. I really put that down to, first of all, cost of living, but also Covid. In that moment, we understood that actually food should be healing rather than just one of all other activities that we do all day long that push us.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Misty Copeland is 'not scared' to face a career beyond dance\n\u2022 Ina Garten on her internet appeal: 'Young people don't have mom in the kitchen'\n\u2022 Entrepreneur Jane Wurwand on why 'high-touch will overshadow high-tech' in business\nFans soon saw the changes in his books, shifting from the exact recipes served at his restaurants to something less haute cuisine and more streamlined, boasting titles like Simple, Plenty and his latest, Comfort.\n\"I think since Simple, I have been spending more of my time thinking, 'What does it actually mean to cook this recipe?' You know, 'When do I cook \u2013 when does one cook it? How much effort goes into it?'\" he says. \"Funnily, from a grand old age talking to younger chefs, I say to them, 'Is someone actually going to cook this?' I want people to cook my food.\"\nThat pared-down approach has even turned \"Ottolenghi\" into an adjective \u2013 used to describe food that offers high impact with few ingredients and straightforward techniques. He remains humble, brushing off the distinction and putting the focus back on his desire to make cooking comforting.\n\"Food really is one of those activities that shouldn't induce anxiety. It's as simple as that,\" he says.\n--\n\u00a0If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

Two films honoured at the Oscars even used the technology. \nAs a DJ played '90s hip hop, computer developers rubbed shoulders actors and executives, in a sign of the changing power players in the industry.\nAI in Hollywood is \"inevitable\", says Bryn Mooser, the party's host and the co-founder of Moonvalley, which created the AI generator tool \"Marey\" by paying for footage from filmmakers with their consent. Mr Mooser says that while AI may still be a dirty word, their product is \"clean\" because it pays for its content.\nAI may be a dirty word in Hollywood, but Mr Mooser says their version of the technology is \"clean.\"\n\"Artists should be at the table,\" he says, adding that it's better to build the tool for filmmakers rather than get \"rolled over by big tech companies\".\nArtificial Intelligence has long been depicted as a villain in Hollywood. In \"The Terminator,\" AI used by the US military decides it must destroy everyone on Earth.\nBut it's AI's creators, and not the technology itself, that has received the brunt of real-life criticism. Companies use publicly available data to build their AI models - which includes copyrighted material shared online - and creators say they're being ripped off.\nOpenAI, Google and other tech companies are facing multiple lawsuits from writers, actors and news organizations, alleging their work was stolen to train AI without their consent. Studios like Paramount, Disney and Universal who own the copyright on movies and TV shows have been urged by writers to do the same, though none have taken legal action.\n\"We've all fought very hard for copyright laws, and nobody wants to see their work stolen to have somebody else profit from it,\" Mr Mooser says. \nHollywood has begun toying with the new technology. The Oscar-nominated films Emilia Perez and The Brutalist used AI to alter voices. Adrian Brody won the Academy Award for best actor, even with the help of AI to fine tune his accent when he spoke Hungarian in his starring role in The Brutalist. AI has even been used to de-age actors like Tom Hanks and Harrison Ford.\nThe technology is seemingly everywhere. OpenAI hosted an AI film festival in Los Angeles earlier this month. Marvel directors Joe and Anthony Russo told the Wall Street Journal they plan to invest $400 million to craft AI tools for filmmakers.\nBut the impacts on how it will alter the future of the entertainment industry remain unclear. Generative AI, for instance, allows computers to learn and solve problems in ways that can seem human \u2013 albeit much faster. And many worry about the technology replacing their jobs as AI is used to generate scripts, animation, locations, voices and human actors.\nIf you ask OpenAI's popular chatbot, ChatGPT, which Hollywood jobs are most easily replaced by AI, background actors are top of the list as \"most vulnerable\" with \"A-List actors & directors\" considered safest because \"star power and brand recognition keep top talent irreplaceable\".\nAt the Moonvalley party, everyone was talking about new AI technology though few wanted to speak with a reporter on record about it. But dozens of powerful people made the trek east to the hip Silver Lake neighbourhood from West Los Angeles even though it was raining. In LA, that's remarkable.\n\"We're here to learn,\" said one executive who spent an hour in traffic getting to the party. \"We're not signing anything or buying anything, but we're interested.\"\nMooser and his co-founder Naeem Talukdar speak passionately about how AI will transform Hollywood and allow filmmakers to create blockbuster style epics on much lower budgets. It could lead to many bad films - but it could also help discover the next Quentin Tarantino or Martin Scorsese, even if they don't have the backing of a big studio.\n\"This technology is utterly meaningless without the artist at the centre of it; the technology needs to ultimately be subservient to the artist,\" says Mr Talukdar.\nHollywood's foray into using AI comes as the Trump administration prepares a new AI plan for the United States. \nTech companies say they can't compete with China under existing US copyright laws and that they need unfettered access to art - from Mickey Mouse to Moana to The Matrix - to train their AI models as a matter of national security.\nGoogle and OpenAI want the US government to designate copyrighted art, movies and TV shows as \"fair use\" for them to train AI, arguing that without the exceptions, they will lose the race for dominance to China.\nHollywood filmmakers say tech companies are attempting to undermine the entertainment industry, which they point out supports more than 2.3 million US jobs.\n\"We firmly believe that America's global AI leadership must not come at the expense of our essential creative industries,\" a group of more than 400 Hollywood A-listers - led by actress/writer Natasha Lyonne who helped develop Moonvalley - wrote in an open letter to the Trump administration, which has been soliciting public comment for its AI Action Plan.\nThe letter's signatories included A-List stars like Ben Stiller, Paul McCartney, Cate Blanchett and Lilly Wachowski, who co-created \"The Matrix,\" which depicts a dystopian simulated reality where humans are enslaved by intelligent machines.\nMany in Hollywood remain terrified of what AI means for their futures.\nOutside a Disney Character Voices office earlier this month, dozens of actors picketed against video game companies for refusing to come to an agreement on using AI in video games.\n\"Using actual actors is the key to a lot of the drama and enjoyment that people get from video games,\" actor DW McCann said. \"People have lived experiences that AI just can't understand.\"\nThe actors want a contract that guarantees their voices and likeness will not be used without their consent to train AI models that replace them in the future. \nMr Mooser says AI will allow filmmakers to create amazing art \u2013 if it's done right.  With humans calling the shots, he says, AI could help them create sets and worlds they couldn't easily access or invent \u2013 and to do so much faster than what they could traditionally do with computer graphics and visual effects.\n\"We're trying to say look, technology is going to be in everything. Let's make sure that we try to fight as hard as we can to make sure that it's done in the right way, and that artists aren't run over by big companies.\"",

        "article_text": "President Volodymyr Zelensky was in a buoyant mood when I met him in Paris with a panel of three other European journalists. He had interrupted a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace and went back there for what he called a \"t\u00eate \u00e0 t\u00eate dinner\" after the interview. \nMacron had not just rolled out the red carpet for him. The Eiffel Tower, behind Zelensky in a picture window as we talked in one of Paris's great museums, was lit up in yellow and blue, the colours of the Ukrainian national flag.\nThe French wanted him to feel as if he was among friends. Zelensky had come to Paris to meet leaders and diplomats from 30 other countries who are working out what they can contribute to the \"coalition of the willing\", the group that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron are trying to organise to offer Ukraine security guarantees if there is a long-term ceasefire.\nZelensky's welcome in Paris was a clear contrast to the dressing down he was given by US President Donald Trump and his vice president JD Vance when he visited the White House last month. \nAfter their verbal attack, Zelensky was unceremoniously turfed out of the White House and not long afterwards Trump ordered the suspension of American military aid and intelligence to Ukraine.\nIt was restored after Zelensky, advised by the British, the French and other European allies, went out of his way to mend his fences with Trump and his administration. \nHe switched to the kind of flattering language Trump demands and agreed to an American plan for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.  He dropped his insistence on US security guarantees first, to underpin any ceasefire.\nBut even though US military and intelligence assistance is flowing, Trump's ruthless suspension of it, which cost Ukrainian lives, has left a deep sense of unease in Ukraine and among its European allies. \nThe evidence is piling up that Trump's United States is not a reliable ally. It is getting easier to sketch out scenarios in which it might not be an ally at all. \nMost European leaders still try to act publicly as if the 80-year-old alliance with the US is healthy. But the gathering of 30 countries in Paris shows they realise they can no longer rely on the benevolence of the United States. \nAmerican presidents going back to Dwight D. Eisenhower in the late 1950s have complained, with good reason, about Europeans getting a free ride from the US security blanket over Europe. Trump has finally pulled it away.\nDuring the interview, Zelensky praised the array of plans that are being formulated in western Europe \u2013 led by the UK, France and Germany \u2013 to spend more on defence. \nHe suggested that in three to five years, \"if everything goes as it is now\", Europe might even catch up with the United States. \nAt best, that is a highly optimistic estimate, less an accurate forecast and more a gesture of appreciation for European allies who unlike the Americans attach very few conditions and strings to support for Ukraine.\nEurope, Zelensky said, \"has discipline and no chaos\". That might be seen as an oblique and unflattering comparison with the twists and turns coming out of the Trump White House.\n\nI asked him about the conditions Russia's President Vladimir Putin has attached to the latest small step in the Trump peace initiative, which is a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea. \nAfter Ukraine and Russia held separate meetings with the Americans in Saudi Arabia, the Kremlin issued a statement that required concessions as Russia's price for a ceasefire. \nThe most significant demand was for a state-owned Russian bank to be readmitted to the Swift system for international payments. That would open a door back into mainstream global commerce for Russia. \nThat decision does not depend on Trump, as Swift is based in Belgium. \nThe European Union foreign affairs spokeswoman responded with a statement saying one of the \"main preconditions\" for lifting or amending sanctions on Russia was \"the end of the Russian unprovoked and unjustified aggression in Ukraine and the unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces from the entire territory of Ukraine\".\nEven Trump, reluctant to criticise Putin, suggested that Russia might be \"dragging its feet\" in the negotiations with the US. It reminded him of his own business career. \nHe told the US cable channel Newsmax that \"I've done it over the years\u2026 I don't want to sign a contract. I want to sort of stay in the game.\"\n\nI asked Zelensky where the push for a ceasefire stood, given Russia's demands. He called for a resolute response from the Americans.\n\"If America is going to stand strong and not bend to the conditions of the Russians - we stand on our land. \n\"We are defending it; we have shown our resilience to everyone\u2026 And now it's very important that our partners would be resilient and strong, at least at the minimum, as we are.\"\nI asked whether he believed the Americans would, as he put it, stay strong.\n\"I hope so. I hope so. God bless they will. But we'll see.\"\nZelensky has no choice about stating his faith in Trump's America, even though he must have grave doubts. \nTrump's decision to punish Ukraine by cutting off military intelligence about Russia missile launches had an immediate and deadly impact, and Zelensky had to work hard to get Trump to relent. He does not want it to happen again.\nHe was open about why he had to try to stay close to Trump, even as the US president seemed to be prioritising the restoration of relations with Moscow as he repeated Russian propaganda points, not least the lie that Ukraine started the war.\n\"We needed to unblock the aid from the US. For us, the exchange of intelligence is very important.\"\n\nThat did not stop Zelensky rebuking comments made by Steve Witkoff, Trump's super envoy, a real estate billionaire turned diplomat who deals with the Middle East as well as the Russian-Ukraine war. \nIn an interview last week with Tucker Carlson, a right-wing podcaster in the United States, Witkoff disparaged the drive by the UK's Starmer and France's Macron to create the \"coalition of the willing\" to support Ukraine. \nThe American said it was a posture and pose, \"a simplistic desire\" to sound like Winston Churchill. His words fit squarely into what seems now to be a settled view in the Trump Administration that their erstwhile allies in Europe are a parasitical burden on the United States. \nWhat if Witkoff was right? Strip away the insults and recognise that Europe's richest nations have chosen, for decades, to spend most of their considerable wealth on matters they consider more pressing than their militaries.\nZelensky said Witkoff and others in the Trump administration, had fallen for Russian propaganda.\n\"I think that Witkoff often quotes the Kremlin narratives\u2026 I can't be ungrateful to the Americans for everything they did, but they are often, unfortunately, under the influence of Russian narratives. And we cannot agree with these narratives.\"\nZelensky suggested that Witkoff was better at his old job, developing real estate in Manhattan.\n\"He doesn't look like a military man. He doesn't look like a general, and he doesn't have such experience. As far as I know, he is very good at selling and buying real estate. And this is a little different.\"\n\nPresident Zelensky, for a man who has lived with immense pressure since Russia's full scale invasion more than three years ago, was remarkably buoyant, clearly pleased by the reception he had in Paris and the efforts that President Macron and Prime Minister Starmer are making to rally European support and to persuade, even cajole,  Trump not to cut intelligence and military support to Ukraine. \nZelensky seemed happy with his new strategy of agreeing to temporary ceasefires to force Putin to show his reluctance to pause the war.\nI asked Zelensky how he was dealing with the pressure. His goal, he said, was for his children to be able \"to walk down the street and not have to hide.\" And how did he think he'd be remembered; as the man who saved Ukraine, or tried to and failed? Zelensky grimaced slightly. Better, he said, than Putin, who was getting old and feared his own people.\n\"He will die soon. It is a fact. His reign could end before he finishes his historically insignificant and unsuccessful life. This is what he fears.\"\nZelensky laughed.\n\"And I will do everything I can to defend Ukraine as much as I can. And I am definitely younger than Putin.\"\nTrump might be hoping for a deal by Easter. Zelensky is still looking to the long haul.",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has said a deal to sell TikTok will be made by 5 April, as questions swirl over whether the app will be banned in the United States.\nThe platform 'went dark' for US users in January as a law took effect which banned the app unless it was sold by its parent company ByteDance.\nBut TikTok returned less than a day later following Trump's election win, and he signed an executive order delaying its sale or ban by 75 days.\nTech companies, celebrities and investors have since lined up to buy the app.\nAn executive order is an instruction from the president which has the weight of the law behind it.\nTrump signed such an order regarding TikTok's sale or ban on 21 January, shortly after his inauguration.\nBut the president's order does not overturn the ban.\nInstead it tells the US attorney general not to enforce the law for now - something experts had expected would be his first move.\nThat buys time for his administration to, as the order puts it, \"determine the appropriate course of action\".\nIt allows the president to directly oppose a ruling by the Supreme Court upholding the law to ban TikTok on 17 January.\nThe Supreme Court's ruling said the ban was \"designed to prevent China - a designated foreign adversary - from leveraging its control over ByteDance to capture the personal data of US TikTok users\".\nTrump's extended deadline for TikTok's sale or ban gives ByteDance until 5 April to find a buyer.\nIf no deal is reached the app could once again face a US ban and be pulled from mobile app stores.\nHowever, Trump could allow the law to stand but tell the Department of Justice (DoJ) to continue to ignore it.\nThe government would be effectively telling Apple and Google they will not be punished for allowing people to download TikTok onto their devices - meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant.\nTikTok returned to Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store in February, after the companies were reportedly told they would not face consequences for hosting it.\nTrump has also said he would \"probably\" extend the deadline, if needed.\nByteDance has long insisted that TikTok is not for sale, and whether that has changed under Trump's presidency remains unclear.\nThe president told reporters on 30 March there were \"a lot of potential buyers\" and \"tremendous interest\" in buying the app.\nHe said earlier in March his administration was talking to four different groups about a potential sale.\nTrump appears to want to find a compromise that complies with the spirit rather than the letter of law.\nHe has also floated the idea of TikTok being jointly owned - telling reporters he was seeking a 50-50 partnership between \"the United States\" and ByteDance.\nMeanwhile, several names have been floated as potential buyers of the company.\nTrump said he would be open to selling TikTok to Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, as well as Elon Musk.\nPrevious names linked with buying TikTok include billionaire Frank McCourt and the Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary - a celebrity investor on Shark Tank, the US version of Dragon's Den.\nAlexis Ohanian, who co-founded Reddit, said in a post on X in March he had joined Mr McCourt's bid.\n\"The list of people who do not want to buy TikTok is much smaller than the list who do,\" Mr Musk replied.\nThe biggest YouTuber in the world Jimmy Donaldson - AKA MrBeast - has also claimed he is in the running after a number of investors contacted him following an earlier tweet signalling his interest.\nCompanies including Microsoft are even among those involved in discussions to buy TikTok, according to Trump.\nA US search engine called Perplexity AI has also reportedly offered to merge with TikTok.\nTikTok says it has 170 million US users who spent - on average - 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024.\nExperts say rivals such as Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts could benefit if Trump's efforts to fully restore TikTok don't succeed. \nUsers bring advertisers - so this could be a big financial boost to those platforms.\n\"Chief marketing officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok,\" said Kelsey Chickering, an analyst at market research company Forrester.\nOther potential winners include Twitch, which made its name by hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok.

Could TikTok be banned again and who might buy it?8 hours agoShareSaveTom Gerken, Liv McMahon & Imran Rahman-JonesTechnology reportersShareSaveGetty ImagesPresident Donald Trump has said a deal to sell TikTok will be made by 5 April, as questions swirl over whether the app will be banned in the United States.The platform 'went dark' for US users in January as a law took effect which banned the app unless it was sold by its parent company ByteDance.But TikTok returned less than a day later following Trump's election win, and he signed an executive order delaying its sale or ban by 75 days.Tech companies, celebrities and investors have since lined up to buy the app.Has Trump overturned the US TikTok ban?An executive order is an instruction from the president which has the weight of the law behind it.Trump signed such an order regarding TikTok's sale or ban on 21 January, shortly after his inauguration.But the president's order does not overturn the ban.Instead it tells the US attorney general not to enforce the law for now - something experts had expected would be his first move.That buys time for his administration to, as the order puts it, \"determine the appropriate course of action\".It allows the president to directly oppose a ruling by the Supreme Court upholding the law to ban TikTok on 17 January.The Supreme Court's ruling said the ban was \"designed to prevent China - a designated foreign adversary - from leveraging its control over ByteDance to capture the personal data of US TikTok users\".Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump has said he would \"like to see TikTok remain alive\".Could TikTok be banned again in the US?Trump's extended deadline for TikTok's sale or ban gives ByteDance until 5 April to find a buyer.If no deal is reached the app could once again face a US ban and be pulled from mobile app stores.However, Trump could allow the law to stand but tell the Department of Justice (DoJ) to continue to ignore it.The government would be effectively telling Apple and Google they will not be punished for allowing people to download TikTok onto their devices - meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant.TikTok returned to Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store in February, after the companies were reportedly told they would not face consequences for hosting it.Trump has also said he would \"probably\" extend the deadline, if needed.Could TikTok ever be banned in the UK too?Who might buy TikTok?ByteDance has long insisted that TikTok is not for sale, and whether that has changed under Trump's presidency remains unclear.The president told reporters on 30 March there were \"a lot of potential buyers\" and \"tremendous interest\" in buying the app.He said earlier in March his administration was talking to four different groups about a potential sale.Trump appears to want to find a compromise that complies with the spirit rather than the letter of law.He has also floated the idea of TikTok being jointly owned - telling reporters he was seeking a 50-50 partnership between \"the United States\" and ByteDance.Meanwhile, several names have been floated as potential buyers of the company.Trump said he would be open to selling TikTok to Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, as well as Elon Musk.Previous names linked with buying TikTok include billionaire Frank McCourt and the Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary - a celebrity investor on Shark Tank, the US version of Dragon's Den.Alexis Ohanian, who co-founded Reddit, said in a post on X in March he had joined Mr McCourt's bid. Other Chinese-owned platforms, such as Xiaohongshu - known as RedNote among its US users - have also seen rapid growth in the US and the UK.MrBeastSocial mediaTikTokElon MuskTrump inauguration 2025Donald Trump \"Chief marketing officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok,\" said Kelsey Chickering, an analyst at market research company Forrester.Other potential winners include Twitch, which made its name by hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok.

        "article_text": "Water companies released raw sewage into England's rivers and seas for a record 3.61 million hours last year, a slight increase on 2023.\nThe data released by Environment Agency on Thursday showed that although the number of spills was down each spill lasted longer on average - resulting in a higher total number of hours.\nSome spilling can be legal, but concern has been mounting amongst scientists about the harm that regular sewage spilling is causing the country's aquatic life.\nWater UK, the industry body, said sewage spills are a \"disgrace\" but has committed to a programme of investment worth \u00a3104bn over the next five years.\n\"These figures are disgraceful and are a stark reminder of how years of underinvestment have led to water companies discharging unacceptable levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes, and seas,\" said Environment Secretary Steve Reed.\nHis views were echoed by Water UK Chief Executive David Henderson: \"Any sewage flowing into waterways is a disgrace. Unfortunately, it's a system fault that we have in our network which mixes rainwater and wastewater. Nobody wants to see any spill of sewage in our waterways.\"\nEngland, like much of the world, has a combined sewage system meaning that rainwater and sewage share the same pipes. In some instances, when there is too much rain, treatment works can be overwhelmed, and sewage is spilled via overflow points into the country's rivers, lakes and seas to prevent a back up to the system.\nThis practice is legal. But previous investigations by the BBC and Environment Agency have revealed that sewage has also been spilled by water companies under dry conditions in breach of their permits.\nWater companies collectively oversee more than 15,000 of these overflow sites and this was the first year where all sites were monitored, revealing for the first time the extent of spilling.\nSewage was spilt for 3.614 million hours in 2024 compared to 3.606 million hours in 2023. \nCEO of River Action, James Wallace, said: \"A year on from last year's catastrophic pollution figures, the true scale of the UK's water crisis is only now coming to light. The figures have barely budged, testament to the deepening sewage scandal.\"\nIn 2022, Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical office for the UK, outlined the serious health risks sewage spills can pose for those using the country's waterways. Chief amongst them is bacteria from human faeces which he said can \"increase the risk of significant infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria\".\nSewage also poses significant environmental risks \u2013 it increases nutrients in the water leading to algal blooms which then eventually denies other wildlife \u2013 like fish - oxygen. These spills also have been shown to introduce microplastics, drugs and sanitary products into rivers and seas.\nThe River Ver in St Albans is one such location - the banks are littered with condoms, tampon applicators and wet wipes likely from sewage releases from nearby Markyate sewage treatment works owned by Thames Water. This rare chalk stream \u2013 one of around 200 worldwide \u2013 which supports important wildlife like water voles, saw more than 3,300 hours of spills in 2024.\nOf the spills a Thames Water spokesperson said: \"The Markyate area experienced one of the wettest years on record in 2024 which has caused excessive amounts of groundwater which has infiltrated into the network. This has resulted in the system being overwhelmed which has led to discharges into the river.\"\nLiberal Democrats Leader Ed Davey said the scale of spilling showed that the sector regulator, Ofwat, was not up to the task.\n\"This has to be the final nail in the coffin for Ofwat, a regulator that has time and again proven it is completely inadequate to protect customers and our beautiful environment,\" he said.\nIn October, the government launched an Independent Water Commission, chaired by former deputy Bank of England governor Sir Jon Cunliffe, to look into the sector - including the effectiveness of Ofwat.\nAn Ofwat spokesperson said: \"Where companies miss their targets, they will be penalised and money will be returned to customers. In parallel, companies will be held to account for past failures through our ongoing enforcement work into the operation and maintenance of sewage works and networks.\"\nThe Markyate site is one of a number across the country that is due an upgrade as part of a five-year \u00a3104bn investment programme by water companies \u2013 with \u00a324bn going specifically to improving infrastructure.\nThese upgrades will be paid largely through bill rises \u2013 which are due to take effect from 1 April \u2013 and will see the average annual bill hit \u00a3603. This has angered consumer groups and environmental charities who argue that the burden of upgrades should be carried by shareholders not households.\nProf Ewan McGaughey, Professor of Law at Kings College London, said: \"The water companies have paid over \u00a385bn out to shareholders since privatisation and that means they haven't been able to put the money into infrastructure.\"\nOfwat and the industry have previously denied the figure\u2013 which comes from University of Greenwich research \u2013 is as high, but there is agreement that significant investment is required.\nPhillip Clisham, specialist adviser to the Institution of Civil Engineers on water and sanitation, has worked in the industry for more than three decades, and said the challenge of fixing the issue has been \"underestimated\".\nHe said the two main solutions are building bigger storm tanks \u2013 which produce a huge amount of planet warming emissions in their construction \u2013 or to reduce excess rainwater by increasing green areas and the use of sustainable urban drainage systems.\nIt is this second solution that is preferable for the environment, he said, but it requires coordination between government, planning officers and housing developers \u2013 and takes longer to implement.\n\"A lot of this work is not as easy as it might seem from the outside in reality.\n\"I think it would be preferable for me to go a bit slower, get it right. But politically there's an awful lot of pressure to fix things now, and I do worry about the next 5 years,\" he said.\nAdditional reporting by Becky Dale, Rob England and Erwan Rivault",

        "article_text": "The famed chef and author tells the BBC's Katty Kay that it was finding academia too \u201cesoteric\u201d that led him to seek out a simpler path: to help the world simplify its food.\nYotam Ottolenghi's singular style of cooking has been embraced across the globe. Focusing on simple ingredients and treating food as a way to bring friends and family together, he's become a renowned chef, a best-selling author and a touchstone for home cooks looking to incorporate global flavours into their everyday rotations.\nThe chef, father and former philosophy student explains to BBC special correspondent Katty Kay, in her interview series Influential, that having parents who cooked helped shape his path. However, he says that it was the sense of belonging that came with cooking \u2013 not family expectations \u2013 that truly drew him in.\n\"There was a quiet expectation that I would probably become an academic,\" he says. \"I don't remember having a conversation, which must have happened. 'What do you want to be when you grow up?' I don't remember that.\"\nHis parents were both in education \u2013 his father, Michael, was a chemistry professor at Jerusalem's Hebrew University \u2013 but Ottolenghi notes that his folks both had experience in the kitchen.\n\"Food was very important. We had good ingredients, good cooking. Both my parents were good cooks,\" he says. \"My father used to cook a lot because he worked more flexible hours. My mother was a head teacher at school [...] She also cooked but he cooked even more.\"\nThe 56-year-old chef \u2013 who has authored 11 cookbooks \u2013 tells Kay that rather than having an epiphany about his future path, he saw the kitchen as a space for curiosity and play, something that he's now passed onto his own children.\n\"My kids \u2013 I've got a 9 year old [and an] 11 year old \u2013 they play, you know?\" he says. \"They go in the kitchen and they make an omelette and this and that. I call it cooking as play. So, I used to do a bit of that but I wasn't obsessive about cooking.\"\nBefore making his name in the culinary world, Ottolenghi dabbled in philosophy but found the subject matter too isolating and \"esoteric\".\n\"The conversation was being held amongst a group of, like, four people, you know like groundbreaking stuff but actually nobody was participating,\" he said of his time in university, where he tackled topics like the meaning of photography and what images mean to their viewers. Instead of that very specialised field, he turned his focus to something simpler, literally.\nIn 2018, following the success of his eponymous Notting Hill caf\u00e9 and shop, Ottolenghi published his fifth cookbook, Simple, distilling all the techniques and preparations that he'd become known for into something accessible and approachable.\n\"Food is a language that everybody understands,\" he says. What surprised him about that, however, was that the books started to eclipse the food. \"Rather than just being a book to sell and share, the publishing arm of Ottolenghi became the dog wagging the tail in this respect. The books became the main thing, almost.\"\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay\nWatch\u00a0Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on\u202fYouTube.\nThe books were a way for fans of the restaurant and of Ottolenghi's pared-down, flavour-forward recipes to access that world at home. He tells Kay that he hopes to be part of a movement to take cooking from being a chore into something healing and restorative.\n\"Home-style cooking and family-style serving are way more popular now than they used to be. I really put that down to, first of all, cost of living, but also Covid. In that moment, we understood that actually food should be healing rather than just one of all other activities that we do all day long that push us.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Misty Copeland is 'not scared' to face a career beyond dance\n\u2022 Ina Garten on her internet appeal: 'Young people don't have mom in the kitchen'\n\u2022 Entrepreneur Jane Wurwand on why 'high-touch will overshadow high-tech' in business\nFans soon saw the changes in his books, shifting from the exact recipes served at his restaurants to something less haute cuisine and more streamlined, boasting titles like Simple, Plenty and his latest, Comfort.\n\"I think since Simple, I have been spending more of my time thinking, 'What does it actually mean to cook this recipe?' You know, 'When do I cook \u2013 when does one cook it? How much effort goes into it?'\" he says. \"Funnily, from a grand old age talking to younger chefs, I say to them, 'Is someone actually going to cook this?' I want people to cook my food.\"\nThat pared-down approach has even turned \"Ottolenghi\" into an adjective \u2013 used to describe food that offers high impact with few ingredients and straightforward techniques. He remains humble, brushing off the distinction and putting the focus back on his desire to make cooking comforting.\n\"Food really is one of those activities that shouldn't induce anxiety. It's as simple as that,\" he says.\n--\n\u00a0If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",
