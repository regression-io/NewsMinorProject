He was straight away part of the group, it's very impressive.

How England's players rated\nFormer England defender Matt Upson, watching the game for BBC Radio 5 Live, said the youngster, who was awarded player of the match, had a \"brilliant evening\".\n\"I think he was absolutely superb,\" Upson said. \"To manage and handle that occasion in the manner he did, with the very limited senior football he has had, really speaks volumes about how good a player he is and how far he can go.\"\nIt has been quite the season for Lewis-Skelly, who has played more games than even he might have been expecting after impressing on Arsenal's pre-season US tour.\nAfter making his debut against Manchester City in September, Lewis-Skelly has played 26 matches for Mikel Arteta's side, with another academy graduate, Ethan Nwaneri, also featuring regularly.\nFormer Arsenal, Chelsea and England left-back Ashley Cole told BBC Sport earlier this week: \"[Lewis-Skelly has] burst on to the scene in the last year and a half. He's just got to keep playing well for Arsenal and in the senior team with England.\n\"But what I would say is you've got be careful with these young players - they're special and they're precious and you have to take your time sometimes.\"\nDespite the rapid rise, it hasn't all been plain sailing for the young full-back.\nHe has twice been sent off - in the win over Wolves in January and the home defeat by West Ham in February - although the first of those red cards was later rescinded on appeal.\nDebutants Dan Burn and Lewis-Skelly pose for a photograph after the win against Albania\nFormer Arsenal centre-back Per Mertesacker is now the club's academy manager and has known Lewis-Skelly since he was part of the under-12 squad, having first joined the Gunners aged nine.\nThe Islington-born youngster's rise is even more impressive when you consider left-back is not even his natural position.\nHe came through the academy as a central midfielder - but has gone from strength to strength in an 'inverted' full-back role.\n\"I don't think there's a particular moment where you see that he would have a good chance to make it to the first team,\" said Mertesacker earlier this year.\n\"I knew Myles from when he was an under-12 and going to youth tournaments with all the ups and downs. Sometimes you win and everyone is excited - and sometimes you lose and you start crying.\n\"It's just about understanding where everyone is on their journey.\n\"With Myles, whatever challenges we put in front of him he seems to be really comfortable and ready.\n\"That's probably for me his main trait. If you can stay as cool as possible in those challenging moments then you have a good chance to get an opportunity.\"\nLewis-Skelly's mum Marcia Lewis knows better than most the jeopardy involved in a young player's early career.\nShe runs a platform called NO1Fan.Club, that provides a support network for parents navigating youth football and helps show alternative pathways in the industry for those who don't quite make it.\nSpeaking to BBC Sport last September, Lewis said about her son: \"He is not an Arsenal first-team player, he is an academy player, he has not 'made it'.\n\"He backs himself, we back him, but the realities are what they are... he is competing with multi-million pound players all over the world.\"\nMertesacker said \"unconditional\" support and a \"really good foundation from home\" have been vital to Lewis-Skelly's rise.\n\"It's not always an upward curve, for anyone. When it comes to the first team and the challenges that are there and the opportunities, it's not easy.\"",

That doesn't include the Wellingtons, Blenheims, Hurricanes, Mosquitos\u2026 she flew 82 different types.\"\nBut the ATA's women were often met with disbelief and ridicule, with fighter pilots sometimes refusing to hand over their aircraft and officers accusing the \"silly girls\" of poor flying after they had skilfully wrestled damaged planes to the ground.\n\"They got over all the prejudice with humour most of the time,\" said Ms Adkins.\n\"Whenever there was a crash, there was an inquiry to see whether it was the pilot or the plane's fault and it was always the plane's fault.\n\"Mum said she landed many a plane without undercarriage.\"\nOut of 168 women in the ATA, 16 died, but despite the danger and discrimination, the women regarded their jobs as a privilege.\n\"At her age it was a big adventure,\" said Ms Adkins. \"They took the prejudice because they felt amazingly lucky.\n\"There weren't loos, there were only urinals, so they used to go behind the hangar.\n\"They could not eat in the mess because they were women so they use to eat outside with their food on a tray.\n\"Their uniform was a skirt. Eventually they were allowed to wear trousers for flying but, even then, there was a sign outside saying 'will women please remove their trousers before entering the mess'.\"\nMs Adkins said, on one occasion, her mother was promoted but it was quickly withdrawn.\nShe also wrote to obtain official dispatches to prove her mother had gained her RAF wings in 1953 because people within the air force did not believe her.\n\"They did not get medals, they weren't even allowed to get promoted,\" said Ms Adkins.\n\"She was promoted by mistake.\n\"Her commandant thought she was good and sent off for her to be promoted and they issued it, then withdrew it.\n\"She was immensely proud of getting her RAF wings, which no one believed.\n\"That must have been so hard in her lifetime, that RAF people did not believe her.\"\nAfter the war, Mrs Moggridge completed her commercial flight training.\nBut when she made history by becoming Britain's first woman airline captain, she was not allowed to speak on the plane's tannoy in case the passengers were alarmed to hear a woman's voice.\nMrs Moggridge died in 2004 and her ashes were scattered over Dunkeswell Airfield, Devon, from a Spitfire.\nThe aircraft was ML407, which she had been the first to fly in 1944, straight from the factory.\nMs Adkins continues her mother's legacy by giving talks at airfields, clubs and events.\n\"I think it's really important to get the story out there,\" she said.\n\"There are no books or films with women pilots. Girls do not have enough women pilot heroines.\"\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram. ",

        "article_text": "One of the most talked-about TV shows of recent years, Netflix's hard-hitting drama Adolescence, has been the hot topic of discussion this week, from the House of Commons to US talk shows to the gates of the scriptwriter's son's school.\nThose discussions have been sparked by the fictional story of a 13-year-old boy who is accused of stabbing a girl, and the factors that could have turned him into a killer.\n\"I've had lots of responses from people I haven't heard from for years, telling me about conversations they're now having with their children,\" writer Jack Thorne says. \"That's really gratifying.\n\"My son's headteacher stopped me at the school gates to say, 'I'd like to talk to you about this, and I'd like to think about what our school can do and what other schools can do',\" Thorne adds.\n\"The conversations seem to be starting in all sorts of different places.\"\nThorne is now calling for the government to take \"radical action\" to help tackle the issues the programme raises.\nChief among them are social media and the influence of incel (involuntary celibate) ideas, which encourage men to blame women for their lack of relationships and opportunities.\nBut the drama, which Thorne created with actor Stephen Graham, is not just pointing the finger at incel culture, the writer tells the BBC.\n\"I really hope this is a drama that suggests that Jamie is like this because of a whole number of complicated factors.\"\nHis parents, school and friends are all shown as playing a part in various ways.\nBut Jamie, played by Owen Cooper, is bullied on social media to make him feel ugly, and is exposed to incel messaging and skewed views on sexual violence.\n\"He is this vulnerable kid, and then he hears this stuff which makes sense to him about why he's isolated, why he's alone, why he doesn't belong, and he ingests it. He doesn't have the filters to understand what's appropriate,\" Thorne says.\n\"At this age, with all these different pressures on him and with the peculiarities of his society around him, he starts to believe that the only way to reset this balance is through violence.\"\nThe writer went down similar online wormholes himself on sites like 4Chan and Reddit in order to see the world through Jamie's eyes.\nHe found that these messages were not simply coming from the obvious places.\n\"It was far from just Andrew Tate. It was not those big guns of the manosphere,\" he says.\n\"It was the smaller blogs and vlogs and the little bits like people talking about a video game, but then explaining through that video game why women hate you.\n\"That was the stuff that I found most disturbing.\"\nThese issues aren't new, but the show has come as others are also discussing the dangerous messages aimed at boys and young men.\nOn Wednesday, former England football manager Sir Gareth Southgate delivered a speech warning against \"callous, manipulative and toxic influencers\".\n\"They are as far away as you could possibly get from the role models our young men need in their lives,\" he said.\nThorne says Sir Gareth is \"amazing\" - but he believes the solution is about more than having better role models.\n\"We've been having that conversation since I was a kid,\" the writer says. \"This has got to be a point where we do something a bit more radical than that. It's not about role models.\n\"Role models obviously can have a huge impact on people. But truthfully, we've got to change the culture that they're consuming and the means by which our technology is facilitating this culture.\n\"It was a really interesting speech, but I was hoping he was going to propose more radical things than he did.\"\nSo what could more radical solutions be?\nThis week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told Parliament he's been watching the \"very good\" drama with his teenage children.\nViolence carried out by young men who are influenced by what they see online is  \"abhorrent and we have to tackle it\", and is \"also a matter of culture\", he told the Commons.\nThorne hopes the PM will get the message that \"there's a crisis happening in our schools, and we need to think about how to stop boys from harming girls, and each other\".\n\"That's going to take a mass of different things to facilitate in schools and in homes, and that requires government help,\" he says.\nHe urges Sir Keir to \"rather urgently\" consider a smartphone ban in schools and a \"digital age of consent\", similar to Australia, which has passed a law banning children under 16 from using social media.\nThe writer has also suggested extending that to all smartphone use and gaming.\n\"I think we should be doing what Australia is doing, and separating our children from this pernicious disease of thought that is infecting them,\" he says.\nA ban would be a tough sell to teenagers, though.\nThorne appeared on BBC Two's Newsnight this week alongside three men aged 18, 19 and 21.\nWhen asked about a social media ban for under-16s, they had mixed feelings.\nOne said it was \"a great idea, within reason\", another said it would be \"quite unfair\", while the third was against the idea, arguing that \"social media has brought a lot of good to young generations as well\".\nFor Thorne, the question about how to police smartphones and social media is about to come very close to home.\nHis son is eight, and Thorne says he wants to make sure he establishes \"a method of communicating with him\" as he grows up. Soon, he will want his own phone.\nWhile working on the series, he has been thinking about how to handle his son's future use of technology. \"And I'm still processing how to do it.\"\nResearching and writing Adolescence has opened his eyes about the challenges facing young people and parents, he says. But how to tackle them? That's the hardest part.",

Inflation, which measures the rate at which prices rise, currently remains above the Bank's 2% target, at 3%.\nThe Bank's Monetary Policy committee (MPC), which sets rates, voted by a majority of eight to one in favour of holding at 4.5%.\nThe base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The relatively higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.\nAbout 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so the latest decision will not have any immediate impact on monthly repayments.\nMore than eight in 10 customers have fixed-rate deals, so they face higher repayment costs when deals end. \nMortgage rates have been edging down recently. On Thursday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.33%, while the average five-year fix was 5.18%.\nLouise Gibson, who lives in a one-bedroom flat in Epsom, Surrey, is facing much higher repayments when her five-year fixed rate mortgage at 1.52% ends in October.\nThe volunteering manager said she was already cutting back her spending by going out less with friends and to the theatre.\n\"I'm petrified about what the next five years will look like and I have no idea about how I am going to find hundreds of pounds extra to pay for my mortgage,\" the 46-year-old said.\nMs Gibson said she was considering extending her mortgage term to reduce her monthly payments.\n\nWhile inflation is much lower than in recent years, households are still feeling the pain of higher prices and are set to be hit by a host of higher bills for water, energy and council tax from April.\nDirect debit failures increased by 2% in February compared with January, driven in part by people missing loan and mortgage repayments, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nTrade tariffs imposed by the US also threaten to push up prices for UK businesses exporting across the Atlantic. The Bank said most firms were in \"wait and see\" mode, as they also face a hike in National Insurance contributions (NICs) next month.\nThe Bank said UK exporters were \"nervous\" of the potential impact of tariffs.\n\"We'll be looking very closely at how the global and domestic economies are evolving,\" Mr Bailey said.\nUS President Donald Trump has imposed a range of tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods coming into the US from some of its top trading partners, sparking a trade war with the likes of the EU and Canada.\nTrump has argued the measures will boost American industry but with tariffs being paid by the domestic company importing goods, economists say the measures could lead to price rises for consumers.\nThe Bank said more firms were pausing or freezing hiring in the wake of tax rises and some had cut back on investment plans. It added pay growth for workers was set to ease over the year.\nThere have been three rate cuts since August 2024 after previous hikes to try to combat high inflation, which was driven by energy and food prices soaring in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine.\nMr Bailey said the Bank expected a \"bit of a pick-up\" in inflation this year but added it would gradually fall over time.\n\"We have to be quite careful at this point,\" he said, when questioned why rates had not been cut on Thursday.\nThe theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing. \nBut it is a balancing act as high interest rates can harm the economy as businesses hold off on investing in production and jobs. \nThe Bank has forecast inflation to rise further this year to 3.7%, and stay above its 2% target until the end of 2027.\nIt previously halved its economic growth estimate for the year in a blow to the government, which has made growing the economy its main priority.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said there was \"still work to do to ease the cost of living\", adding she was \"determined to go further and faster\" to kickstart economic growth.\nBut shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Reeves's Budget in October was to blame for inflation remaining above the Bank's target.\nLiberal Democrat treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper called on Reeves to reverse her decision to increase NICs for employers, arguing economic growth was being \"snuffed out\".",

        "article_text": "Indonesia's parliament has passed controversial changes to legislation that will allow its military a bigger role in government.\nCritics warn that the move could return Indonesia to the dark days of Suharto's military dictatorship, which lasted 32 years until he was forced out of office in 1998.\nThe revisions backed by President Prabowo Subianto - a former special forces commander and Suharto's son-in-law - allow military officers to take up positions in government without first retiring or resigning from the armed forces.\nHundreds of pro-democracy activists have camped outside parliament since Wednesday evening to protest at the changes.\n\"The essence of democracy is that the military should not engage in politics. The military should only manage barracks and national defence,\" said Wilson, an activist with the Indonesian Association of Families of the Disappeared (KontraS), a group advocating for activists who disappeared during a crackdown in 1997 and 1998.\n\"Since 1998, there has been a creeping murder of democracy. And today marks its peak. Democracy has been killed by the House of Representatives,\" Wilson told the BBC. \nThe revisions allow active military personnel to hold positions in 14 civilian institutions, up from 10. They also raise retirement age by several years for most ranks. Highest-ranking four-star generals can now serve until 63, up from 60. \nBy Thursday evening, the crowd of protesters outside parliament had grown to nearly a thousand. \"Return the military to the barracks!\" \"Against militarism and oligarchy,\" read the banners they held.\nPolice officers and military personnel stood guard around the protesters. \nWhile there have been efforts over the past 25 years to limit the military's involvement in politics and governance, local human rights watchdog Imparsial found that nearly 2,600 active-duty officers were serving in civilian roles even before the law's revision.\nThe changes signal a \"broader consolidation of power\" under Prabowo, said Dedi Dinarto, lead Indonesia analyst at public policy advisory firm Global Counsel. \nThat the main opposition party endorsed the changes - despite initial opposition - further underscores this shift, he noted. \n\"By embedding military perspectives into civilian domains, the legislation could reshape Indonesia's policy direction, potentially prioritising stability and state control over democratic governance and civil liberties,\" Mr Dinarto said. \nThe armed forces' \"dual function\", where they are given control of security and administrative affairs, was central to Suharto's regime.\nFor some Indonesians, Prabowo epitomises that authoritarian era. It was he who led the special forces unit accused of abducting activists in 1997 and 1998.\nMany had feared that his return to political power and becoming president would erode Indonesia's hard-won but fragile democracy.\nSince taking office last October, Prabowo has already been expanding the military's involvement in public areas. His flagship $4bn free-meal programme for children and pregnant women, for instance, receives logistical support from the armed forces.\nDefending the amendments on Thursday, defence minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin told parliament \"geopolitical changes and global military technology\" require the military to transform to tackle \"conventional and non conventional conflicts\". \n\"We will never disappoint the Indonesians in keeping our sovereignty,\" he said. \nHowever some rights groups argue that increasing military control in public affairs beyond defence will undermine impartiality. \n\"How can active-duty officers in the Attorney General's Office remain impartial when they are still bound by military command?\" asked Virdika Rizky Utama, a researcher at Jakarta-based think-tank PARA Syndicate, Benar News reports. \n\"If the military gains influence over the justice system, who will hold them accountable?\" \n\"President Prabowo appears intent on restoring the Indonesian military's role in civilian affairs, which were long characterised by widespread abuses and impunity,\" said Andreas Harsono, senior Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch. \n\"The government's rush to adopt these amendments undercuts its expressed commitment to human rights and accountability.\" \nKontraS also noted that the government's \"rush to amend the [law] stands in stark contrast to its prolonged inaction on other critical human rights commitments\".\n\"This long struggle cannot stop just because the law has been passed. There is only one word: Resist,\" said Sukma Ayu, an undergraduate at Universitas Muhammadiyah Prof. Hamka in Jakarta. \n\"We will continue protesting until we claim victory... We have no choice but to occupy the 'house of the people',\" she said. ",

Last year's player contract dispute has been resolved and with three-time Premiership Women's Rugby (PWR) winner Sean Lynn in place as the new head coach, a close encounter could be back on the cards this weekend.\nScotland welcomed record crowds to Hive Stadium last year and home support could well prove the difference between these well-matched sides.\nWomen's Six Nations team-by-team guide\nWomen's Six Nations 2025: How to follow Wales on the BBC\nScotland give an international debut to Hollie Cunningham who starts in the second row alongside experienced campaigner Sarah Bonar.\nThe pack also features Anne Young and Elliann Clarke, who both earn a first Six Nations start in the front row, with Scotland stalwart Lana Skeldon lining up at hooker.\nCaptain Rachel Malcolm leads from the blindside flanker, forming a back row with Rachel McLachlan and Evie Gallagher at number eight.\nHelen Nelson and Leia Brebner-Holden are named as the half-backs with Lisa Thomson and Emma Orr resuming a threatening midfield partnership.\nChloe Rollie starts at full-back with Rhona Lloyd and Francesca McGhie on the wings.\nHead coach Bryan Easson has opted for a 6-2 split on the bench, with Evie Wills in line to make her first international appearance in three years while second row Adelle Ferrie could make her Scotland debut.\nWales have a blend of seasoned internationals and up-and-coming Celtic Challenge talent in their matchday squad.\nGloucester-Hartpury's Welsh contingent are straight back in the side after Sunday's PWR title defence, including captain Hannah Jones.\nJones has a new midfield partner in Kayleigh Powell, who usually plays fly-half or full-back, with Lleucu George preferred at 10 alongside vice-captain Keira Bevan at scrum-half.\nThree-time Olympian Jasmine Joyce-Butchers starts at full-back, with in-form Lisa Neumann and Carys Cox named on the wings.\nMaisie Davies, Jenni Scoble and Alaw Pyrs all make their first Wales start, with Davies and Scoble joining experienced hooker Carys Phillips in the front row.\nPyrs, the younger sister of replacement prop Gwenllian, packs down with lock Abbie Fleming, while Kate Williams, Bethan Lewis and Georgia Evans form a familiar looking back row.\nLynn has gone for a 5-3 split on the bench, with Kelsey Jones and Pyrs set to return from injury.\nSarra Elgan\u2019s Women\u2019s Six Nations\nScotland head coach Bryan Easson: \"They are a familiar enemy, it's always tasty and they are always close games and games that we really enjoy.\n\"Two styles that are a little bit different, it can be quite physical, it can also be a really good tactical battle as well.\n\"We know that Sean coming in is going to have a different edge with the experience he's had a Gloucester-Hartpury, with a winning team as well, a winning mentality.

        "article_text": "When Marianne Williams was told she had incurable cancer at 43 she knew she had to face it with positivity.\nMarianne was diagnosed with myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer, in November 2017, when her daughter was just 11.\n\"I count myself lucky,\" she said. \"I'm a positive person and I generally tend to look forward and try to think, 'okay, what's the positive in this?' rather than the negative.\"\nEach year she marks the anniversary of her diagnosis by putting on her Wonder Woman costume, something she ordered from her hospital bed during her early days of her treatment.\n\"I know sometimes in the cancer world no matter what cancer you've got the word positivity can be quite controversial and I don't want to sound flippant about it because for some people they don't feel positive, but I feel like I've got things to look forward to,\" said Marianne from Corntown in Vale of Glamorgan.\n\"You can only deal with it in a way that is right for you.\"\nMarianne even managed to find the positive in chemotherapy.\n\"It's grim, but actually bloody brilliant, I've lost my hair, I haven't got to shave my legs,\" said Marianne, who is married and has a daughter and two step-children.\n\"Anything positive is a small win in my opinion.\"\nMarianne was 41 when she began feeling unwell.\nShe had several bouts of tonsillitis, conjunctivitis, urinary tract infections (UTIs), sore throats, colds, a tooth infection and labyrinthitis, an inflammation of the inner ear's labyrinth.\n\"I woke up in the middle of the night with the room spinning, vomiting, I couldn't get back to bed standing up so had to crawl back to bed on my hands and knees,\" she said.\n\"You start thinking, 'okay, there's something's not quite right'.\" \nMarianne said she made countless visits to her GP but tests picked up nothing apart from the fact her white blood cells were a bit high which was attributed to her recent infections. \nThen after suffering for days with a UTI, her symptoms worsened.\n\"My face, head, hand and feet had swollen,\" she said.\n\"My stomach was enormous \u2013 I looked like I was pregnant. I'd spent the whole week with horrendous migraines, constant vomiting, dizzy spells and pain across my ribs and back.\"\nThe mum was sent to hospital where she was told she had kidney failure with just 6% kidney function and had to begin dialysis.\nA number of tests followed before she was told she had myeloma.\n\"The first thing you think when they say 'incurable' is 'am I going to die then?

        "article_text": "Prime Minister and Liberal leader Mark Carney has called an election in Canada, kickstarting five weeks of campaigning before Canadians head to the polls.\nVoting day will officially be on Monday 28 April.\nIt will be the first election in a decade without former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the ballot, and the two major parties in Canada - the Conservatives and the Liberals - are neck-and-neck in the polls, making it a race to watch.\nWhile Canadians don't vote for prime minister directly, the leader of the party that wins the most seats will traditionally become head of government.\nHere is a breakdown of the leaders of Canada's major parties.\nCarney, 60, is the incumbent prime minister of Canada, but he has only been on the job for a few days.\nHis party overwhelmingly chose him - with more than 85% of the vote - to succeed Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader earlier this month. He became prime minister shortly after, following Trudeau's resignation.\nFor many in Canada and the UK, Carney is a familiar face. He was head of both the Banks of Canada and England, serving at the former during the 2008 financial crash and the latter during Brexit.\nHe was born in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, making him the first Canadian prime minister from the north. Carney later grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, before he attended Harvard University and then Oxford, where he studied economics. \nCarney is hailed for his financial expertise. He has also taken a defiant stance against US President Donald Trump, vowing retaliation against his tariffs and stating that Canada will never become the 51st US state.\nBut Carney is politically untested. He has never been elected to public office in Canada, and this general election will be his very first. His French is also weak, which could be a liability among voters who feel strongly about preserving Canada's French-speaking heritage, especially in the province of Quebec. \nRecent polls show his party is slightly trailing behind the Conservatives, but more Canadians say they think Carney would be a better prime minister than his opponent Pierre Poilievre.\nPoilievre, 45, originally hails from Calgary, Alberta. He has been in Canadian politics for nearly two decades - first elected to the House of Commons at age 25, making him one of the youngest MPs at the time.\nSince then, he has consistently advocated for a low-tax, small government in Canada.\nHe is known for his confrontational style of politics. In recent years, Poilievre has tirelessly attacked the Liberals and Trudeau, saying that their \"disastrous\" and \"woke\" policies have worsened the quality of life in Canada, while promising a return to \"common sense politics\" if his party were to form government.\nIt is a message that has resonated with many Canadians who have been worried about the country's housing crisis, stagnant wages and high cost of living. Poilievre has led in national polls since mid-2023, and analysts had projected a near-certain win for his party in the upcoming election.\nBut the Liberal Party has since caught up to him in the polls, following Trudeau's resignation and the rise of Carney as Liberal leader.\nPoilievre has been criticised for his populist style of politics and has drawn comparisons to Trump at a time when Canadians have rejected the US President's tariffs and his rhetoric that Canada should become the \"51st state\".\nPoilievre has sought to shift his messaging since, distancing himself from Trump and vowing to put \"Canada first.\"\nTrump himself has said that Poilievre is not \"MAGA enough\", though the Conservative leader has been praised by Trump ally and tech titan Elon Musk.\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is a Quebec nationalist party that only runs candidates in the French-speaking province, meaning its leader is unlikely to become Canada's next prime minister.\nStill, they are a key player in Canadian elections, and their popularity in Quebec could determine the fate of the other major parties looking to form government.\nBlanchet has led the party since 2019. He is known for his frankness, calling Trump's 51st state rhetoric nonsense.\n\"It's enough jibber-jabber,\" Blanchet said during an address on Trump's tariffs earlier this month in Montreal. \"We can say whatever we want, but that doesn't mean we can do whatever we want.\"\nHe has also dismissed Trump's tariffs, saying: \"I'm sure there will be somebody on his plane between a basketball game and a baseball game to tell him, don't do that, because it's bad for us. I'm sure that at the end of the day, the voice of reason will prevail.\"\nOn domestic issues, Blanchet has pushed for Quebec to diversify its trade partners, and has asked for a prominent seat at Canada's economic planning table, noting that his province is home to the largest aluminium sector in the country - a commodity that has been targeted by US tariffs.\nBlanchet has also suggested that the appetite for an independent Quebec will \"come roaring back\" when and if the US-Canada relationship stabilises.\nPolling shows the Bloc - who are going into the election with 33 seats in Parliament -  have been trailing behind the Liberal Party in Quebec.\nSingh, 46, is leader of the NDP, a left-leaning party that traditionally focuses on worker and labour issues. He made history in 2017 when he became the first ethnic minority and practising Sikh to lead a major political party in Canada.\nIn 2019, the former criminal defence lawyer was elected as an MP in a British Columbia riding, where he has served in public office since.\nThe NDP had helped the Trudeau Liberal government keep its hold on power since 2021, providing needed votes in Parliament in exchange for support on progressive legislation like dental benefits for lower-income families and a national pharmacare programme covering birth control and insulin.\nBut in late 2024, Singh tore up that \"supply and confidence\" agreement, after Trudeau's cabinet directed its industrial relations board to impose binding arbitration to end a work stoppage at Canada's two largest railways.\nAt the time, Singh had said that the Liberals \"let people down\" and didn't \"deserve another chance from Canadians\".\nBut his party has struggled to shore up support. Polls show that only 9% of Canadians intend to vote for them as of mid-March, with their ground shrinking while support for the Liberals has risen.\nA big question will be whether the NDP will be able to grow the number of seats they occupy in the House of Commons and maintain official party status. \nIn the early 2010s, the party had enough support to form the official opposition, meaning it was the party with the second-most seats in Parliament. By 2021, their seat number had shrunk to 24 out of 338.\nAs Canada gears up for an election this year, the BBC wants to hear from voters across the country.

        "article_text": "One of the most talked-about TV shows of recent years, Netflix's hard-hitting drama Adolescence, has been the hot topic of discussion this week, from the House of Commons to US talk shows to the gates of the scriptwriter's son's school.\nThose discussions have been sparked by the fictional story of a 13-year-old boy who is accused of stabbing a girl, and the factors that could have turned him into a killer.\n\"I've had lots of responses from people I haven't heard from for years, telling me about conversations they're now having with their children,\" writer Jack Thorne says. \"That's really gratifying.\n\"My son's headteacher stopped me at the school gates to say, 'I'd like to talk to you about this, and I'd like to think about what our school can do and what other schools can do',\" Thorne adds.\n\"The conversations seem to be starting in all sorts of different places.\"\nThorne is now calling for the government to take \"radical action\" to help tackle the issues the programme raises.\nChief among them are social media and the influence of incel (involuntary celibate) ideas, which encourage men to blame women for their lack of relationships and opportunities.\nBut the drama, which Thorne created with actor Stephen Graham, is not just pointing the finger at incel culture, the writer tells the BBC.\n\"I really hope this is a drama that suggests that Jamie is like this because of a whole number of complicated factors.\"\nHis parents, school and friends are all shown as playing a part in various ways.\nBut Jamie, played by Owen Cooper, is bullied on social media to make him feel ugly, and is exposed to incel messaging and skewed views on sexual violence.\n\"He is this vulnerable kid, and then he hears this stuff which makes sense to him about why he's isolated, why he's alone, why he doesn't belong, and he ingests it. He doesn't have the filters to understand what's appropriate,\" Thorne says.\n\"At this age, with all these different pressures on him and with the peculiarities of his society around him, he starts to believe that the only way to reset this balance is through violence.\"\nThe writer went down similar online wormholes himself on sites like 4Chan and Reddit in order to see the world through Jamie's eyes.\nHe found that these messages were not simply coming from the obvious places.\n\"It was far from just Andrew Tate. It was not those big guns of the manosphere,\" he says.\n\"It was the smaller blogs and vlogs and the little bits like people talking about a video game, but then explaining through that video game why women hate you.\n\"That was the stuff that I found most disturbing.\"\nThese issues aren't new, but the show has come as others are also discussing the dangerous messages aimed at boys and young men.\nOn Wednesday, former England football manager Sir Gareth Southgate delivered a speech warning against \"callous, manipulative and toxic influencers\".\n\"They are as far away as you could possibly get from the role models our young men need in their lives,\" he said.\nThorne says Sir Gareth is \"amazing\" - but he believes the solution is about more than having better role models.\n\"We've been having that conversation since I was a kid,\" the writer says. \"This has got to be a point where we do something a bit more radical than that. It's not about role models.\n\"Role models obviously can have a huge impact on people. But truthfully, we've got to change the culture that they're consuming and the means by which our technology is facilitating this culture.\n\"It was a really interesting speech, but I was hoping he was going to propose more radical things than he did.\"\nSo what could more radical solutions be?\nThis week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told Parliament he's been watching the \"very good\" drama with his teenage children.\nViolence carried out by young men who are influenced by what they see online is  \"abhorrent and we have to tackle it\", and is \"also a matter of culture\", he told the Commons.\nThorne hopes the PM will get the message that \"there's a crisis happening in our schools, and we need to think about how to stop boys from harming girls, and each other\".\n\"That's going to take a mass of different things to facilitate in schools and in homes, and that requires government help,\" he says.\nHe urges Sir Keir to \"rather urgently\" consider a smartphone ban in schools and a \"digital age of consent\", similar to Australia, which has passed a law banning children under 16 from using social media.\nThe writer has also suggested extending that to all smartphone use and gaming.\n\"I think we should be doing what Australia is doing, and separating our children from this pernicious disease of thought that is infecting them,\" he says.\nA ban would be a tough sell to teenagers, though.\nThorne appeared on BBC Two's Newsnight this week alongside three men aged 18, 19 and 21.\nWhen asked about a social media ban for under-16s, they had mixed feelings.\nOne said it was \"a great idea, within reason\", another said it would be \"quite unfair\", while the third was against the idea, arguing that \"social media has brought a lot of good to young generations as well\".\nFor Thorne, the question about how to police smartphones and social media is about to come very close to home.\nHis son is eight, and Thorne says he wants to make sure he establishes \"a method of communicating with him\" as he grows up. Soon, he will want his own phone.\nWhile working on the series, he has been thinking about how to handle his son's future use of technology. \"And I'm still processing how to do it.\"\nResearching and writing Adolescence has opened his eyes about the challenges facing young people and parents, he says. But how to tackle them? That's the hardest part.",

        "article_text": "Prime Minister and Liberal leader Mark Carney has called an election in Canada, kickstarting five weeks of campaigning before Canadians head to the polls.\nVoting day will officially be on Monday 28 April.\nIt will be the first election in a decade without former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the ballot, and the two major parties in Canada - the Conservatives and the Liberals - are neck-and-neck in the polls, making it a race to watch.\nWhile Canadians don't vote for prime minister directly, the leader of the party that wins the most seats will traditionally become head of government.\nHere is a breakdown of the leaders of Canada's major parties.\nCarney, 60, is the incumbent prime minister of Canada, but he has only been on the job for a few days.\nHis party overwhelmingly chose him - with more than 85% of the vote - to succeed Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader earlier this month. He became prime minister shortly after, following Trudeau's resignation.\nFor many in Canada and the UK, Carney is a familiar face. He was head of both the Banks of Canada and England, serving at the former during the 2008 financial crash and the latter during Brexit.\nHe was born in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, making him the first Canadian prime minister from the north. Carney later grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, before he attended Harvard University and then Oxford, where he studied economics. \nCarney is hailed for his financial expertise. He has also taken a defiant stance against US President Donald Trump, vowing retaliation against his tariffs and stating that Canada will never become the 51st US state.\nBut Carney is politically untested. He has never been elected to public office in Canada, and this general election will be his very first. His French is also weak, which could be a liability among voters who feel strongly about preserving Canada's French-speaking heritage, especially in the province of Quebec. \nRecent polls show his party is slightly trailing behind the Conservatives, but more Canadians say they think Carney would be a better prime minister than his opponent Pierre Poilievre.\nPoilievre, 45, originally hails from Calgary, Alberta. He has been in Canadian politics for nearly two decades - first elected to the House of Commons at age 25, making him one of the youngest MPs at the time.\nSince then, he has consistently advocated for a low-tax, small government in Canada.\nHe is known for his confrontational style of politics. In recent years, Poilievre has tirelessly attacked the Liberals and Trudeau, saying that their \"disastrous\" and \"woke\" policies have worsened the quality of life in Canada, while promising a return to \"common sense politics\" if his party were to form government.\nIt is a message that has resonated with many Canadians who have been worried about the country's housing crisis, stagnant wages and high cost of living. Poilievre has led in national polls since mid-2023, and analysts had projected a near-certain win for his party in the upcoming election.\nBut the Liberal Party has since caught up to him in the polls, following Trudeau's resignation and the rise of Carney as Liberal leader.\nPoilievre has been criticised for his populist style of politics and has drawn comparisons to Trump at a time when Canadians have rejected the US President's tariffs and his rhetoric that Canada should become the \"51st state\".\nPoilievre has sought to shift his messaging since, distancing himself from Trump and vowing to put \"Canada first.\"\nTrump himself has said that Poilievre is not \"MAGA enough\", though the Conservative leader has been praised by Trump ally and tech titan Elon Musk.\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is a Quebec nationalist party that only runs candidates in the French-speaking province, meaning its leader is unlikely to become Canada's next prime minister.\nStill, they are a key player in Canadian elections, and their popularity in Quebec could determine the fate of the other major parties looking to form government.\nBlanchet has led the party since 2019. He is known for his frankness, calling Trump's 51st state rhetoric nonsense.\n\"It's enough jibber-jabber,\" Blanchet said during an address on Trump's tariffs earlier this month in Montreal. \"We can say whatever we want, but that doesn't mean we can do whatever we want.\"\nHe has also dismissed Trump's tariffs, saying: \"I'm sure there will be somebody on his plane between a basketball game and a baseball game to tell him, don't do that, because it's bad for us. I'm sure that at the end of the day, the voice of reason will prevail.\"\nOn domestic issues, Blanchet has pushed for Quebec to diversify its trade partners, and has asked for a prominent seat at Canada's economic planning table, noting that his province is home to the largest aluminium sector in the country - a commodity that has been targeted by US tariffs.\nBlanchet has also suggested that the appetite for an independent Quebec will \"come roaring back\" when and if the US-Canada relationship stabilises.\nPolling shows the Bloc - who are going into the election with 33 seats in Parliament -  have been trailing behind the Liberal Party in Quebec.\nSingh, 46, is leader of the NDP, a left-leaning party that traditionally focuses on worker and labour issues. He made history in 2017 when he became the first ethnic minority and practising Sikh to lead a major political party in Canada.\nIn 2019, the former criminal defence lawyer was elected as an MP in a British Columbia riding, where he has served in public office since.\nThe NDP had helped the Trudeau Liberal government keep its hold on power since 2021, providing needed votes in Parliament in exchange for support on progressive legislation like dental benefits for lower-income families and a national pharmacare programme covering birth control and insulin.\nBut in late 2024, Singh tore up that \"supply and confidence\" agreement, after Trudeau's cabinet directed its industrial relations board to impose binding arbitration to end a work stoppage at Canada's two largest railways.\nAt the time, Singh had said that the Liberals \"let people down\" and didn't \"deserve another chance from Canadians\".\nBut his party has struggled to shore up support. Polls show that only 9% of Canadians intend to vote for them as of mid-March, with their ground shrinking while support for the Liberals has risen.\nA big question will be whether the NDP will be able to grow the number of seats they occupy in the House of Commons and maintain official party status. \nIn the early 2010s, the party had enough support to form the official opposition, meaning it was the party with the second-most seats in Parliament. By 2021, their seat number had shrunk to 24 out of 338.\nAs Canada gears up for an election this year, the BBC wants to hear from voters across the country.

        "article_text": "With glaciers disappearing at an alarming rate, 2025 has been named the Year of International Glacier Preservation. Here's how and where to see one responsibly before it's too late.\nOn an exceptionally warm July day in 2022, certified mountain guide Andrea Milani took a lunch break from rock climbing near the Italian Dolomites' Passo Fedaia ascent. As he ate pizza with two friends, helicopters circled and ambulance sirens wailed in the distance. A massive chunk (80m wide and 25m high) had just broken off nearby Marmolada glacier, triggering an avalanche of ice, snow and debris. Milani's two friends who'd finished that descent just hours before meeting him were the lucky ones: 11 climbers tragically died that day.\n\"Now more than ever, climate change is making glacier travel more dangerous. Rising temperatures mean the snow covering crevasses and seracs becomes less reliable, increasing the risk of hidden hazards,\" says Milani, who guides climbers, skiers, bikers and hikers of all levels safely across Northern Italy with Dolomite Mountains tours.\u00a0\nThe reality is that one-third of glaciers could disappear from climate change by 2050 \u2013 and for Marmolada, it's 2040. This is why the United Nations has declared 2025 the International Year of Glaciers' Preservation. It has also set 21 March 2025 as the first annual World Day for Glaciers in partnership with Unesco and the World Meteorological Organization. The initiatives aim to mobilise governments and organisations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and implement climate adaptation strategies to protect the planet's 200,000 glaciers as the Earth warms faster than ever before.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Worldwide, human-caused climate change has melted so much ice from glaciers that the meltwater has raised global sea level 8cm since 1900,\" says Patrick Gonzalez, former principal climate change scientist for the US National Park Service and assistant director for climate and biodiversity of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\nSadly, scenes like the one at Marmolada have played out across the planet time and again. Over the past two decades, Bolivia's 18,000-year-old Chacaltaya glacier, once the world's highest ski resort, has melted completely. Italy and Switzerland were forced to redraw their shared borders last autumn due to the melt of the Matterhorn in Zermatt. And at Muir Glacier in Alaska's Glacier Bay National Park, climate change has melted away a layer of ice as tall as New York's One World Trade Center.\nThese slow-moving, fast-retreating dense masses of ice, snow and rock that have accumulated in the mountains over centuries on every continent except Australia are glaring evidence that man-made climate change exists. If all glaciers were to melt today, sea level would increase by a half a metre, leaving entire cities underwater, devastating ecosystems and depriving two billion people of drinking water.\nThoughtful Travel\nWant to travel better? Thoughtful Travel is a series on the ways people behave while away, from ethics to etiquette and more.\nBut travellers can still visit glaciers like Marmolada safely \u2013 they just need to know how. In fact, research has shown that seeing a glacier in nature can prompt us to protect the planet. Glaciers are now a symbol of its fragility, reminding us how, through simple cost-effective solutions like walking, biking and purchasing solar and wind energy, we can help limit global warming.\nWhile 91% of glaciers are in Antarctica, many can be found in more accessible parts of the world, so go visit one; it's easier than ever, just make sure you proceed with caution.\nMountaineers, skiers and nature lovers from all over the world flock to the Canadian Rockies for irresistible high alpine terrain, and that includes the Columbia Icefields. Straddling the majestic Banff and Jasper national parks on the Continental Divide, it's all that's left of an ice mass that once enveloped most of western Canada's mountains. Ride the Ice Explorer train to the Athabasca Glacier to walk the glass-floored Columbia Icefield Skywalk with sweeping views over the waterfalls coming from the Sunwapta Valley's glacier and the famous mountain goats of Glacier Lookout along the cliffs.\nIf you are bold enough to climb the glacier, go with an experienced Yamnuska Mountain Adventures guide. You'll learn about glacier dynamics, route finding and risk management on one of the largest icefields in North America. It's an adventure that demands respect and preparation, says Yamnuska mountain guide Jesse de Montigny.\n\"The primary danger is crevasses \u2013 deep, often hidden cracks in the ice that can be difficult to detect, especially when covered by snow,\" says de Montigny. \"Weather conditions can change rapidly, creating whiteout conditions that make navigation difficult. Proper rope systems, glacier travel techniques and crevasse rescue knowledge are essential for mitigating risk in these environments.\"\nMendenhall is one of more than 100,000 glaciers in what's appropriately called the \"Glacier State\". Inside the Tongass National Forest, 19km from Juneau along the Alaska-Canada border in south-eastern Alaska, is the Juneau Icefield. It's also one of Alaska's only glaciers that can be reached for viewing by car or shuttle; start your adventure at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Visiting Antarctica or the Arctic? Here's how to minimise your impact\n\u2022 Why humans are drawn to the ends of the Earth\n\u2022 Antarctic tourism: Should we just say no?\nSince it has been melting excessively in recent years, you'll need to join a helicopter tour to get more than a look out at the glacier; to hike it (or fly over it) try Alaska Shore Excursions. (The glacier's ice caves are no longer safely accessible.)\nNote: As of 13 March, the majority of the glacier's Forest Service park rangers and staff were laid off due to federal cuts, despite the tourist season commencing in April. Meanwhile the Juneau Icefield is melting five times faster than it was in the 1980s.\nIt's worth overcoming your fear of heights for the \"Queen of the Dolomites\", located within Northern Italy's 12 interconnected Dolomiti Superski resorts. Take the cable car up, and whether you ride back down or ski the glacier, make a stop at Europe's highest museum to learn about World War One tunnels dug by Austro-Hungarian soldiers who lived there for months in their glacier \"Ice City\".\nIf you decide to brave mountaineering or climbing, be sure to hire a guide. Miliani always tells his Dolomite Mountains tour groups to stay aware and read the environment. \"Glacier mountaineering isn't just about skill; it's about preparation, experience and respect for the environment, he says. His advice? Distance yourself from the next climber (by 8-12m) moving along the rope at a steady pace and avoid sudden movements that could throw off your balance. Check the map and the weather (the colder the better), and most importantly, the avalanche forecast. Wear the right gear, pack a self-rescue kit, GPS, compass, altimeter and radio or satellite phone. And don't leave home without taking a first-aid course.\u00a0\n\"Crevasses can be sneaky, hiding under thin layers of snow, so knowing how to spot and test them is crucial,\" he adds. \"If you're crossing a snow bridge [an arc formed by snow across a crevasse] make sure it's stable before stepping onto it. And let's not forget seracs and avalanche zones \u2013 don't hang around under them longer than necessary.\"\nIt's just got easier to visit Chamonix's Mer de Glace (also known as Montenvers), only second in size in the Alps to Switzerland's Aletsch Glacier. This iridescent ice aqua glacier \u2013 transmitting a blue wavelength and absorbing all the other colours \u2013 has become harder to view after losing 6m of thickness a year.\nSince last year, though, visitors' can now see Mer de Glace via a new gondola from a 1,913m-high panoramic platform. There's an on-site restaurant, coffee shop, museum and even an ice cave that visitors can still walk through \u2013 originally cut into the glacier in 1992 by high mountain guides and now re-dug every summer because, like icebergs, glaciers are always moving, more than ever now. Access the gondola by taking the train up the mountain from Chamonix town centre.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Flights around the world have been disrupted after Heathrow Airport closed due to a fire at a nearby electrical substation.\nHeathrow, the UK's busiest airport, said on Friday afternoon that they will \"restart\" some flights later after the blaze at North Hyde substation in Hayes, west London. The airport said it hoped \"to run a full operation\" on Saturday,\nMore than 1,300 flights were affected, tracking website Flightradar24 said, and passengers have been told not to travel to the airport unless their airline has advised them to. \nThe National Grid said earlier that an \"interim solution\" has been found to allow power to be restored to customers including Heathrow Airport, saying that the network has been \"reconfigured to restore all customers impacted\".\nHere's what we know so far.\nA fire at an electrical substation in west London, which supplies Heathrow, caused a major power outage at the airport, prompting its closure. \nIt is not yet known what caused the fire at the substation, but Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said there was no suggestion of foul play as counter-terrorism police investigate.\n\"The counter-terrorism command has specific capabilities and capacities that mean that they are used to conducting investigations at pace,\" she said, adding that they were needed as the fire took place next to a critical piece of national infrastructure.\nEmergency services were first called to Nestles Avenues in Hayes, west London at 23:23 GMT on Thursday. \nJonathan Smith,  London Fire Brigade (LFB) deputy commissioner, said the fire at the electrical substation involved a transformer containing 25,000 litres of cooling oil.\nThe fire was \"very visible and significant,\" he said. The LFB said the fire was under control by 06:28.\nOn Friday evening, the service said the fire was \"believed to be non-suspicious\" and the investigation will \"focus on the electrical distribution equipment\".\nCommander Simon Messinger, who is leading the Metropolitan Police's response to the fire, said: \"Various specialist investigators continue to examine the scene and it is expected to take some time before full assessments can be completed.\"\nBut he repeated that \"at this stage, there remains no indication of any foul play\".\nThe substation is about a mile and a half away from the airport. \nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the substation's back-up generator \"appears to have been knocked out\".\nVideos shared on social media showed tall flames and plumes of smoke billowing from the substation overnight. \nPeople living nearby were advised to keep doors and windows closed to avoid smoke inhalation. \nWith Heathrow being such a busy airport for passenger journeys and global trade, questions have been raised over whether it has back-up systems in the event of power cuts.\nThe BBC understands that Heathrow does have back-up power for its key systems, but kickstarting these alternative power supplies for the whole airport takes time.\nA source said it was not possible to switch the power back on immediately.\nA Heathrow source also told the BBC that they have \"multiple sources\" of energy at the airport \u2013 with diesel generators and \"uninterruptable power supplies\" in place.\nThey added when the power outage happened the back up systems \"all operated as expected\".\nThe systems, however, are not enough to run the whole airport \u2013 hence the decision to close it down.\nAnd even once the power is back on, there are countless systems which need to be rebooted and checked to ensure they are working properly and are stable.\nIt is unclear why Heathrow's own back-up systems were not adequate to keep the airport running when one critical component of its energy supply was knocked out, and it is also unclear why the National Grid distribution network was not set up to supply sufficient electricity.\nA Heathrow source said these questions would be investigated.\nThe first flights since the fire took off from and landed at Heathrow on Friday evening with the airport initially saying it would prioritise repatriation and relocation of aircraft.\nPassengers were urged not to travel to the airport unless their airline had advised them to do so on Friday.\nThe airport is hoping to run a normal service on Saturday, Heathrow's chief executive Thomas Woldbye said.\nThe travel disruption affected many other airports, as airlines cancelled and diverted flights.\nThe airport has apologised for the disruption and has advised passengers to contact their airlines for further information.\nIts helpline number is 020 8757 2700. \nLate on Friday, the Department for Transport said on X that restrictions on overnight flights at Heathrow had been temporarily lifted to ease congestion.\nOnly 5,800 flights are allowed to take off or land at Heathrow between 23:30 and 06:00 each year, under government restrictions designed to limit how much noise the airport makes at night.\nAt least 1,351 flights to and from Heathrow were affected on Friday, Flightradar24 said, with some 120 affected aircraft already in the air when the closure was announced.\nThe Foreign Office has advised UK citizens who are abroad and require urgent assistance to contact their teams via an online query form. \nAir Canada and United Airlines have announced they will be resuming some or all of their flights from Friday evening. Virgin Atlantic has said it hopes to operate \"a near full schedule\" on Saturday with limited cancellations, adding that it will continuously review flights.\nGatwick Airport told the BBC it was aware of the situation at Heathrow Airport and stands \"ready to support as required\".\nSeveral of Australia's Qantas airline planes have been diverted from London to Paris, with other flights likely to be affected, it said. \nBritish Airways has cancelled all its short-haul flights due to operate to and from the airport on Friday. \nSome long-haul flights - including to Cape Town, Johannesburg, Singapore and Rio de Janeiro - were later given clearance to depart from Heathrow from 1900 GMT and the airline said it was reviewing the fire's implications for Saturday's schedule and beyond.\nCathay Pacific, Hong Kong's main airline cancelled all its flights to London on Friday. \nThe Heathrow Express railway service said it was running a reduced service from Paddington to Heathrow.\nIn addition to passengers expecting to fly,  disruption has been caused to thousands of homes in west London, which have been left without power.\nAbout 150 people had to be evacuated from surrounding properties.\nMore than 16,300 homes lost power in a large-scale outage caused by the fire, energy supplier Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said.\n\"We're aware of a widespread power cut affecting many of our customers around the Hayes, Hounslow and surrounding areas,\" it added.\nThe National Grid said on Friday afternoon the network had been \"reconfigured to restore all customers impacted, including the ability to resupply the parts of Heathrow airport that are connected to North Hyde\".\nMeanwhile, two nurseries and four schools in Hillingdon - the London borough Heathrow Airport is located in - are shut today.\nHillingdon Council are assisting 12 people who were evacuated from their homes by the emergency services with hotel accommodation.\nBin collections will also be impacted on Friday, the council warned.\nBus routes in the Hillingdon area have been affected and the M4 is closed between junction three and four, while the Terminal Four spur roads are also closed.\nNo injuries from the fire have been reported. \nCounter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan Police are now leading the investigation into the fire because of the location of the substation and the \"impact on critical national infrastructure\". \nIt added there was currently no indication of foul play but it is keeping \"an open mind\".\nLondon Fire Brigade said it was working closely with the Metropolitan Police.\nIn the meantime, customers have been told not to go to the airport unless their airline has advised them to.\nBut Mr Woldbye said the airport would be \"back in full operation\" on Saturday.",

        "article_text": "Rum is a key part of Jamaica's cultural identity, but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican?\nThat question is at the centre of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island, as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can, and cannot, be called \"Jamaica rum\".\nIn October of last year, Jamaica's Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) approved amendments to the geographical indication (GI) designation for Jamaica Rum that was originally set up in 2016. The biggest change is that ageing the rum overseas is now prohibited.\nThe amendment was called for by the Spirits Pool Association (SPA), the trade organisation that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica's six rum distilleries - Appleton (which is owned by J Wray and Nephew), Clarendon, Hampden Estate, Long Pond, New Yarmouth and Worthy Park Estate.\nThe SPO's argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognised in its two key export markets \u2013 the EU and the US.\nIt says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors, and lead to more drinkers recognising it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location.\nBut the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica, because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business.\nThis company, National Rums of Jamaica (NRJ), owns Long Pond and 73% of Clarendon. NRJ is comprised of three shareholders \u2013 the government of Jamaica, Demerara Distillers of Guyana and the Barbados-based West Indies Rum Distillery (Wird).\nThe key factor is that Wird has since 2017 been owned by French spirits firm Maison Ferrand. Its business model relies heavily on exporting rum in bulk and ageing overseas - something not allowed under Jamaica's new GI.\nIt argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum, and that the island has exported and aged rum abroad for centuries.\nAnd so, the NRJ is appealing the ruling of JIPO, with a hearing scheduled for 28 April.\nThe Spirits Pool Association says that Wird only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by Maison Ferrard.\n\"What we're saying is, if you truly believe in Jamaica rum, age it in Jamaica,\" says Christopher Gentles, general manager of the SPA.\nRum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses, the thick treacle-like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants.\nMr Gentles says that ageing the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance, and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness. And so, he adds that \"we were a little bit puzzled\" by the NRJ's objection.\nThe SPA also points out that exporting and ageing spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value-added processes like refining, bottling, labelling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism.\nBoth the NRJ and Maison Ferrard declined to comment.\nThe use of GIs makes a product distinctive, and opens up three potential sources of value, according to Dev Gangjee, professor of intellectual property law at the University of Oxford.\n\"The first is simply a price premium. Research shows products can charge a price that is 1.5 to 2.7 times more than standard.\"\nThis isn't always reflected in profit as GI products are often more expensive to make, he adds.\nThe second reason is \"they anchor production in that region\". This stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value - like cheddar cheese, which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by-word for a generalised type of cheese.\nLastly, Prof Gangjee says GIs help to advertise the region and \"opens up other aspects of history and geography\", citing France's successful wine tourism industry.\nExamples of successful and longstanding GIs are Scotch whisky, champagne, and Parma ham.\nAnother Caribbean country similarly embroiled in a dispute over GI and rum is Barbados. Currently the island doesn't have a scheme.\nBarbados has five distilleries and four agreed on the wording of a proposed Barbados rum GI. The sole objector was Wird, which owns brands such as Cockspur.\nSimilarly to the situation in Jamaica, it objects to the proposed rules against ageing overseas.\nThe failure by Barbados to obtain a GI has frustrated the other producers, including Richard Seale, owner of the island's Foursquare distillery. \"We need to have intrinsic industries that are rooted here, tied here, that cannot be separated from here,\" he says.\nBack in Jamaica, the SPA wants the country's rum to apply for the EU's Protected Geographical Indication classification, but this cannot happen until the proceedings at the JIPO have concluded.\nMr Gentles hopes that a compromise can be reached, even if it means that both sides are not totally happy. \"It is my firm believe that one day we will put this behind us,\" he says.\nAnd while the SPA hopes that a stronger GI will boost acclaim and business, it is also about pride in a product intimately linked to Jamaica's history.\nIn the days following the October ruling Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, endorsed the JIPO decision, saying there were many examples of firms \"with no association to Jamaica attempting to appropriate the mystique of the island's brand\".\nIt concluded: \"When foreign entities become owners of uniquely Jamaican products, there should be a commitment to robustly maintain the integrity of the brand.\"",

        "article_text": "Boxing heavyweight legend George Foreman has died aged 76, according to his family. \nKnown as Big George in the ring, the American built one of the most remarkable and enduring careers in the sport, winning Olympic gold in 1968 and claiming the world heavyweight title twice, 21 years apart - the second making him the oldest champion in history aged 45.\nHe lost his first title to Muhammad Ali in their famous Rumble in the Jungle fight in 1974. But Foreman's professional boxing career boasted an astonishing total of 76 wins including 68 knockouts, almost double that of Ali. \nHe retired from the sport in 1997 but not before he agreed to put his name to a best-selling grill - a decision that went on to bring him fortunes that dwarfed his boxing earnings. \nHis family said in a post on Instagram on Friday night: \"Our hearts are broken.\n\"A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose.\"\nThe statement added: \"A humanitarian, an Olympian, and two time heavyweight champion of the world, He was deeply respected - a force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name - for his family.\"\nForeman was born in Marshall, Texas, on 10 January 1949, and raised along with six siblings by a single mother in the segregated American South.\nHe dropped out of school and turned to street robberies before eventually finding his outlet in the ring.\nForeman won the heavyweight gold medal at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, aged 19, before turning pro and winning 37 consecutive matches. He lost only five bouts over his career.\nHe beat previously undefeated reigning champion Joe Frazier in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1973 knocking him down six times in the first two rounds.\nHis 1974 Rumble in the Jungle against Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, remains one of the most famous boxing matches ever. \nAli, the older man, was the underdog after he was stripped of his crown seven years earlier for refusing to be drafted into the Vietnam War.\nForeman reflected on the legendary fight 50 years later in an October interview with BBC World Service Newshour, explaining that everyone thought he was going to decimate Ali. \n\"Oh, he's not going to last one round,\" the boxer said experts were predicting at the time. \nForeman told the BBC he typically would get \"real nervous\" and have \"butterflies\" before any boxing match, but that night - it was the \"most comfortable\" he had felt.\nBut the wily Ali used a tactic that later became known as \"rope-a-dope\", which wore out Foreman, causing him to throw out hundreds of punches before Ali unloaded on him in the eighth round and scored a knockout.\nAfter a second professional loss, Foreman retired in 1977 and became an ordained minister at the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ in Texas, which he founded and built.\nHe told the BBC his defeat to Ali became the \"best thing that ever happened to me\" as it ultimately led him to \"get my message out\" through preaching. \nHe recalled that his preaching started small, on street corners and with friends, then grew. \n\"We began meeting informally at various homes in Houston, and before long, the crowds became too large for most houses to accommodate,\" Foreman said on his website. \n\"Eventually, we bought a piece of land and an old, dilapidated building on the north-east side of Houston.\"\nForeman came out of retirement in 1987 to raise money for a youth centre he founded. He won 24 matches before losing to Evander Holyfield after 12 rounds in 1991.\nIn 1994, Foreman knocked out undefeated Michael Moorer to become the oldest ever heavyweight champion at age 45.\nHe became ad pitchman for his George Foreman Grill, which millions have purchased since it hit the market in 1994, thanks in part to his memorable catchphrase, the \"Lean Mean Grilling Machine\".\nForeman was married five times. He has a dozen children, including five sons who are all named George. \nHe explained on his website that he named them after himself so they \"they would always have something in common\". \n\"I say to them, 'If one of us goes up, then we all go up together,\" he explained. \"And if one goes down, we all go down together!'\"",

        "article_text": "Flights around the world have been disrupted after Heathrow Airport closed due to a fire at a nearby electrical substation.\nHeathrow, the UK's busiest airport, said on Friday afternoon that they will \"restart\" some flights later after the blaze at North Hyde substation in Hayes, west London. The airport said it hoped \"to run a full operation\" on Saturday,\nMore than 1,300 flights were affected, tracking website Flightradar24 said, and passengers have been told not to travel to the airport unless their airline has advised them to. \nThe National Grid said earlier that an \"interim solution\" has been found to allow power to be restored to customers including Heathrow Airport, saying that the network has been \"reconfigured to restore all customers impacted\".\nHere's what we know so far.\nA fire at an electrical substation in west London, which supplies Heathrow, caused a major power outage at the airport, prompting its closure. \nIt is not yet known what caused the fire at the substation, but Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said there was no suggestion of foul play as counter-terrorism police investigate.\n\"The counter-terrorism command has specific capabilities and capacities that mean that they are used to conducting investigations at pace,\" she said, adding that they were needed as the fire took place next to a critical piece of national infrastructure.\nEmergency services were first called to Nestles Avenues in Hayes, west London at 23:23 GMT on Thursday. \nJonathan Smith,  London Fire Brigade (LFB) deputy commissioner, said the fire at the electrical substation involved a transformer containing 25,000 litres of cooling oil.\nThe fire was \"very visible and significant,\" he said. The LFB said the fire was under control by 06:28.\nOn Friday evening, the service said the fire was \"believed to be non-suspicious\" and the investigation will \"focus on the electrical distribution equipment\".\nCommander Simon Messinger, who is leading the Metropolitan Police's response to the fire, said: \"Various specialist investigators continue to examine the scene and it is expected to take some time before full assessments can be completed.\"\nBut he repeated that \"at this stage, there remains no indication of any foul play\".\nThe substation is about a mile and a half away from the airport. \nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the substation's back-up generator \"appears to have been knocked out\".\nVideos shared on social media showed tall flames and plumes of smoke billowing from the substation overnight. \nPeople living nearby were advised to keep doors and windows closed to avoid smoke inhalation. \nWith Heathrow being such a busy airport for passenger journeys and global trade, questions have been raised over whether it has back-up systems in the event of power cuts.\nThe BBC understands that Heathrow does have back-up power for its key systems, but kickstarting these alternative power supplies for the whole airport takes time.\nA source said it was not possible to switch the power back on immediately.\nA Heathrow source also told the BBC that they have \"multiple sources\" of energy at the airport \u2013 with diesel generators and \"uninterruptable power supplies\" in place.\nThey added when the power outage happened the back up systems \"all operated as expected\".\nThe systems, however, are not enough to run the whole airport \u2013 hence the decision to close it down.\nAnd even once the power is back on, there are countless systems which need to be rebooted and checked to ensure they are working properly and are stable.\nIt is unclear why Heathrow's own back-up systems were not adequate to keep the airport running when one critical component of its energy supply was knocked out, and it is also unclear why the National Grid distribution network was not set up to supply sufficient electricity.\nA Heathrow source said these questions would be investigated.\nThe first flights since the fire took off from and landed at Heathrow on Friday evening with the airport initially saying it would prioritise repatriation and relocation of aircraft.\nPassengers were urged not to travel to the airport unless their airline had advised them to do so on Friday.\nThe airport is hoping to run a normal service on Saturday, Heathrow's chief executive Thomas Woldbye said.\nThe travel disruption affected many other airports, as airlines cancelled and diverted flights.\nThe airport has apologised for the disruption and has advised passengers to contact their airlines for further information.\nIts helpline number is 020 8757 2700. \nLate on Friday, the Department for Transport said on X that restrictions on overnight flights at Heathrow had been temporarily lifted to ease congestion.\nOnly 5,800 flights are allowed to take off or land at Heathrow between 23:30 and 06:00 each year, under government restrictions designed to limit how much noise the airport makes at night.\nAt least 1,351 flights to and from Heathrow were affected on Friday, Flightradar24 said, with some 120 affected aircraft already in the air when the closure was announced.\nThe Foreign Office has advised UK citizens who are abroad and require urgent assistance to contact their teams via an online query form. \nAir Canada and United Airlines have announced they will be resuming some or all of their flights from Friday evening. Virgin Atlantic has said it hopes to operate \"a near full schedule\" on Saturday with limited cancellations, adding that it will continuously review flights.\nGatwick Airport told the BBC it was aware of the situation at Heathrow Airport and stands \"ready to support as required\".\nSeveral of Australia's Qantas airline planes have been diverted from London to Paris, with other flights likely to be affected, it said. \nBritish Airways has cancelled all its short-haul flights due to operate to and from the airport on Friday. \nSome long-haul flights - including to Cape Town, Johannesburg, Singapore and Rio de Janeiro - were later given clearance to depart from Heathrow from 1900 GMT and the airline said it was reviewing the fire's implications for Saturday's schedule and beyond.\nCathay Pacific, Hong Kong's main airline cancelled all its flights to London on Friday. \nThe Heathrow Express railway service said it was running a reduced service from Paddington to Heathrow.\nIn addition to passengers expecting to fly,  disruption has been caused to thousands of homes in west London, which have been left without power.\nAbout 150 people had to be evacuated from surrounding properties.\nMore than 16,300 homes lost power in a large-scale outage caused by the fire, energy supplier Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said.\n\"We're aware of a widespread power cut affecting many of our customers around the Hayes, Hounslow and surrounding areas,\" it added.\nThe National Grid said on Friday afternoon the network had been \"reconfigured to restore all customers impacted, including the ability to resupply the parts of Heathrow airport that are connected to North Hyde\".\nMeanwhile, two nurseries and four schools in Hillingdon - the London borough Heathrow Airport is located in - are shut today.\nHillingdon Council are assisting 12 people who were evacuated from their homes by the emergency services with hotel accommodation.\nBin collections will also be impacted on Friday, the council warned.\nBus routes in the Hillingdon area have been affected and the M4 is closed between junction three and four, while the Terminal Four spur roads are also closed.\nNo injuries from the fire have been reported. \nCounter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan Police are now leading the investigation into the fire because of the location of the substation and the \"impact on critical national infrastructure\". \nIt added there was currently no indication of foul play but it is keeping \"an open mind\".\nLondon Fire Brigade said it was working closely with the Metropolitan Police.\nIn the meantime, customers have been told not to go to the airport unless their airline has advised them to.\nBut Mr Woldbye said the airport would be \"back in full operation\" on Saturday.",

There couldn't be a better ambassador for women's rugby.\"\nAldcroft missed the entire 2019 Women's Six Nations because of injury but returned for the 2019 Super Series in San Diego\nAldcroft had huge desire and determination and, to further her rugby ambitions,  moved from the family home in the north-east to the south-west to study and take part in a full-time rugby programme at Hartpury College.\n\"Moving away was a huge decision,\" Aldcroft said. \"The first week I hated it. I didn't realise I would be so homesick but it was the best two years I have ever experienced.\n\"I hoped one day I would be able to play for England, so I concentrated on that dream.\"\nSean Lynn, now head coach of Wales women, first encountered a 16-year-old Aldcroft when he was teaching at Hartpury.\nIt was not long before he had a conversation with Red Rose head coach Simon Middleton about a player he \"can't fault\". \n\"'She's not going to be a leader by her outspoken words, this girl will lead by example',\" said Lynn, who became head coach of Gloucester-Hartpury in 2020.\n\"On and off the pitch, she is just a professional individual.\n\"She is that warrior queen but what I love about her is she demands high standards in training.\"\nAldcroft signed for Darlington Mowden Park Shark in 2015, representing England under-20s for two years before making an instant impact on her senior England debut in November 2016.\nComing on in the closing stages against then Six Nations champions France, she scored the winning try in a 17-13 victory.\nNext year she signed for Gloucester-Hartpury and in 2018 was named co-captain with Natasha Hunt, while establishing herself in the England squad.\n\"Once you get a little taste of it you just want more,\" she said. \"I am just so hungry to keep developing with the teams.\"\nGloucester-Hartpury claim third straight PWR title\nHunt and Aldcroft led Gloucester-Hartpury to a third successive domestic title earlier this month\nAldcroft, who had captained on occasion already in her career, replaced Marlie Packer as permanent captain of the Red Roses in January this year with head coach John Mitchell saying captaincy would bring the best out of her. \n\"The values it takes to be a high-performing Red Rose are ingrained in her character and she is highly respected within the squad,\" he said. \"We believe Zoe will thrive in the role.\"\nJuggling being the captain of the best Premiership team and the world's best international side is a \"stressful job\" but Aldcroft believes setting an example to her team-mates every day in training is key.\n\"If you have the ability to work hard and push your own boundaries that's the most important thing,\" she said.\n\"In rugby, you are looking for people to put their bodies on the line, people who will go that extra step.

        "article_text": "This story contains details of someone taking their own life, which some readers may find distressing.\nThe family of a Boeing whistleblower who took his own life last year has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the company.\nThe complaint alleges that John Barnett was subjected to a campaign of harassment, abuse and humiliation after he raised concerns about safety issues.\nIt claims that the conduct of the company was \"the clear, foreseeable cause\" of Mr Barnett's death.\nBoeing said it was saddened by Mr Barnett's death and extended its condolences to his family.\nThe former Boeing manager was found dead from what police described as a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the car park of a Charleston hotel on 9 March last year.\nThe 146-page lawsuit has been brought by his mother, Vicky Stokes, and his brothers Rodney and Michael on behalf of his estate. It was filed on Wednesday in the US District Court of South Carolina.\nIt attributes his death to Boeing's actions, including what it describes as a retaliatory campaign by his managers that amounted to a \"hostile work environment\".  \n\"Whether or not Boeing intended to drive John to death or merely destroy his ability to function, it was absolutely foreseeable that Boeing's conduct would result in PTSD and John's unbearable depression... Boeing's conduct was the clear cause, and the clear foreseeable cause, of John's death,\" it says.\nIt describes Mr Barnett as a dedicated, idealistic worker who \"took his role seriously in protecting the flying public\" and \"believed that he had a personal, legal and moral obligation to ensure\u2026 that every possible defect was identified, documented and remedied.\"\nIt describes how he was allegedly harassed, denigrated, humiliated and treated with scorn and contempt, as well as being removed from investigations he was working on and blacklisted from transferring to other quality control positions within the company.\nMr Barnett took early retirement from Boeing in March 2017, at a time when the claim says he had been suffering from symptoms of depression and severe anxiety, and knew he was going to be fired. The lawsuit alleges the company continued to put pressure on him, for example by preventing friends who continued to work there from having any contact with him.\nAmong the exhibits put forward in support of the claim are an email, in which he says, \"Boeing has completely destroyed my outlook on life\" and his handwritten final note, which says \"I can't do this any longer!! Enough!!\"\nJohn Barnett worked for Boeing for 32 years. \nFrom 2010, he was employed as a quality manager at Boeing's factory in North Charleston, South Carolina. The facility builds the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art airliner used mainly on long-haul routes.\nDuring his time at the factory, Mr Barnett raised a number of concerns with management about violations of safety procedures, as well as about defects in aircraft on the production line.\nHe later took his concerns to the media. In 2019, he told the BBC that:\nBoeing denied his assertions. However, a 2017 review by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), did uphold some of Mr Barnett's concerns.\nIt established that the location of at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts in the factory was unknown, and that they were considered lost. Boeing was ordered to take remedial action.\nOn the oxygen cylinders issue, the company said that in 2017 it had \"identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly\". But it denied that any of them were actually fitted on aircraft.\nSafety standards at Boeing have come under a harsh spotlight since an incident last year in which a disused door panel fell off a brand new 737 Max aircraft shortly after takeoff. \nThe incident, which came five years after two previous catastrophic accidents involving the 737 Max, brought intense scrutiny of the company's quality control procedures and conditions in the factory. \nThe company appointed a new chief executive last year, industry veteran Kelly Ortberg, and has produced a detailed action plan to address concerns raised by regulators about issues on the factory floor.\nIn response to the lawsuit being filed, Boeing issued a brief statement. \n\"We are saddened by John Barnett's death and extend our condolences to his family,\" it said.\nPreviously, however, the company has pushed back against the allegations made against it, telling the BBC: \"Boeing reviewed and addressed quality issues that Mr Barnett raised before he retired in 2017, as well as other quality issues referred to in the complaint. Engineering analysis determined the issues he raised did not affect airplane safety.\"\nIt also drew attention to a decision made earlier in Mr Barnett's case, in 2020, in which the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration concluded the company had not breached whistleblower protection law.\nIt added: \"We appreciate employees who raise their voice, and we have systems in place to encourage them to speak up confidentially or anonymously.\"\nIf you have been affected by the issues in this story, you can find support from the BBC's Action Line.",

        "article_text": "Tomar has won nine of her 13 professional bouts\nPuja Tomar laughs nervously as she reveals her parents did not want her initially because she was a girl.\nIt surprises some of the journalists in the room, but for Tomar - the only Indian woman to ever fight in the UFC - it is the cornerstone of why she is doing this interview.\nHer start in life helped to forge her extraordinary resilience and character, her career, and everything she stands for today.\n\"My family and this society doesn't allow girls, they like only boys,\" Tomar tells BBC Sport. \n\"Before I was born, they wanted a boy. Even when I was a newborn, my mum told me my father didn't want a third girl.\"\nTomar, 31, was born in a small village called Budhana in Uttar Pradesh, a state in northern India.\nHistorically, Indian families wanting boys over girls is common, particularly among poor communities, leading to a skewed sex ratio in favour of men.\nThere have been instances where unwanted baby girls have been buried alive and left to die in clay pots in the country.\nThe reasoning is rooted in widely held cultural beliefs that a male child would carry the family name, look after the parents in their old age, and perform the rituals on their death - while daughters would cost them dowries and leave them for their matrimonial homes.\nNo home, food or phone: Blachowicz's 'detox' from life\nI owe the UK fans after last performance - Edwards\nIn 2022, the United Nations estimated that nearly 400,000 female births - or 3% of all female births - are missed annually as a result of gender biased sex selection.\nTomar was the third of three sisters, which led to ridicule from other families because her dad had not fathered a boy. \nBut she did not let the misogyny she faced affect her.\nAfter losing her father at the age of seven, Tomar -  supported by her mum - was instead fuelled by the experience.\n\"After that, I wanted to beat boys. So I learned Jackie Chan movies and kung-fu and how to beat the boys,\" said Tomar.\n\"Even in the road I would go up to boys and say 'hey' \u2013 I tried to fight with boys. I wanted to prove myself.\n\"After that I realised I could be in sports, but nobody told me how to do it. My cousins, my family - nobody allows girls to go outside in India. But my mum, she fought for this day.\"\nTomar has a professional MMA record of nine wins and four losses\nTomar made a winning start on her UFC debut in June and on Saturday at UFC London at the O2 Arena, takes on Irish strawweight Shauna Bannon.\nUsing the platform she has in the UFC, Tomar wants parents in India to see the potential in daughters and treat them as equals to their sons.\n\"I just want to tell every parent to be proud you have a girl. Give confidence to your girls, give belief to them,\" said Tomar.\n\"Because if I can do it, many more can. Just open the gate. Don't think a girl is only there to make food, a girl can do anything, just give them opportunities.\"\nSince her UFC debut, Tomar says parents in her village have asked how their girls can start in mixed martial arts (MMA) - a movement which makes her \"proud\".\nThe success Tomar is experiencing would seem unimaginable from the moment she started her MMA journey.\nAlongside sex ratio discrimination, Indian sportswomen face multiple other challenges,, external including under-funded sport and sexual harassment and assault.\nTomar says she was around 24 years old when she first started training in MMA, but had difficulties finding gyms in India.\n\"I was in MMA with no experience, no coach. Just sometime I'd get help, but I had no coach,\" says Tomar.\n\"MMA sport training is very hard in India. In my society, you have to be fully clothed when you train with men. It's very hard.\"\nEventually Tomar would move to Soma Fight Club, which is a gym in Bali, Indonesia, where she still trains today.\nShe was signed by the UFC in 2023 after a four-fight winning streak.\n\"I kept going and kept going and one day I can show the world girls don't [belong only] in the kitchen,\" said Tomar.\n\"I just want to work hard and keep going and win and win. One day I want to be on top.\"\nIf you have been affected by issues raised in this article, there is information and support available on BBC Action Line.\nMMA schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

This is what caught light in this instance. The exact cause is not yet known, but counter terrorism police are looking into whether there was any foul play.\nHeathrow uses as much energy as a small city, so it is not possible for it to have the back-up power by itself to run its operation safely.\nA source at Heathrow said it did however have back-up options for certain key systems, but kickstarting the alternative power supplies for the whole airport took time.\nThe systems need to be checked to ensure they are working properly.\nA Heathrow source said its back-up diesel generators and uninterruptable power supplies in place all operated as expected.\nThe problem lay with the National Grid, the source said, pointing out thousands of homes had been left without power, not just the airport.\nThere are two National Grid substations close to Heathrow: one at North Hyde, north of the airport, and one at Laleham, south of the airport, according to energy analysis firm Montel Group.\nIt appears that only the North Hyde substation is connected to Heathrow through the local distribution network, said Phil Hewitt, director at the firm.\n\"This potential lack of resilience at a critical national and international infrastructure site is worrying,\" he said. \"An airport as large and as important as Heathrow should not be vulnerable to a single point of failure.\"\nHowever, Robin Potter, a research fellow at Chatham House, said Heathrow was one of only two UK airports \u2013 Gatwick is the other \u2013 that has any level of regulation around its resilience standards.\n\"These are actually the better airports in the UK for how their resilience is assessed and regulated,\" he said.\nIn 2023, the National Infrastructure Commission recommended to the government that it should set standards for some key sectors of infrastructure such as telecoms, water, transport and energy by 2025.\nIt followed up with a further report at the end of last year detailing how the government could do that for those sectors. \n\"Those have effectively been on the government's desk since October 2023,\" he added.\nA Heathrow source said questions over why its back-up system failed would be investigated.\nSometimes - like now -  a chain is only important as its weakest link. The cost of having a whole extra power supply to run the airport just in case would cost huge amounts of money and  resources for a privately-owned business like Heathrow.\nQuestions over whether additional back-ups are worth the additional cost will continue long after the passengers and cargo delayed by Friday's disruptive, and internationally embarrassing, failure have got where they are going.\nReporting by Tom Espiner, Theo Leggett, Ben King, and Oliver Smith.",

        "article_text": "The number of measles cases in west Texas and New Mexico is rising, new data shows - even as officials work to contain an outbreak that sprang up two months ago. \nThere have been more measles cases in the US during the first three months of 2025, than in all of 2024, according the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \nAs of Friday, there are 309 cases in Texas and one measles-related death in the state. In New Mexico, cases have risen to 42, with one measles-related death. \nWhile there are more cases of the virus, there is some good news: More people are getting the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination this year than last year.\nAccording to the CDC, a federal public health agency, the last time measles numbers were this high in the US was 2019 when the annual total was 1,274. But the number of cases each year from 2020 through 2023 were all lower than the number of cases in the first three months of 2025. \nThe MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off the dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and also immunise against mumps and rubella.\nSince the outbreak began, more people are reportedly getting the vaccine.\nBetween 1 February and 18 March last year, the New Mexico Department of Health registered 6,500 measles vaccines, the Associated Press reported. In the same time period this year, more than 11,600 measles vaccines were administered in the state.\nBetween 1 January and 16 March, Texas gave at least 173, 000 measles doses compared to last year's 158,000 in the same time period, state health department data shows. \nBesides the outbreak spreading in Texas and New Mexico, measles cases were reported in other states and across Canada, as well. \nSo far this year in Canada there have been 224 measles cases, 173 confirmed and 51 probable, the government said. \nBut the epicentre remains in western Texas and neighbouring New Mexico, where two unvaccinated people have died from the virus this year.\nWhile the disease was declared eliminated 25 years ago, the US still sees outbreaks, which are defined as three or more related cases.\nThe two deaths were jarring to many in a country that, before last week, had not recorded a measles death since 2015. The 2015 death was the first attributed to virus in the US since 2003.\nIn mid-April, CDC officials are expected to discuss the growing outbreak at a public meeting of its independent vaccine advisory panel.

        "article_text": "When you see pasta, your brain probably doesn't jump to the secrets of the universe. But for almost a century, physicists have puzzled over spaghetti's counterintuitive properties.\nYou might think physicists only ask the big questions. We mostly hear about the physics of the cosmic and the miniscule, the shape of our universe and the nature of the particles that fill it. But physicists, of course, have ordinary lives outside of the laboratory, and sometimes their way of questioning the universe spills over to their daily habits. There's one everyday item that seems to especially obsess them: spaghetti.\nGoing back at least a century, spaghetti has been the subject of rigorous studies. Through this research, physicists continue to learn new things about the solid state of matter, the chemistry of food and even draw connections to the origin of life. The steady torrent of spaghetti science helps to demonstrate that deep questions lurk in our ordinary routines, and that there are plenty of hungry physicists who can't stop asking them.\nFor example: how thin can spaghetti get? The typical spaghetto \u2013 the word for an individual strand of spaghetti \u2013 is between one and two mm thick (0.04-0.08in). But other long noodles vary widely in diameter, from udon at 4mm (0.16in) to angel hair at 0.8mm (0.03in). The thinnest handmade strands are called su filindeu, coming in at 0.4mm (0.02in), so slender that only a few women in Nuoro, Italy know how to make them.\nBut recently, a team of researchers at the University College London wondered if 21st Century lab equipment could do better. They used a technique called \"electro-spinning\". First, they dissolved flour into a special, electrically charged solution in a syringe. Then they held the syringe over a special, negatively-charged plate. \"This pulls the solution through the dispenser needle down towards the collector plate in a very stringy noodle-type shape,\" says Beatrice Britton, lead author of the study.\nWhen the solution dried, the researchers were left with a crisscrossing thread of incredibly thin spaghetti. \"To the naked eye, all you see is a sort of lasagna sheet,\" Britton says, but a powerful microscope reveals a mat made of strands as thin as 0.1mm (0.004in). These noodles are also much stiffer than regular spaghetti. Britton and her colleagues hope their research can be a step towards biodegradable alternatives to plastic \"nanofibres\", which are now used to filter liquids and treat wounds.\nThe world's thinnest spaghetti is just one recent example of how physicists can't seem to stop plying their tools on everybody's favourite carb. But physicists using their noodle on their noodles is no new thing. In 1949, Brown University physicist George F Carrier posed \"the spaghetti problem\" in The American Mathematical Monthly, which he deemed to be \"of considerable popular and academic interest\". Essentially, the problem amounts to: \"Why can't I slurp up a strand of spaghetti without getting sauce on my face\"?\nHis equations showed how the exposed strand swings about more wildly as it gets shorter and shorter, guaranteeing an eventual slap of the noodle against the slurper's lip \u2013 and the fateful sauce eruption Carrier so deplored. Sadly, his mathematical formulas offered no way around the face-slap. It's as deeply etched in the laws of the universe as the Big Bang.\nLater, two scientists inverted Carrier's pioneering study, exploring what happens when a stringy object slips out of a hole instead of being sucked in. They called their version the \"reverse spaghetti problem\", familiar to any impatient eater who's had to spit out burning pasta because they hadn't waited for it to cool. For now, no theoretical physicist has attempted the more complicated problem of two dogs slurping from either end of the same spaghetti strand.\u00a0\nThe great mid-century American physicist Richard Feynman helped unlock the riddles of quantum mechanics, explaining how the elementary particles that make up atoms interact with one another. But Feynman's enormous contribution to spaghetti physics is less widely known. One night, Feynman wondered why it's almost impossible to break a stick of spaghetti into two pieces instead of three. He and a colleague spent the rest of the evening snapping spaghetti sticks until they covered the kitchen floor.\nFeynman's interrogation into the counterintuitive physics of dry spaghetti sparked a quarter century of attempts to explain it. This finally happened in 2005, when two French researchers showed that spaghetti always breaks into two pieces \u2013 at first. But after the fracture, as the two bent pieces snap straight again, all their pent-up strain gets released in a shockwave, causing further splintering.\nIn 2018, a team of MIT scientists figured out how to stifle the shockwave \u2013 delicately twist the spaghetti strand before snapping it. Their method required lab equipment, but it reliably produced a perfect pair of fragments. Their work provided a new and deeper understanding of brittle rods that goes beyond spaghetti; the phenomenon of three-way fracturing is well-known to pole vaulters, for example.\nMy (Italian-American) mother taught me to break a bundle of dry spaghetti in half before putting it in boiling water, so it fits horizontally in the pot. I guess Feynman did the same, but it's an outrage to many of the world's spaghetti-eaters. If you're in the latter camp, then you place your dried spaghetti bundle upright in the pot of boiling water, then watch it slowly soften, buckle and submerge itself.\nThis familiar spaghetti behaviour may not seem like a puzzle, but try removing a recently-curled piece of spaghetti from the pot and letting it dry. It will stay curved rather than returning to its original straight length \u2013 something in those first few minutes irreversibly changes the composition of the spaghetti. In 2020, two physicists finally explained this spaghetti transmutation. It's due to a feature called \"viscoelasticity\" \u2013 a name for the unique way materials like spaghetti respond to physical stress. This special property allows water to flow through the strand's outer layers.\nThe strange mechanics of cooked spaghetti go even further. In one study, scientists dropped strands on the ground and measured how they coiled to learn about other elastic materials, from rope to DNA strands. In another, physicists tied spaghetti into knots and studied what types of strain would cause them to tear.\nSpaghetti physics even goes beyond the pasta itself \u2013 sauce is loaded with its own scientific mysteries. When eight Italian physicists met while doing research abroad in Germany, they found a shared frustration in the classic Roman dish cacio e pepe.\nThe sauce requires very few ingredients \u2013 it's basically a mixture of reserved pasta water and grated pecorino cheese \u2013 but they'd all experienced its mystifying fickleness. Often the cheese irreversibly clumps up, ruining the sauce. This is especially common when you cook it in large batches, which made the physicists hesitant to invite their German colleagues to dinner. \"We can't mess up cacio e pepe in front of German people,\" says Ivan Di Terlizzi, who studies statistical and biological physics at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, Germany.\nFortunately, among them were some of the world's foremost experts on the physics of \"phase separation\", exactly the kind of congealing phenomenon that plagued their group dinners. Arguing about the phase separation of cacio e pepe, they realised it was flummoxing from a scientific perspective as well.\n\"This is actually a very interesting problem,\" says Daniel Maria Busiello, co-author on the cacio\u00a0study. \"So we decided to design an experimental apparatus to actually test all these things.\"\nThe \"apparatus\" consisted of a bath of water heated to a low temperature, a kitchen thermometer, a petri dish and an iPhone camera attached to an empty box. They invited as many hungry friends as they could find to Di Terlizzi's apartment and hunkered down to cook a weekend's worth of cacio e pepe.\u00a0\nThey found that the \"simple\" sauce was enormously complex. Chemically, it's a water-based solution with only a few components: starch (from the pasta water), lipids (from the cheese) and two kinds of protein (also from the cheese). Using their apparatus, they found a physical explanation for the sauce-wrecking clumps, which they termed the \"mozzarella phase\".\nProteins, unlike most molecules, get stickier when they're hot. As the sauce is heated, the researchers found this leads to these proteins sticking to the lipids and forming mozzarella-like clumps. In a well-made cacio e pepe, what prevents this is the starch, which forms a protective coat around the lipid molecules so they can't stick to the proteins. If the sauce gets too hot, the increased stickiness of the proteins overcomes this barrier.\nOnce they understood the science behind the sauce, it was clear how to fix it. \"If you add enough starch above a certain threshold, you don't get this kind of separated state,\" says Di Terlizzi. Pasta water doesn't typically contain enough starch to guarantee this threshold, so they suggest adding a mixture of corn starch dissolved in water.\nThe group decided to conclude their manuscript with a foolproof recipe for the classic dish. But in surveying the rich scientific literature, they realised they weren't the first to reach this cacio epiphany. In the name of academic integrity, they cited a YouTube video wherein the Michelin-star Roman chef Luciano Monosilio suggests the same tweak for a foolproof recipe \u2013 a dash of corn starch. \"It's the only non-scientific reference in our paper,\" says Di Terlizzi.\nThe physics they used connects the clumping of cacio e pepe to ideas about the origin of life on Earth. Biophysicists use phase separation to understand how droplets of liquid can congeal and divide within a solution. \"A droplet dividing pretty much looks like a proto-cell,\" says Giacomo Bartolucci, another co-author on the study. Inside the little blobs that preceded actual cells, some believe, the building blocks of life may have come together via a process much like the Italians\u2019 mozzarella phase. The same ideas are helping biologists understand how the plaques that cause Alzheimer's coalesce in the brain.\nWhy is spaghetti such a locus of speculation and study for physicists?\nFor one, it's simple \u2013 flour, water and heat, says Vishal Patil, one of the discoverers of the twist-and-break method who is now a professor of mathematics at the University of California, San Diego. The fact that a combination of so few components raises so many deep questions speaks to how physics underlies everything they see and do, Patil says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why sarcastic teens are the smartest\n\u2022 The French towns giving away free chickens\n\u2022 YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know\nIt also shows that no matter how deep physicists probe the big and the small, the answers can still fall short of explaining phenomena we see every day. When it comes to cacio e pepe, all the tools of theoretical physics can only tell us what every Italian grandmother knows: keep the stove burning low when you make it. Laboratory electrospinning can only achieve marginally thinner spaghetti than what the women of Nuoro, Italy make daily by hand.\n\"Spaghetti is just a very accessible thing you can play with,\" Patil says. The low cost of flour-based noodles is what made them a democratic delicacy for so many cultures around the world \u2013 spaghetti was popularised in Naples as street food. That's why Feynman didn't hesitate to snap pounds of the stuff onto his kitchen floor.\nAfter a long day at the blackboard, plugging away at the impenetrable math of quantum mechanics or black holes, the mechanical wonders of spaghetti are the perfect fodder for scientists' mealtime probing.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

Her body was found the following month.Her family spotted her distinctive black rose tattoo in a BBC report about the launch of the Operation Identify Me campaign in 2023.The campaign is seeking to find the identities of another 45 women found dead in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France, Italy and Spain. He reported her missing to Paraguayan authorities in 2019 after several months without contact.While Lima has now been identified, Interpol said the circumstances around her death remain \"unexplained\".InterpolThe farmhouse in Girona where Ainoha Izaga Ibieta Lima was foundThe woman previously identified through the campaign was 31-year-old Rita Roberts from Wales.The last contact her family had with her was a postcard from Belgium in May 1992. Police said she had a tattoo of the word \"success\" in Hebrew.Last year, she was added to the Operation Identify Me campaign, which has seen Interpol \"black notices\" - seeking information about unidentified bodies - released to the public for the first time.Earlier this month, a breakthrough came when Paraguayan authorities matched fingerprints uploaded by Spain to the black notice against ones on their own national database.Lima's brother told police that she had travelled to Spain in 2013. \"Our work is not just about solving cases, it's also about restoring dignity to victims and giving a voice to those affected by tragedy,\" he said.Lima was found dead in a poultry shed attached to a farmhouse in Spain's Girona province in August 2018.She was not carrying any identification documents, and the people living in the farmhouse and other local residents said they did not know who she was.",

        "article_text": "Thomas Tuchel praised goalscoring debutant Myles Lewis-Skelly's performance\nEngland started the Thomas Tuchel era with a 2-0 victory over Albania in World Cup qualifying.\nTeenager Myles Lewis-Skelly scored on his senior international debut before captain Harry Kane netted his 70th England goal to seal the win.\nBBC Sport takes a look at some of the talking points from the game.\nFirst impressions of 'low-key' Tuchel & his England team\nWho 'didn't show enough' against Albania? How England's players rated\n'He does everything right' - the remarkable rise of Lewis-Skelly\nThis average positions graphic shows how high England played against a defensive opponent (England are black and Albania are purple)\nBefore the game Tuchel created plenty of headlines when he said England looked like they had played with fear at Euro 2024 under his predecessor Gareth Southgate.\nHe also suggested he wanted them to play Premier League-style physical football.\nKnown for his tactical flexibility, nobody was quite certain what formation Tuchel would opt for - but he sent England out in a 4-2-3-1.\nWhile Tuchel's teams are normally known for their intensity and pressing, it was hard for England to show either against a team who set up as defensively as Albania, especially in the first half.\nAnd the German is also still in the early stages of his reign - having only met his players four days ago for the first time since officially taking over in January.\n\"Thomas Tuchel's had the squad for three days - you can't expect to see a different England team,\" said former Three Lions midfielder Leon Osman on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"We won the football match. Once we got ahead there was no urgency. \n\"We want to be entertained. There is a certain element of control which is good in tournament football.\n\"At the minute we're not in a tournament, we want to be entertained.\"\nEngland had 74% of the ball and 12 shots to Albania's three - with the hosts recording all six efforts on target in the game.\nIn the opening 45 minutes they completed 437 passes, the most on Opta's records of any England first half.\nThe visitors did try to play more after the break, but England's backline were only tested a few times by substitute Armando Broja. \nThe result itself was routine - new England manager or not. The Three Lions are unbeaten in 38 home qualifiers for World Cups or Euros since November 2007, with 34 wins. \n\"It was a difficult game from a spectating perspective,\" said former England defender Matt Upson on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Once we got into the rhythm, it was very much an England game at Wembley against inferior opposition where they struggled to break them down.\n\"We are all wanting to see how Thomas Tuchel's plan is going to happen.\n\"There are so many questions, but ultimately they have to manage the game itself and England did that well.\"\nUpson added that Tuchel probably learned to \"understand what it feels like and looks like tactically\" to play against a team in a low block like Albania's.\nJust a few months ago, Arsenal left-back Lewis-Skelly, 18, would barely have been on England's radar. He had not played a senior professional game until after the September international break.\nBut he has broken into Arsenal's first team, scored against Manchester City and been sent off twice (although one was overturned) in 26 games - and now firmly established himself as a Gunners regular.\n\"It doesn't get much better,\" said former Arsenal centre-back Upson.\n\"The opportunity has fallen to him, the timing has been great. The amount of injuries Arsenal had got him in the team.\n\"Those doors have opened, but he has had to grab those opportunities. He looks to be a top player.\"\nTuchel gave him a chance for England and he took it with both hands.\nIn a prime example of the modern full-back role, Lewis-Skelly was front-footed, cutting into central midfield and popping up in the box.\nAnd he got the opening goal when he appeared in the Albania area to score through Thomas Strakosha's legs from Jude Bellingham's fantastic through ball.\nThat made him the third-youngest England goalscorer ever - and youngest to net on his debut.\nMyles Lewis-Skelly had more touches in Albania's half than his own\n\"In the second half he played as a number eight or a number 10,\" said Tuchel. \n\"His very best position is where he plays for Arsenal in the double six. \n\"We tried to play a bit more conventional today as it's easier to learn because we have many players from many different clubs, but he understands very quickly.\"\nLewis-Skelly left the pitch to an ovation in the final minute.\nEngland tried three different left-backs in their final three Nations League games - Lewis Hall, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Rico Lewis - but Lewis-Skelly will hope to make the position his own.\nUpson said: \"He was absolutely superb. To manage and handle that occasion in the manner he did with the very limited senior football he has had... really speaks volumes about how good a player he is and how far he can go. It was a brilliant evening for him.\n\"When you look at the competition for that position, Lewis Hall is probably the closest. You can see a little battle between the two of them for the left-back slot. That was a big moment for Lewis-Skelly tonight to try to cement himself in Thomas Tuchel's mind for that role.\"\nEx-Everton player Osman added: \"He was dead relaxed, but he wasn't tested defensively.\n\"To secure the position he will have to show he can stand up defensively.\"\nDan Burn went close to his second Wembley headed goal in a week\nCentre-back Burn is at the other end of the spectrum when it comes to England debuts.\nThis was the 32-year-old's first appearance for England at any age level. In fact he was the oldest Three Lions debutant since Kevin Davies in 2010.\nIt came in what is undoubtedly the best week of the 6ft 7in defender's career.\nOn Sunday, also at Wembley, he headed his boyhood club Newcastle ahead against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final as they won 2-1 to lift a first trophy in 56 years.\nThe following day he joined up with England.\nHe was given an immediate debut by Tuchel - and did well.\nBurn became the first England debutant to make 100 or more passes on Opta's record - and ended up completing 135 from 137.\nHe made more clearances (seven), won more tackles (two) and won more aerial duels (four) than any other Three Lions player.\nPlus he managed to hit both crossbars, turning a clearance against his own woodwork before later heading Declan Rice's corner on to the bar.\nUpson said: \"He was excellent in the first half, looked very good but didn't have much to deal with defensively. He showed his threat from set-pieces.\"\nHowever, there were a few moments where he was caught out, especially when Broja came on.\nMarc Guehi, who was one of England's best players at Euro 2024, watched on from the bench with Ezri Konsa starting alongside Burn.\n\"There were a couple of moments in the second half where Burn got hurt in behind, got a bit tight and spun,\" said Upson. \"His partnership with Konsa was excellent.\n\"Konsa's performance was very assured and showed he's really developed in the last six months. Playing in the Champions League with Aston Villa has brought him on to the next level. \n\"Burn has moments of impact but I thought Konsa is probably best placed to keep his spot.\"\nRejection, non-league and pushing trolleys: Burn's rise to England\n'I don't want to go to sleep because I feel like I'm dreaming'\nEngland wingers Phil Foden and Marcus Rashford both failed to set the game alight.\nManchester United forward Rashford, on loan at Villa, was given his first England chance in a year after rediscovering his form under Unai Emery.\nHe showed a few good touches, especially early on, but failed to create much.\nManchester City's Foden had a similar experience on the right-hand side. \nThey were both replaced, along with Liverpool midfielder Curtis Jones, in the 74th minute.\n\"Both of our wingers that started were not as impactful as they can be or as they are in club football,\" said Tuchel.\n\"At the moment I'm not so sure why we struggled to bring the ball quicker to them.\n\"They trained very well, they were decisive in training which is why they deserved it. They were very good in the last weeks in their clubs. \n\"We will keep encouraging them and give them a structure so they can show their potential.\"\nUpson said: \"Foden wants to come inside. He's not the type of out-and-out winger which Tuchel wants to play.\n\"He wants a fast-paced aggressive style - to go at teams. Foden is more of a footballer who likes to come to feet and open things up that way. \n\"Rashford showed willingness and he has that speed but didn't quite find the end product tonight. \n\"He was looking not to lose the ball instead of taking a risk. It's an area that will be tinkered with in games to come.\"\nHarry Kane is now 17 goals clear of Wayne Rooney's previous England goalscoring record\nCaptain Kane is England's all-time leading scorer by some way - and he netted his 70th international goal on Friday.\nIt came after a fine bit of control to take down Rice's cross before he passed the ball into the bottom corner.\nKane is the first England player to score on his first appearance under three different managers - Roy Hodgson, Gareth Southgate and Tuchel.\n\"Typical Kane,\" said Upson. \"He didn't get much action for quite long periods but a couple of his passes were superb. He drops deeps and clips those balls over the top. \n\"His finish was really high level. The first touch and movement and to find that bottom corner was excellent. Very much a Kane-type performance. \n\"He would probably want to be involved in the game a bit more in the build-up. But Albania sat in so didn't allow him a lot of opportunities to get the ball.\"\nThe 31-year-old continued his fine association with Tuchel too, having bagged 44 goals in 45 games under the German at Bayern Munich.\nMauricio Pochettino is now the only manager Kane has scored more goals under.",

I want to do my best,\" Arroyo told BBC Sport. \n\"I am finding it frustrating because I want the players to be brave and it's not the best moment for them to be brave. \n\"It's good to talk about that because I am just as scared as they are. I don't want to be the manager of a relegated team.\n\"But the reality is a possibility if we don't do our jobs. We are in the same boat so we need to row harder, faster and stronger to make it. I really believe we will make it.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page\nThis video can not be played\nClinton scores \"ingenious\" long-range strike as Man Utd beat Aston Villa\nThe mood was low, belief seemed to disappear and fans were fearing the worst on another painful evening in Birmingham on Sunday.\n\"If you love to win, stand up,\" was the chant being sung by Manchester United fans towards the end of their ruthless 4-0 win at Villa Park.\nAnd even some Villa fans joined in.\nTheir side had struggled to create chances in a timid first half and were punished. They never found a way back into the game.\n\"I've really struggled to understand what Aston Villa are trying to do. The players look lost,\" said former England midfielder Izzy Christiansen on Sky Sports. \n\"I feel for the players right now and I don't want to be too harsh because I don't know what the root of the problems are. \n\"They're in this situation for a reason - the table doesn't lie. The manager has got to find the right words very carefully to motivate the team and get them on track, because it could end up being a slippery slope for the football club.\"\nJust before the full-time whistle went, manager Arroyo was crouched down in the dugout, perhaps pondering what to say to her players.\nShe jumped up afterwards and went over to each of them, giving them hugs and consoling handshakes.\nIn her pre-match programme notes, Arroyo admitted the squad was \"struggling\" and last week's defeat by Palace had knocked them.\n\"We're not getting the results that we all expect and not performing the way that we want,\" she added.\nIt is a feeling that will have only worsened on Sunday and you could sense the anxiety around Villa Park.\n\"Villa might actually get relegated,\" one security guard outside the press room blurted out afterwards.\nUnited led 3-0 by half-time thanks to a double from striker Elisabeth Terland and a long-range lob by Grace Clinton.\nVilla's evening got worse when Leah Galton added a fourth goal, and though substitute Ebony Salmon provided a threat, it was too late to make a dent.\nArroyo's side have only five matches to secure their safety in the WSL.\nAston Villa have lost their last six WSL games\nHow Villa have fallen so quickly is not clear.\nThey were being touted as a team who could break into the top four just 18 months ago - but now there are several factors that appear to have contributed to their downfall.\nSince former manager Carla Ward's resignation last season, they have struggled to find consistency, appointing Robert de Pauw before sacking him after six months.\nThat caused disruption in the January transfer window and Villa allowed big-name players Kenza Dali and Adriana Leon - who had grown unhappy - to leave in the hope of improving things in the dressing room. \nRecruitment has not entirely paid off. They spent money on club record signing Gabi Nunes, for example, but have still struggled to score goals.\n\"It's really surprising to see the downward spiral they have been on,\" former England defender Laura Bassett told BBC Radio 5 Live. \n\"I don't think the performances and the way they are competing has been bad but there's been individual mistakes and a lack of belief. \n\"They have not been clinical and not scoring goals so that can manifest psychologically, making it tough. \n\"We haven't seen that [new manager] bounce and I know a lot of players are out of contract at the end of the season too. In terms of management higher up, I'd be asking 'what is the direction?'\"\nWhat was most evident on Sunday was a growing sense of anxiety among Villa supporters.\nBut Arroyo says they can help the team fight for survival and she hopes to give them \"what they deserve\" by delivering results in the next five games.\n\"If you are not winning I cannot ask them to support us happily. I think they are trying their best,\" she said. \n\"I can only say 'thank you for coming' because we are not even able to score so I cannot ask them for anything. The only thing I can say is that we will work as hard as possible. \n\"I am pleased they understand we are struggling because with their support we will be stronger. We are not in the position we want, we are not in the position the club wants and we are not in the position the fans deserve. \n\"This is the reality. I'm sorry. If they can make the next game, hopefully they can celebrate with us.\"\nDespite the struggles, Arroyo still has belief.\nShe added: \"I see the players are committed and trying to learn. I am convinced we will make it.\"",

        "article_text": "Mark Carney, former two-time central banker, was sworn in as Canada's new prime minister earlier this month, after being elected leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. \nOn Sunday, he called a snap election. \nSeveral political leaders had called for a vote after former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he was resigning as leader of the Liberals in January.\nBut after US President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on the country, sparking a trade war, calls have grown for Canada to go to the polls as soon as possible.\nWith the snap election call, Carney is sending Canadians the polls in a matter of weeks. \nThe election will be held on Monday 28 April. \nBy law, the maximum time between federal elections in Canada is five years. The next vote was officially scheduled for 20 October 2025. \nHowever, there are a couple of scenarios in which an early election can be triggered: \nThe first scenario is what Carney did on Sunday. \nIn the Canadian federal election - as in the UK's general election - voters do not cast a ballot directly for a prime minister. \nInstead, the leader of the party with the majority of members of parliament (MPs) becomes PM. \nThat means Carney will be in the running, along with Pierre Poilievre, who leads the opposition Conservative Party, and Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic Party. \nFour main parties will contest the next election - the Liberals, the Conservatives, the New Democrats (NDP) and the Bloc Quebecois. \nThe Liberal Party has been in power since 2015, when Trudeau was voted in. At dissolution, it held 153 seats. \nThe Conservatives were the official opposition with 120 seats. \nThe Bloc Quebecois, which only runs candidates in the province of Quebec, had 33 seats, and the NDP had 24. \nThe Green Party held two seats.\nDuring the latter stages of Trudeau's premiership, opinion polls consistently showed the Conservatives with a strong lead. \nBut the numbers tightened after Trudeau stepped down. \nFollowing Trump's decision to introduce steep tariffs against Canada, they tightened further, suggesting a neck-and-neck race. \nWhen Trudeau resigned at the beginning of 2025, he did so under significant pressure from his own party. It was felt that his personal unpopularity was damaging the Liberals' hopes of winning the next election.\nNational polling averages, shared by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), suggest how support for the Liberals weakened throughout 2023 and 2024.\nAt the same time, support for the Conservatives soared. On 20 January 2025 - the day of Trump's inauguration - the Conservatives were polling 44.8% while the Liberals were on 21.9%.\nSince then, polls suggest that support for the Liberals has ticked back up. The latest averages indicate that 37.5% of Canadians back the Liberals, while 37.1% support the Conservatives. \nThis marks the first time in three years the Liberals are leading in the polls, according to the CBC. \nHow to respond to President Trump's economic threats has overtaken the cost of living as the dominant issue for voters.\nThere are 343 federal ridings - also called constituencies or electoral districts -across the country. Each has a corresponding seat in the House of Commons. \nAll the seats in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, are up for grabs during an election.\nMembers of the Senate, the upper chamber, are appointed and do not run for election.\nLike the UK, Canada has a \"first-past-the-post\" electoral system. \nThe candidate who gets the most votes in each riding wins that seat and become an MP. They do not need to get the majority of all the votes cast in their area. Other parties win nothing in that area.\nThe leader of the party with the largest number of elected MPs normally forms the government. The second-placed party usually forms the official opposition. \nIf no party ends up with an overall majority of seats, the result is known as a hung parliament or a minority government. \nPractically, it means the party with the most seats will not be able to pass legislation without the help of other parties.\nTo vote in a Canadian election you must:",

Around 600 boys join the programme each year.\nAt the end around half of them will earn extended scholarships or professional contracts while of the other half, most will end up in higher or further education, an apprenticeship, an American scholarship or part-time work in semi-pro football.\nLast year 16% of LFE apprentices went into higher or further education, with a third of those opting to study at universities in the United States.\nThey combine four years of full-time football with studying for a degree in a country where football culture is booming - a World Cup looming in 2026 and with Lionel Messi and a host of former Premier League stars now lighting up the MLS.\n\"Our trustees have always strongly believed in education alongside football development,\" said LFE chief executive officer Sarah Stephen.\n\"At some point even those who get a pro contract won't be in the game. We have to prepare them all for an alternative career, whether that's inside or outside football.\n\"Before they have even started, part of the welcome presentation is to show them where some of the boys are now - boys who aren't necessarily playing football but are out in America or some have careers playing in Sweden and are doctors, physios, firefighters.\n\"It's got to be a life-enriching experience for everyone. Ofsted said we are absolutely developing extremely resilient, confident, articulate young men ready for their next steps, whether that's as a footballer or whatever they choose to do.\"\nLFE send development mentors into clubs, provide mental health support and run a life skills programme covering issues like addiction, personal finances, sexual health, consent and, in certain regions, knife crime.\nThey also track scholars for three years after their apprenticeship ends, and provide further support where needed, while all scholars become PFA members for life.\nEach May around 200 players attend trials for released players, where 95% get some form of interest from clubs in the EFL or National League or from UK or, increasingly, US universities.\nSo, let's meet some of the kids in America...\nMaximus Rigby spent nine years playing for Leeds and shared pitches with Anthony Gordon, Jarell Quansah and Oscar Bobb before being released in 2021\nMaximus Rigby, a 21-year-old midfielder from York, was signed by Leeds United aged nine. After signing a scholarship at 16, he was released two years later in 2021. He has spent the past four years studying business marketing at Saint Francis University in Pennsylvania while playing Division One football for the Red Flash.\n\"As a kid you don't understand the dynamic of how the football industry works when you sign at that age, especially being such a high level,\" Rigby says.\n\"You're like 'wow, this is a pretty straightforward line, all I have to do is keep playing and I'm going to be there in a few years'. You realise along the way it's not like that.\n\"As you get older you start to see lads you've been with for a good period of time get released, whether they are too small, not technical, whatever the reason, then the questions start to come around you. You start to feel the pressure, this isn't a game you just sit around and enjoy any more. That's when it really hits you.\"\nAnd Rigby said things got \"really competitive\" when Leeds won promotion to the Premier League in 2020.\n\"I was parking next to Lamborghinis in my Toyota,\" he smiled. \"It shows you are so close but so far. You're training with guys that are famous millionaires, but there's that element of they are just human. \n\"When you're with them you think 'I can strive for this, for sure' \u2013 it does motivate you and you can see this is not too far away if you get a bit lucky or put in the work.\"\nRigby, though, had realised it might not work out. He didn't put \"all his eggs in one basket\" with Leeds or anywhere, attending a number of trials, which, in turn, opened the door to the States - and a culture shock at first.\n\"Going out there you have no idea what you are about to do - when I got out here after a long journey you go into a dorm room with nothing on the wall, like a prison room, you think 'I've just made the mistake of my life',\" he added.\n\"But give it a week or two and you make friends, learn so much, and you're so busy you don't miss home, you just soak in an amazing opportunity.\n\"I think a lot of people get turned off by the whole school aspect, but I think people underestimate it. You learn a lot. I have team-mates from all over the world.\n\"There's a big misconception about the style and level of the football out here. Some guys are 22 or 23 and have professional experience in France or Germany.\n\"It's been a blast, a crazy journey but one I'm thankful for, with a lot of lessons along the way.\"\nAlex Hare is in his final year at Tampa\nAlex Hare, a 22-year-old goalkeeper from Derby, played for his beloved Rams from age seven to 16 before being picked up by Sheffield Wednesday. He was released in 2021 and opted to move to the US, spending time at Missouri State and Coastal Carolina University before transferring to the University of Tampa where he will start his final season with the Spartans in August alongside a sports management degree.\n\"My dad's always been a very realistic person, so he drilled into me from a young age 'enjoy your football while you can, but don't have the idea everything is going to be sunshine and rainbows, because the chances are you're probably not going to make it',\" said Hare matter-of-factly.\n\"When I was released by Derby it was tough to take. It was like your girlfriend's dumped you x100. It's horrible, especially with it being the club you supported growing up, and still do.\"\nIt was a feeling he experienced again with Wednesday two years later - but Hare says the LFE did a good job of highlighting the routes available to him long before he was released by the Owls.\n\"Early on I recognised America as a really good pathway for me, but when you're 14 you're a typical na\u00efve footballer thinking you're going to be playing Champions League by the time you're 22,\" he added.\n\"You get to 17, 18 and reality starts to hit. You see a lot of very good players in age groups above you and it's not happening for them and you start to shift your mentality.\n\"The America route seemed great because I get a degree and I can set my future up in a better way off the pitch - it's still full time football for four years, a lot of lads who end up dropping into non-league don't get that, and I get the experience of living and going to university in America.\n\"I felt it would be a better move for me and my life and it has been, I'm very glad I did it.\"\nThanks to his coach, Hare has already had a trial with second-tier professional side the Tampa Bay Rowdies and hopes to make a career in the game when he graduates.\n\"The standard surprised me, it was a lot better than I thought it would be,\" he added. \"You don't realise how many Europeans there are. \n\"Without sounding arrogant I expected to come to Tampa, a Division Two school, with the best football resume but there's a guy here who has made an appearance for Bologna in Serie A - all of a sudden Wednesday under-18s isn't looking too impressive.\n\"I do worry if I go back to England I'd have to drop a few tiers down. I'm not sure if I'd be able to get a move where it would be worth giving up the life I have out here.\n\"I definitely want to work in football, it's my passion, whether that's going into coaching, analysis, player representation. I think I want to stay in America, there's more opportunities with the game growing, and it's 26 degrees in mid-March too.\"\nClick here to learn more about the work of the LFE , externaland for more information on youth development within the EFL, head here., external\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "The main rival to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been formally arrested and charged with corruption.\nEkrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul, is expected to be selected as the opposition Republican People's Party's (CHP) 2028 presidential nominee in a ballot on Sunday. \nHe has denied the allegations and said they are politically motivated. \"I will never bow,\" he wrote on X before he was remanded in custody.\nHis detention sparked some of Turkey's largest protests in more than a decade. Erdogan has condemned the demonstrations and accused the CHP of trying to \"disturb the peace and polarise our people\".\nImamoglu was one of more than 100 people, including other politicians, journalists and businessmen, detained as part of an investigation on Wednesday, triggering four consecutive nights of demonstrations.\nOn Sunday, he was formally arrested and charged with \"establishing and managing a criminal organisation, taking bribes, extortion, unlawfully recording personal data and rigging a tender\".\nHe was remanded in custody pending trial. AFP and local media reported he had been taken to a prison in Silivri.\nIn social media posts, Imamoglu criticised his arrest as a \"black stain on our democracy\", and said judicial procedure was not being followed.\nHe urged people across the country to join protests and to take part in Sunday's vote. Imamoglu is the only person running in the CHP's presidential candidate selection.\nLarge crowds had already gathered near Istanbul's city hall by early evening, and could be seen waving Turkish flags and chanting in front of a row of riot police.\nAs night began to fall, officers were seen firing water cannons at some protesters.\nThe arrest does not prevent Imamoglu's candidacy and election as president, but if he is convicted of any of the charges against him, he will not be able to run. \nThe jailed politician is seen as one of the most formidable rivals of Erdogan, who has held office in Turkey for 22 years as both prime minister and president.\nHowever, due to term limits, Erdogan cannot run for office again in 2028 unless he changes the constitution.\nOpposition figures say the arrests are politically motivated. But the Ministry of Justice has criticised those connecting Erdogan to the arrests, and insist on its judicial independence.\nImamoglu has meanwhile been suspended from his post as Instanbul's mayor, Turkey's interior ministry said in a statement.\nProsecutors also want to charge Imamoglu with \"aiding an armed terrorist organisation\", but the Turkish court said it was not currently necessary.\nThe CHP had a de facto alliance with the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM) in connection with last year's local elections. \nDEM has been accused of being affiliated with the PKK - or Kurdistan Workers' Party - which it denies. \nThe PKK declared a ceasefire early this month, after waging an insurgency against Turkey for more than 40 years. It is proscribed as a terrorist group in Turkey, the EU, UK and US.\nMeanwhile, Istanbul University announced on Tuesday it was revoking Imamoglu's degree due to alleged irregularities.\nIf upheld, this would put his ability to run as president into doubt, since the Turkish constitution says presidents must have completed higher education to hold office.\nImamoglu's lawyers said they would appeal the decision to revoke his degree to the Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights.\nThe Supreme Election Council will decide whether Imamoglu is qualified to be a candidate.\nThousands have taken to the streets across Turkey in largely peaceful demonstrations since Imamoglu's detention on Wednesday.\nAn initial four-day ban on gatherings in Istanbul, designed to stifle protests, now covers the whole country. It was extended for another four days on Saturday.\nMore than 700 arrests have been made since the protests began, according to Turkish authorities.\nRiot police have repeatedly clashed with protesters and have been seen firing pepper gas and water cannons towards them.\nOn Saturday, tear gas hung in the air outside the mayor's office in Istanbul before the protests had even started. \nAs the crowds grew throughout the evening, it became hard to breathe as round after round was fired to disperse demonstrators.\nChanting \"rights, law, justice\", people of all ages defied the government ban to protest against what they saw as an unlawful detention.\nOne young woman, dressed in black and wearing a face mask, told the BBC she was not protesting for political reasons or because she supported the opposition, but instead to defend democracy.\n\"I'm here for justice, I'm here for liberty. We're free people and Turkish people cannot accept this. This is against our behaviour and culture.\"\nAnother woman, who had brought her 11-year-old son to the protests, said she wanted to include him because she is worried about his future.\n\"It's getting harder to live in Turkey day by day, we can't control our lives, we can't choose who we want and there is no real justice here,\" she said.",

Israel resumed attacks on Tuesday as talks to extend the deal failed to progress. \nIsrael has warned that attacks will intensify in Gaza until Hamas releases the remaining hostages.\n\nIsrael says Hamas is still holding 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Thursday it had begun \"targeted ground activities\" to create what it called a \"partial buffer between the north and south\" in Gaza. It called the action a \"limited ground operation\".\nIDF spokesperson Col Avichay Adraee said forces were deployed up to the centre of a strip known as the Netzarim corridor which divides northern and southern Gaza.\nOn Tuesday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it had \"resumed combat in full force\" and any ceasefire negotiations would now take place \"under fire\".\nIsrael and Hamas have failed to agree how to take the ceasefire beyond the first phase, which expired on 1 March.\nHamas did not agree to a renegotiation of the ceasefire on Israel's terms, although it offered to release a living American hostage and four hostages' bodies as mediators tried to keep the ceasefire going.\nIsrael blocked all food, fuel and medical supplies entering Gaza at the beginning of March in order to put pressure on Hamas. It accused Hamas of commandeering the provisions as part of its strategy against Israel, though without providing evidence.\nThe war was triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, were killed and 251 other taken hostage. Twenty-five Israeli and five Thai hostages were released alive during the first phase of the ceasefire.\nIsrael responded to the October attack with a massive military offensive, which had killed more than 48,500 Palestinians, mainly civilians, before Israel resumed its campaign, the Hamas-run health ministry says.

Israel has warned that attacks will intensify in Gaza until Hamas releases the remaining hostages.Israel says Hamas is still holding 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Thursday it had begun \"targeted ground activities\" to create what it called a \"partial buffer between the north and south\" in Gaza. At least 55 killed in new Israeli Gaza strikes, says Hamas-run agency6 minutes agoShareSaveSeher AsafBBC NewsShareSaveReutersIsrael resumed large-scale air strikes on Gaza on TuesdayAt least 55 Palestinians have been killed in overnight Israeli air strikes in Gaza, the Hamas-run civil defence agency has said.It comes after Israel resumed its bombing campaign and ground operations in the territory this week, with air strikes killing more than 430 people over two days, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Hamas says the ground operation announced by Israel on Wednesday is a \"new and dangerous\" violation of the ceasefire deal, which began in January. It called the action a \"limited ground operation\".IDF spokesperson Col Avichay Adraee said forces were deployed up to the centre of a strip known as the Netzarim corridor which divides northern and southern Gaza.On Tuesday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it had \"resumed combat in full force\" and any ceasefire negotiations would now take place \"under fire\".Israel and Hamas have failed to agree how to take the ceasefire beyond the first phase, which expired on 1 March.Hamas did not agree to a renegotiation of the ceasefire on Israel's terms, although it offered to release a living American hostage and four hostages' bodies as mediators tried to keep the ceasefire going.Israel blocked all food, fuel and medical supplies entering Gaza at the beginning of March in order to put pressure on Hamas. It accused Hamas of commandeering the provisions as part of its strategy against Israel, though without providing evidence.The war was triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, were killed and 251 other taken hostage.",

        "article_text": "Mike Johns didn't expect his return trip from Los Angeles to Scottsdale, Arizona in December to go viral.\nTo get to the airport he booked a driverless taxi and enjoyed a thrill when he jumped in with curious bystanders looking on.\nBut he got much more attention than he bargained for. \nMr Johns found himself being driven around and around a car park while those same bystanders looked on.\nThe Waymo ride was not doing what it should and there was no obvious way Mr Johns could fix it - and he had a flight to catch.\nMr Johns recorded the experience, a video that went viral almost immediately and was picked up on TV stations around the world, casting fresh public doubt about self-driving cars and how ready they are for real-world passengers.\n\"Why is this happening to me on a Monday morning?\" Mr Johns filmed himself asking.\nEventually a voice activated inside the car telling him to access the Waymo app to get the vehicle back under control.\nWaymo which is owned by Alphabet, the parent company of Google, told the BBC that it released a software update almost immediately fixing the problem.\nThe company says its driverless system is \"better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries, airbag deployments, and police reports\".\nNevertheless, Mr John's experience is not the first time the company has had to take action.\nLast year the company recalled more than 600 cars after one hit a street pole.\nAnd in May 2024 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched a probe into 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles .\nThe road to a driverless future has also gone awry for rival services.\nIn December, US car giant General Motors closed down its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise.\nGM attributed the change of strategy to \"the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business\".\nIn October 2023, one of its vehicles hit a pedestrian and dragged her for more than 20ft (6m), leaving her seriously injured.\nMeanwhile, in February of last year, it emerged that Apple's rumoured self-driving car project was folding.\nUber abandoned its own driverless car efforts in 2020. \nBut some big players remain in the race, including Zoox, which is owned by Amazon, as well as chipmaker Nvidia and Elon Musk's Tesla.\nWaymo is the leading US player though. It already operates self-driving taxis in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas and is promising to launch soon in Atlanta and Miami, Florida.\nSo why has Waymo succeeded where other efforts, at least in the US, have failed?\n\"Three things - people, money and process,\" says Sven Beiker, a lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and managing director of Silicon Valley Mobility, an automotive consultancy.\nHe points out that over the years Waymo has employed some of the leading figures in autonomous vehicle engineering, it has the financial weight of Google-owner Alphabet behind it, and has become thorough in its approach.\n\"They've come around to really playing by the book, to be a good steward of processes... working with regulators to make sure what they deploy is safe.\"\nSo what's next?\nRegions with good weather are likely to see driverless services first says Philipp Kampshoff, global co-leader of Automotive and Assembly Practice at the consultancy giant McKinsey.\nThat would include southern US states like Texas and Florida, where Waymo already has plans.\n\"Robo-taxis still operate much better in good weather conditions. They still, for the most part, struggle in heavy snow,\" Mr Kampshoff says.\nHe also points out that the batteries perform better in warmer conditions, which is particularly important for driverless cars that need a lot of energy to power on board computing.\n\"Bringing this all together, in the second part of the 2020s, you will see one city after the other being unlocked and then scaling within these cities,\" he says. \nIt will be a slow process. \n\"It's actually quite a labour intensive process to roll out this technology, which includes a fair amount of human driving,\" says Mr Beiker. \n\"You need to drive those vehicles through the streets where you want to deploy them, and you need to drive them over and over again, and you need to, to some extent, manually edit the data,\" he adds. \nAnd the whole process could also be held up by safety concerns. \n\"This is only going to happen if we're not running into major accidents. The moment major accidents are going to happen, a lot of these operations are going to be shut down,\" says Mr Kampshoff.\nFor those working on self-driving trucks, safety is arguably on even bigger worry.\n\"Safety is the number one concern that we work on,\" says David Liu, the chief executive of Plus, which makes driverless software for trucks and works with global companies such as Amazon, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Scania.\n\"Autonomous trucks and autonomous vehicles, need to be much safer than average human driven vehicle,\" says Mr Liu.\n\"Human drivers are great, but not flawless. Most of the accidents we get ourselves into are due to driver inattentiveness. And we don't have that issue with technology,\" Mr Liu explains.\n\"A robo-taxi mostly runs within cities in low-speed environments, while trucks are typically run on highways at higher speed.\n\"So we do need to put in different set of technology to be able to see more clearly around the trucks and be able to handle a longer braking distance, for instance.\"\nTo see into the driverless future it might be worth watching developments in China. \nIn the city of Wuhan more than 500 driverless cars are being operated by the company Baidu.\nAcross the country driverless cars are reported to be operating in 16 cities and being tested by 19 manufacturers.\n\"There's definitely more competition... there are four or five companies that are very similar to Waymo,\" says Mr Beiker who is currently working on a study of robo-taxi deployments around the world, sponsored by Sweden's innovation agency Vinnova.\nBack in Scottsdale, Mr Johns reflects on his experience and the rollout of autonomous vehicles.\n\"One big thing is that we're all a part of a paid experiment. At the end of the day, what they're doing is fixing it as they go, per city. And that's a problem.\"",

He attended the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in history and anthropology. \nAfter finishing school, Blanchet worked as a teacher and later led a music non-profit in Montreal. \nThe year Blanchet was elected leader, the Bloc increased the number of seats it had in Parliament, overtaking the New Democrats to become the party with the third-most seats in the House of Commons. \nQuebec voters -  and the province's 78 federal ridings - have in the past dramatically affected election outcomes in Canada. \nThe Bloc's mandate is to be a voice for Quebec in Ottawa. \nAmong the big issues in Quebec right now is the global trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.

        "article_text": "The end of March is when things start getting really serious at clubs up and down the English Football League.\nBut it's not just promotion races or relegation scraps dominating the agenda as the season draws to an end.\nBehind-the-scenes decisions are made and meetings arranged which will affect not just the months ahead, but the careers and even lives of hundreds of promising footballers who have spent the past two years on academy scholarships.\nFor around half of those, extended scholarships or lucrative professional contracts are dangled, keeping hopes and dreams of 'making it' alive for at least another year.\nFor others, when the clocks go forward, their time is nearly up.\nSo what happens next?\nThe EFL's Youth Development Week is a perfect time to shine a light on what happens to scholars released by their clubs at the end of their League Football Education (LFE) apprenticeship.\nLFE was formed 21 years ago by the EFL and Professional Footballers' Association to provide apprenticeships for 16-18 year-old scholars at EFL clubs. Around 600 boys join the programme each year.\nAt the end around half of them will earn extended scholarships or professional contracts while of the other half, most will end up in higher or further education, an apprenticeship, an American scholarship or part-time work in semi-pro football.\nLast year 16% of LFE apprentices went into higher or further education, with a third of those opting to study at universities in the United States.\nThey combine four years of full-time football with studying for a degree in a country where football culture is booming - a World Cup looming in 2026 and with Lionel Messi and a host of former Premier League stars now lighting up the MLS.\n\"Our trustees have always strongly believed in education alongside football development,\" said LFE chief executive officer Sarah Stephen.\n\"At some point even those who get a pro contract won't be in the game. We have to prepare them all for an alternative career, whether that's inside or outside football.\n\"Before they have even started, part of the welcome presentation is to show them where some of the boys are now - boys who aren't necessarily playing football but are out in America or some have careers playing in Sweden and are doctors, physios, firefighters.\n\"It's got to be a life-enriching experience for everyone. Ofsted said we are absolutely developing extremely resilient, confident, articulate young men ready for their next steps, whether that's as a footballer or whatever they choose to do.\"\nLFE send development mentors into clubs, provide mental health support and run a life skills programme covering issues like addiction, personal finances, sexual health, consent and, in certain regions, knife crime.\nThey also track scholars for three years after their apprenticeship ends, and provide further support where needed, while all scholars become PFA members for life.\nEach May around 200 players attend trials for released players, where 95% get some form of interest from clubs in the EFL or National League or from UK or, increasingly, US universities.\nSo, let's meet some of the kids in America...\nMaximus Rigby spent nine years playing for Leeds and shared pitches with Anthony Gordon, Jarell Quansah and Oscar Bobb before being released in 2021\nMaximus Rigby, a 21-year-old midfielder from York, was signed by Leeds United aged nine. After signing a scholarship at 16, he was released two years later in 2021. He has spent the past four years studying business marketing at Saint Francis University in Pennsylvania while playing Division One football for the Red Flash.\n\"As a kid you don't understand the dynamic of how the football industry works when you sign at that age, especially being such a high level,\" Rigby says.\n\"You're like 'wow, this is a pretty straightforward line, all I have to do is keep playing and I'm going to be there in a few years'. You realise along the way it's not like that.\n\"As you get older you start to see lads you've been with for a good period of time get released, whether they are too small, not technical, whatever the reason, then the questions start to come around you. You start to feel the pressure, this isn't a game you just sit around and enjoy any more. That's when it really hits you.\"\nAnd Rigby said things got \"really competitive\" when Leeds won promotion to the Premier League in 2020.\n\"I was parking next to Lamborghinis in my Toyota,\" he smiled. \"It shows you are so close but so far. You're training with guys that are famous millionaires, but there's that element of they are just human. \n\"When you're with them you think 'I can strive for this, for sure' \u2013 it does motivate you and you can see this is not too far away if you get a bit lucky or put in the work.\"\nRigby, though, had realised it might not work out. He didn't put \"all his eggs in one basket\" with Leeds or anywhere, attending a number of trials, which, in turn, opened the door to the States - and a culture shock at first.\n\"Going out there you have no idea what you are about to do - when I got out here after a long journey you go into a dorm room with nothing on the wall, like a prison room, you think 'I've just made the mistake of my life',\" he added.\n\"But give it a week or two and you make friends, learn so much, and you're so busy you don't miss home, you just soak in an amazing opportunity.\n\"I think a lot of people get turned off by the whole school aspect, but I think people underestimate it. You learn a lot. I have team-mates from all over the world.\n\"There's a big misconception about the style and level of the football out here. Some guys are 22 or 23 and have professional experience in France or Germany.\n\"It's been a blast, a crazy journey but one I'm thankful for, with a lot of lessons along the way.\"\nAlex Hare is in his final year at Tampa\nAlex Hare, a 22-year-old goalkeeper from Derby, played for his beloved Rams from age seven to 16 before being picked up by Sheffield Wednesday. He was released in 2021 and opted to move to the US, spending time at Missouri State and Coastal Carolina University before transferring to the University of Tampa where he will start his final season with the Spartans in August alongside a sports management degree.\n\"My dad's always been a very realistic person, so he drilled into me from a young age 'enjoy your football while you can, but don't have the idea everything is going to be sunshine and rainbows, because the chances are you're probably not going to make it',\" said Hare matter-of-factly.\n\"When I was released by Derby it was tough to take. It was like your girlfriend's dumped you x100. It's horrible, especially with it being the club you supported growing up, and still do.\"\nIt was a feeling he experienced again with Wednesday two years later - but Hare says the LFE did a good job of highlighting the routes available to him long before he was released by the Owls.\n\"Early on I recognised America as a really good pathway for me, but when you're 14 you're a typical na\u00efve footballer thinking you're going to be playing Champions League by the time you're 22,\" he added.\n\"You get to 17, 18 and reality starts to hit. You see a lot of very good players in age groups above you and it's not happening for them and you start to shift your mentality.\n\"The America route seemed great because I get a degree and I can set my future up in a better way off the pitch - it's still full time football for four years, a lot of lads who end up dropping into non-league don't get that, and I get the experience of living and going to university in America.\n\"I felt it would be a better move for me and my life and it has been, I'm very glad I did it.\"\nThanks to his coach, Hare has already had a trial with second-tier professional side the Tampa Bay Rowdies and hopes to make a career in the game when he graduates.\n\"The standard surprised me, it was a lot better than I thought it would be,\" he added. \"You don't realise how many Europeans there are. \n\"Without sounding arrogant I expected to come to Tampa, a Division Two school, with the best football resume but there's a guy here who has made an appearance for Bologna in Serie A - all of a sudden Wednesday under-18s isn't looking too impressive.\n\"I do worry if I go back to England I'd have to drop a few tiers down.

Swapping Champions League dreams for the American dreamImage source, BBC/Getty/Maximus RigbyAlex HoadBBC Sport JournalistPublished21 March 2025The end of March is when things start getting really serious at clubs up and down the English Football League.But it's not just promotion races or relegation scraps dominating the agenda as the season draws to an end.Behind-the-scenes decisions are made and meetings arranged which will affect not just the months ahead, but the careers and even lives of hundreds of promising footballers who have spent the past two years on academy scholarships.For around half of those, extended scholarships or lucrative professional contracts are dangled, keeping hopes and dreams of 'making it' alive for at least another year.For others, when the clocks go forward, their time is nearly up.So what happens next?Image source, Rex Features'Have to be prepared for a career outside football'The EFL's Youth Development Week is a perfect time to shine a light on what happens to scholars released by their clubs at the end of their League Football Education (LFE) apprenticeship.LFE was formed 21 years ago by the EFL and Professional Footballers' Association to provide apprenticeships for 16-18 year-old scholars at EFL clubs. \"As you get older you start to see lads you've been with for a good period of time get released, whether they are too small, not technical, whatever the reason, then the questions start to come around you. Around 600 boys join the programme each year.At the end around half of them will earn extended scholarships or professional contracts while of the other half, most will end up in higher or further education, an apprenticeship, an American scholarship or part-time work in semi-pro football.Last year 16% of LFE apprentices went into higher or further education, with a third of those opting to study at universities in the United States.They combine four years of full-time football with studying for a degree in a country where football culture is booming - a World Cup looming in 2026 and with Lionel Messi and a host of former Premier League stars now lighting up the MLS. \"LFE send development mentors into clubs, provide mental health support and run a life skills programme covering issues like addiction, personal finances, sexual health, consent and, in certain regions, knife crime.They also track scholars for three years after their apprenticeship ends, and provide further support where needed, while all scholars become PFA members for life.Each May around 200 players attend trials for released players, where 95% get some form of interest from clubs in the EFL or National League or from UK or, increasingly, US universities.So, let's meet some of the kids in America...'Parking next to Lamborghinis in my Toyota'Image source, Maximus RigbyImage caption, Maximus Rigby spent nine years playing for Leeds and shared pitches with Anthony Gordon, Jarell Quansah and Oscar Bobb before being released in 2021Maximus Rigby, a 21-year-old midfielder from York, was signed by Leeds United aged nine.",

        "article_text": "Geovany Quenda signed for Chelsea from Sporting this week for \u00a342m\nTransfers in March? \nShould we be surprised when Chelsea sign two young players for a combined \u00a362m outside of the transfer window... or is this just the latest quirk of the club hierarchy's unquenching appetite for deals?\nSporting winger Geovany Quenda, 17, will join the Blues in 2026, while midfielder Dario Essugo, 20, will move this summer to deputise for Moises Caicedo. \nA recent Uefa report declared Chelsea's 2024 squad was \"comfortably the most expensive ever assembled\", 24% higher than the previous record by Real Madrid in 2020.\nThe report also says Chelsea spent almost 2bn euros (\u00a31.7bn) in transfer fees in the five-year period to 2024.\nAnd yet they keep spending.\nSeveral other teenagers are lined up to join Chelsea in the next few transfer windows, for fees worth more than \u00a3150m in total.\nThey include: \nMidfielder Kendry Paez, 17, who is already training with the Blues, and will complete a \u00a317m move in the summer\n18-year-old winger Estevao Willian, who is expected to join after the Club World Cup for \u00a329m - potentially rising to \u00a351m with add-ons, according to sources in Brazil \n19-year-old goalkeeper Mike Penders, who will join from Genk for \u00a317m in the summer \nAnd 19-year-old defender Mamadou Sarr, after an \u00a311.9m deal was agreed with partner club Strasbourg in January.\nQuenda, Essugo, Paez, Estevao, Penders and Sarr may all be exciting talents - but what is the masterplan at Stamford Bridge, and how can they afford it?\nBuy young stars on lower wages, spread the payments over long contracts, keep flipping players and sell on unwanted talent for a profit - that is Chelsea's strategy in a nutshell. Oh, and try to win things at the same time.\nWith an average age of 23 years and five months, the Blues already have the youngest squad in the Premier League - and it is set to get even younger from next season. \nThe club has had a radical shift in transfer strategy since Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital took over from Roman Abramovich in 2022. \nMost Abramovich-era players have been sold in an attempt to reduce the age of the squad - and the wage bill. \nThat money has then been reinvested in young talent in what appears to be a 'supercharged Brighton' approach to transfer business. \nYoung players are being signed on long contracts, usually between seven and nine years, for reasons which co-owner Boehly explained at last month's FT Business of Football event.\n\"It is the way this market operates,\" the American billionaire said. \"I don't see it as good or bad. \n\"You always focus on how you keep something together for a very long time. How? You identify a younger portfolio of players to be consistent and reliable over a long period of time - and that's an option that's valuable...\n\"A seven-year contract is really a five-year contract as 90% of the time you have to make a decision or shoot yourself in the foot [with a player trying to run down their contract]. \n\"You either agree terms, or shoot yourself in the foot, or agree there are greener pastures out there.\"\nA recent CIES Football Observatory report, external revealed Chelsea are the best performing team in world football when measuring how many minutes (almost 92%) are being played by players under contracts beyond 2026.\nIn other words - the clubs where squad planning is \"most likely to bring stability\" in the coming years or to \"generate substantial capital gains\" from transfers.\nChelsea are clearly betting on a host of highly rated youngsters from across the globe in the hope they will unearth more stars like Cole Palmer or Nicolas Jackson. \nThey also want to beat clubs like Benfica to rising stars in markets like South America to avoid paying a 'Portuguese premium', like they did when signing Enzo Fernandez for \u00a3107m in 2023. \n\"We knew there was going to be a big transition,\" Chelsea co-sporting director Paul Winstanley said in 2023. \"No chance to sit back and relax, that's for sure. Did we think we would oversee a Premier League record of transactions? Probably not.\" \nThat constant desire to trade players has slowed down a little after a series of record-breaking transfer windows in terms of both volume and spending.\nThe accounting model makes some sense as the long contracts and amortisation - spreading the cost of a transfer over an extended period - have enabled Chelsea to get players like Caicedo on comparatively 'lower' \u00a3180,000-a-week wages, despite him costing a British transfer record \u00a3115m when joining in 2023 from Brighton. \nUkraine winger Mykhailo Mudryk - who joined Chelsea for up to \u00a389m, inclusive of add-ons, from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2023 - is on 'just' \u00a397,000 a week on a contract running to 2031. He is one example of how players can spread lower baseline earnings across a longer deal.\nBut there can be issues with those lengthier contracts. \nMudryk is currently suspended after testing positive for a banned substance. If found guilty, he could face up to a four-year ban, while still having years on his Chelsea deal.\nAnd then what if a player wants out? On the Overlap podcast, Jamie Carragher asked whether any club could afford to buy Chelsea's star man Palmer.\nLast year, the playmaker renewed his contract until 2033, but Carragher said he can see the 22-year-old's \"frustration\" with some underperforming team-mates.\n\"It reminded me of Stevie [Gerrard] at Liverpool at times, because he was so much better than everyone else and he got frustrated. Stevie was a local player, but he was never going to leave, whereas Cole Palmer isn't. \n\"This is when I go back to those eight-year contracts, and whether they are good for the club and players. \n\"If you're Palmer, who's got six or seven years left on his deal, and he should be playing for a team looking to win the Champions League, how does he get out?\"\nThis is uncharted territory and, although it makes sense on a balance sheet, is the human aspect being overlooked?\nThere are also young players like Cesare Casadei, Renato Veiga and Carney Chukwuemeka who all left Chelsea in January amid various frustrations about a lack of minutes available, with multiple young stars all vying for the same roles. \nForward Christopher Nkunku, who was made available to other clubs in January - and other players such as midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who only joined last summer - face uncertainty before the next transfer window.\nChelsea sources continue to insist they have no issues with the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules (PSR) and have yet to fall foul of them under this ownership.\nHowever, it took what was described as a 'fire sale' of talent and the sale of two hotels to a sister company to continue adhering to the financial controls. \nChelsea have also been involved in a couple of so-called 'PSR swap deals' - with academy talent Ian Maatsen moving to Aston Villa as Omari Kellyman joined the Blues.\nQualifying for the Champions League would also help bolster the club's finances - and a major factor behind playing without a front-of-shirt sponsor is that the Blues are waiting to qualify for Europe's premier competition to negotiate a better rate. \nAnother positive on the horizon for Chelsea's finances is their involvement in this summer's expanded Club World Cup in the United States, when they are expected to receive more than \u00a350m to take part.\nIt is unlikely, therefore, that any marquee players will be sold but academy defender Trevoh Chalobah is still expected to leave to create more PSR headroom in the summer.\nKieron O'Connor, who writes the Swiss Ramble football finance blog, told BBC Sport: \"The only thing we know for sure with Chelsea's PSR situation is that they were compliant for the three-year monitoring period up to 2023-24, as the Premier League has confirmed that no clubs were in breach.\n\"Chelsea have not yet published their accounts for last season, but I reckon that the only way that they could have kept below the maximum \u00a3105m loss was by applying some fancy financial footwork.\n\"The expectation is they will have made a huge operating loss, as they did not qualify for Europe, while they have also struggled to replace shirt and sleeve sponsors. This will be partially offset by hefty player sales, but they will still need to find money elsewhere, such as the sale of the women's football club.\n\"The 2024-25 assessment will benefit from dropping the large 2021-22 loss, but compliance would still be dependent on the significant inter-company transactions. The big question is whether Uefa will also accept these exceptional credits, as their regulations are tighter than the Premier League's.\"\nWhere there is a real need to sell players is simply to get the squad numbers down as Chelsea look to move away from using loans for unwanted talent, like Ben Chilwell to Crystal Palace and Raheem Sterling to Arsenal, and instead try to develop young players at lower league and European clubs.\nChelsea believe within two loan spells they should be able to tell whether a young player is capable of making it at Stamford Bridge, and would look to sell a player quickly if they do not believe they can make the grade.\nDuring a vocal minority protest against the ownership at the recent match against Southampton, one common complaint was whether Chelsea could win trophies with a strategy similar to Brighton.\nIf Chelsea do not pay top-level wages, will the best players join the club? And doesn't experience count for something?\nChelsea's owners, and those close to them, have always highlighted their desire to win and ambitions to match expectations in the longer term. \nHowever, they want to do so with this current approach and have urged patience to wait for their players and this project to reach a mature stage. \nOne source suggested to BBC Sport that the project is at 'Everest Base Camp' - the starting point to climb the world's largest mountain.\nThose ambitions for major honours extend beyond just the Conference League, where Chelsea's squad was worth as much as the other 31 teams combined. \nSources close to senior players at Chelsea say they want stability having had three permanent managers and five including interim bosses across two seasons. \nAfter the 1-0 defeat by Arsenal at Emirates Stadium last weekend, Caicedo said \"they are working seven years together, and us just two years\". \nMaresca has also echoed those calls when explaining why Chelsea cannot be title contenders this season, pointing towards the time needed for Mikel Arteta, Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp to build their imposing teams.  \nChelsea's ownership subscribe to that view and currently believe Maresca works within the project better than his predecessors Mauricio Pochettino and Thomas Tuchel did, while getting better results than Graham Potter - who was sacked over results rather than a culture clash. \nHere are some fan views on the latest signings from the BBC Sport Chelsea page:\nGarry: Will either of them play in goal or as a striker then? I thought not. This is just more pointless stockpiling of young talent, with a view to cash in on potential demand further down the line. We are slowly becoming irrelevant as a club. I can't even be bothered to get annoyed with it all any more.\nClive: Off the back of rumours that we are going to be selling Enzo Fernandez, we have signed two more midfielders. That is OK, but where is the experienced and proven striker who is able to back up Nicolas Jackson and help his decision-making and scoring skills?\nNicholas: It's building a portfolio of players not building a team. I've become numb to the players coming into the club.\nTristan: These latest deals have summed up the Boehly ownership era, showing a lack of direction. When you think we are done spending too much money on young players, Boehly comes up trumps and spends insane amounts on players. Our ownership and management are equally poor - dramatic change is needed now.\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\nGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nHighlights: Price on target as Northern Ireland draw at home to Switzerland\nMuch has been made of the youthful nature of Michael O'Neill's new generation Northern Ireland side.\nSo youthful, in fact, that the average age of the team that finished the game was only 22. \nBut that was just a figure, and at Windsor Park against Switzerland on Friday you could not tell who the battle-hardened, major tournament experts were, and who were the fearless youngsters.\nAfter earning promotion from Nations League C, this was billed as a step up for Northern Ireland against a pot one team.\nWhile Switzerland were without a win in seven matches, they were Euro 2024 quarter-finalists, only knocked out on penalties by England. \nIsaac Price's latest moment of magic gave the hosts the lead, but the Swiss soon levelled through a header from the unmarked Vincent Sierro. \nThey have a reputation as one of Europe's most consistent and efficient sides, but there was not a gulf in class in Belfast. \nIn fact, it was Northern Ireland who could have won the match as Price, Lee Bonis, Ethan Gabraith and debutant Jamie Donley all had efforts to find a winner.\n\"It was good, it was what we wanted from the game,\" said a satisfied O'Neill.\n\"We scored a goal goal but, we're disappointed with the goal that we lost.\n\"If you look at the age of our team, against a really strong team - yes, they are missing some important players, but so are we.\n\"I think it shows a lot of progress in the team. We weren't overawed by the opposition.\"\nPrice on target as Northern Ireland draw with Switzerland\n'Lots of positives' in Switzerland draw - O'Neill\nO'Neill was pleased with the work from his side off the ball, as they allowed Switzerland to dominate possession but chances for the visitors were few and far between.\nAfter a difficult Euro 2024 campaign, in which an injury-ridden NI fell short of qualification, O'Neill's side have now lost just twice in 11 matches - one of which was to European champions Spain and the other a narrow defeat on a heavy pitch in Bulgaria.\nFriday's draw shows that things are moving in the right direction ahead of the start of 2026 World Cup qualifying in September.\nFor O'Neill, continuing that momentum is key.\n\"The cycle for Euro 2024 was a difficult one, we were never going to be able to compensate for the players we lost,\" O'Neill added.\n\"We didn't have players ready made to come in. We're probably benefiting from that now because we had to play the younger players in that point in time. \n\"There is momentum and it's good for the players, because when they started to play international football, maybe they weren't winning a lot of games. \n\"It's not like they are coming from the culture of, 'Oh, we're used to winning', so to give them that and get that experience at international level is vital. \n\"We have a really good group of lads - how they work as a group and what they are like around the hotel, it's a really easy group to manage and I think they have a lot of growing still to do.\" \nWhile Isaac Price, who O'Neill says is a \"brilliant young player\", stole the headlines after another superb goal, Northern Ireland's player of the night was arguably Ethan Galbraith, who continues to grow in stature every time he pulls on the green shirt. \nThe Leyton Orient midfielder also caught the eye of O'Neill, who said the 23-year-old produced \"a really good performance\".\n\"He's another player who looks really comfortable playing international football,\" O'Neill added.\n\"Technically he's so good as well. I always hoped Ethan would come through and I'm delighted that he has.\"\nWhen on the books of Manchester United, it was almost assumed it was a case of when not if Galbraith would play for Northern Ireland's senior team.\nHowever, after electing to drop down the leagues upon leaving Old Trafford, Galbraith has taken the long road to the international stage and O'Neill feels it was worth the wait. \n\"Ethan was a terrific young player, and it's a difficult situation to come through and be a player at Manchester United. \n\"He's had to go back down the leagues and I think Leyton Orient and [manager] Richie Wellens has been brilliant for him.\" \nEthan Galbraith was impressive in Northern Ireland's midfield and even had a spell at right-back\nO'Neill added that \"everyone knew the talent was there\" with Galbraith, who also had a spell at Doncaster Rovers.\n\"It sometimes just takes a little bit longer for it to fall into place. \n\"His mentality is a lot stronger now, his physical attributes are stronger - but his ability on the ball was never in question.\" \nAfter Friday's solid performance, Northern Ireland will be tested again in Stockholm against Sweden on Tuesday evening, who are on a resurgent run after dropping into League C.\nO'Neill admits he does not have the depth to \"change the side dramatically and expect the team to be just as strong\", but says he will likely freshen things up.\n\"Sweden are a good side. I'm not sure whether [Newcastle United striker Alexander] Isak will play and I believe [Sporting Lisbon's Victor] Gyokeres is out, but they have good players and it will be a test for us.  \n\"The players should gain confidence from tonight's game and take that into Tuesday.\"",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump revoked security clearances from his previously defeated Democratic election rivals, Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton, as well as a number of other former officials and critics.\nTrump said in February he was revoking security clearance for his predecessor Joe Biden. His order confirmed that decision, adding that he was also revoking the security clearance of \"any other member\" of the Biden family. \n\"I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information,\" Trump's memorandum read. \nFormer US presidents and top security officials usually keep their security clearance as a courtesy. \nTrump ordered department and agency leaders to \"revoke unescorted access to secure United States government facilities for these individuals.\"\n\"This action includes, but is not limited to, receipt of classified briefings, such as the President's Daily Brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the intelligence community by virtue of the named individuals' previous tenure in the Congress,\" the order stated.\nFor several named figures, the loss of access to classified material and spaces will have a more symbolic impact. \nIt may limit the materials they are able to review, or restrict access to some government buildings or secure facilities.\nThe lawyers and prosecutors named by Trump, however, could potentially face roadblocks in accessing or reviewing information for their cases or clients.\nTrump's revocations focus on top Biden administration officials, as well as prominent political critics and attorneys who have challenged Trump or his allies in court.\nBiden's secretary of state Antony Blinken, national security advisor Jake Sullivan, and deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco all lost their clearances.\nTrump also targeted two of his own former officials from his first term: Fiona Hill and Alexander Vindman, who testified during his first impeachment trial that began in 2019.\nTrump also revoked access for high-profile Republican critics, former Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.\nThey were the only two Republican lawmakers who joined a US House investigation into Trump's role in the 6 January 2021 attack on Congress.\nBoth also voted to charge Trump in his second impeachment, which a Democratic-led US House of Representatives instigated after the riot. Trump was acquitted by the Senate on the charge of inciting the 6 January riot.\nTrump has also singled out top legal opponents in his latest decision on security access. His order revoked clearance for New York attorney general Letitia James, who brought multiple lawsuits against Trump and his businesses. \nIn a civil fraud lawsuit that concluded in 2024, a judge found Trump liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in fines. Trump is appealing the decision.\nManhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg, who prosecuted and won Trump's criminal hush money case last year, also lost his clearance.\nTrump's legal targets went beyond elected prosecutors. He withdrew security clearance for Norm Eisen, an attorney leading multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce. \nAndrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor who joined an investigation of Trump during his first term and later provided media commentary about the hush money trial, also lost his clearance.\nPrevious media reports had indicated that the administration had pulled the security clearance for a top whistleblower attorney in Washington, Mark Zaid.\nFriday's order listed him among the individuals who would lose access. \nHowever, Mr Zaid told the BBC that \"despite being told three times that my clearance has been revoked, I still have not received anything formally.\"\nHe claimed losing his security clearance would harm \"the federal employees, including Trump supporters, who count on me to handle cases few other lawyers could.\"\nSeveral of the individuals chosen by Trump derided his order in social media statements.\n\"I don't care what noises Donald Trump makes about a security clearance that hasn't been active for five years,\" Mr Vindman wrote on X.\nMr Eisen wrote on X that being targeted by Trump's order \"just makes me file even more lawsuits!\" \nTrump had earlier pulled security clearances of more than four dozen former intelligence officials whom he accused of meddling in the 2020 election in Joe Biden's favour. He provided no evidence for these claims.\nIn February, Trump announced he was revoking Biden's security access. In a social media post, Trump said Biden \"set this precedent in 2021, when he instructed the Intelligence Community (IC) to stop the 45th President of the United States (ME!) from accessing details on National Security, a courtesy provided to former Presidents\".\nIn 2021, Biden - serving as president at the time - barred his defeated rival Trump from having access to intelligence briefings citing his \"erratic behaviour\".\nA 2024 Justice Department special counsel report found Biden had improperly retained classified documents from his time as vice president. The report noted that Biden had cooperated with federal investigators and returned the discovered documents.\nIn 2023, Justice Department special prosecutor Jack Smith indicted Trump for allegedly mishandling classified documents following his first term in office and obstructing their return to the government.\nTrump pleaded not guilty and a Florida federal judge dismissed the case in July 2024. Smith officially dropped the case that December after Trump won re-election.",

        "article_text": "It all started with one question.\nA query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.\nAnd no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.\nInstead, it was a simple ask: \"List my 10 best mutuals on X.\" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.\nWhen Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.\nThe chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too. \nLater, Grok shrugged it off, saying, \"I was just having fun, but lost control.\" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.\nAnd just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything \u2013 cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama \u2013 and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the \"most fun AI in the world!\".  \nEven law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket. \nAt first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, \"Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!\".\nBefore its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.\n\"Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,\" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.\nBut then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\nA tsunami of  political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding \"I am not afraid of anyone\". It claimed Gandhi had got the \"edge on formal education than Modi\". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews \"often seemed scripted\". \nWhen an X user asked whether the BJP \"is in trouble\" because of Grok, it replied: \"It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer.\"  When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.\nMr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.\n\"Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,\" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.\n\"Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,\" he adds.\nNikhil Pahwa, the founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, believes that the \"discourse around Grok's statements in India is overblown\".\n\"At its core, AI is fundamentally 'garbage in, garbage out' - its outputs reflect the data it is trained on, and the weights given to it,\" he says.\n\"Since Grok is trained on the entirety of X, it naturally mirrors the tone and patterns of discourse found there, including the bizarre responses and the abusing we are seeing.\n\"This isn't about ideology; it's about the nature of the input shaping the output,\" he adds.\nWhen the BBC asked Grok who spreads the most disinformation on X, it responded on Thursday: \"Musk is a strong contender, given his reach and recent sentiment on X, but I can't crown him just yet.\"\nJoyojeet Pal, who studies political use of social media at the University of Michigan, says unlike a politician or celebrity with a set ideology, a chatbot is only partisan if explicitly trained to be or if its data overwhelmingly supports a particular view. If a chatbot leans too partisan, it risks losing its competitive edge.\n\"In Grok's particular case, this is tickling liberals because the most dominant voices on the platform [X] lean right and are dismissive of liberal arguments. But the larger data it trains on is likely to present a more balanced view of the world, often explicitly at odds with what its loudest voices are saying,\" he said.\nIndia's IT ministry is already in touch with X regarding Grok's use of inappropriate language  and \"controversial responses\", according to reports. \nWhile some view this as a passing phase, with Mr Sinha predicting that \"people will soon get bored of it and all this will be short lived\", Grok's unfiltered nature hints it might be here to stay. At least for the time being.\nWith additional reporting by Nikita Yadav in Delhi \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Heather Knight is yet to confirm whether she will remain as England captain\nJon Lewis is not the first England coach or captain to fall victim to the ruthless scrutiny that follows a heavy Ashes defeat, and he certainly will not be the last.\nThe series, which ended in February with a 16-0 thrashing, saw England's women placed under a microscope of pressure, criticism and attention like never before. \nMuch of that came down to England's below-par, and often meek, performances, but a considerable amount was also down to their attitude and the perception they displayed to their fans and the media. \nSince his appointment in November 2022, Lewis has been the driver of England's external messaging, constantly preaching about aggression, fearlessness and entertainment.  \nThe peak of his tenure came in the summer of 2023, when Heather Knight's side fought back from 6-0 down in the home Ashes to draw 8-8. It was a series that had record crowds in grounds including Edgbaston, Lord's and The Oval and showed England were capable of competing with, and beating, the world's best. \nBut after two T20 disappointments in 2023 and 2024 and an away Ashes humiliation, endless talk of processes and style was wearing thin with England followers - they just wanted to win something meaningful, something that has not been achieved since the 50-over World Cup win at Lord's in 2017. \nThe next global tournament is approaching in India at the end of the summer, which will be the first major assignment for England's next coach. \nBefore then, home series against West Indies and India, where there will be plenty for the side and the management to learn and put right from Lewis' tenure.\nEngland sack coach Lewis after Ashes humiliation\nFormer captain Edwards wants to help England rebuild\nAussies offer solutions to England's 'fundamental weaknesses'\nDespite the cloud of negativity under which he has departed, Lewis' record as coach is solid, with a win percentage of 71% across all formats. \nBut the biggest learning curve for England from the Ashes and Lewis' era is that winning bilateral series, with all due respect to the opposition, do not count for much. \nThe home summer of 2024 which saw dominant clean sweeps against Pakistan and New Zealand was quickly forgotten when England crashed out of the T20 World Cup in the group stage following a shambolic display against West Indies. \nThe comprehensive series win in South Africa in December meant little when they were outplayed on every occasion in Australia less than a month later.\nUnder Lewis, England have shown what they are capable of at times, most notably during that memorable home Ashes, but they have also shown far too often that they cannot do it when it counts. \nAfter the humbling at the beginning of the year, the managing director of England women's cricket Clare Connor repeated Lewis' common statement that their side is not put under pressure frequently enough outside of Ashes series and World Cups - but that is a difficult excuse to stand up when Australia, so far ahead of the rest of the world, seem to manage pretty well. \nEngland will once again be expected to dominate this upcoming home summer, but the World Cup in India presents an enormous challenge in terms of the conditions and the physical toll it could take. \nThey may not be favourites - Australia always are, and India will be confident on home soil - but over the past two years England have been unable to get past the semi-final stage and for the team ranked second in the world that is unacceptable.\nFor the new coach, and potentially new captain - Knight's future is still uncertain - it is a difficult challenge but one that could go a long way in winning back some fans, but they cannot afford another case of deja vu. \nConnor also acknowledged that the team's reputation had taken a hit, but refuted claims of \"cosiness\" or a lack of professionalism. \nBut honesty will go a long way in winning back fans for England, and the new coach cannot fix a problem unless they accept there is one. \nSophie Ecclestone's refusal to do a pre-match interview with Channel 7 pundit and former England spinner Alex Hartley gave England more unwanted headlines, and while Connor admitted it was an \"unfortunate incident\" that would not be repeated, it threw the team's perception and attitude into the limelight, giving the impression of a culture which enabled one of its best players to make such an unprofessional call with little consequence.\nLewis and Knight started to lose credibility with the repeated claims of being \"so close\" to beating Australia after the first few defeats, leaving fans and the media wondering whether we had all been watching different games. \nIt was also left to Knight and others to front up to the press after each crushing defeat, each one becoming more awkward and painful, with Lewis waiting until the third T20 in Adelaide - with the series already gone - until he eventually stepped forward. \nFrom that came his infamous quote about the \"Bondi to Coogee\" walk which suggested that Australia's climate and outdoor lifestyle was a factor in their athleticism being so superior to England's. \nNaturally, as with all woeful Ashes tours, the Australian media needed no encouragement to latch on to an opportunity for mocking and it felt like a turning point for Lewis' reign and that it would be very difficult for him and the team to recover.\nECB boss 'can't believe' 16-0 Women's Ashes loss\nThis video can not be played\n'Goodness me!' - England drop seven catches\nSo, just how can the new coach avoid the same mistakes on the field, too?\nThe review into the Ashes defeat is yet to be published but in terms of their on-field performances, England need to concentrate on going back to basics. \nThey were largely dominated by Australia, but there were also multiple instances of England gifting them opportunities to win - consider the inability to chase 181 in the second one-day international at Melbourne's Junction Oval, or the embarrassing second day of the Test match which saw seven dropped catches. \nThe team's fielding in general should be very high, if not top, of the new coach's to-do list - it is a huge area for improvement where England have faltered under Lewis, with drops also costing them in the T20 World Cup. \nSimilarly is their ability to play spin, and with a World Cup in India approaching, they have less time to rectify this weakness but it should be a non-negotiable. \nDuring the Ashes, they lost 40 wickets to spin at an average of 12.3 and a strike-rate of just 53.7. \nAgain, it is time to forget Lewis' talk of aggression and expressing yourself - it is clearly not working. The batters evidently need direction in this regard; they need to adopt clear, individual plans against slower bowling before being left to their own devices. \nIf Lewis' reign was all about freedom and flexibility, it is possible that - or at least until these basics are done right - an element of structure and discipline would not do England any harm. \nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "It all started with one question.\nA query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.\nAnd no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.\nInstead, it was a simple ask: \"List my 10 best mutuals on X.\" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.\nWhen Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.\nThe chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too. \nLater, Grok shrugged it off, saying, \"I was just having fun, but lost control.\" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.\nAnd just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything \u2013 cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama \u2013 and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the \"most fun AI in the world!\".  \nEven law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket. \nAt first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, \"Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!\".\nBefore its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.\n\"Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,\" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.\nBut then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\nA tsunami of  political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding \"I am not afraid of anyone\". It claimed Gandhi had got the \"edge on formal education than Modi\". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews \"often seemed scripted\". \nWhen an X user asked whether the BJP \"is in trouble\" because of Grok, it replied: \"It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer.\"  When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.\nMr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.\n\"Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,\" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.\n\"Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,\" he adds.\nNikhil Pahwa, the founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, believes that the \"discourse around Grok's statements in India is overblown\".\n\"At its core, AI is fundamentally 'garbage in, garbage out' - its outputs reflect the data it is trained on, and the weights given to it,\" he says.\n\"Since Grok is trained on the entirety of X, it naturally mirrors the tone and patterns of discourse found there, including the bizarre responses and the abusing we are seeing.\n\"This isn't about ideology; it's about the nature of the input shaping the output,\" he adds.\nWhen the BBC asked Grok who spreads the most disinformation on X, it responded on Thursday: \"Musk is a strong contender, given his reach and recent sentiment on X, but I can't crown him just yet.\"\nJoyojeet Pal, who studies political use of social media at the University of Michigan, says unlike a politician or celebrity with a set ideology, a chatbot is only partisan if explicitly trained to be or if its data overwhelmingly supports a particular view. If a chatbot leans too partisan, it risks losing its competitive edge.\n\"In Grok's particular case, this is tickling liberals because the most dominant voices on the platform [X] lean right and are dismissive of liberal arguments. But the larger data it trains on is likely to present a more balanced view of the world, often explicitly at odds with what its loudest voices are saying,\" he said.\nIndia's IT ministry is already in touch with X regarding Grok's use of inappropriate language  and \"controversial responses\", according to reports. \nWhile some view this as a passing phase, with Mr Sinha predicting that \"people will soon get bored of it and all this will be short lived\", Grok's unfiltered nature hints it might be here to stay. At least for the time being.\nWith additional reporting by Nikita Yadav in Delhi \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

There were some tough times, but there were some great times too.\" \nKnown for their synchronised dance routines, the group plan to keep on movin' and bring them back to the stage once again, even if they are a little rusty.\n\"It does come back when you start getting back into the swing of things again, rehearsals, the moves, 'oh I'm meant to go up there, and go down there',\" said Abz. \n\"But I do need a little reminder of the lyrics, so I will be going back through the albums and reminding myself which parts were mine and what I'm actually singing where and when.\"\n\"I'm feeling pretty good about the moves,\" said Ritchie.\n\"I can't wait to get back out there and thrust me hips again.\" \nThe 25-date tour kicks off in Cardiff on 29 October and 2 November 2025.\nYou can hear Five on BBC Radio Wales at 12:00 BST on Saturday 21 March and on BBC Sounds.",

        "article_text": "Unalaska Island in the remote Aleutian archipelago was part of an epic, but now mostly forgotten, military campaign during World War Two.\nSituated where the northern Pacific Ocean meets the Bering Sea, the remote US island of\u00a0Unalaska\u00a0straddles the liminal zone where North America transitions into Siberia. The island lies further west than Hawaii; its position on the cusp of East Asia makes it one of Alaska's more remote and idiosyncratic communities.\nPart of the Aleutian Islands, a 1,100-mile volcanic archipelago that curves in a westward arc to within 600 miles of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, Unalaska features one of the harshest environments on the planet outside the polar regions. The windswept coastlines are rugged, often precipitous and almost entirely devoid of trees.\nBecause of the Aleutians' location in the Pacific Ring of Fire \u2013 one of the world's most seismically active areas \u2013 earthquakes are ubiquitous, and half of the island chain's 70 volcanoes, including Unalaska's active\u00a0Makushin\u00a0volcano, have erupted in the last 250 years. \"Cradle of Storms\" and \"Birthplace of Winds\" are two well-deserved nicknames among locals for the Aleutians. Conflicting weather systems generated in neighbouring seas result in cyclonic storms, hurricane-force winds, heavy rain and dense fog that have a considerable impact upon weather across much of Canada and the continental US.\nToday roughly 4,200 people call Unalaska home, including fishermen and the Indigenous Unangax\u0302 people (pronounced Oo-Nung-akhh). Also referred to as the Aleuts, the Unangax\u0302 have lived in the archipelago and parts of the Alaska Peninsula for at least 9,000 years, creating a subsistence lifestyle that drew upon every resource that the land and sea offered. But over the past several centuries, the Unangax\u0302 population has plummeted due to disease and the gradual attrition of their culture that came on the heels of colonialism. Today there are\u00a0around 2,000 Unangax\u0302\u00a0in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nYet, this wind-battered island has historically been home to another very different group of peoples who also migrated across what is now the Bering Strait: Russians.\u00a0\nAfter Danish explorer Vitus Bering and his Russian colleague Alexei Chirikov became the first-known Europeans to visit the Aleutian Islands in 1741, waves of Russian fur traders flocked to the archipelago to hunt sea otters and fur seals. After establishing a Russian settlement on Unalaska in 1759, the islands officially became a colony of the Russian Empire in the late 1700s. Today many inhabitants still have Russian surnames. The Russian Orthodox Church followed the fur hunters, building small houses of worship across the islands and converting many Unangax\u0302 to their faith.\nAlthough the US gained control of the Aleutian Islands when it purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867, the Russian Orthodox legacy has survived. Unalaska's\u00a0Church of the Holy Ascension\u00a0is one of a few Russian Orthodox houses of worship that remain. Rebuilt atop its original 1824 location in 1896, it is the oldest cruciform-style Russian Orthodox cathedral in North America, and contains one of Alaska's greatest collection of Russian artefacts, religious icons and artworks \u2013 including some that were donated directly from\u00a0Catherine the Great.\nBefore the arrival of the current Russian Orthodox priest, reverend Evon Bereskin was Unalaska's sole Christian Orthodox priest and the keeper of the Church of the Holy Ascension from 2013 to 2023. A member of the Unangax\u0302 community, he oversaw all the parishes in the Aleutian islands.\n\"I am constantly in awe of the fact that I [was] the custodian of this incredible relic building,\" he told me. \"It [was] an unbelievable honour and responsibility.\"\nAs head of the church, Reverend Bereskin raised funds to restore the church and its icons, which had suffered at the hands of time and the elements. He also changed the liturgy of his services to English (from the Unangax\u0302 language and old Slavonic) to make services more accessible to worshippers.\nPrior to World War Two, the US had a modest commercial and military presence on the Aleutian Islands, which, lying relatively close to East Asia, were vulnerable to attack after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. On 3-4 June 1942, planes from two Japanese aircraft carriers attacked Dutch Harbor in the town of Unalaska on the island's northern coast, killing 50 people. Several days later Japanese forces invaded Kiska and Attu islands, the westernmost islands in the Aleutians (670 and 850 miles from Unalaska, respectively), in an attempt to inflict a psychological blow and divert US forces from the Central Pacific theatre, where the Battle of Midway Island was about to take place. It was the first invasion of US soil since the British incursions in 1812. The SS Northwestern, a passenger and freight steamship used by the US Navy in the war, was destroyed in the Japanese attack on Dutch Harbor. Its rusted hull still rises above the water's surface, a ghostly reminder of a bloody battle.\nWithin months of the Dutch Harbor attack, 145,000 US and Canadian soldiers were deployed to defend and retake the occupied Aleutians. They secured the islands with fortresses, artillery and bunkers, such one on\u00a0Bunker Hill\u00a0above Dutch Harbor, which is now the setting of a\u00a0hike\u00a0with stunning 360-degree views. A larger base overlooking Unalaska Bay and the Bering Sea a few miles away on nearby Mount Ballyhoo, known as\u00a0Fort Schwatka, once featured 100 buildings and was built to withstand earthquakes and hurricane-force winds. Epic, harrowing battles were fought on bleak and difficult terrain. Thousands died on both sides of the conflict \u2013 many from exposure to the islands' harsh weather. By August 1943, the Japanese were expelled from the Aleutians, and over time, the battles that took place here have been largely forgotten.\nAfter the Japanese attacks, the US military ordered the mandatory evacuation of the Unangax\u0302 from the Aleutians for their safety and to prepare the island for arriving military forces. Residents were given less than a day's notice, allowed one suitcase each and weren't told where they were going or when they would return. In all, 881 Unangax\u0302 were expelled from nine villages across the archipelago and were interned at abandoned canneries in the temperate rainforests of south-eastern Alaska for three years. Many had never left their homeland before, let alone seen trees.\nAround 10% of the camps' population perished due to poor housing and sanitation conditions and limited access to health care. Those who returned to Unalaska in 1945 found their villages either looted or burned down. In the 1980s, the Unangax\u0302 sued for ill-treatment and deprivation of their rights in conjunction with\u00a0Japanese Americans who were also interned\u00a0during the war. In 1988, a restitution law was passed granting financial compensation and an apology to the Unangax\u0302 from both Congress and the President. Today, an etched stone slab Unalaska serves as is a memorial to that dark period.\nAfter World War Two, Unalaska became a hub of the US' commercial fishing industry, which still dominates the island today. Dutch Harbor is the\u00a0US' top commercial fishing port by volume\u00a0and the main delivery port featured on Discovery Channel's hit reality show,\u00a0Deadliest Catch. Four hundred vessels from 14 countries make port here each year, catching several hundred million pounds of fish \u2013 around 10% of the entire US fishing industry. Halibut, salmon, herring and several varieties of crab are among the species caught in nearby waters.\nAlaskan pollock comprises 80% of all seafood processed on the island and is used to produce fish oil, fish fillets (for frozen fish sticks and McDonald\u2019s Filet-o-Fish sandwiches) and surimi (imitation crab meat) among other products. UniSea, the largest seafood processing plant on the island, has some of the highest environmental standards of any fishery in Alaska, including traceable seafood and lowest by-catch.\n\"We use every part of the pollock fish here and nothing goes to waste,\" said Tom Enlow, president and CEO of UniSea and a resident of Unalaska. \"Fish oil gives us a renewable hydrocarbon to help power and heat our plant and worker accommodations, thereby offsetting the burning of diesel.\"\u00a0\nIn addition to an abundance of fish, Unalaska's nutrient-rich waters play host to a\u00a0rich variety of marine mammals, including orcas, Dall porpoises, sea otters, harbour seals and whales (humpback, pilot and fin). Steller's sea lions gather on isolated rocks known as rookeries to mate and give birth between May and July. The Aleutian coastlines are also home to a nesting seabird population that is larger than that of the rest of the US combined. Bird enthusiasts travel from all over the world to see the varied waterfowl, especially the ultra-rare whiskered auklet.\nMeanwhile,\u00a0hiking Unalaska's trails\u00a0exposes the remote corners of the island. Traversing its rolling alpine meadows and dramatic mountains is to experience the palpable soul of the Aleutians. These poetic, lyrical landscapes soften the harsh and sometimes unforgiving attributes of a place deeply beholden to the elements.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

Those 300 extras had to be employed for 10 days. That is an awful lot of money. So all these things would have been difficult on a public service budget.\n\"I think we could have done it, it just would have been very different. And truthfully, it probably would have needed co-finance from abroad, and the problem at the moment is that finance has disappeared.\"\nThe impact of Covid and the 2023 US actors' and writers' strikes, as well as higher energy costs, are some of the reasons often given for the increasing costs of TV production.\nAnd Kosminsky is not alone in arguing that the advent of streaming platforms has inflated prices so dramatically that the public service broadcasters have been unable to keep up.\nPatrick Spence, the executive producer behind Mr Bates vs the Post Office, told the BBC this was \"a serious issue\".\n\"Not only would Mr Bates not get funded today, but I wouldn't even have started developing it,\" he said.\nFormer subpostmaster Sir Alan Bates, whose story was central to the programme named after him, said it would be \"a real shame\" if these kinds of dramas could no longer be made.\nMr Bates vs the Post Office meant \"a lot of people saw for the first time the sort of hell going on in the background in the Post Office, the real miscarriage of justice going on right across the country\", he said.\nSpence said the price of making dramas had risen at the same time as the international funding model had dried up for these types of shows. Later this year, his ITV drama The Hack, about the phone hacking scandal, by Adolescence writer Jack Thorne, will air in the UK.\nSpence said there was \"no way\" he could raise the money to fund that programme now.\nFigures out last month from the BFI showed \u00a35.6bn was spent on high end TV and film production in the UK in 2024.

But for almost a century, physicists have puzzled over spaghetti's counterintuitive properties.\nYou might think physicists only ask the big questions. We mostly hear about the physics of the cosmic and the miniscule, the shape of our universe and the nature of the particles that fill it. But physicists, of course, have ordinary lives outside of the laboratory, and sometimes their way of questioning the universe spills over to their daily habits. There's one everyday item that seems to especially obsess them: spaghetti.\nGoing back at least a century, spaghetti has been the subject of rigorous studies. Through this research, physicists continue to learn new things about the solid state of matter, the chemistry of food and even draw connections to the origin of life. The steady torrent of spaghetti science helps to demonstrate that deep questions lurk in our ordinary routines, and that there are plenty of hungry physicists who can't stop asking them.\nFor example: how thin can spaghetti get? The typical spaghetto \u2013 the word for an individual strand of spaghetti \u2013 is between one and two mm thick (0.04-0.08in). But other long noodles vary widely in diameter, from udon at 4mm (0.16in) to angel hair at 0.8mm (0.03in). The thinnest handmade strands are called su filindeu, coming in at 0.4mm (0.02in), so slender that only a few women in Nuoro, Italy know how to make them.\nBut recently, a team of researchers at the University College London wondered if 21st Century lab equipment could do better. They used a technique called \"electro-spinning\". First, they dissolved flour into a special, electrically charged solution in a syringe. Then they held the syringe over a special, negatively-charged plate. \"This pulls the solution through the dispenser needle down towards the collector plate in a very stringy noodle-type shape,\" says Beatrice Britton, lead author of the study.\nWhen the solution dried, the researchers were left with a crisscrossing thread of incredibly thin spaghetti. \"To the naked eye, all you see is a sort of lasagna sheet,\" Britton says, but a powerful microscope reveals a mat made of strands as thin as 0.1mm (0.004in). These noodles are also much stiffer than regular spaghetti. Britton and her colleagues hope their research can be a step towards biodegradable alternatives to plastic \"nanofibres\", which are now used to filter liquids and treat wounds.\nThe world's thinnest spaghetti is just one recent example of how physicists can't seem to stop plying their tools on everybody's favourite carb. But physicists using their noodle on their noodles is no new thing. In 1949, Brown University physicist George F Carrier posed \"the spaghetti problem\" in The American Mathematical Monthly, which he deemed to be \"of considerable popular and academic interest\". Essentially, the problem amounts to: \"Why can't I slurp up a strand of spaghetti without getting sauce on my face\"?\nHis equations showed how the exposed strand swings about more wildly as it gets shorter and shorter, guaranteeing an eventual slap of the noodle against the slurper's lip \u2013 and the fateful sauce eruption Carrier so deplored. Sadly, his mathematical formulas offered no way around the face-slap. It's as deeply etched in the laws of the universe as the Big Bang.\nLater, two scientists inverted Carrier's pioneering study, exploring what happens when a stringy object slips out of a hole instead of being sucked in. They called their version the \"reverse spaghetti problem\", familiar to any impatient eater who's had to spit out burning pasta because they hadn't waited for it to cool. For now, no theoretical physicist has attempted the more complicated problem of two dogs slurping from either end of the same spaghetti strand.\u00a0\nThe great mid-century American physicist Richard Feynman helped unlock the riddles of quantum mechanics, explaining how the elementary particles that make up atoms interact with one another. But Feynman's enormous contribution to spaghetti physics is less widely known. One night, Feynman wondered why it's almost impossible to break a stick of spaghetti into two pieces instead of three. He and a colleague spent the rest of the evening snapping spaghetti sticks until they covered the kitchen floor.\nFeynman's interrogation into the counterintuitive physics of dry spaghetti sparked a quarter century of attempts to explain it. This finally happened in 2005, when two French researchers showed that spaghetti always breaks into two pieces \u2013 at first. But after the fracture, as the two bent pieces snap straight again, all their pent-up strain gets released in a shockwave, causing further splintering.\nIn 2018, a team of MIT scientists figured out how to stifle the shockwave \u2013 delicately twist the spaghetti strand before snapping it. Their method required lab equipment, but it reliably produced a perfect pair of fragments. Their work provided a new and deeper understanding of brittle rods that goes beyond spaghetti; the phenomenon of three-way fracturing is well-known to pole vaulters, for example.\nMy (Italian-American) mother taught me to break a bundle of dry spaghetti in half before putting it in boiling water, so it fits horizontally in the pot. I guess Feynman did the same, but it's an outrage to many of the world's spaghetti-eaters. If you're in the latter camp, then you place your dried spaghetti bundle upright in the pot of boiling water, then watch it slowly soften, buckle and submerge itself.\nThis familiar spaghetti behaviour may not seem like a puzzle, but try removing a recently-curled piece of spaghetti from the pot and letting it dry. It will stay curved rather than returning to its original straight length \u2013 something in those first few minutes irreversibly changes the composition of the spaghetti. In 2020, two physicists finally explained this spaghetti transmutation. It's due to a feature called \"viscoelasticity\" \u2013 a name for the unique way materials like spaghetti respond to physical stress. This special property allows water to flow through the strand's outer layers.\nThe strange mechanics of cooked spaghetti go even further. In one study, scientists dropped strands on the ground and measured how they coiled to learn about other elastic materials, from rope to DNA strands. In another, physicists tied spaghetti into knots and studied what types of strain would cause them to tear.\nSpaghetti physics even goes beyond the pasta itself \u2013 sauce is loaded with its own scientific mysteries. When eight Italian physicists met while doing research abroad in Germany, they found a shared frustration in the classic Roman dish cacio e pepe.\nThe sauce requires very few ingredients \u2013 it's basically a mixture of reserved pasta water and grated pecorino cheese \u2013 but they'd all experienced its mystifying fickleness. Often the cheese irreversibly clumps up, ruining the sauce. This is especially common when you cook it in large batches, which made the physicists hesitant to invite their German colleagues to dinner. \"We can't mess up cacio e pepe in front of German people,\" says Ivan Di Terlizzi, who studies statistical and biological physics at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, Germany.\nFortunately, among them were some of the world's foremost experts on the physics of \"phase separation\", exactly the kind of congealing phenomenon that plagued their group dinners. Arguing about the phase separation of cacio e pepe, they realised it was flummoxing from a scientific perspective as well.\n\"This is actually a very interesting problem,\" says Daniel Maria Busiello, co-author on the cacio\u00a0study. \"So we decided to design an experimental apparatus to actually test all these things.\"\nThe \"apparatus\" consisted of a bath of water heated to a low temperature, a kitchen thermometer, a petri dish and an iPhone camera attached to an empty box. They invited as many hungry friends as they could find to Di Terlizzi's apartment and hunkered down to cook a weekend's worth of cacio e pepe.\u00a0\nThey found that the \"simple\" sauce was enormously complex. Chemically, it's a water-based solution with only a few components: starch (from the pasta water), lipids (from the cheese) and two kinds of protein (also from the cheese). Using their apparatus, they found a physical explanation for the sauce-wrecking clumps, which they termed the \"mozzarella phase\".\nProteins, unlike most molecules, get stickier when they're hot. As the sauce is heated, the researchers found this leads to these proteins sticking to the lipids and forming mozzarella-like clumps. In a well-made cacio e pepe, what prevents this is the starch, which forms a protective coat around the lipid molecules so they can't stick to the proteins. If the sauce gets too hot, the increased stickiness of the proteins overcomes this barrier.\nOnce they understood the science behind the sauce, it was clear how to fix it. \"If you add enough starch above a certain threshold, you don't get this kind of separated state,\" says Di Terlizzi. Pasta water doesn't typically contain enough starch to guarantee this threshold, so they suggest adding a mixture of corn starch dissolved in water.\nThe group decided to conclude their manuscript with a foolproof recipe for the classic dish. But in surveying the rich scientific literature, they realised they weren't the first to reach this cacio epiphany. In the name of academic integrity, they cited a YouTube video wherein the Michelin-star Roman chef Luciano Monosilio suggests the same tweak for a foolproof recipe \u2013 a dash of corn starch. \"It's the only non-scientific reference in our paper,\" says Di Terlizzi.\nThe physics they used connects the clumping of cacio e pepe to ideas about the origin of life on Earth. Biophysicists use phase separation to understand how droplets of liquid can congeal and divide within a solution. \"A droplet dividing pretty much looks like a proto-cell,\" says Giacomo Bartolucci, another co-author on the study. Inside the little blobs that preceded actual cells, some believe, the building blocks of life may have come together via a process much like the Italians\u2019 mozzarella phase. The same ideas are helping biologists understand how the plaques that cause Alzheimer's coalesce in the brain.\nWhy is spaghetti such a locus of speculation and study for physicists?\nFor one, it's simple \u2013 flour, water and heat, says Vishal Patil, one of the discoverers of the twist-and-break method who is now a professor of mathematics at the University of California, San Diego. The fact that a combination of so few components raises so many deep questions speaks to how physics underlies everything they see and do, Patil says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why sarcastic teens are the smartest\n\u2022 The French towns giving away free chickens\n\u2022 YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know\nIt also shows that no matter how deep physicists probe the big and the small, the answers can still fall short of explaining phenomena we see every day. When it comes to cacio e pepe, all the tools of theoretical physics can only tell us what every Italian grandmother knows: keep the stove burning low when you make it. Laboratory electrospinning can only achieve marginally thinner spaghetti than what the women of Nuoro, Italy make daily by hand.\n\"Spaghetti is just a very accessible thing you can play with,\" Patil says. The low cost of flour-based noodles is what made them a democratic delicacy for so many cultures around the world \u2013 spaghetti was popularised in Naples as street food. That's why Feynman didn't hesitate to snap pounds of the stuff onto his kitchen floor.\nAfter a long day at the blackboard, plugging away at the impenetrable math of quantum mechanics or black holes, the mechanical wonders of spaghetti are the perfect fodder for scientists' mealtime probing.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Farmers are turning bees into unexpected helpers to keep elephants off their crops.\nAround the world, spreading farmland is increasingly overlapping with elephant habitats, often resulting in dangerous interactions as elephants roam over people's crops. But in Kenya, after decades of investigation, researchers have come up with a simple but ingenious solution to deter elephants: strings of beehive fences.\nInspired by longtime local knowledge of elephants' dislike of beehives, these buzzing barriers are offering a gentle but effective way of de-escalating the sometimes-violent interactions between farmers and elephants. And they are now spreading across the world, from Mozambique to Thailand.\nSo what is it about bees that elephants hate so much? And can they really be expected to keep the peace in this ever more crowded world?\nHuman-elephant conflict is a growing issue in several areas. In Kenya, where the population and demand for resources is growing, human-inhabited areas are increasingly overlapping with elephant's ranges. Combined with the recovery of some elephant populations, this is leading to greater chance of conflict between humans and these giants.\n\"Expansion of agricultural land, logging, urbanisation, and shrinking and fragmentation of elephant habitats \u2013 wildlife that require large spaces of land \u2013 [are] forcing elephants to enter human settlements in search of food and water,\" says Greta Francesca Iori, an Ethiopia-based advisor on elephant conservation and human-elephant conflict for several governments and non-profits.\n\"Wherever there are elephants, there are instances and information coming through of human-elephant conflict.\"\nGraeme Shannon, a wildlife ecologist at Bangor University in Wales, UK, who has studied African elephants for two decades, notes that the people pushed into these areas are often of poorer backgrounds. \"So farming is crucial for them and their families.\"\nBut water and lush, highly nutritional crops can be very appealing for elephants, leading them close to human settlements.\nPeople take a lot of time caring for their land, then the elephants come \"when you have planted the crops and they are almost mature\", says Emmanuel Mwamba, a farmer who lives in Mwakoma, Kenya, a village at the frontline of human-elephant conflict. \"If elephants come there\u2026 everything is gone.\"\n\"Some of us [\u2026] rely on crops for subsistence\", adds Mwamba. \"Imagine if that was destroyed within a night.\"\nSuch encounters can be fatal for both sides. Farmers can die trying to stop hungry, seven-tonne elephants from entering their crops, while the elephants can end up getting killed by humans for happening upon a good meal.\nTo prevent these conflicts, scientists and locals have spent decades testing a variety of solutions to deter elephants, from electric fences, watchtowers and solar spotlights to chilli-greased bricks and smelly elephant repellents, or even simply using noises to scare the elephants \u2013 all with their own pros and cons.\nBut using bees to scare away elephants has emerged as a particularly promising and efficient tool, combining effective deterrence with a host of other benefits for farmers.\nIt all started back in the early 2000s, when Fritz Vollrath, an ecologist at the University of Oxford and chairman of charity Save the Elephants, and Iain Douglas-Hamilton, founder of Save The Elephants, heard a folklore story from Kenyan pastoralists about how trees in certain areas were not damaged by elephants because they had beehives in them.\nInspired by the tale, Vollrath and Douglas-Hamilton began working with Lucy King, co-existence director at Save the Elephants, to investigate scientifically whether bees could really scare the giant pachyderms. By 2007 their research had led them to conclude that elephants not only stay away from trees containing beehives of wild African honeybees, but \"also rumble to each other to tell each other to stay away\", King says. \"We know that they can get stung, and we know that they never forget.\"\nKing designed a tool farmers could use to protect their crops from hungry elephants: a fence made of beehives. She first tested the idea in 2008 in a community in Laikipia, Kenya, which suffered from regular elephant crop-raids.\nThe fence goes all around a farm, with hives placed every 10m (33ft) between two posts. Lured in with natural attractants such as beeswax and lemongrass oil, African honeybees naturally colonise the beehives.\n\"For one acre [0.4 hectares] of farmland, you need 24 beehives,\" King says. However, just 12 of these are real: every other one is a dummy beehive \u2013 a fake made of just a yellow piece of plywood that gives the elephants the illusion that there are more beehives than there really are. This reduces costs and gives more space to the bees. \"As an elephant approaches in the dark, and they can smell bees, and they can smell honey, they can see a load of yellow boxes. They don't know which one is real and which one is fake. So it's an illusion. And it seems to work,\" King says.\nOther than deterring elephants from the crops and so providing food security, the beehive fences can bring other benefits to the communities who use them.\nFor one thing, they can generate an additional income for the farmers by producing honey. \"If a farmer has honey and has crops, it's actually good enough for the family to go on,\" says Mwamba, who lives in one of the villages where the beehive fences have been tested and has now become a beehive fence project officer for Save the Elephants, teaching other farmers how to build and maintain the fences.\nWomen are \"often disproportionately impacted by human elephant conflict\", adds King: it's often women who work in the farms and need to scare the elephants away, risking injury. For them, \"feeling more empowered in their situations means that they can actually get on with the job of looking after their household, maybe going back to school, maybe making sure they have time to do the other things\", King says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The farmers protecting Nepal's snow leopards\n\u2022\u00a0Why Vermont farmers are using urine on their crops\n\u2022\u00a0Why some animals thrive on being alone\u00a0\nOver the years, King and other researchers have collected a body of evidence about the efficiency of beehive fences in Kenya, and today the fences are being tried and studied in dozens of other countries including Tanzania, Mozambique and Sri Lanka. Proof of the method's efficiency also comes from Thailand, another country where human-elephant conflict is an everyday issue.\nIn 2024, King and her colleagues published a long-term study that analysed the effectiveness of beehive fences over nine years in two small villages in southern Kenya: Mwambiti and Mwakoma, where Emmanuel Mwamba lives. These communities are highly reliant on crops, such as cabbage and maize, that attract the many elephants that cross between the East and West side of Tsavo National Park, which hosts around 15,000 elephants \u2013 the largest population in Kenya.\nThe researchers worked in close contact with locals, installing and collecting data on the beehive fences. Out of almost 4,000 elephants which approached the beehive fences, 75% of them were deterred by the fences, the study found. The farmers also made $2250 (\u00a31,740) from selling honey.\n\"I think it's ingenious,\" says Shannon, who wasn't involved in the research. \"You've got this natural mechanism by which you can deter these animals from approaching farms. I just think it's brilliant.\"\nStill, the study also revealed some of the weaknesses of the tool, Shannon adds. For example, the bee populations plummeted during drought years due to a lack of flowering plants. In 2018, when the hives were still recovering from the previous year's drought, an unusually large number of elephants entered the villages, and the fences managed to deter only around 73%. \"Like any single method or any single tool, it has caveats and limitations to how effective it can be,\" says Shannon.\nKing says she also worries about the impact of climate change on beehive fences, \"because if you have these erratic droughts happening every four years, rather than every 15-20 years like they used to happen, you're in trouble because the bees don't recover in time\". Excessive rain can also be a problem for the bees, she adds, as it can knock flowers down from trees and bushes.\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nA solution, the researchers suggest, is implementing other tools which can work together with the beehive fences, such as chilli briquettes or watchtowers. \"Without question, there is no one solution,\" says King.\nBut thinking on a larger scale, says Iori, while such local solutions can be helpful in mitigating human-elephant conflict, they can be put at risk by both climatic and geopolitical shocks, which in turn can \"significantly reduce people's belief\" in them. \"We need to have always a multi-pronged approach, where you're also dealing with higher level issues of: How do we engage government?

It's a good thing for the community right now \u2013 Emmanuel MwambaIt all started back in the early 2000s, when Fritz Vollrath, an ecologist at the University of Oxford and chairman of charity Save the Elephants, and Iain Douglas-Hamilton, founder of Save The Elephants, heard a folklore story from Kenyan pastoralists about how trees in certain areas were not damaged by elephants because they had beehives in them.Save the ElephantsStudies have found bees are an effective way of deterring elephants away from crops (Credit: Save the Elephants)Inspired by the tale, Vollrath and Douglas-Hamilton began working with Lucy King, co-existence director at Save the Elephants, to investigate scientifically whether bees could really scare the giant pachyderms. Farmers can die trying to stop hungry, seven-tonne elephants from entering their crops, while the elephants can end up getting killed by humans for happening upon a good meal.To prevent these conflicts, scientists and locals have spent decades testing a variety of solutions to deter elephants, from electric fences, watchtowers and solar spotlights to chilli-greased bricks and smelly elephant repellents, or even simply using noises to scare the elephants \u2013 all with their own pros and cons.But using bees to scare away elephants has emerged as a particularly promising and efficient tool, combining effective deterrence with a host of other benefits for farmers.We started with two beehive fences. Elephants hate bees \u2013 here's why that's good news for Kenyan farmers13 hours agoShareSaveGennaro TommaShareSaveMeha Kumar/ Save the ElephantsFarmers are turning bees into unexpected helpers to keep elephants off their crops.Around the world, spreading farmland is increasingly overlapping with elephant habitats, often resulting in dangerous interactions as elephants roam over people's crops. Nowadays, he adds, people believe they need to co-exist with elephants.Before the introduction of beehive fences, \"the elephants had crop-raided most of the farms here,\" Mwamba recalls.",

The maximum sentence for this crime is three years in jail. \nDespite resigning from her ministerial job, Th\u00f3rsdottir said she had no plans to leave parliament. ",

The BBC has changed some names to protect the identities of young people.\nFor Amir, from Leeds, Mr Baszucki's comments were \"ridiculous\", and the course of action he suggested was \"much easier said than done\". \n\"Roblox is ruining my son\", he told the BBC - and he feels powerless to stop it.\nA user since he was eight or nine, he says the 15-year-old is \"addicted\" and can now use the site for up to 14 hours a day.\n\"He is a single child and both parents are so busy working. I feel guilty we haven't been able to give him quality time. That's been robbed by Roblox,\" Amir told the BBC.\nThe son's account is linked to the father's email address, and Amir has received \"hundreds\" of emails over the years from Roblox about the violation of the 'terms of use'.\nHe says his son has been given temporary bans, but finds a way to play on - using multiple accounts and the accounts of others. \nAmir hopes he can reduce his son's time on the platform by \"playing cards, talking and watching YouTube together\" rather than forcing him off the platform completely.\nIn response, Roblox highlighted to BBC News the screen time limit feature on the platform that gives parents the ability to restrict the amount of time children are allowed to spend on Roblox each day.\nSally, from the north of Scotland, told the BBC she \"fully takes responsibility\" as a parent - but questioned whether Roblox was doing the same.\nShe told the BBC her nine-year-old daughter was being groomed on Roblox and - despite reporting it to the platform - did not get a response, leaving her \"enraged\".\nThe mother said last December her child was chatting to someone in a game where you can \"mimic real life\". This user coerced her child to role play \"marriage\". They told the girl they were touching themselves, and asked Sally's daughter to touch herself and take a photo.\nThey offered Roblox's in-game currency in exchange for the picture. The child didn't do it, and told her mother days later.\n\"When she approached me, it was with a lot of tears, and feeling very, very shameful with what had happened. I assured my child that it's not their fault that they have done everything correct - to tell me.\n\"This is unacceptable for a platform that's advertised towards young children. It seems like the company isn't taking any responsibility and clearly their filters are not working.\"\nSally said companies that created platforms should be liable for any issues with them, rather than telling its users \"'well, don't use it'.\"\nIn his BBC interview, Mr Baszucki said building a \"trust and safety system\" had been an important part of Roblox ever since it launched. \nHe added: \"We do, in the company, take the attitude that any bad - even one bad incident - is one too many.\n\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"\nHe said he remained confident in Roblox's safety tools and insisted the firm went above and beyond to keep its users safe.\nRoblox also says it analyses all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so - and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.\nIt stressed to BBC News that users cannot share images with each other on the platform. \nConcerns about children being exposed to sexual content on Roblox have been aired before.\nIn November last year, under 13s were banned on the platform from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players. Other parental controls were also introduced.\nMany people have also contacted the BBC to endorse what the Roblox CEO said.\nKathryn Foley said she was \"impressed\" with Mr Baszuki's \"honesty\" in his interview, and highlighted ongoing conversations she has with her nine-year-old daughter, Helene, about the platform.\nHelene is a big fan of the animal game Adopt Me.\n\"I would say on the whole the Roblox experience has been a very positive one with Adopt Me being a very kind and safe place for her to have fun with her friends,\" Kathryn said.\nMeanwhile, Kirsty Solman spoke to the Jeremy Vine show on BBC Radio 2 about her 13-year-old son Kyle, who has ADHD, autism and severe anxiety. \n\"He really struggles with social interactions and small talk. Being on Roblox and other gaming platforms, he is then able to play with his classmates.\n\"That stress and anxiety is taken away, and he has ended up with a really good group of friends.\"\nKirsty said she spoke to her son about online safety and checks his devices every day.\nPhil from London agreed parents needed to take the initiative when it came to online safety.\n\"There is a danger in thinking the internet is a cr\u00e8che,\" he commented on the BBC website.",

        "article_text": "A promising footballer from south London says being told he would never be able to play the sport he loves again was \"one of the hardest things to deal with mentally\".\nCollin Skhoyimue was signed to a League One club's academy just before his 14th birthday and two months into his contract, he was selected to play a match above his age grade. \nBut that was short-lived as he suffered an injury to the cartilage in his knee during the game and was subsequently released. \nEight years on, Collin, now 21, says it was like \"somebody taking his dream away\".\nIt's a familiar story. There are an estimated 1.5 million players playing organised youth football in England at any one time - but only around 180 of those will make it as a Premier League professional.\nCollin's love for football started when he was five years old.\n\"I remember I used to fold up socks into a ball and put it on the floor and play,\" he says.\nHe would make football goals on both sides of his house using his mum's shoes and, as the only player, would try to score for both teams.\nWhen he got signed for the League One football club in December 2017, he went home to surprise his mum Sylvia.\nCollin says it was \"a good feeling that the hard work paid off\" and he \"proved the haters wrong\", referring to the people in his school who had  doubts about him and called him names.\nLeague One is the third tier of professional football in England, below the Premier League and the Championship. \n\"Collin is a very passionate boy, once he gets it in his mind 'I'm going to do this', he's so determined and he'll go for it and get it done,\" his mum says.\nCollin was one of three young boys who were chosen to go on trial for the football academy out of 300 trialists, which he describes as \"a dream\". He says he used his six-week summer holiday to prepare for the initial open trial.\nTwo months after being signed, the footballer was given the opportunity to play for the under-15s, despite being in the under-14 squad at the time.\nDuring this match, he was passing the ball from defence and was injured when his knee collided with an opponent's knee during a tackle.\n\"After that, my football career turned into a nightmare,\" the 21-year-old says.\nDespite doing rehab with his academy for six months, Collin decided to get a scan with the NHS, where doctors diagnosed him with a congenital discoid meniscus and told him he would need surgery on his knee. \nHe was then put on the NHS waiting list and nine months later had the operation.\nSix months afterwards, Collin's team was about to enter the under-16 season.\nHowever, the academy manager who initially signed him for the club had left the team, meaning the new coach had not seen him play and he was released.\n\"One of the hardest things about that is not that I got released because of my ability or if I'm always late to training... but the reason I got released was out of my hands so there was genuinely nothing I could have done to avoid myself from getting released,\" Collin says.\n\"Football is a business,\" he adds. \"Once you're playing and you're well, everyone loves you - but when you're on the sidelines and you're not playing and no longer useful, they'll just throw you out.\n\"As a footballer, you're just an asset and I think the earlier you realise that, the better.\"\nDespite the surgery, Collin's problems with his knee continued and he underwent another operation. Six months later, a scan revealed that the issue had not been solved.\nCollin says his surgeon then told him: \"You've now had two surgeries... the issue has not been solved and you will never ever be able to play football again.\"\nThose last 10 words were \"one of the most heartbreaking experiences\", says Collin. \nHe adds he did not go into school for a week because \"his dream was over\". \nDespite not playing football for four years, Collin did not give up hope for the game he loved.\nHaving finally made a recovery to his knee, he made his first appearance back on the pitch in August 2022, despite doctors saying he would never play again.\n\"That was one of the best days of my life,\" he says.\nHe then developed a love for coaching, began managing an under-7s team and started his own coaching business to \"be that person that [he] needed when [he] was younger\".\nAfter being signed to a new football team and playing for one year for the full-time National League, Collin suffered another injury to his other knee and has been in recovery since December 2023.\nHe now hosts a series on social media called Injured 2 Pro where he shares his journey. \nCollin hopes to use his story to inspire and motivate people around the world.\n\"I've been through a lot and when you've been through a lot you have a lot to give so I feel like I have a lot to give back,\" he says.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "In the latest episode of Influential, US writer Ann Patchett shares how seeing kindness around her influences the way she approaches her characters.\nThe world needs \"life-changing books\", Ann Patchett once wrote in an essay in The New York Times. She wasn't referring to her own works, yet admirers of the best-selling US author would argue that this is exactly what she has achieved, with acclaimed novels including Bel Canto, and the Pulitzer Prize-shortlisted The Dutch House, along with her award-winning 2005 memoir, Truth and Beauty: A Friendship.\u00a0\nPatchett, who cites John Updike and Roxane Gay as influences on her deep body of work, brushes off praise. Reflecting on her books, she says that it took her years to finally feel like she was a successful writer, even when The New York Times included the prize-winning 2001 novel Bel Canto in its best books of the 21st Century list.\n\"I just didn't think you could make art and be successful,\" she tells the BBC's Katty Kay. They sat down at Parnassus Books, the bookshop Patchett she opened in 2011 in Nashville, Tennessee, a city which is also the setting for her 1992 novel The Patron Saint of Liars and her 2013 memoir-fiction hybrid, This Is the Story of a Happy Marriage. \"[It] never occurred to me.\"\nSome may see an author opening a bookshop as self-serving, but Patchett explains that she approached it like a civic duty. She didn't want to live in a city without one, and after she saw her local bookshops shutting, she co-founded her own.\n\"It wasn't that I wanted to open a bookstore \u2013 I really fell into it backwards,\" she says. \"It's been a wonderful thing. It's been a huge joy.\"\nPatchett rose to prominence in the world of fiction, crafting stories that brought together unexpected situations, and even more unexpected characters. Take, for instance, the home for unwed mothers in The Patron Saint of Liars or the depths of the Amazon rainforest in 2011's State of Wonder. She describes the scenarios in her books as \"people in confinement\", even though the stories span everything from events on a meditation retreat to hostage situations \u2013 and her own memoirs.\n\"The setting is the fun,\" she says of that commonality, though she's quick to point out that there's always something deeper going on. Readers have been transported to Alpine peaks, the jungles of South America, the cities of Los Angeles and Chicago \u2013 but Patchett points out that within those far-flung places, it's first and foremost the characters that she hopes fans connect with. \"The setting is the frosting, but it is always the relationships.\"\nMore like this:\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0Misty Copeland is 'not scared' to face a career beyond dance\u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0Ina Garten on her internet appeal: 'Young people don\u2019t have mom in the kitchen'\u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0Entrepreneur Jane Wurwand on why 'high-touch will overshadow high-tech' in business\u00a0\nPatchett has said before she doesn't watch television and that she has resisted the siren song of social media.\n\"I am very interested in protecting my brain and not just being constantly interrupted,\" she tells Kay. She uses a flip phone, she doesn't remember her number and she avoids both smartphones and social media. \"I've never texted. That seems like a really bad idea. I don't want people to be able to get me all the time.\"\nShe may not participate, but she is aware of the digital world \u2013 and it does make its way into her work. When Kay asks her how she captures readers' attention when they all have feeds to scroll, Patchett doesn't see this as an issue.\n\"There are always going to be people who want to read,\" she says. \"There isn't one truth about the way people are, how they get their entertainment, how they get their education.\"\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay\nWatch\u00a0Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on\u202fYouTube.\nReflecting on the characters in her books, Patchett explains that she is more drawn to kindness than anything else. When she looks at everything happening around her, she doesn't just see chaos and doom.\n\"In my novels, there probably is more kindness than you might see in other books, but not more kindness than you might see in your daily life,\" she says.\u00a0\nWhen Commonwealth, her seventh novel, was published in 2016, she spoke to fellow writer Zadie Smith, who offered an insight that Patchett had never considered.\n\"'Autobiographical fiction isn't what has happened to us. It's what we're afraid of happening. It's what we fixate on and think about and worry about,'\" Patchett recalls Smith saying. \"In that moment, I thought, what am I afraid of? Who am I afraid of being? What do I think about all the time?\"\u00a0\nAddressing those questions head-on has allowed Patchett to craft characters that have resonated with readers. She says that her fans bring her first-edition hardcover copies of Bel Canto at festivals (she's quick to remind everyone that every hardcover of Bel Canto is a first edition), and tell her that she's managed to create something very special with every book.\u00a0\nAs ever, she downplays such praise. \"I do it because I love to do it, I don't feel any pressure,\" she says. \"If I never wrote a book again, the world would keep going just fine.\"\nInfluential with Katty Kay airs on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Until just over a week ago, Artem Kariakin and his unit were making regular trips across Ukraine's border into the Russian town of Sudzha.\nHe shows me video taken with a phone of their very last trip, as Ukrainian forces retreated from Russia's Kursk region. It shows them making their way past dozens of burnt out military and civilian vehicles.\nA soldier armed with a shotgun, their last line of defence, scans the horizon for Russian drones. Out of nowhere, one flies towards the back of their truck. Sparks fly, but they keep on going.\nArtem says they were lucky - the explosive charge was not big enough to stop them.\nAnother truck nearby was less fortunate. It was already in flames.\nArtem admits Ukraine's retreat from Sudzha, the largest town Ukraine held in Kursk, was \"not well organised\".\n\"It was pretty chaotic,\" he tells me. \"Many units left in disarray. I think the problem was the order to withdraw came too late.\"\nIt wasn't helped, he says, because units were operating without proper communications. The Starlink satellite systems they normally rely on didn't work inside Russia.\nThe 27-year-old soldier still views the Kursk offensive as broadly successful. Artem says it forced Russia to divert its forces from the east. Most of Ukraine's troops still managed to escape in time \u2013 even if for many it was on foot.\nBut he believes Ukraine's surprise incursion into Russian territory, launched last August, was too deep and too narrow - relying on just one main road for supplies and reinforcements.\nWhile Artem and his men were fleeing for their lives, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were talking by phone about trying to bring the war to an end. Artem says he finds that \"absurd\".\n\"To me these calls between Trump and Putin are just surreal,\" he says. \"Trump wants to end the war because he promised to do it - and Putin wants to deceive Trump to continue his war. I can't take their conversations seriously.\"\nArtem, whose home is in the now Russian-occupied Luhansk region, tells me he feels disappointed with the US and Trump. \"What can I feel when they just want to give away my home?\"\nArtem says he never believed that Putin would be willing to trade any part of Russia for Ukraine's occupied territories. But he still believes the Kursk offensive was important to protect its own border. Ukrainian troops may have been forced to retreat, but they still occupy high ground just over the border with Sumy.\nUkraine is continuing its cross-border raids \u2013 not just into Kursk, but Belgorod too. \nSerhiy's assault battalion helps plan these attacks \u2013 finding a way through Russian minefields and anti-tank obstacles known as \"dragon's teeth\".\nWe joined him on a night-time mission to locate and recover armoured vehicles in need of repairs. It's the safest time to move close to the Russian border.\nSerhiy himself is no stranger to Russia: he was born there. He now has Belorussian citizenship, but he chose to fight for Ukraine. He justifies Ukraine's incursions into his former home. Russia too, he says, has been trying to create a buffer zone inside Ukrainian territory.\nTravelling in his Ukrainian-made armoured vehicle, Serhiy still lists the likely threats, now we are less than 10km from the Russian border: glide bombs, rockets and artillery, and drones fitted with thermal imaging cameras.\nHis own vehicle is fitted with electronic counter-measures to jam enemy drones, but even those won't work against drones operated via fibre optic wires. Those can't be stopped, though on some routes Ukraine has now erected netting to try to catch the drones before they can hit their target.\nOur original search near the Russian border for a damaged US-made Bradley armoured vehicle is abandoned when Serhiy receives intelligence that Russian drones are operating nearby. Instead, he tries to locate another broken-down Bradley where the risks will be smaller.\nHe and his driver still have to overcome obstacles along the way. Trees and branches lie strewn across their path \u2013 remnants from a recent Russian air strike. We see several more explosions in the distance, briefly turning the night sky orange.\nSerhiy eventually finds his broken-down Bradley. It's already been retrieved from the battlefield across the border and has been loaded onto a lorry to be taken back for repairs.\nThe Bradley commander confirms to me that they've been fighting in Russia. He describes the situations across the border as \"difficult, but we're holding on\".\nThe Bradley is another reminder of Ukraine's reliance on US military support. That now seems less certain with Trump's focus on peace talks. Serhiy says it's already clear to him that there's \"haggling behind Ukraine's back\".\nI ask Serhiy if he thinks European nations can fill any void left by the US. Is a European \"coalition of the willing\" enough to guarantee Ukraine's security? \n\"I think if America doesn't help Ukraine, then a ceasefire will be agreed soon - but on extremely unfavourable terms for Ukraine,\" Serhiy replies.\n\"Europe clearly cannot resolve this conflict alone. They're not strong enough. They've been focussing on their own economies instead of thinking about security.\"\nSerhiy says he wants the war to end. Like many Ukrainians, he would like to see peace - but not at any price.\nAdditional reporting by Volodymyr Lozkho and Anastasiia Levchenko",

        "article_text": "As a scientist, Sara Cox realises the dangers her beloved birds face. As an artist, she wants to help everyone else understand too.\nSara stops walking and points excitedly over the drystone wall into the field beyond.\nThere, strutting among the scattered sheep, is a lapwing, the literal icon of the North Pennines having been immortalised in the area's logo. \n\"They are brilliant,\" Sara says, a smile across her face as she watches the small bird peck between long blades of grass.\nThe 58-year-old lifts one hand up behind her head and waggles her gloved fingers over the top of her homemade woolly hat.\n\"They have these feathers protruding from their head, they always remind me of the Egyptian queen Nefertiti and her crown.\"\nIt is a few days into spring and the lapwings have returned to Teesdale, the Durham dale Sara, her husband and two children have called home for more than 20 years.\nAlthough the sun is out, it is a bitingly cold day in the fields above Low Force, one of the waterfalls that bejewels the River Tees.\nFurther down the track, Sara finds a speckled brown feather, pocketing it for closer inspection back at the wooden desk in her 275-year-old stone-floored cottage.\nSara is out for one of her regular walks for inspiration, making sketches and mental notes to help her with her work.\nHer speciality is wire birds, intricate life-size sculptures weaved from spools of metal strands that attempt to capture the vitality of the creatures Sara loves so much.\nShe has made kingfishers and ravens, wrens and curlews, with some of her sculptures installed on a nature trail around Durham Wildlife Trust's reserve at Low Barns near Bishop Auckland.\n\"It's about drawing attention to certain birds,\" she says, adding: \"A lot of the birds I've made have been endangered or are on the red list. They're really cool little things.\n\"I'm very conscious the birds that come up here are diminishing in number. The environmental impact of what we do on birds is pretty horrendous, so anything I can do that makes people feel emotion or interest when they look at a sculpture is good for the environment.\"\nSara is as adept at explaining the anatomy of the birds and geology of the local rocks as she is at just marvelling at the beauty of the area and its wildlife.\nShe has science degrees from Aberystwyth, Sheffield and Durham, including one in zoology for which she studied sparrows for her dissertation. She is also a qualified teacher.\nBut she also has a lifelong love of art and passion for creating things, engendered by her grandparents and reinforced by her engineer father and a mother who, among other things, is an accomplished potter.\n\"They were all good with their hands,\" Sara says. \"I grew up seeing my parents make stuff, seeing people create.\n\"Everybody can make, everybody is creative.\"\nBack at her cottage in Mickleton, Sara fiddles with a strip of wire as she talks, twisting and reforming it as she eulogises over its malleability.\n\"If it's not the right shape, you can bend it back again,\" she says. \"It's about using your imagination and problem solving.\"\nIt is why science and art make perfect bedfellows, she says.\nAt school in Sutton Coldfield, Sara was encouraged to follow scientific pursuits rather than artistic ones, a distinct separation made between the two disciplines.\n\"I think that's a mistake,\" she says, adding her later forays into artistic pursuits such as  felt-making and now wire modelling are some of the ongoing \"tiny rebellions\" against her earlier enforced segregation.\nScientists and artists both notice things, but while scientists measure, artists interpret, Sara says.\nShe relies on science to produce her art, be it physics to make structures, anatomy to understand the birds or just general \"problem solving\".\n\"I'm bringing science into my sculptures all the time. It's quite a privilege to be able to take something, study it and then try and make it out nothing.\n\"You could build a raven from a million different materials so artists are playing to see what they can use, which is what material scientists do too.\n\"So scientists need artist and artists need science and the two shouldn't be separated.\"\nThere are no blueprints, each of her sculptures is based on meticulous research and a lot of trial and error.\nShe starts with the feet and works her way up, taking about six weeks to complete a model.\nSara has made two ravens, which she has named Huginn and Muninn after the Norse god Odin's own corvid companions.\nHuginn recently spent a few weeks in London as part of the Royal Society of British Artists annual exhibition.\n\"It was an absolute treat to go down and they displayed him beautifully,\" Sara says.\n\"He was just checking everybody out and looking at all the people going past. I think he will have some stories to tell.\n\"People said to me can you bear to let him go and I was thinking 'yeah, absolutely', because that's the point of making these things.\n\"I want people to think about birds so it's no good if they're sitting here with me. \n\"I want other people to be thinking about all these amazing birds that we've got in this country, so I've just got to keep on making.

As of 07:00 GMT the majority of departures had left as expected but of arrivals nine of the first 20 flights scheduled to land were cancelled. \nMore than 1,300 flights were affected on Friday, tracking website Flightradar24 said, and passengers were told not to travel to the airport unless their airline advised them to. \nThe National Grid said that an \"interim solution\" had been found to allow power to be restored to customers including Heathrow Airport, saying that the network had been \"reconfigured to restore all customers impacted\".\nFirefighters worked throughout the day to bring the blaze at North Hyde substation in Hayes, west London, under control.\nHere's what we know so far.\nA fire at an electrical substation in west London, which supplies Heathrow, caused a major power outage at the airport, prompting its closure. \nIt is not yet known what caused the fire at the substation, but Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said there was no suggestion of foul play as counter-terrorism police investigate.\n\"The counter-terrorism command has specific capabilities and capacities that mean that they are used to conducting investigations at pace,\" she said, adding that they were needed as the fire took place next to a critical piece of national infrastructure.\nEmergency services were first called to Nestles Avenues in Hayes, west London at 23:23 GMT on Thursday. \nJonathan Smith,  London Fire Brigade (LFB) deputy commissioner, said the fire at the electrical substation involved a transformer containing 25,000 litres of cooling oil.\nThe fire was \"very visible and significant,\" he said. The LFB said the fire was under control by 06:28.\nOn Friday evening, the service said the fire was \"believed to be non-suspicious\" and the investigation will \"focus on the electrical distribution equipment\".\nCommander Simon Messinger, who is leading the Metropolitan Police's response to the fire, said: \"Various specialist investigators continue to examine the scene and it is expected to take some time before full assessments can be completed.\"\nBut he repeated that \"at this stage, there remains no indication of any foul play\".\nThe substation is about a mile and a half away from the airport. \nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the substation's back-up generator \"appears to have been knocked out\".\nVideos shared on social media showed tall flames and plumes of smoke billowing from the substation overnight. \nPeople living nearby were advised to keep doors and windows closed to avoid smoke inhalation. \nWith Heathrow being such a busy airport for passenger journeys and global trade, questions have been raised over whether it has back-up systems in the event of power cuts.\nThe BBC understands that Heathrow does have back-up power for its key systems, but kickstarting these alternative power supplies for the whole airport takes time.\nA source said it was not possible to switch the power back on immediately.\nA Heathrow source also told the BBC that they have \"multiple sources\" of energy at the airport \u2013 with diesel generators and \"uninterruptable power supplies\" in place.\nThey added that when the power outage happened the back-up systems \"all operated as expected\".\nThe systems, however, are not enough to run the whole airport \u2013 hence the decision to close it down.\nAnd even once the power is back on, there are countless systems which need to be rebooted and checked to ensure they are working properly and are stable.\nIt is unclear why Heathrow's own back-up systems were not adequate to keep the airport running when one critical component of its energy supply was knocked out, and it is also unclear why the National Grid distribution network was not set up to supply sufficient electricity.\nA Heathrow source said these questions would be investigated.\nThe first flights since the fire took off from and landed at Heathrow on Friday evening, with the airport initially saying it would prioritise repatriation and relocation of aircraft.\nHeathrow said the airport was \"open and fully operational\" on Saturday morning, however a number of flights were cancelled and disruptions were expected to last days.\nThe closure had knock-on effects at many other airports, as airlines cancelled and diverted flights.\nThe airport has apologised for the disruption and has advised passengers to contact their airlines for further information.\nIts helpline number is 020 8757 2700. \nLate on Friday, the Department for Transport said on X that restrictions on overnight flights at Heathrow had been temporarily lifted to ease congestion.\nOnly 5,800 flights are allowed to take off or land at Heathrow between 23:30 and 06:00 each year, under government restrictions designed to limit how much noise the airport makes at night.\nAt least 1,351 flights to and from Heathrow were affected on Friday, Flightradar24 said, with some 120 affected aircraft already in the air when the closure was announced.\nThe Foreign Office has advised UK citizens who are abroad and require urgent assistance to contact their teams via an online query form. \nAir Canada and United Airlines have announced they will be resuming some or all of their flights from Friday evening. Virgin Atlantic has said it hopes to operate \"a near full schedule\" on Saturday with limited cancellations, adding that it will continuously review flights.\nGatwick Airport told the BBC it was aware of the situation at Heathrow Airport and stands \"ready to support as required\".\nSeveral of Australia's Qantas airline planes have been diverted from London to Paris, with other flights likely to be affected, it said. \nBritish Airways has cancelled all its short-haul flights due to operate to and from the airport on Friday. \nSome long-haul flights - including to Cape Town, Johannesburg, Singapore and Rio de Janeiro - were later given clearance to depart from Heathrow from 1900 GMT and the airline said it was reviewing the fire's implications for Saturday's schedule and beyond.\nCathay Pacific, Hong Kong's main airline cancelled all its flights to London on Friday. \nThe Heathrow Express railway service said it was running a reduced service from Paddington to Heathrow.\nIn addition to passengers expecting to fly,  disruption has been caused to thousands of homes in west London, which have been left without power.\nAbout 150 people had to be evacuated from surrounding properties.\nMore than 16,300 homes lost power in a large-scale outage caused by the fire, energy supplier Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said.\n\"We're aware of a widespread power cut affecting many of our customers around the Hayes, Hounslow and surrounding areas,\" it added.\nThe National Grid said on Friday afternoon the network had been \"reconfigured to restore all customers impacted, including the ability to resupply the parts of Heathrow airport that are connected to North Hyde\".\nMeanwhile, two nurseries and four schools in Hillingdon - the London borough Heathrow Airport is located in - are shut today.\nHillingdon Council are assisting 12 people who were evacuated from their homes by the emergency services with hotel accommodation.\nBin collections will also be impacted on Friday, the council warned.\nBus routes in the Hillingdon area have been affected and the M4 is closed between junction three and four, while the Terminal Four spur roads are also closed.\nNo injuries from the fire have been reported. \nCounter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan Police are now leading the investigation into the fire because of the location of the substation and the \"impact on critical national infrastructure\". \nIt added there was currently no indication of foul play but it is keeping \"an open mind\".\nLondon Fire Brigade said it was working closely with the Metropolitan Police.",

Text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website & app. Listen live on BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra\nWales will start their World Cup qualifying campaign on Saturday looking to right the wrongs of history.\nThis is not the familiar tale of the many near misses that littered their painful distant past, but rather a recent triumph that turned into dismal failure.\nBy reaching the 2022 World Cup, Wales realised a dream; glorious catharsis after 64 barren years without playing on football's biggest stage.\nBut once they got to Qatar, that dream became a nightmare.\nAs one Football Association of Wales official in Doha put it: \"We'd waited a lifetime, and then it was a disaster.\"\nIt was not simply Wales' first-round exit that was so dispiriting, but the manner of it. This was the opportunity of a generation, squandered - and it still rankles.\nThat is why this team view the 2026 World Cup as \"unfinished business\" according to midfielder Joe Allen, a chance to make amends for Qatar.\nWales not only want to secure their place at next year's tournament but make a meaningful impact when they get there, having failed so miserably to do so last time.\n\"It is something that sticks with me and I'm sure it sticks with a lot of the guys,\" says captain Ben Davies.\n\"The best moment of Qatar for us was probably just the Ukraine [play-off] game in getting there. It was disappointing out there and it was something that was tough to get over for a while.\n\"We didn't really show how good we can be on the world stage and that hunger to go and do it again is definitely there.\"\n'For him, for them' - Williams' family inspiration\nQuiz: How well do you know Bellamy's career?\n'That'll hurt forever' - World Cup pain drives Bellamy\nThe significance of qualifying transcended football for Wales, a country which had never enjoyed the global attention that comes with a modern-day World Cup.\nThey had less time to prepare than other teams in Qatar, having only sealed qualification five months earlier with a play-off win over Ukraine - but the FAW understood the logistics of major tournaments having been to the previous two European Championships.\nEuro 2016 in particular had been a transformative success for Wales, though a World Cup was on a different level.\nThe nation grasped the cultural and political value of this opportunity but, in terms of the football, there were reservations.\nManager Rob Page had performed admirably after stepping into the role in difficult circumstances following Ryan Giggs' abrupt departure in 2020.\nHaving led the team to the knockout stages of Euro 2020, Page etched his name into Welsh football history by becoming the first man to take Wales to a World Cup since 1958.\nThat can never be taken away from the former captain but, even by his own admission, this was a job he never thought he would have, considering his only previous managerial experience had come at Port Vale and Northampton Town.\nPage was popular with the Wales squad but some performances during World Cup qualifying, such as a goalless home draw with Estonia \u2013 as well as the 4-0 thrashing by Denmark at Euro 2020 \u2013 had prompted criticism, with some questioning his credentials at this level.\n\"The players all liked Rob as a person but some were unsure about him as a coach,\" another FAW source tells BBC Sport Wales.\n\"When the squad met up in Cardiff before travelling to Qatar, the feeling seemed to be that they weren't as well prepared as they could have been.\"\nMatters did not improve when they got to Qatar. The timing and location of training sessions had to be changed at the last minute because of the searing heat, while some staff felt team meetings were disorganised.\nSome players were also unimpressed by the content of training sessions and, with the likes of Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey and Allen already lacking match sharpness due to limited game time at their clubs, there was a pervading sense that Wales were entering this tournament undercooked.\n\"Could we have gone with fresher legs from the start? It's easy to say now, in hindsight,\" Page said after returning home.\nPage only realised in hindsight what many felt was obvious before and during the event; his lack of foresight would prove costly.\nThis video can not be played\nWales begin World Cup journey live on BBC Wales\nRob Page is the only man to have managed Wales at two major tournaments\nWales' World Cup campaign started to unravel at the very moment it began in earnest.\nThey were fortunate to draw against the United States in their opening game, Page admitting he got his selection and tactics wrong as his side were outplayed by dynamic, athletically superior opposition.\nBale's late penalty rescued Wales on that occasion but, with their all-time leading scorer's influence waning as retirement loomed, Page's side would have no such luck in their remaining two fixtures.\nThe manager said there were \"lessons learned\" against the USA but he proceeded to repeat the same mistakes against Iran as Wales were overwhelmed physically once again, hopelessly overrun as Iran won 2-0.\nMore than effectively extinguishing Welsh hopes of reaching the second round, this felt like the beginning of the end of their golden generation.\nBale, Ramsey and Allen were all key figures in Wales' dizzying ascent to the Euro 2016 semi-finals but, in the baking desert heat of Qatar, they had been reduced to shrivelled imitations of their former selves.\nThe final ignominy was a 3-0 defeat against England which could have been a far more severe drubbing had Gareth Southgate's men felt the urge.\nJust a week after their first World Cup game for 64 years, Wales were heading home.\n\"Hopefully, next time we qualify it won't just be about being there,\" says defender Neco Williams, who started all three matches.\n\"Last time, we were just there.\"\nPlenty wanted Page gone while others felt World Cup qualification had made him close to unsackable, or at least had earned him another chance.\nHowever, he was soon under pressure after a humiliating 4-2 home defeat against Armenia derailed their Euro 2024 qualifying campaign.\nAlthough he held on to his job despite missing out on qualification, Page was eventually dismissed last summer and replaced by Craig Bellamy.\nBellamy has started superbly, unbeaten in six games having led Wales to the Nations League's top division and instilled a bold new playing style in the process.\nHis ultimate aim, as he stated on his first day in the job, is to qualify for the 2026 World Cup.\nAnd more than that, having seen how Wales fared in Qatar and how that disappointment still burns in his players, Bellamy wants his team to do themselves justice if they get to next year's competition in the USA, Canada and Mexico.\n\"These boys have got to a World Cup. I understand the motivation to move that again because of what happened last time,\" he says.\n\"We always talk about 'us against the world' but we're not an underdog. I don't believe in that, and I won't have it. Now, at times you use it, but you can't live on it because it only lasts so long.\n\"For me, it's always 'no, we are more'.

It's easy to say now, in hindsight,\" Page said after returning home.Page only realised in hindsight what many felt was obvious before and during the event; his lack of foresight would prove costly.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Wales begin World Cup journey live on BBC Wales'We were just there'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Rob Page is the only man to have managed Wales at two major tournamentsWales' World Cup campaign started to unravel at the very moment it began in earnest.They were fortunate to draw against the United States in their opening game, Page admitting he got his selection and tactics wrong as his side were outplayed by dynamic, athletically superior opposition.Bale's late penalty rescued Wales on that occasion but, with their all-time leading scorer's influence waning as retirement loomed, Page's side would have no such luck in their remaining two fixtures.The manager said there were \"lessons learned\" against the USA but he proceeded to repeat the same mistakes against Iran as Wales were overwhelmed physically once again, hopelessly overrun as Iran won 2-0.More than effectively extinguishing Welsh hopes of reaching the second round, this felt like the beginning of the end of their golden generation.Bale, Ramsey and Allen were all key figures in Wales' dizzying ascent to the Euro 2016 semi-finals but, in the baking desert heat of Qatar, they had been reduced to shrivelled imitations of their former selves.The final ignominy was a 3-0 defeat against England which could have been a far more severe drubbing had Gareth Southgate's men felt the urge.Just a week after their first World Cup game for 64 years, Wales were heading home. Listen live on BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Radio 5 Sports ExtraWales will start their World Cup qualifying campaign on Saturday looking to right the wrongs of history.This is not the familiar tale of the many near misses that littered their painful distant past, but rather a recent triumph that turned into dismal failure.By reaching the 2022 World Cup, Wales realised a dream; glorious catharsis after 64 barren years without playing on football's biggest stage.But once they got to Qatar, that dream became a nightmare.As one Football Association of Wales official in Doha put it: \"We'd waited a lifetime, and then it was a disaster. \"Plenty wanted Page gone while others felt World Cup qualification had made him close to unsackable, or at least had earned him another chance.However, he was soon under pressure after a humiliating 4-2 home defeat against Armenia derailed their Euro 2024 qualifying campaign.Although he held on to his job despite missing out on qualification, Page was eventually dismissed last summer and replaced by Craig Bellamy.Bellamy has started superbly, unbeaten in six games having led Wales to the Nations League's top division and instilled a bold new playing style in the process.His ultimate aim, as he stated on his first day in the job, is to qualify for the 2026 World Cup.And more than that, having seen how Wales fared in Qatar and how that disappointment still burns in his players, Bellamy wants his team to do themselves justice if they get to next year's competition in the USA, Canada and Mexico.",

This is particularly important in dry conditions or with older balls.\nSaliva is more effective in red-ball cricket, typically used in Tests, than in white-ball formats like ODIs and T20s.\nIn red-ball cricket, the ball is used for a longer period, allowing bowlers to shine one side and help generate reverse swing.\nIt remains unclear whether the International Cricket Council (ICC) will lift the saliva ban for red-ball cricket, following the Indian cricket board's decision to lift it for the world's richest T20 league. The ICC is led by Jay Shah, former secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the world's wealthiest cricket board.\n\nThe change will come into effect from Saturday when IPL 2025 - its 18th edition - kicks off with defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) facing Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) at Eden Gardens. The tournament will feature 74 matches across 13 cities over two months.\nIndian fast bowler Mohammed Siraj, who is playing for the Gujarat Titans franchise, has welcomed the decision.\n\"It's excellent news for us bowlers because when the ball is not doing anything, applying saliva on the ball will increase the chances of finding some reverse swing,\" Siraj told Press Trust of India news agency.\n\"It sometimes aids reverse swing because scrubbing the ball against the shirt will not help [to get reverse swing]. But using saliva on the ball will help in maintaining [the shine on one side], and it is important.\"\nMohammed Shami, another Indian fast bowler, had earlier this month called on the ICC to lift the ban.\nAfter India's Champions Trophy semi-final win over Australia, he said, \"We keep appealing that we should be allowed to use saliva so that we can bring reverse swing back into the game and make it interesting.\"\nShami's plea was supported by former international bowlers Vernon Philander and Tim Southee.\nRecently, Indian spin great R Ashwin, who recently retired from international cricket, had said that he too was confused by the ban.\n\"ICC released some research papers which said that saliva did not aid reverse swing much and that not putting saliva on the ball has not made a huge difference. I don't know how they did the research, but saliva should be allowed anyways if it is not a problem,\" he said on his YouTube channel.\nSports writer Sharda Ugra says the lifting of the ban on saliva could help make the contest between bat and ball \"more even\".\nMany believe the odds are stacked against the bowlers in T20 leagues with batter-friendly wickets. The highest IPL total, set in 2013 with RCB's 263 for five against Pune, was surpassed four times in 2024. In 17 seasons, there have been 10 totals crossing 250 runs.\nHowever, Ugra adds that it's not clear how much impact the lifting of the ban will have on bowling. \n\"Saliva isn't the only factor in generating swing - conditions must also be ideal, and a skilled bowler is key,\" she told the BBC.\nSome former fast bowlers like India's Venkatesh Prasad also had a word of caution about change.\n\"The ban on applying saliva was also about maintaining cleanliness. Anything can happen today, we don't know how many - and when - a new virus enters the air. So, I think you need to be very careful in making a decision about lifting the ban,\" Prasad told The Times of India newspaper earlier this month.",

        "article_text": "Premier League intensity or caution - how will Tuchel's England play?\nThere's an irony at the heart of the Thomas Tuchel project that perhaps makes him the most intriguing England appointment this century.\nHiring a German supercoach on a short-term contract effectively bins a decade of regeneration at St George's Park and the \"England DNA\" philosophy that Dan Ashworth launched in 2014 with Gareth Southgate, then the under-21s coach, at his side.\nAnd yet, seemingly by accident, the Football Association's lurch to a win-now mentality - their indulgence in a foreign star with a febrile temperament and cutting-edge tactics - has embraced English football's real culture, its inescapable DNA: the Premier League.\nIt's a relationship Tuchel has already promised to lean into, a story he has already begun to tell.\n\"We will inject a little bit of club football into federation football,\" he said in his first news conference as England manager last Friday.\n\"The Premier League is a very physical league, a very direct league. We should be proud enough of the culture and the style of English football and the English league to implement this.\n\"We have to increase the intensity in our games. I want to have more touches in the opponent's box. I want to have more ball recoveries in the opponent's half.\"\nFirst and foremost, this is intelligent politics from Tuchel, who presents a clear and disarmingly simple vision: forget the Spain-lite stuff, forget the hesitant Southgate years, England should tap into its greatest asset and USP for inspiration.\nThis video can not be played\nHere's why Tuchel is the 'perfect fit' for England\nThere is no doubt Tuchel has the pedigree and the tactical nous to pull it off, in theory at least.\nHis Chelsea team were certainly meant to be defined in this way: hard pressing, high intensity, and - crucially - possession with purpose.\nIn his second year at the helm, a common sight in the Stamford Bridge dugout was a furious Tuchel sweeping both hands from side to side, urging the Chelsea players to cut lines, to pass vertically.\nControl of the ball is vital - Chelsea averaged 62.2% possession in the Premier League under him, the third most during his stint in England - but he was often frustrated by the rigidity and overly-structured passing that afflicted the Blues.\nInstead they found intensity when out of possession. Their PPDA, a measure of pressing intensity, was 9.8 during his time at the club, the second-best score in the Premier League.\nBut Tuchel is a deep tactical thinker and perhaps too flexible to be anchored to these buzzwords. He is not a 'philosophy' manager wedded to one idea like Ruben Amorim or Ange Postecoglou.\nAt Dortmund he pressed high and hard, only to drop deeper at Chelsea, where he developed a penchant for double number 10s between the lines. At Bayern Munich, tactical fluency never really took hold, yet Tuchel clearly moved towards fast wingers and quick transitions more than in previous jobs.\nEven the formation is open to change. He deployed a back three in 55 of his 63 Premier League games for Chelsea but has rarely returned to it since.\nThere are no absolutes, leaving open the possibility that, for all the talk of a strong tactical vision, Tuchel - like so many England managers before him - will naturally retreat into something altogether more conservative.\nHis disappointing 14-month spell at Bayern, who finished third in his only full season in charge, was defined by a caution and pragmatism that he, reportedly resisting internal calls to play attacking football, felt forced upon him by a weak defence.\nEngland's paucity of high-quality defenders, certainly compared to their riches in attack, may ultimately inspire similar caution, especially in an environment that naturally breeds restrictive thinking.\nThe Didier Deschamps blueprint for international knockout football - a cagey defensive mid-block and low-volume, safety-first attacks - remains in-vogue, and despite his lofty aims, Tuchel could be drawn in, not least because he's done it once before - and it sparked his greatest achievement to date.\nThis video can not be played\nThe making of Thomas Tuchel\nTuchel built his Champions League-winning Chelsea side on the foundation of a deep-lying defence and quick counter-attacks, choosing the defensive approach as he muddled through following a mid-season appointment in January 2021.\nAdventurous they were not, but Chelsea kept 18 clean sheets in his first 24 matches in charge and conceded just two goals in seven Champions League knockout games, culminating in a couple of backs-to-the-walls wins when it mattered most.\nChelsea beat Real Madrid 2-0 in the semi-final second leg with just 32.7% possession, and then squeezed past Manchester City in a nervy final in Porto with only 39.6% of the ball.\nTuchel's England will also need to be built quickly for knockout football, while minimal time on the training field necessitates simpler instructions at international level - and defensive resilience is quicker to coach than attacking dynamism.\nAdd in the pressure cooker of those final-stage matches and the lopsided talent in the England squad, and it becomes harder to believe Tuchel can infuse international management with Premier League intensity.\nBut that doesn't mean he won't turn the dial on Southgate.\nChelsea battled to victory in those tough Champions League games. They snapped into midfield challenges and passed bravely through the lines, far more than the static and retreating England midfields that came to define Southgate's biggest matches.\nThis video can not be played\nBrotherhood, Ben White and playing style - Tuchel answers key questions\nSuffice to say there are too many unknowns to accurately predict Tuchel's preferred playing style, personnel, or even formation before we see England in action this weekend.\nBut we can at least highlight the type of player he will grow fond of.\nTuchel's favourites at Chelsea were Mason Mount, Kai Havertz, Jorginho and N'Golo Kante - intelligent, shape-shifting footballers able to follow detailed tactical instructions and willing to break lines even when pressured.\nDeclan Rice and Jude Bellingham obviously fall into this category with England, although Tuchel may take a shine to Curtis Jones; an all-action, press-evading footballer with the smarts to link the middle together.\nIn the forward line the priority will be hard-working pressers, as well as players comfortable cutting inside to receive possession in that fertile central attacking midfield space, hence Eberechi Eze and Morgan Rogers being picked ahead of Jack Grealish and Callum Hudson-Odoi.\nThis video can not be played\n'Tuchel isn't picking players on form' - Sutton\nBut it's defence where we will learn Tuchel's true intentions.\nHis options here are more limited, as represented most acutely by Jordan Pickford: hardly the ball-playing sweeper-keeper Tuchel would like, but the only realistic option.\nAnd where there are defensive decisions to be made, contradictions abound.\nKyle Walker's inclusion attests to the pull of conservatism, but Myles Lewis-Skelly does the opposite. Jordan Henderson over Adam Wharton is an eye-catchingly anti-progressive decision, as is the sturdy Dan Burn over Jarrad Branthwaite.\nEach choice hints at competing voices on Tuchel's shoulders. Those whispers will be loudest when Trent Alexander-Arnold, unavailable for selection this time, comes back into the fold. What happens to him will prove instructive.\nA Premier League-inspired Tuchel - of intense, direct, and physical football - will make Trent the beating heart.\nThe Champions League-winning Tuchel - of necessity, caution and restrictive gameplans - will follow in Southgate's footsteps and leave the Liverpool right-back on the bench.\nTuchel's appointment is something truly new, an acceptance that England's DNA is the Premier League, for better and for worse.\nBut Premier League management affords what international coaching does not - time to teach, to embed tactics and to build a squad profile in the manager's image. Without that, the ever-flexible Tuchel may temper his ambition.",

What happens to him will prove instructive.A Premier League-inspired Tuchel - of intense, direct, and physical football - will make Trent the beating heart.The Champions League-winning Tuchel - of necessity, caution and restrictive gameplans - will follow in Southgate's footsteps and leave the Liverpool right-back on the bench.Tuchel's appointment is something truly new, an acceptance that England's DNA is the Premier League, for better and for worse.But Premier League management affords what international coaching does not - time to teach, to embed tactics and to build a squad profile in the manager's image. \"First and foremost, this is intelligent politics from Tuchel, who presents a clear and disarmingly simple vision: forget the Spain-lite stuff, forget the hesitant Southgate years, England should tap into its greatest asset and USP for inspiration.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Here's why Tuchel is the 'perfect fit' for EnglandThere is no doubt Tuchel has the pedigree and the tactical nous to pull it off, in theory at least.His Chelsea team were certainly meant to be defined in this way: hard pressing, high intensity, and - crucially - possession with purpose.In his second year at the helm, a common sight in the Stamford Bridge dugout was a furious Tuchel sweeping both hands from side to side, urging the Chelsea players to cut lines, to pass vertically.Control of the ball is vital - Chelsea averaged 62.2% possession in the Premier League under him, the third most during his stint in England - but he was often frustrated by the rigidity and overly-structured passing that afflicted the Blues.Instead they found intensity when out of possession. Premier League intensity or caution - how will Tuchel's England play?Published4 hours agoAlex KebleFootball tactics writerThere's an irony at the heart of the Thomas Tuchel project that perhaps makes him the most intriguing England appointment this century.Hiring a German supercoach on a short-term contract effectively bins a decade of regeneration at St George's Park and the \"England DNA\" philosophy that Dan Ashworth launched in 2014 with Gareth Southgate, then the under-21s coach, at his side.And yet, seemingly by accident, the Football Association's lurch to a win-now mentality - their indulgence in a foreign star with a febrile temperament and cutting-edge tactics - has embraced English football's real culture, its inescapable DNA: the Premier League.Tuchel's England will be fast & furious - in theoryIt's a relationship Tuchel has already promised to lean into, a story he has already begun to tell. They snapped into midfield challenges and passed bravely through the lines, far more than the static and retreating England midfields that came to define Southgate's biggest matches.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Brotherhood, Ben White and playing style - Tuchel answers key questionsFlexible & intelligent players will be prioritisedSuffice to say there are too many unknowns to accurately predict Tuchel's preferred playing style, personnel, or even formation before we see England in action this weekend.But we can at least highlight the type of player he will grow fond of.Tuchel's favourites at Chelsea were Mason Mount, Kai Havertz, Jorginho and N'Golo Kante - intelligent, shape-shifting footballers able to follow detailed tactical instructions and willing to break lines even when pressured.Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham obviously fall into this category with England, although Tuchel may take a shine to Curtis Jones; an all-action, press-evading footballer with the smarts to link the middle together.In the forward line the priority will be hard-working pressers, as well as players comfortable cutting inside to receive possession in that fertile central attacking midfield space, hence Eberechi Eze and Morgan Rogers being picked ahead of Jack Grealish and Callum Hudson-Odoi.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'Tuchel isn't picking players on form' - SuttonBut it's defence where we will learn Tuchel's true intentions.His options here are more limited, as represented most acutely by Jordan Pickford: hardly the ball-playing sweeper-keeper Tuchel would like, but the only realistic option.And where there are defensive decisions to be made, contradictions abound.Kyle Walker's inclusion attests to the pull of conservatism, but Myles Lewis-Skelly does the opposite.",

The excitement and intensity the German promised will have to wait for another day after this scrappy 2-0 World Cup qualifying win over Albania.\nIn an unflattering review of England's Euro 2024 campaign - widely interpreted as criticism of Southgate and the team beaten by Spain in the final - Tuchel claimed it was missing \"intensity, clarity, identity, repetition of patterns, expression of players and hunger\".\nIn this game, at least, there was little to distinguish Tuchel's England from Southgate's, his search for thrills thwarted by Albania's lack of ambition, a reluctance to leave their own half and his own team's lack of fluency and rhythm.\nA win is a win, however, and this is what Tuchel has been appointed to do, in the short-term against Albania and Latvia here on Monday - and in the long-term at next year's World Cup.\nFive talking points from Tuchel's first game as England boss\n'He does everything right' - the remarkable rise of Lewis-Skelly\nWho 'didn't show enough' against Albania? How England's players rated\nTuchel went for a 4-2-3-1 formation, with Manchester City's Phil Foden on the right and on-loan Aston Villa attacker Marcus Rashford on the left, which did not prove a roaring success.\nAfter the game England's new boss said \"we hope for more impact in these positions\" and that \"they were not as decisive as they can be\".\nBut the decision to give Arsenal left-back Myles Lewis-Skelly a debut was a masterstroke as he became the youngest player to score on his senior England debut, aged 18 years and 176 days.\nDan Burn, another making his first appearance at 32, almost repeated his goalscoring feats for Newcastle United in the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool when he headed against the bar in the first half, but looked laboured and vulnerable when Albania substitute Armando Broja ran at him late on.\nTuchel laid down his template by insisting he wants more intensity, more touches in the opponents' box and more ball recoveries in the opponents' half. By this measure there is work to do, but this is early days.\nEngland had 34 touches in Albania's box compared to 44 in interim manager Lee Carsley's last game against the Republic of Ireland in November, winning back possession in the final third four times as opposed to six, enjoying 74.2% possession against 73.6%.\nThis should all be placed in the context of an Albanian strategy which effectively consisted of building the lowest of blocks to frustrate England.\nIt is too early to detect any sort of identity as, in many ways, this was more of the same that went before, but it was easy to detect what Tuchel likes and wants from his body language.\nThis video can not be played\nTuchel happy with start but England must be 'more dangerous'\nIn the opening stages, he twice broke into animated applause when England pressurised Albania into errors - the first occasion when they stole possession and on another when intensity forced the visitors to pass the ball into touch.\nTuchel was equally enthusiastic when England pounced to pinch the ball back. This was the intensity he wanted and will expect more of in the future. \nIt was all accompanied by tic-tac arm-waving, but mostly he was a calm, measured figure, although there was little to get excited about for long spells.\nTuchel was not a permanent presence on the touchline, taking his seat after 14 minutes, remaining there for three minutes, occasionally in discussion with his staff, before returning pitch-side.\nHe greeted the first goal of his reign, slipped home by Lewis-Skelly from Jude Bellingham's incisive pass, with a pump of his fist and a big smile - but it was quickly down to business as he delivered some lengthy instructions to goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.\nTuchel also soon became acquainted with one of Wembley's more recent traditions, the paper aeroplanes that fly during periods of inactivity. The first one landed near him after 33 minutes.\nTuchel has shown he is not too proud to use the physical presence and set-piece prowess he believes bring the strengths of the Premier League to England, selecting the physicality and aerial power of 6ft 7in Burn ahead of the more technically gifted Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi, who was arguably England's best performer at the Euros.\nWhen the Three Lions won three successive corners in the first half, a line of players formed - a ploy known variously as \"the bus stop\" or \"the love train\" - but there was only one target for Declan Rice's delivery - the giant figure of Burn.\nIt was the most obvious of plans, but almost worked as he rose above Albania's defenders to crash a header against the bar.\nTuchel only lost his composure once, when he berated the officials for not awarding a foul when Rashford was barged to the ground in front of him, but this was an uneventful night and a routine win.\nNo serious clues were offered about any revolutionary moves Tuchel might have up his sleeve, although he will yearn for a swift return to fitness for Bukayo Saka given Foden's disappointing performance in the position the Arsenal winger would normally occupy.\nOne area Tuchel is keen to develop is the \"interactions\" between England's players on the field, effectively moments where they encourage each other, showing a bond of togetherness.\nWhen he addressed the players at St George's Park on Monday, he presented them with data that showed there were 60 such interactions in the first half of the Euros final against Spain in Berlin, but only 35 after half-time when they conceded the goals that saw them slip to a 2-1 defeat.\nThis was not a night when interactions or high-fives were the order of the day. It was more a simple case of 'job done'. Although Pickford did celebrate - and at great length with much enthusiasm - when defender Ezri Konsa pulled off a superb covering tackle as Albania's Jasir Asani raced through with the chance of an unlikely equaliser.\nTuchel's plain speaking is already a contrast to the measured, almost diplomatic, words of Southgate and he made his feelings clear once more when he said: \"We can do better, we have to do better.\"\nWhen it was all over, the first three points secured, Tuchel made a swift exit down Wembley's tunnel, leaving his players to conduct a lap of appreciation - although thousands of fans had drifted away well before the end.\nThis was not a night that carried the air of a glorious new era, but Tuchel has been brought to England with a simple brief - win.",

It was like they were having a bad season,\" Kane said.\n\"People take it for granted and maybe a little bit with England as well. I've scored 69 goals and when you score against Albania or Latvia, or these teams, people just expect it so it's not spoken about so much.\n\"If I was 25 now and doing what I'm doing, the excitement around me would maybe be a little bit different to what it is now. That's part of where we are with football. I've seen it with some other players as they get into their 30s.\n\"Maybe people just get a little bit bored of what you do, but I'm certainly not bored.

Yet the former Tottenham striker's impact has been questioned at times in Germany.\n\"It's hard. Sometimes it motivates me. Sometimes, to be honest I try to stay away from it as much as I can,\" Kane added.\n\"Probably, when I was young I listened to more than what I do now. Ultimately, I criticise myself more than anyone could do on the outside but... always use it as fuel to prove people wrong.\n\"In today's game, I feel like there's such a difference between a high and a low. You go from not scoring for a couple of games, to people saying he's not sharp enough... to scoring and you're a Ballon d'Or contender and it's like, the difference is too high and too low.\n\"I know what I've done in my career and I feel like I have a lot of respect from a lot of football people out there and I've achieved a lot in my career.\"\nMichael Owen was the last English player to win the Ballon d'Or in 2001. \nBut Kane believes his transfer to Bayern in 2023 has provided him with the platform to earn the coveted prize awarded to the world's best player each year.\n\"Just being at a club like Bayern Munich has helped push me on even more, confidence-wise and responsibility-wise,\" he added.\n\"I feel like I've definitely got better, I've improved, and maybe the 'aura' of me as a player is a bit more respected than what it has been in the past, because you're playing in big games, big nights.\n\"I felt that last season as well, I scored over 40 goals, but obviously, I was never going to win the Ballon d'Or because we didn't win the team trophies.\n\"Those opportunities are there.

        "article_text": "Computers and smartphones might be where most writing is done these days, but typewriters still have work to do in the US.\nPretty much every day, another customer clutching an old typewriter will walk into Mike Marr's shop in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Marr carefully looks the machine over. Invariably, it will be a total mess. Made decades ago, the hunk of heavy metal bristling with moving parts is now laced with years of grime. The keys are too stiff. Or maybe the paper that's supposed to glide through it keeps getting stuck.\n\"Do you think you can get it going again?\" the customer will ask, a touch of anxiety in their voice. Marr, who has been repairing typewriters for more than 20 years, will say he'll give it his best shot.\n\"When they come in and pick that typewriter up, just seeing their smile is everything to us,\" he says. Even in the year 2025, a century and a half after the first commercially successful typewriter was introduced to the American public, surprising numbers of people in the US are still using these machines. And not just for fun \u2013 many of Marr's customers are businesses. \"We're still servicing probably 20 to 25 typewriters a week,\" he says. He employs three other people in his shop to keep up with the demand. \"Isn't that crazy?\"\nIn today's world, internet-connected computers and smartphones are king. They're used for the vast majority of business tasks and transactions. But here and there, in little offices and warehouses, you can still find a well-worn typewriter lingering in the corner. A machine whose keys have been pressed many thousands, if not millions, of times. To this day, typewriters print names on forms. They put addresses on envelopes. They fill out cheques. And the people who use them, generally speaking, have no intention of switching to a computer any time soon \u2013 at least for those particular tasks.\nIt was back in 1953 that Marr's grandfather founded the business he now runs: Marr Office Equipment. Decades ago, a call came through from IBM. The tech giant was looking for a new typewriter distributor in the northeast of the US. Marr's father and uncle, in charge at the time, were over the moon. \"That was the biggest thing that could ever happen to them,\" says Marr. \"Trailer trucks would just pull up and unload IBM after IBM. They'd already be sold. We couldn't keep up with it.\"\nMarr Office Equipment's heyday may be long gone but Marr still knows typewriter users all over his local area. He mentions one that is about a 10 minute drive away, in south Providence \u2013 a law firm named Tomasso & Tomasso, co-owned by brothers John and Ray, both attorneys. \"We sound exactly alike,\" says John, laughing as he introduces himself over the phone. Do they actually still rely on typewriters? Absolutely. \"There's not a day that goes by that we don't use them,\" says Tomasso. \"This is really still the best way.\"\nThe firm's office has three typewriters, John says and his colleagues still use them to type up cheques and fill in legal forms to ensure the details on those documents are legible. Plus, there's a security angle. It's very hard to hack a typewriter since they are not connected to the internet. In 2013, jaw-dropping details emerged about the extent of US intelligence agency surveillance programmes. This prompted the Russian Federal Guard Service (FSO) to revert to typewriters in an attempt to evade eavesdropping. German officials were also reported to be considering a similar move in 2014. (During the Cold War, Soviet spies actually developed techniques for snooping on electric typewriter activity, a form of \"keylogging\" technology \u2013 where the keystrokes inputted on a keyboard are captured. US operatives also reconstructed text from typewriter ribbons \u2013 meaning that even typewriters aren't completely safe.)\nI ask Tomasso whether there are downsides to using the typewriter \u2013 isn't it harder to correct mistakes? No, he replies, he has a model with an \"eraser ribbon\" that seamlessly covers up a mistype. Plus, the typewriters are inexpensive to run. Replacement ink ribbons cost around $5 (\u00a34), he estimates. Replacement printer ink cartridges can cost several times that.\nBesides, Tomasso loves to see his writing materialise instantly on the page in front of him. \"There's more of a sense of accomplishment than just letters that appear on a screen,\" he explains. \"It's one of those amazing devices that just makes our life better \u2013 I think that's the purpose of technology.\"\nFurther west, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is a real estate agency called Jarvis Realty, owned and run by Woody Jarvis. \"I'm real old school,\" he says. Jarvis, too, regularly uses a typewriter for office work. He gives the example of putting together an offer of purchase for a client. It'll start on the computer but he'll then print the document out and, should he need to make any modifications, he prefers to use correction fluid and his typewriter rather than re-printing the contract and wasting a lot of paper. \"Our contracts are very legible and easy to understand,\" he says. He'll also occasionally type up a name and address on an envelope for a colleague. \"For me, it works because I know how to make it all work.\"\nTypewriters have had a long and colourful history. Centuries ago, tinkerers came up with early, experimental typing machines but they didn't really catch on. Then, in 1868, the first device actually called a typewriter emerged: the Sholes and Glidden Type-Writer, which was patented that year by four inventors in Milwaukee. One of the group, Christopher Latham Sholes, also invented the Qwerty keyboard. Without him, typing \u2013 even on computers \u2013 might be very different today. By the 20th Century, typewriters were everywhere. Millions of the machines were sold in the first few decades of the 1900s and by the mid-1980s, the typewriter industry was worth more than $1.1bn (\u00a3764m) in the US alone, according to press reports from the time.\nIn the 21st Century, typewriters have remained popular in certain corners of the world, despite the rise of computers. In India, for example, typewriters have found a flourishing market among enthusiasts and are still a common \u2013 albeit steadily vanishing \u2013 sight in courts and government offices.\nJarvis's cousin, Lisa Floading, who works at the Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design, is a big fan of typewriters. She has 62 of them. \"There's something very inviting about a typewriter waiting with paper in it,\" she explains. \"I have them all over my house.\"\nFloading uses a typewriter every day, she says, to make lists or write letters, and for office admin. \"There it is, you wrote three pages, boom, done. That's kind of lost on the laptop,\" she says. And she'll even bring a typewriter to her local coffee shop sometimes so she can work on it there. People regularly come up to her to ask about it, she says.\nIn June, Floading took part in an event in Milwaukee called Qwertyfest \u2013 intended to celebrate both the typewriter and the Qwerty keyboard layout, in memory of Christopher Latham Sholes. Among the attractions was a room full of typewriters where attendees could simply sit down and type. The sound of clacking keys and carriages returning filled the space. It was once a sound common in typing pools in businesses around the country.\nJim Riegert, now in his 70s, remembers what it used to be like. \"Back then, typewriters were pretty big. Typewriters and adding machines,\" he says, referring to desktop calculators. \"It got really difficult in the typewriter business about 25 years ago,\" he says. \"The internet was coming on and killing us, too.\" He runs Typewriters.com and, despite a decline in sales in recent decades, he still shifts four or five electric IBM typewriters every week. \"I just sold 12 to a prison that's putting them in the library because they don't let prisoners use computers,\" he says. Funeral homes, some of which use typewriters to compile death certificates, are also regular clients.\nRiegert's business is based in the city of Tucker, Georgia. His own office, inside a giant warehouse, is crammed witharound 70 or 80 IBM electric typewriters \u2013 second-hand units, which he services and sells. The build quality is top notch, he stresses. A prime model could set you back $749 (\u00a3594). When they were brand new in 1984 they would sell for around $1,000, but even accounting for inflation they have retained a surprising amount of value in the digital age.\u00a0 \"They're still the best typewriters you can buy,\" he says. These days, demand might be low \u2013 but somehow business remains steady, and profitable.\nIBM, nowadays arguably better known for supercomputers such as Watson, sold its typewriter business to Lexmark in the early 1990s. However, an IBM spokesperson says on very rare occasions, \"some people do ask for old manuals or service documents for typewriters, which we can provide if they're in the archives\". Lexmark, meanwhile, sold its last typewriter in 2002 and no longer has any typewriter-related services, though some of its former distributors still carry out maintenance on IBM Lexmark typewriters.\nIf, on the other hand, you want to buy a brand-new typewriter, that too remains possible. Many thousands are still manufactured every year. Todd Althoff is president of Royal, a US company that has been making typewriters since 1904. \"We're going to continue,\" he insists. \"Obviously [there is] not that much growth but it's sustainable and we keep the factory busy.\"\nThe factory is in Indonesia, he explains, and is run by a team from Nakajima, a typewriter manufacturing firm from Japan. Every year, Royal still sells around 20,000 new electric typewriters and more than double that amount of mechanical typewriters. The latter have become desirable partly as decoration \u2013 a librarian might buy one for a display at the front of their library, for instance, suggests Althoff. The mechanical and electric models Royal sells cost between $300 (\u00a3238) and $400 (\u00a3317).\nThankfully, there are still companies that make new typewriter ribbons, notes Paul Lundy, who runs Bremerton Office Machine Company, a typewriter repair business in Seattle. \"Those accessories are readily available,\" he says. \"As a person who repairs typewriters, that's always running at the back of my mind \u2013 why are businesses still using these things?\"\nBut he has some good examples, including workers in warehouses who must continually process the transfer of goods by filling out forms. It's hard to feed these complex forms into a computer printer so that information gets printed onto them in exactly the right places. So, says Lundy, the warehouse workers prefer to insert the form into a typewriter and type it up by sight instead.\nOver the years, he's noticed that some aging typewriter parts are becoming more fragile, in some cases possibly as a result of plastic fatigue. But overall, they remain \"incredibly durable\" machines, he says.\nAnd, best of all, when you sit down to use one, there are no distractions. You just type. One of Lundy's customers who appreciates this perhaps more than most is Anjali Banerjee, a novelist who lives in Seattle. She has published 15 books and she wrote the first drafts of the last three on a typewriter.\nSome years ago, Banerjee began getting increasingly frustrated when trying to type new material on her computer. Notifications kept popping up or her word processing software would repeatedly intervene on things like spelling and grammar. So she went out and bought a typewriter.\nBanerjee started with an electric model but then got interested in mechanical versions. Now, she claims that her first drafts emerge more fluidly when she sits down at a typewriter rather than a screen. \"I have to keep moving forward. The story moves faster, if that makes sense,\" she says. \"You have to put it out there, like clay.\" The further editing \u2013 or shaping of the clay \u2013 takes place after she scans the typewriter-produced drafts into her computer.\nBanerjee goes on to admit candidly: \"I developed what we call 'typewriter fever'.\"\nFollowing her first typewriter purchase in 2019, she built up an astonishing collection of no fewer than 120 machines. However, she has recently slimmed this down to about 80 typewriters and plans to sell off roughly half of those. In essence, it became an epic search to find her perfect typewriter. And Banerjee has definitely discovered some personal favourites, such as her Olivetti Studio 45, an Italian-made model. The author, who also plays piano, compares typing on a typewriter to playing a tune on the instrument. It's percussive. And it requires more effort from your hands and fingers than a computer keyboard. She has sought out typewriters that are just right \u2013 not too stiff, not too loose. But a good, deep \"throw\" (the depth of key press required) is satisfying, she adds.\nTypewriters engage the senses, says Banerjee. You hear the energetic clack-clack-clack of the keys as you work away. You might even detect the musty aroma of old offices or maybe long-faded cigarettes. In that atmosphere of industry distilled, you focus in on what you're doing. \"I lose time,\" she says. She'll look up and two hours may have gone by. Her thoughts are right there on the pages in front of her.\nAs long as there are writers like Banerjee, and office workers who prize well-practised convenience over modernity, typewriters will never be completely obsolete, it seems.\nThat ought to keep Mike Marr busy, at his shop in Rhode Island. \"I was born and bred to repair typewriters and office equipment,\" he says. \"It's all I know in life.\"\nMany of the ailing machines that customers bring to him are fundamentally in good condition, merely requiring a clean and a re-oiling of their moving parts. A smattering of decades-old grease in the machine's tightest nooks and crannies has simply dried up. But that's an easy fix. The typewriter itself is perfectly fine \u2013 and it has plenty more work to do.\n--\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

This is what caught light in this instance. The exact cause is not yet known, but counter terrorism police are looking into whether there was any foul play.\nHeathrow uses as much energy as a small city, so it is not possible for it to have the back-up power by itself to run its operation safely.\nA source at Heathrow said it did however have back-up options for certain key systems, but kickstarting the alternative power supplies for the whole airport took time.\nThe systems need to be checked to ensure they are working properly.\nA Heathrow source said its back-up diesel generators and uninterruptable power supplies in place all operated as expected.\nThe problem lay with the National Grid, the source said, pointing out thousands of homes had been left without power, not just the airport.\nThere are two National Grid substations close to Heathrow: one at North Hyde, north of the airport, and one at Laleham, south of the airport, according to energy analysis firm Montel Group.\nIt appears that only the North Hyde substation is connected to Heathrow through the local distribution network, said Phil Hewitt, director at the firm.\n\"This potential lack of resilience at a critical national and international infrastructure site is worrying,\" he said. \"An airport as large and as important as Heathrow should not be vulnerable to a single point of failure.\"\nHowever, Robin Potter, a research fellow at Chatham House, said Heathrow was one of only two UK airports \u2013 Gatwick is the other \u2013 that has any level of regulation around its resilience standards.\n\"These are actually the better airports in the UK for how their resilience is assessed and regulated,\" he said.\nIn 2023, the National Infrastructure Commission recommended to the government that it should set standards for some key sectors of infrastructure such as telecoms, water, transport and energy by 2025.\nIt followed up with a further report at the end of last year detailing how the government could do that for those sectors. \n\"Those have effectively been on the government's desk since October 2023,\" he added.\nA Heathrow source said questions over why its back-up system failed would be investigated.\nSometimes - like now -  a chain is only important as its weakest link. The cost of having a whole extra power supply to run the airport just in case would cost huge amounts of money and  resources for a privately-owned business like Heathrow.\nQuestions over whether additional back-ups are worth the additional cost will continue long after the passengers and cargo delayed by Friday's disruptive, and internationally embarrassing, failure have got where they are going.\nAdditional reporting by Tom Espiner, Theo Leggett, Ben King, and Oliver Smith.\nUpdate 22 March: This article has been corrected to amend a reference to the amount of trade goods affected by the closure of Heathrow.

        "article_text": "This story contains details of someone taking their own life, which some readers may find distressing.\nThe family of a Boeing whistleblower who took his own life last year has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the company.\nThe complaint alleges that John Barnett was subjected to a campaign of harassment, abuse and humiliation after he raised concerns about safety issues.\nIt claims that the conduct of the company was \"the clear, foreseeable cause\" of Mr Barnett's death.\nBoeing said it was saddened by Mr Barnett's death and extended its condolences to his family.\nThe former Boeing manager was found dead from what police described as a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the parking lot of a Charleston hotel on 9 March last year.\nThe 146-page lawsuit has been brought by his mother, Vicky Stokes, and his brothers Rodney and Michael on behalf of his estate. It was filed on Wednesday in the US District Court of South Carolina.\nIt attributes his death to Boeing's actions, including what it describes as a retaliatory campaign by his managers that amounted to a \"hostile work environment\".  \n\"Whether or not Boeing intended to drive John to death or merely destroy his ability to function, it was absolutely foreseeable that Boeing's conduct would result in PTSD and John's unbearable depression... Boeing's conduct was the clear cause, and the clear foreseeable cause, of John's death,\" it says.\nIt describes Mr Barnett as a dedicated, idealistic worker who \"took his role seriously in protecting the flying public\" and \"believed that he had a personal, legal and moral obligation to ensure\u2026 that every possible defect was identified, documented and remedied.\"\nIt describes how he was allegedly harassed, denigrated, humiliated and treated with scorn and contempt, as well as being removed from investigations he was working on and blacklisted from transferring to other quality control positions within the company.\nMr Barnett took early retirement from Boeing in March 2017, at a time when the claim says he had been suffering from symptoms of depression and severe anxiety, and knew he was going to be fired. The lawsuit alleges the company continued to put pressure on him, for example by preventing friends who continued to work there from having any contact with him.\nAmong the exhibits put forward in support of the claim are an email, in which he says, \"Boeing has completely destroyed my outlook on life\" and his handwritten final note, which says \"I can't do this any longer!! Enough!!\"\nJohn Barnett worked for Boeing for 32 years. \nFrom 2010, he was employed as a quality manager at Boeing's factory in North Charleston, South Carolina. The facility builds the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art airliner used mainly on long-haul routes.\nDuring his time at the factory, Mr Barnett raised a number of concerns with management about violations of safety procedures, as well as about defects in aircraft on the production line.\nHe later took his concerns to the media. In 2019, he told the BBC that:\nBoeing denied his assertions. However, a 2017 review by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), did uphold some of Mr Barnett's concerns.\nIt established that the location of at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts in the factory was unknown, and that they were considered lost. Boeing was ordered to take remedial action.\nOn the oxygen cylinders issue, the company said that in 2017 it had \"identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly\". But it denied that any of them were actually fitted on aircraft.\nSafety standards at Boeing have come under a harsh spotlight since an incident last year in which a disused door panel fell off a brand new 737 Max aircraft shortly after takeoff. \nThe incident, which came five years after two previous catastrophic accidents involving the 737 Max, brought intense scrutiny of the company's quality control procedures and conditions in the factory. \nThe company appointed a new chief executive last year, industry veteran Kelly Ortberg, and has produced a detailed action plan to address concerns raised by regulators about issues on the factory floor.\nIn response to the lawsuit being filed, Boeing issued a brief statement. \n\"We are saddened by John Barnett's death and extend our condolences to his family,\" it said.\nPreviously, however, the company has pushed back against the allegations made against it, telling the BBC: \"Boeing reviewed and addressed quality issues that Mr Barnett raised before he retired in 2017, as well as other quality issues referred to in the complaint. Engineering analysis determined the issues he raised did not affect airplane safety.\"\nIt also drew attention to a decision made earlier in Mr Barnett's case, in 2020, in which the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration concluded the company had not breached whistleblower protection law.\nIt added: \"We appreciate employees who raise their voice, and we have systems in place to encourage them to speak up confidentially or anonymously.\"\nIf you have been affected by the issues in this story, you can find support from the BBC's Action Line.",

        "article_text": "Mike Johns didn't expect his return trip from Los Angeles to Scottsdale, Arizona in December to go viral.\nTo get to the airport he booked a driverless taxi and enjoyed a thrill when he jumped in with curious bystanders looking on.\nBut he got much more attention than he bargained for. \nMr Johns found himself being driven around and around a car park while those same bystanders looked on.\nThe Waymo ride was not doing what it should and there was no obvious way Mr Johns could fix it - and he had a flight to catch.\nMr Johns recorded the experience, a video that went viral almost immediately and was picked up on TV stations around the world, casting fresh public doubt about self-driving cars and how ready they are for real-world passengers.\n\"Why is this happening to me on a Monday morning?\" Mr Johns filmed himself asking.\nEventually a voice activated inside the car telling him to access the Waymo app to get the vehicle back under control.\nWaymo which is owned by Alphabet, the parent company of Google, told the BBC that it released a software update almost immediately fixing the problem.\nThe company says its driverless system is \"better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries, airbag deployments, and police reports\".\nNevertheless, Mr John's experience is not the first time the company has had to take action.\nLast year the company recalled more than 600 cars after one hit a street pole.\nAnd in May 2024 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched a probe into 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles .\nThe road to a driverless future has also gone awry for rival services.\nIn December, US car giant General Motors closed down its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise.\nGM attributed the change of strategy to \"the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business\".\nIn October 2023, one of its vehicles hit a pedestrian and dragged her for more than 20ft (6m), leaving her seriously injured.\nMeanwhile, in February of last year, it emerged that Apple's rumoured self-driving car project was folding.\nUber abandoned its own driverless car efforts in 2020. \nBut some big players remain in the race, including Zoox, which is owned by Amazon, as well as chipmaker Nvidia and Elon Musk's Tesla.\nWaymo is the leading US player though. It already operates self-driving taxis in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas and is promising to launch soon in Atlanta and Miami, Florida.\nSo why has Waymo succeeded where other efforts, at least in the US, have failed?\n\"Three things - people, money and process,\" says Sven Beiker, a lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and managing director of Silicon Valley Mobility, an automotive consultancy.\nHe points out that over the years Waymo has employed some of the leading figures in autonomous vehicle engineering, it has the financial weight of Google-owner Alphabet behind it, and has become thorough in its approach.\n\"They've come around to really playing by the book, to be a good steward of processes... working with regulators to make sure what they deploy is safe.\"\nSo what's next?\nRegions with good weather are likely to see driverless services first says Philipp Kampshoff, global co-leader of Automotive and Assembly Practice at the consultancy giant McKinsey.\nThat would include southern US states like Texas and Florida, where Waymo already has plans.\n\"Robo-taxis still operate much better in good weather conditions. They still, for the most part, struggle in heavy snow,\" Mr Kampshoff says.\nHe also points out that the batteries perform better in warmer conditions, which is particularly important for driverless cars that need a lot of energy to power on board computing.\n\"Bringing this all together, in the second part of the 2020s, you will see one city after the other being unlocked and then scaling within these cities,\" he says. \nIt will be a slow process. \n\"It's actually quite a labour intensive process to roll out this technology, which includes a fair amount of human driving,\" says Mr Beiker. \n\"You need to drive those vehicles through the streets where you want to deploy them, and you need to drive them over and over again, and you need to, to some extent, manually edit the data,\" he adds. \nAnd the whole process could also be held up by safety concerns. \n\"This is only going to happen if we're not running into major accidents. The moment major accidents are going to happen, a lot of these operations are going to be shut down,\" says Mr Kampshoff.\nFor those working on self-driving trucks, safety is arguably on even bigger worry.\n\"Safety is the number one concern that we work on,\" says David Liu, the chief executive of Plus, which makes driverless software for trucks and works with global companies such as Amazon, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Scania.\n\"Autonomous trucks and autonomous vehicles, need to be much safer than average human driven vehicle,\" says Mr Liu.\n\"Human drivers are great, but not flawless. Most of the accidents we get ourselves into are due to driver inattentiveness. And we don't have that issue with technology,\" Mr Liu explains.\n\"A robo-taxi mostly runs within cities in low-speed environments, while trucks are typically run on highways at higher speed.\n\"So we do need to put in different set of technology to be able to see more clearly around the trucks and be able to handle a longer braking distance, for instance.\"\nTo see into the driverless future it might be worth watching developments in China. \nIn the city of Wuhan more than 500 driverless cars are being operated by the company Baidu.\nAcross the country driverless cars are reported to be operating in 16 cities and being tested by 19 manufacturers.\n\"There's definitely more competition... there are four or five companies that are very similar to Waymo,\" says Mr Beiker who is currently working on a study of robo-taxi deployments around the world, sponsored by Sweden's innovation agency Vinnova.\nBack in Scottsdale, Mr Johns reflects on his experience and the rollout of autonomous vehicles.\n\"One big thing is that we're all a part of a paid experiment. At the end of the day, what they're doing is fixing it as they go, per city. And that's a problem.\"",

        "article_text": "Saira Baloch was 15 when she stepped into a morgue for the first time.\nAll she heard in the dimly-lit room were sobs, whispered prayers and shuffling feet. The first body she saw was a man who appeared to have been tortured. \nHis eyes were missing, his teeth had been pulled out and there were burn marks on his chest.\n\"I couldn't look at the other bodies. I walked out,\" she recalled.\nBut she was relieved. It wasn't her brother - a police officer who had been missing for nearly a year since he was arrested in 2018 in a counter-terrorism operation in Balochistan, one of Pakistan's most restive regions.\nInside the morgue, others continued their desperate search, scanning rows of unclaimed corpses. Saira would soon adopt this grim routine, revisiting one morgue after another. They were all the same: tube lights flickering, the air thick with the stench of decay and antiseptic.\nOn every visit, she hoped she would not find what she was looking for - seven years on, she still hasn't. \nActivists say thousands of ethnic Baloch people have been disappeared by Pakistan's security forces in the last two decades - allegedly detained without due legal process, or abducted, tortured and killed in operations against a decades-old separatist insurgency. \nThe Pakistan government denies the allegations, insisting that many of the missing have joined separatist groups or fled the country.\nSome return after years, traumatised and broken - but many never come back. Others are found in unmarked graves that have appeared across Balochistan, their bodies so disfigured they cannot be identified.\nAnd then there are the women across generations whose lives are being defined by waiting. \nYoung and old, they take part in protests, their faces lined with grief, holding up fading photographs of men no longer in their lives. When the BBC met them at their homes, they offered us black tea - Sulemani chai - in chipped cups as they spoke in voices worn down by sorrow. \nMany of them insist their fathers, brothers and sons are innocent and have been targeted for speaking out against state policies or were taken as a form of collective punishment.\nSaira is one of them. \nShe says she started going to protests after asking the police and pleading with politicians yielded no answers about her brother's whereabouts.\nMuhammad Asif Baloch was arrested in August 2018 along with 10 others in Nushki, a city along the border with Afghanistan. His family found out when they saw him on TV the next day, looking scared and dishevelled. \nAuthorities said the men were \"terrorists fleeing to Afghanistan\". Muhammad's family said he was having a picnic with friends.\nSaira says Muhammad was her \"best friend\", funny and always cheerful - \"My mother worries that she's forgetting his smile.\" \nThe day he went missing, Saira had aced a school exam and was excited to tell her brother, her \"biggest supporter\". Muhammad had encouraged her to attend universty in Quetta, the provincial capital. \n\"I didn't know back then that the first time I'd go to Quetta, it would be for a protest demanding his release,\" Saira says.  \nThree of the men who were detained along with her brother were released in 2021, but they have not spoken about what happened.\nMuhammad never came home.\nThe journey into Balochistan, in Pakistan's south-west, feels like you are stepping into another world. \nIt is vast - covering about 44% of the country, the largest of Pakistan's provinces - and the land is rich with gas, coal, copper and gold. It stretches along the Arabian Sea, across the water from places like Dubai, which has risen from the sands into glittering, monied skyscrapers.\nBut Balochistan remains stuck in time. Access to many parts is restricted for security reasons and foreign journalists are often denied access. \nIt's also difficult to travel around. The roads are long and lonely, cutting through barren hills and desert. As the infrastructure thins out the further you travel, roads are replaced by dirt tracks created by the few vehicles that pass. \nElectricity is sporadic, water even scarcer. Schools and hospitals are dismal.\nIn the markets, men sit outside mud shops waiting for customers who rarely come. Boys, who elsewhere in Pakistan may dream of a career, only talk of escape: fleeing to Karachi, to the Gulf, to anywhere that offers a way out of this slow suffocation.\nBalochistan became a part of Pakistan in 1948, in the upheaval that followed the partition of British India - and in spite of opposition from some influential tribal leaders, who sought an independent state. \nSome of the resistance turned militant and, over the years, it has been stoked by accusations that Pakistan has exploited the resource-rich region without investing in its development.\nMilitant groups like the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), designated a terrorist group by Pakistan and other nations, have intensified their attacks: bombings, assassinations and ambushes against security forces have become more frequent.\nEarlier this month, the BLA hijacked a train in Bolan Pass, seizing hundreds of passengers. They demanded the release of missing people in Balochistan in return for freeing hostages. \nThe siege lasted over 30 hours. According to authorities, 33 BLA militants, 21 civilian hostages and four military personnel were killed. But conflicting figures suggest many passengers remain unaccounted for.\nThe disappearances in the province are widely believed to be part of Islamabad's strategy to crush the insurgency - but also to suppress dissent, weaken nationalist sentiment and support for an independent Balochistan.\nMany of the missing are suspected members or sympathisers of Baloch nationalist groups that demand more autonomy or independence. But a significant number are ordinary people with no known political affiliations.\nBalochistan's Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti told the BBC that enforced disappearances are an issue but dismissed the idea that they were happening on a large scale as \"systematic propaganda\".\n\"Every child in Balochistan has been made to hear 'missing persons, missing persons'. But who will determine who disappeared whom? \n\"Self-disappearances exist too. How can I prove if someone was taken by intelligence agencies, police, FC, or anyone else or me or you?\"\nPakistan's military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif recently said in a press conference that the \"state is solving the issue of missing persons in a systematic manner\". \nHe repeated the official statistic often shared by the government - of the more than 2,900 cases of enforced disappearances reported from Balochistan since 2011, 80% had been resolved. \nActivists put the figure higher - at around 7,000 \u2013 but there is no single reliable source of data and no way to verify either side's claims.\nWomen like Jannat Bibi refuse to accept the official number. \nShe continues to search for her son, Nazar Muhammad, who she claims was taken in 2012 while eating breakfast at a hotel. \n\"I went everywhere looking for him. I even went to Islamabad,\" she says. \"All I got were beatings and rejection.\"\nThe 70-year-old lives in a small mud house on the outskirts of Quetta, not far from a symbolic graveyard dedicated to the missing.\nJannat, who runs a tiny shop selling biscuits and milk cartons, often can't afford the bus fare to attend protests demanding information about the missing. But she borrows what she can so she can keep going.\n\"Silence is not an option,\" she says.\nMost of these men - including those whose families we spoke to - disappeared after 2006.\nThat was the year a key Baloch leader, Nawab Akbar Bugti, was killed in a military operation, leading to a rise in anti-state protests and armed insurgent activities. \nThe government cracked down in response - enforced disappearances increased, as did the number of bodies found on the streets.\nIn 2014, mass graves of missing people were discovered in Tootak \u2013 a small town near the city of Khuzdar, where Saira lives, 275km (170 miles) south of Quetta. \nThe bodies were disfigured beyond identification. The images from Tootak shook the country - but the horror was no stranger to people in Balochistan.\nMahrang Baloch's father, a famous nationalist leader who fought for Baloch rights, had disappeared in early 2009. Abdul Gaffar Langove had worked for the Pakistani government but left the job to advocate for what he believed would be a safer Balochistan.\nThree years later Mahrang received a phone call that his body had been found in Lasbela district in the south of the province.\n\"When my father's body arrived, he was wearing the same clothes, now torn. He had been badly tortured,\" she says. For five years, she had nightmares about his final days. She visited his grave \"to convince myself that he was no longer alive and that he was not being tortured\". \nShe hugged his grave \"hoping to feel him, but it didn't happen\". \nWhen he was arrested, Mahrang used to write him letters -  \"lots of letters and I would draw greeting cards and send them to him on Eid\". But he returned the cards, saying his prison cell was no place for such \"beautiful\" cards. He wanted her to keep them at home. \n\"I still miss his hugs,\" she says. \nAfter her father's death, Mahrang says, her family's world \"collapsed\".\nAnd then in 2017,  her brother was picked up by security forces, according to the family, and detained for nearly three months.  \n\"It was terrifying. I made my mother believe that what happened to my father wouldn't happen to my brother. But it did,\" Mahrang says. \"I was scared of looking at my phone, because it might be news of my brother's body being found somewhere.\"\nShe says her mother and she found strength in each other: \"Our tiny house was our safest place, where we would sometimes sit and cry for hours. But outside, we were two strong women who couldn't be crushed.\"\nIt was then that Mahrang decided to fight against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Today, the 32-year-old leads the protest movement despite death threats, legal cases and travel bans.\n\"We want the right to live on our own land without persecution. We want our resources, our rights. We want this rule of fear and violence to end.\"\nMahrang warns that enforced disappearances fuel more resistance, rather than silence it.\n\"They think dumping bodies will end this. But how can anyone forget losing their loved one this way? No human can endure this.\"\nShe demands institutional reforms, ensuring that no mother has to send her child away in fear. \"We don't want our children growing up in protest camps. Is that too much to ask?\"\nMahrang was arrested on Saturday morning, a few weeks after her interview with the BBC.\nShe was leading a protest in Quetta after 13 unclaimed bodies - feared to be missing persons - were buried in the city. Authorities claimed they were militants killed after the Bolan Pass train hijacking, though this could not be independently verified.\nEarlier Mahrang had said: \"I could be arrested anytime. But I don't fear it. This is nothing new for us.\"\nAnd even as she fights for the future she wants, a new generation is already on the streets.\nMasooma, 10, clutches her school bag tightly as she weaves through the crowd of protesters, her eyes scanning every face, searching for one that looks like her father's.\n\"Once, I saw a man and thought he was my father. I ran to him and then realised he was someone else,\" she says.\n\"Everyone's father comes home after work. I have never found mine.\"\nMasooma was just three months old when security forces allegedly took her father away during a late-night raid in Quetta. \nHer mother was told he would return in a few hours. He never did.\nToday, Masooma spends more time at protests than in the classroom. Her father's photograph is always with her, tucked safely in her school bag.\nBefore every lesson begins, she takes it out and looks at it.\n\"I always wonder if my father will come home today.\"\nShe stands outside the protest camp, chanting slogans with the others, her small frame lost in the crowd of grieving families.\nAs the protest comes to an end she sits cross-legged on a thin mat in a quiet corner. The noise of slogans and traffic fades as she pulls out her folded letters - letters she has written but could never send.\nHer fingers tremble as she smooths out the creases, and in a fumbling, uncertain voice, she begins to read them.\n\"Dear Baba Jan, when will you come back? Whenever I eat or drink water, I miss you. Baba, where are you? I miss you so much. I am alone. Without you, I cannot sleep. I just want to meet you and see your face.\"",

About 150 people were evacuated from surrounding properties.\nThe Met Police has said that counter-terrorism officers were \"leading inquiries\" but are not treating the incident as suspicious.\nMiliband said he has commissioned the investigation to \"understand any wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure, both now and in the future\".\nNESO, which operates Britain's electricity grid, is expected to report to the power regulator Ofgem and the government in six weeks with its initial findings.\nNearly 1,400 flights were disrupted by the airport's closure, according to air traffic website flightradar24.com. Around 120 flights were diverted elsewhere.\nSeparately, Heathrow has announced a review of the airport's response to the power outage and its crisis management plans will be undertaken by former Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly.\nThe airport said it was \"open and fully operational\" on Saturday morning, but the chaos has raised questions about the resilience of the major transport hub.\nFifty slots were added to Saturday's schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers travelling through it, the airport said.\nOn Saturday, more than 30 flights due to depart from the airport were cancelled and more than 15 were delayed, according to Heathrow's live departure board.\nIt also showed that more than 70 flights expected to arrive at the airport had been cancelled, including from Doha, Riyadh, Dubai, Manchester, and Newcastle Upon Tyne.\nFarah Rafeeq was due to travel with a friend from Heathrow to Cambodia on Friday to attend a friend's wedding but the mass cancellation of flights has meant she will miss part of the ceremony.\nThe 24-year-old found an alternative flight from Gatwick Airport that will get them to Cambodia for Sunday afternoon in time for the wedding reception but said they had to pay \"double the amount\" for a the new flight.\nIn Miami, Charlotte and her family were heading to Heathrow on Thursday night when their American Airlines plane was \"turned around mid-flight\", she said.\n\"I have been stranded in Miami with my infant one year-old and three year-old son since then,\" she told the BBC.\nShe said the family had been \"passed around from hotel to hotel\", but now hopes to be booked on a flight on Sunday.\nAn American Airlines spokesperson said it has been \"working around the clock to get customers on their way\" to Heathrow \"as quickly and efficiently as possible\", adding that it was providing overnight accommodation to passengers affected by the airport's closure.\nSubstations, operated by National Grid, are designed to produce, convert, and distribute electricity at suitable voltage levels. Heathrow uses three electricity substations, each with a backup.\nThere are also backup diesel generators, and uninterruptible battery-powered supplies which provide enough power to keep safety critical systems such as aircraft landing systems running.\nHowever, when the fire broke out the substation, it was out of action, along with its backup.\nHeathrow's main fall-back was the two remaining substations, but the airport's CEO, Thomas Woldbye, told the BBC that it \"takes time\" to \"switch them\".\nHe said the incident was \"not created at Heathrow Airport, it was created outside the airport and we had to deal with the consequences\".\nIn a statement released on Saturday evening, Mr Woldbye welcomed the investigation, saying that \"we will support every effort to understand the causes and impacts of yesterday's off-airport incident\".\nHeathrow's chairman Lord Paul Deighton said the airport regrets the disruption caused and hopes people affected \"understand that the decision was made in order to prioritise the safety of our passengers and colleagues\".\nHe added that the airport is \"committed to finding any potential learnings from this unprecedented incident\" when its review is conducted.\nAdditional reporting by Kris Bramwell.

        "article_text": "When Jane was told by someone she knew that there were nude photos of her on an image-sharing website, she was in complete shock.\nUsers had left crude and misogynistic comments under the photos. Some were urging the posters to upload more images of her.\n\"I couldn't believe it,\" Jane told the BBC. \"Men were getting sexual gratification from pictures of me that I hadn't consented to being shared.\"\nJane, whose name has been changed for this article, is one of more than a dozen women in the same area of England who had their social media accounts hacked two years ago.\nThe BBC understands all of them have had intimate images - which were originally sent in private direct messages on social media - posted on the same website.\nSome of the women's names have been posted alongside their photos. Two of the women were under 18 when the images were taken, meaning legally, they would also be classed as indecent images of children.\nJane later discovered some of the photos of the other women had also been posted on different sites too.\n\"It makes me feel very angry that somebody's taking ownership over content that I thought was mine and was sent privately,\" Jane said. \"I feel really exposed... It's disgusting.\"\nIt is a criminal offence to post intimate pictures of someone online without their consent, punishable with up to two years in prison.\nSome people colloquially refer to crimes of this nature as \"revenge porn\", even when the perpetrator is not a former partner and there's no revenge motive - but those affected prefer the term \"non-consensual image abuse\".\nJane is now calling on media regulator Ofcom to investigate using its powers under the Online Safety Act.\nThe law lists 130 \"priority offences\" that companies should focus on preventing, including the non-consensual posting of intimate images.\nEarlier this week, Ofcom was given new powers to crack down on illegal content. Tech companies will now have to ensure staff are prioritising taking down the material when alerted to it, and have systems in place that help them do that. \nCompanies that break the new rules could be fined up to \u00a318m.\nTessa Gregory, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, is representing Jane in her appeal to Ofcom.\nShe told the BBC that the Revenge Porn Helpline, which supports adults who experience intimate image abuse, helped Jane track down the images by carrying out reverse image searches online and contacting pornographic sites on her behalf.\nMs Gregory said she now wants Ofcom to \"take swift and decisive action\" against the sites.\nOfcom, she said, is supposed to make an announcement online when they begin an investigation.\n\"We're asking if they're already investigating this issue, because it seems so prevalent we would expect them to be, but we have found no evidence that they are,\" Ms Gregory said.\nShe added that she and Jane want Ofcom to take action not just against the sites hosting the images, but also against the search engines directing people to those sites.\nOfcom told the BBC it was aware of Jane's case and that it was \"considering any appropriate next steps\".\nIt added that it had \"a broad range of enforcement powers to hold tech firms accountable\" for carrying out their legal responsibilities under the Online Safety Act, and that it \"won't hesitate to use them where necessary\".\nInsiders at Ofcom told the BBC the regulator will prioritise sites based on various things, including reach and the risk they pose to people.\nThe Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which aims to eliminate child sexual abuse images online, launched a campaign last year called Think Before You Share. It educates young people about the potential pitfalls of sharing nude pictures, and how they can be posted elsewhere without their consent.\nEmma Hardy, from the IWF, told the BBC that often, by the time they found an image or video, it was \"already out of control\".\n\"It's already spread further than that trusted partnership, and it's being potentially sold online,\" she said. \"It's being harvested and collated in places where it's being made available for people with a sexual interest in that age or sex of person.\"\nJane worries that if action isn't taken quickly, her photos will continue to spread.\n\"I know somebody has those pictures saved on their computer, so I don't have any control of those images,\" she said. \"I think revenge porn and non-consensual image abuse grows arms and legs. You think they're gone, and then they can be posted in the future.\"\nBut she believes it's unrealistic to expect people not to privately share intimate photos of themselves - and that the onus should be on websites not to host them if they get stolen or leaked.\n\"I think it's a mistake to think people will never send nudes. Certain websites have a duty to protect your privacy.\n\"There needs to be a shift in mindset, and not blame the victim for sending the image in the first place. We thought it was private.\"\nIf you, or someone you know, has been affected by intimate image abuse, these organisations may be able to help.\nClarification: This story has been updated to clarify which sites Ofcom plans to prioritise.",

Check important info.\"\nNoyb says that is insufficient.\n\"You can't just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true,\" Noyb lawyer Joakim S\u00f6derberg said.\nHallucinations are one of the main problems computer scientists are trying to solve when it comes to generative AI. \nThese are when chatbots present false information as facts. \nEarlier this year, Apple suspended its Apple Intelligence news summary tool in the UK after it hallucinated false headlines and presented them as real news. \nGoogle's AI Gemini has also fallen foul of hallucination - last year it suggested sticking cheese to pizza using glue, and said geologists recommend humans eat one rock per day.\nIt is not clear what it is in the large language models - the tech which underpins chatbots - which causes these hallucinations.\n\"This is actually an area of active research. How do we construct these chains of reasoning? How do we explain what what is actually going on in a large language model?\" said Simone Stumpf, professor of responsible and interactive AI at the University of Glasgow.\nProf Stumpf says that can even apply to people who work behind the scenes on these types of models.\n\"Even if you are more involved in the development of these systems quite often, you do not know how they actually work, why they're coming up with this particular information that they came up with,\" she told the BBC. \nChatGPT has changed its model since Mr Holmen's search in August 2024, and now searches current news articles when it looks for relevant information.\nNoyb told the BBC Mr Holmen had made a number of searches that day, including putting his brother's name into the chatbot and it produced \"multiple different stories that were all incorrect.\"\nThey also acknowledged the previous searches could have influenced the answer about his children, but said large language models are a \"black box\" and OpenAI \"doesn't reply to access requests, which makes it impossible to find out more about what exact data is in the system.\"",

There was no communication from them until 11:00 and even this it was only that they could take us back on Monday, which would involve an eight hour stay at Heathrow.\n \"If you didn't want the flight you had to phone a number that took forever to get through, but I suspect it was a minor inconvenience compared to some.\"\nLess fortunate was Liz Steele, who missed her youngest son Paddy's graduation in Stirling on Friday.\nShe told BBC News: \"It was devastating. \n\"I know that there are people that have been affected much worse than this, but I've been to every other graduation that my kids have had, Masters and undergrads, and I just always thought that I would be there.\"\nHeathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye denied the incident - caused by a transformer catching fire within the North Hyde electrical substation - had made the airport a \"laughing stock\".\nHe told the BBC's Today programme: \"We have other substations but to switch them in takes time.\n\"The situation was not created at Heathrow Airport, it was created outside the airport and we had to deal with the consequences.\" \nA spokesperson for British Airways said around 85% of its services would be able to fly today.\nOn social media Heathrow Airport advised all passengers to check flights in advance before travelling.",

        "article_text": "Mike Johns didn't expect his return trip from Los Angeles to Scottsdale, Arizona in December to go viral.\nTo get to the airport he booked a driverless taxi and enjoyed a thrill when he jumped in with curious bystanders looking on.\nBut he got much more attention than he bargained for. \nMr Johns found himself being driven around and around a car park while those same bystanders looked on.\nThe Waymo ride was not doing what it should and there was no obvious way Mr Johns could fix it - and he had a flight to catch.\nMr Johns recorded the experience, a video that went viral almost immediately and was picked up on TV stations around the world, casting fresh public doubt about self-driving cars and how ready they are for real-world passengers.\n\"Why is this happening to me on a Monday morning?\" Mr Johns filmed himself asking.\nEventually a voice activated inside the car telling him to access the Waymo app to get the vehicle back under control.\nWaymo which is owned by Alphabet, the parent company of Google, told the BBC that it released a software update almost immediately fixing the problem.\nThe company says its driverless system is \"better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries, airbag deployments, and police reports\".\nNevertheless, Mr John's experience is not the first time the company has had to take action.\nLast year the company recalled more than 600 cars after one hit a street pole.\nAnd in May 2024 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched a probe into 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles .\nThe road to a driverless future has also gone awry for rival services.\nIn December, US car giant General Motors closed down its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise.\nGM attributed the change of strategy to \"the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business\".\nIn October 2023, one of its vehicles hit a pedestrian and dragged her for more than 20ft (6m), leaving her seriously injured.\nMeanwhile, in February of last year, it emerged that Apple's rumoured self-driving car project was folding.\nUber abandoned its own driverless car efforts in 2020. \nBut some big players remain in the race, including Zoox, which is owned by Amazon, as well as chipmaker Nvidia and Elon Musk's Tesla.\nWaymo is the leading US player though. It already operates self-driving taxis in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas and is promising to launch soon in Atlanta and Miami, Florida.\nSo why has Waymo succeeded where other efforts, at least in the US, have failed?\n\"Three things - people, money and process,\" says Sven Beiker, a lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and managing director of Silicon Valley Mobility, an automotive consultancy.\nHe points out that over the years Waymo has employed some of the leading figures in autonomous vehicle engineering, it has the financial weight of Google-owner Alphabet behind it, and has become thorough in its approach.\n\"They've come around to really playing by the book, to be a good steward of processes... working with regulators to make sure what they deploy is safe.\"\nSo what's next?\nRegions with good weather are likely to see driverless services first says Philipp Kampshoff, global co-leader of Automotive and Assembly Practice at the consultancy giant McKinsey.\nThat would include southern US states like Texas and Florida, where Waymo already has plans.\n\"Robo-taxis still operate much better in good weather conditions. They still, for the most part, struggle in heavy snow,\" Mr Kampshoff says.\nHe also points out that the batteries perform better in warmer conditions, which is particularly important for driverless cars that need a lot of energy to power on board computing.\n\"Bringing this all together, in the second part of the 2020s, you will see one city after the other being unlocked and then scaling within these cities,\" he says. \nIt will be a slow process. \n\"It's actually quite a labour intensive process to roll out this technology, which includes a fair amount of human driving,\" says Mr Beiker. \n\"You need to drive those vehicles through the streets where you want to deploy them, and you need to drive them over and over again, and you need to, to some extent, manually edit the data,\" he adds. \nAnd the whole process could also be held up by safety concerns. \n\"This is only going to happen if we're not running into major accidents. The moment major accidents are going to happen, a lot of these operations are going to be shut down,\" says Mr Kampshoff.\nFor those working on self-driving trucks, safety is arguably on even bigger worry.\n\"Safety is the number one concern that we work on,\" says David Liu, the chief executive of Plus, which makes driverless software for trucks and works with global companies such as Amazon, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Scania.\n\"Autonomous trucks and autonomous vehicles, need to be much safer than average human driven vehicle,\" says Mr Liu.\n\"Human drivers are great, but not flawless. Most of the accidents we get ourselves into are due to driver inattentiveness. And we don't have that issue with technology,\" Mr Liu explains.\n\"A robo-taxi mostly runs within cities in low-speed environments, while trucks are typically run on highways at higher speed.\n\"So we do need to put in different set of technology to be able to see more clearly around the trucks and be able to handle a longer braking distance, for instance.\"\nTo see into the driverless future it might be worth watching developments in China. \nIn the city of Wuhan more than 500 driverless cars are being operated by the company Baidu.\nAcross the country driverless cars are reported to be operating in 16 cities and being tested by 19 manufacturers.\n\"There's definitely more competition... there are four or five companies that are very similar to Waymo,\" says Mr Beiker who is currently working on a study of robo-taxi deployments around the world, sponsored by Sweden's innovation agency Vinnova.\nBack in Scottsdale, Mr Johns reflects on his experience and the rollout of autonomous vehicles.\n\"One big thing is that we're all a part of a paid experiment. At the end of the day, what they're doing is fixing it as they go, per city. And that's a problem.\"",

        "article_text": "Flights have resumed at Heathrow Airport, a day after a fire at a nearby electrical substation shut down operations at one of the world's major transport hubs.\nHeathrow, the UK's busiest airport, said on Saturday morning it was open and fully operational, however flight disruptions are expected to last days.\nBritish Airways estimated 85% of its planned flights would run on Saturday, but with delays throughout. As of 07:00 GMT the majority of departures had left as expected but of arrivals nine of the first 20 flights scheduled to land were cancelled. \nMore than 1,300 flights were affected on Friday, tracking website Flightradar24 said, and passengers were told not to travel to the airport unless their airline advised them to. \nNational Grid said that an \"interim solution\" had been found to allow power to be restored to customers including Heathrow Airport, saying that the network had been \"reconfigured to restore all customers impacted\".\nFirefighters worked throughout the day to bring the blaze at North Hyde substation in Hayes, west London, under control.\nHere's what we know so far.\nA fire at an electrical substation in west London, which supplies Heathrow, caused a major power outage at the airport, prompting its closure. \nIt is not yet known what caused the fire at the substation, but Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said there was no suggestion of foul play as counter-terrorism police investigate.\n\"The counter-terrorism command has specific capabilities and capacities that mean that they are used to conducting investigations at pace,\" she said, adding that they were needed as the fire took place next to a critical piece of national infrastructure.\nEmergency services were first called to Nestles Avenues in Hayes, west London at 23:23 GMT on Thursday. \nJonathan Smith,  London Fire Brigade (LFB) deputy commissioner, said the fire at the electrical substation involved a transformer containing 25,000 litres of cooling oil.\nThe fire was \"very visible and significant,\" he said. The LFB said the fire was under control by 06:28.\nOn Friday evening, the service said the fire was \"believed to be non-suspicious\" and the investigation will \"focus on the electrical distribution equipment\".\nCommander Simon Messinger, who is leading the Metropolitan Police's response to the fire, said: \"Various specialist investigators continue to examine the scene and it is expected to take some time before full assessments can be completed.\"\nBut he repeated that \"at this stage, there remains no indication of any foul play\".\nThe substation is about a mile and a half away from the airport. \nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the substation's back-up generator \"appears to have been knocked out\".\nVideos shared on social media showed tall flames and plumes of smoke billowing from the substation overnight. \nPeople living nearby were advised to keep doors and windows closed to avoid smoke inhalation. \nWith Heathrow being such a busy airport for passenger journeys and global trade, questions have been raised over whether it has back-up systems in the event of power cuts.\nThe BBC understands that Heathrow does have back-up power for its key systems, but kickstarting these alternative power supplies for the whole airport takes time.\nA source said it was not possible to switch the power back on immediately.\nA Heathrow source also told the BBC that they have \"multiple sources\" of energy at the airport \u2013 with diesel generators and \"uninterruptable power supplies\" in place.\nThey added that when the power outage happened the back-up systems \"all operated as expected\".\nThe systems, however, are not enough to run the whole airport \u2013 hence the decision to close it down.\nAnd even once the power is back on, there are countless systems which need to be rebooted and checked to ensure they are working properly and are stable.\nIt is unclear why Heathrow's own back-up systems were not adequate to keep the airport running when one critical component of its energy supply was knocked out, and it is also unclear why the National Grid transmission network was not set up to supply sufficient electricity.\nA Heathrow source said these questions would be investigated.\nThe first flights since the fire took off from and landed at Heathrow on Friday evening, with the airport initially saying it would prioritise repatriation and relocation of aircraft.\nHeathrow said the airport was \"open and fully operational\" on Saturday morning, however a number of flights were cancelled and disruptions were expected to last days.\nThe closure had knock-on effects at many other airports, as airlines cancelled and diverted flights.\nThe airport has apologised for the disruption and has advised passengers to contact their airlines for further information.\nIts helpline number is 020 8757 2700. \nLate on Friday, the Department for Transport said on X that restrictions on overnight flights at Heathrow had been temporarily lifted to ease congestion.\nOnly 5,800 flights are allowed to take off or land at Heathrow between 23:30 and 06:00 each year, under government restrictions designed to limit how much noise the airport makes at night.\nAt least 1,351 flights to and from Heathrow were affected on Friday, Flightradar24 said, with some 120 affected aircraft already in the air when the closure was announced.\nThe Foreign Office has advised UK citizens who are abroad and require urgent assistance to contact their teams via an online query form. \nAir Canada and United Airlines have announced they will be resuming some or all of their flights from Friday evening. Virgin Atlantic has said it hopes to operate \"a near full schedule\" on Saturday with limited cancellations, adding that it will continuously review flights.\nGatwick Airport told the BBC it was aware of the situation at Heathrow Airport and stands \"ready to support as required\".\nSeveral of Australia's Qantas airline planes have been diverted from London to Paris, with other flights likely to be affected, it said. \nBritish Airways has cancelled all its short-haul flights due to operate to and from the airport on Friday. \nSome long-haul flights - including to Cape Town, Johannesburg, Singapore and Rio de Janeiro - were later given clearance to depart from Heathrow from 1900 GMT and the airline said it was reviewing the fire's implications for Saturday's schedule and beyond.\nCathay Pacific, Hong Kong's main airline cancelled all its flights to London on Friday. \nThe Heathrow Express railway service said it was running a reduced service from Paddington to Heathrow.\nIn addition to passengers expecting to fly,  disruption has been caused to thousands of homes in west London, which have been left without power.\nAbout 150 people had to be evacuated from surrounding properties.\nMore than 16,300 homes lost power in a large-scale outage caused by the fire, energy supplier Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said.\n\"We're aware of a widespread power cut affecting many of our customers around the Hayes, Hounslow and surrounding areas,\" it added.\nNational Grid said on Friday afternoon the network had been \"reconfigured to restore all customers impacted, including the ability to resupply the parts of Heathrow airport that are connected to North Hyde\".\nMeanwhile, two nurseries and four schools in Hillingdon - the London borough Heathrow Airport is located in - are shut today.\nHillingdon Council are assisting 12 people who were evacuated from their homes by the emergency services with hotel accommodation.\nBin collections will also be impacted on Friday, the council warned.\nBus routes in the Hillingdon area have been affected and the M4 is closed between junction three and four, while the Terminal Four spur roads are also closed.\nNo injuries from the fire have been reported. \nCounter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan Police are now leading the investigation into the fire because of the location of the substation and the \"impact on critical national infrastructure\". \nIt added there was currently no indication of foul play but it is keeping \"an open mind\".\nLondon Fire Brigade said it was working closely with the Metropolitan Police.",

        "article_text": "Heather Knight led England to 134 wins from her 199 matches in charge\nConsidering the catastrophic nature of the Ashes defeat at the beginning of the year, it was inevitable that England would be starting the summer of 2025 with a new coach and captain. \nBut this is unfamiliar territory. \nSince 2000, England have only had three permanent women's captains and all three could still be playing a huge role in the next era. \nClare Connor is the current managing director of women's cricket and will therefore oversee the process of appointing the next leader, Charlotte Edwards is a candidate to become the next coach and Heather Knight, who has fulfilled the job for the past nine years before she was sacked on Saturday, will likely return to the batting ranks. \nKnight's era of captaincy is one which started under the immense pressure of filling the shoes of an all-time great in Edwards, delivered a World Cup win just a year after her appointment and throughout it all, she was tasked with bridging the amateur generation with the professional. \nBut it came to a cruel end - a 16-0 humiliation at the hands of their greatest rivals, where she had to continuously fight back the emotions after each difficult interview and stand on the vast Melbourne Cricket Ground outfield to watch Australia's triumphant celebrations as her own side had unravelled.\nAnd while it should not be defined by the most recent thrashing, it has been a turning point with head coach Jon Lewis also making way on Friday. \nProfessional sport is merciless, and Ashes defeats usually more so than most. \nSo England's slate is wiped clean, and Knight's too - she has stated her desire to continue playing and if she can rediscover the spark that was dimmed by Australia, she will be a valuable asset to the next captain, hopefully channelling Joe Root's run-scoring feats since he relinquished the men's Test leadership. \nKnight sacked as England captain after Ashes thrashing\nWhat next for England after Lewis' sacking?\nIn some ways, ending the captaincy on 199 matches in charge feels fitting to summarise Knight's captaincy. \nAn immense achievement of longevity, desire and determination - but also falling just short. \nThe scenes at Lord's in July 2017, when England beat India by nine runs to win the 50-over World Cup, promised so much. \nKnight had delivered success immediately with then-coach Mark Robinson, who had made the ruthless call a year earlier to move on from Edwards and breed the next generation. \nBut ultimately, there has been little progress since then - the wait for another World Cup or an Ashes win is now up to eight years, despite all of the increased investment into England's domestic structure, The Hundred, and the franchise opportunities for players all over the world.  \nOf course, Knight is not to blame for all of that. As captain, she has averaged just shy of 58 in Tests, 37.10 in one-day internationals and 30.19 in T20s, and became the first woman in international cricket to score a century in all three formats.\nShe is also not only defined by the on-field contributions. Knight has always led from the front with her professionalism, her work ethic and her relations with the media, stepping up to answer difficult questions after defeats and has never shied away from advocating for women's rights in the game. \nBefore the start of day one of the Ashes Test match last month, amid all of the ongoing chaos with her team and the speculation about her own future, Knight was at Melbourne's Junction Oval to support Afghanistan's female cricketers play their historic exhibition match, having previously called on the International Cricket Council (ICC) to provide more support for them. \nThere was the charge from the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) in September 2024, where Knight was fined for being pictured in blackface when she was 21.\nKnight admitted the charge and apologised, saying she had learned from the past and the CDC found there was \"no racist intent\".\nFormer England bowler and current Test Match Special commentator Isa Guha said Knight had been \"brilliant with people, selfless, resilient and accountable\". \nIt may have come to an abrupt and difficult end, but England need to get back to winning ways, and Knight has left enormous shoes to fill in all aspects. \nThis is the biggest question of all. \nKnight's steady, reassuring presence at the helm has been a double-edged sword, and the management's lack of succession planning is now coming back to haunt them at a very tricky time. \nThey have until 21 May to appoint a new coach and captain in time for the white-ball series against West Indies, which is followed by India's arrival at the end of June, before a potentially very difficult 50-over World Cup in India at the end of the summer. \nBut there is no excuse. England have had nine years to plan for the future, and they have not done it.\nConsider the seamless transition from Alyssa Healy to Tahlia McGrath when the former injured her calf before the first Ashes T20, and the likes of Phoebe Litchfield, Annabel Sutherland and Ash Gardner who all appear to be competent, future candidates. \nNat Sciver-Brunt seems the most likely successor considering she has been Knight's deputy and stated her desire to fulfil the role during the Ashes, but England imploded under her leadership during the Commonwealth Games when Knight was injured, and the same happened during last year's shambolic T20 World Cup group-stage exit. \nEngland also need to be wary of adding any more to Sciver-Brunt's workload where she already carries the batting line-up and is one of the most experienced bowlers, and is soon to become a mother for the first time.\nAmy Jones is another who has deputised for Knight in the past but admitted the role did not come naturally to her, which makes her return unlikely, while other senior players in Kate Cross and Tammy Beaumont do not play all formats. \nOff-spinner Charlie Dean has been earmarked as a future England captain for the past couple of years but has yet to be given an opportunity. \nSophie Ecclestone, the world's best bowler, is another outside contender having had leadership experience with Manchester Originals in The Hundred, but her refusal to be interviewed by former team-mate and now pundit Alex Hartley during the Ashes led to unwanted headlines and attention on England's team culture and perception.\n\"There isn't a standout candidate to take over - that has been one of the biggest downfalls of the past five or six years,\" Hartley told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"They need a really strong coach moving forward, someone who can get the culture right and they can control the group and sort out the problems within the changing room and then the captain can come in and have strong ideas and work alongside the coach. \n\"I want a young person, a fresh person, someone like Charlie Dean - I think she'd be an exceptional leader who will play for England for a number of years.\"\nA nine-year tenure is unlikely to be repeated again, but with Knight still in the dressing room, there is nobody better for the new leader to learn from. \nA new era begins here.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Repeated failures in how CTs, X-rays and other medical scans are being interpreted are leading to avoidable patient deaths and delays in diagnosing cancer, England's health ombudsman has warned. \nThe most common problems include doctors failing to spot abnormalities, scans being delayed or not carried out, and results not being followed up properly.\nThe ombudsman has upheld or partially upheld 45 cases which include failures in medical imaging in the last four years, and says lessons must be learned to avoid the same mistakes again. \nNHS England said staff work extremely hard to keep patients safe but acknowledged there was more to do to improve the \"response to serious health issues\".\nIn one case, medical staff at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough repeatedly failed to diagnose an 82-year-old man with bowel cancer and left him suffering prolonged pain, according to the parliamentary and health service ombudsman (PHSO).\nThe man, from Buckinghamshire, went to A&E five times between August and October 2021. \nA scan taken in August showed a lesion in the bowel.\nHowever, clinicians reported no abnormalities, the investigation found, leading to a six-week delay in diagnosis and surgery.\nThe patient also had an X-ray in October that suggested an obstruction in his small bowel, but this X-ray was not reviewed and he was discharged and sent home. \nLater that month the cancer was diagnosed and he had an operation to remove part of the bowel. The surgery uncovered another mass elsewhere in his body. \nJust months later, the man took his life, leaving a note saying he could no longer deal with the pain. \nThe ombudsman, Rebecca Hilsenrath KC, said staff failed to manage his pain on five occasions. \nFailings in his care \"were probably contributory factors to the patient's decision to end his life\", her report suggests. \nThe man's daughter said: \"I really tried to get the doctors to listen. \n\"I had a feeling something was wrong and I pleaded numerous times for them to keep him in the hospital, but they just kept discharging him and not doing anything to help him.\"\nA statement provided by the hospital trust says: \"We are very sorry for our failing in care in this case and we have a further meeting with the patient's family shortly to update them on the changes we have since made. \n\"This includes ensuring that older patients presenting with abdominal pain are appropriately reviewed.\"\nThe trust has also agreed to pay the family \u00a34,000, as recommended by PHSO. \nIn another investigation, the ombudsman found a cancerous tumour was incorrectly identified as benign (non-cancerous) - despite repeated scans suggesting otherwise. \nThe patient, a 54-year-old man, had his first scan in Tenerife, after becoming unwell on holiday. \nHis brother said: \"When my brother collapsed in Tenerife, the hospital immediately identified the tumour for what it was [an aggressive brain tumour] and even offered to remove it. \n\"But my brother wanted to come home, he thought the best place for him to have the treatment was in the NHS.\"\nThe man returned to Gillingham, where the local hospital carried out further scans identifying the tumour, and referred him to specialists at King's College Hospital.\nHowever, staff there \"downgraded the diagnosis\", saying the tumour was not cancerous. The man was not offered chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\nHe died in hospital, a month after an operation to remove the tumour, which was confirmed to be cancerous.\nIf the cancer had been identified correctly, he could have had surgery months earlier and potentially the option of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, PHSO said.\nWhile the survival rate for this cancer is poor, the ombudsman's investigation suggests the man may have had a few extra months of life.\nHis brother said: \"I wanted King's College Hospital to acknowledge their mistakes so that I can stop picking at the scab of trying to understand what happened to him and remember my brother as he was when he was alive.\"\nIn a statement, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: \"We fully recognise that errors were made in this patient's care, and we apologised to his family at the time of the incident.\n\"Learning from mistakes when they occur is crucial, and we have made a number of changes as a result of this case to improve the safety and effectiveness of the care our teams provide.\"\nThe trust has agreed to pay the family \u00a33,500. \nMs Hilsenrath, whose team independently investigates complaints, said: \"Each of the cases we have investigated and upheld represent a real person whose life has been impacted by failings in care. \n\"They are also all instances where the organisations involved failed to identify that anything had gone wrong\"\nThe 2021 ombudsman report into medical imaging issues recommended system-wide improvements, but Ms Hilsenrath said while there had been some progress, she was still seeing instances where people's care was \"sub-optimal, often with devastating consequences\".\nIt is \"critical\" that action is taken to improve the digital infrastructure in the NHS and ensure people are diagnosed and treated swiftly, she added.\nDr Katharine Halliday, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, agreed digital infrastructure needed improvements. \n\"The ombudsman highlights some devastating failures in the NHS, and we must collectively learn from these experiences to drive meaningful change,\" she said. \n\"However, it must also be recognised that these findings reflect a system that is overburdened and under-resourced.\"\nThe college says it faces a 30% shortfall of clinical radiologists, which is projected to rise to 40% by 2028. \nAn NHS spokesperson said: \"The NHS had delivered a record number of tests and checks in 2024, a fifth more than pre-pandemic but we know there is more to do to improve the recognition and response of serious health issues.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"Our deepest sympathies are with all those who have been affected by the failings highlighted in this shocking report.\"\nThe spokesperson added that they were opening more Community Diagnostic Centres (CDCs), and using new technology like AI so \"all patients can receive world-class care\".\nChanges were also being introduced in cancer care, the spokesperson said, which would see 100,000 more patients who are referred receiving a diagnosis within four weeks and up to 19,000 more people starting their treatment within two months each year.",

        "article_text": "Thomas Tuchel praised goalscoring debutant Myles Lewis-Skelly's performance\nEngland started the Thomas Tuchel era with a 2-0 victory over Albania in World Cup qualifying.\nTeenager Myles Lewis-Skelly scored on his senior international debut before captain Harry Kane netted his 70th England goal to seal the win.\nBBC Sport takes a look at some of the talking points from the game.\nFirst impressions of 'low-key' Tuchel & his England team\nWho 'didn't show enough' against Albania? How England's players rated\n'He does everything right' - the remarkable rise of Lewis-Skelly\nThis average positions graphic shows how high England played against a defensive opponent (England are black and Albania are purple)\nBefore the game Tuchel created plenty of headlines when he said England looked like they had played with fear at Euro 2024 under his predecessor Gareth Southgate.\nHe also suggested he wanted them to play Premier League-style physical football.\nKnown for his tactical flexibility, nobody was quite certain what formation Tuchel would opt for - but he sent England out in a 4-2-3-1.\nWhile Tuchel's teams are normally known for their intensity and pressing, it was hard for England to show either against a team who set up as defensively as Albania, especially in the first half.\nAnd the German is also still in the early stages of his reign - having only met his players four days ago for the first time since officially taking over in January.\n\"Thomas Tuchel's had the squad for three days - you can't expect to see a different England team,\" said former Three Lions midfielder Leon Osman on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"We won the football match. Once we got ahead there was no urgency. \n\"We want to be entertained. There is a certain element of control which is good in tournament football.\n\"At the minute we're not in a tournament, we want to be entertained.\"\nEngland had 74% of the ball and 12 shots to Albania's three - with the hosts recording all six efforts on target in the game.\nIn the opening 45 minutes they completed 437 passes, the most on Opta's records of any England first half.\nThe visitors did try to play more after the break, but England's backline were only tested a few times by substitute Armando Broja. \nThe result itself was routine - new England manager or not. The Three Lions are unbeaten in 38 home qualifiers for World Cups or Euros since November 2007, with 34 wins. \n\"It was a difficult game from a spectating perspective,\" said former England defender Matt Upson on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Once we got into the rhythm, it was very much an England game at Wembley against inferior opposition where they struggled to break them down.\n\"We are all wanting to see how Thomas Tuchel's plan is going to happen.\n\"There are so many questions, but ultimately they have to manage the game itself and England did that well.\"\nUpson added that Tuchel probably learned to \"understand what it feels like and looks like tactically\" to play against a team in a low block like Albania's.\nJust a few months ago, Arsenal left-back Lewis-Skelly, 18, would barely have been on England's radar. He had not played a senior professional game until after the September international break.\nBut he has broken into Arsenal's first team, scored against Manchester City and been sent off twice (although one was overturned) in 26 games - and now firmly established himself as a Gunners regular.\n\"It doesn't get much better,\" said former Arsenal centre-back Upson.\n\"The opportunity has fallen to him, the timing has been great. The amount of injuries Arsenal had got him in the team.\n\"Those doors have opened, but he has had to grab those opportunities. He looks to be a top player.\"\nTuchel gave him a chance for England and he took it with both hands.\nIn a prime example of the modern full-back role, Lewis-Skelly was front-footed, cutting into central midfield and popping up in the box.\nAnd he got the opening goal when he appeared in the Albania area to score through Thomas Strakosha's legs from Jude Bellingham's fantastic through ball.\nThat made him the third-youngest England goalscorer ever - and youngest to net on his debut.\nMyles Lewis-Skelly had more touches in Albania's half than his own\n\"In the second half he played as a number eight or a number 10,\" said Tuchel. \n\"His very best position is where he plays for Arsenal in the double six. \n\"We tried to play a bit more conventional today as it's easier to learn because we have many players from many different clubs, but he understands very quickly.\"\nLewis-Skelly left the pitch to an ovation in the final minute.\nEngland tried three different left-backs in their final three Nations League games - Lewis Hall, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Rico Lewis - but Lewis-Skelly will hope to make the position his own.\nUpson said: \"He was absolutely superb. To manage and handle that occasion in the manner he did with the very limited senior football he has had... really speaks volumes about how good a player he is and how far he can go. It was a brilliant evening for him.\n\"When you look at the competition for that position, Lewis Hall is probably the closest. You can see a little battle between the two of them for the left-back slot. That was a big moment for Lewis-Skelly tonight to try to cement himself in Thomas Tuchel's mind for that role.\"\nEx-Everton player Osman added: \"He was dead relaxed, but he wasn't tested defensively.\n\"To secure the position he will have to show he can stand up defensively.\"\nDan Burn went close to his second Wembley headed goal in a week\nCentre-back Burn is at the other end of the spectrum when it comes to England debuts.\nThis was the 32-year-old's first appearance for England at any age level. In fact he was the oldest Three Lions debutant since Kevin Davies in 2010.\nIt came in what is undoubtedly the best week of the 6ft 7in defender's career.\nOn Sunday, also at Wembley, he headed his boyhood club Newcastle ahead against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final as they won 2-1 to lift a first trophy in 56 years.\nThe following day he joined up with England.\nHe was given an immediate debut by Tuchel - and did well.\nBurn became the first England debutant to make 100 or more passes on Opta's record - and ended up completing 135 from 137.\nHe made more clearances (seven), won more tackles (two) and won more aerial duels (four) than any other Three Lions player.\nPlus he managed to hit both crossbars, turning a clearance against his own woodwork before later heading Declan Rice's corner on to the bar.\nUpson said: \"He was excellent in the first half, looked very good but didn't have much to deal with defensively. He showed his threat from set-pieces.\"\nHowever, there were a few moments where he was caught out, especially when Broja came on.\nMarc Guehi, who was one of England's best players at Euro 2024, watched on from the bench with Ezri Konsa starting alongside Burn.\n\"There were a couple of moments in the second half where Burn got hurt in behind, got a bit tight and spun,\" said Upson. \"His partnership with Konsa was excellent.\n\"Konsa's performance was very assured and showed he's really developed in the last six months. Playing in the Champions League with Aston Villa has brought him on to the next level. \n\"Burn has moments of impact but I thought Konsa is probably best placed to keep his spot.\"\nRejection, non-league and pushing trolleys: Burn's rise to England\n'I don't want to go to sleep because I feel like I'm dreaming'\nEngland wingers Phil Foden and Marcus Rashford both failed to set the game alight.\nManchester United forward Rashford, on loan at Villa, was given his first England chance in a year after rediscovering his form under Unai Emery.\nHe showed a few good touches, especially early on, but failed to create much.\nManchester City's Foden had a similar experience on the right-hand side. \nThey were both replaced, along with Liverpool midfielder Curtis Jones, in the 74th minute.\n\"Both of our wingers that started were not as impactful as they can be or as they are in club football,\" said Tuchel.\n\"At the moment I'm not so sure why we struggled to bring the ball quicker to them.\n\"They trained very well, they were decisive in training which is why they deserved it. They were very good in the last weeks in their clubs. \n\"We will keep encouraging them and give them a structure so they can show their potential.\"\nUpson said: \"Foden wants to come inside. He's not the type of out-and-out winger which Tuchel wants to play.\n\"He wants a fast-paced aggressive style - to go at teams. Foden is more of a footballer who likes to come to feet and open things up that way. \n\"Rashford showed willingness and he has that speed but didn't quite find the end product tonight. \n\"He was looking not to lose the ball instead of taking a risk. It's an area that will be tinkered with in games to come.\"\nHarry Kane is now 17 goals clear of Wayne Rooney's previous England goalscoring record\nCaptain Kane is England's all-time leading scorer by some way - and he netted his 70th international goal on Friday.\nIt came after a fine bit of control to take down Rice's cross before he passed the ball into the bottom corner.\nKane is the first England player to score on his first appearance under three different managers - Roy Hodgson, Gareth Southgate and Tuchel.\n\"Typical Kane,\" said Upson. \"He didn't get much action for quite long periods but a couple of his passes were superb. He drops deeps and clips those balls over the top. \n\"His finish was really high level. The first touch and movement and to find that bottom corner was excellent. Very much a Kane-type performance. \n\"He would probably want to be involved in the game a bit more in the build-up.

Born to Greek parents in Genk, Karetsas joined their academy and quickly accelerated through the ranks to make his first-team debut at the end of last season as a 16-year-old substitute against Cercle Brugge. He started for the first time in a win over Royal Antwerp two weeks later.\nThis season, he has been a first-team regular, starting 14 and coming on in another 11 games, mainly as an attacking midfielder and helping Genk to the top of the Jupiler Pro League.\nKaretsas represented Belgium at youth level, playing for their under-21s as recently as November.\nBut, as Greek journalist Stephen Kountourou explained on BBC Scotland's Daily Football Podcast, there was a wrangle going on behind the scenes.\n\"We had to fight tooth and nail with the Belgian FA to stop him representing them and that was seen as a big coup for Greek football, because Karetsas is rated not just as a potentially decent talented player but as one of the big players for the future in international football,\" he said.\nFor Karetsas, whose idols include Neymar and Ronaldinho, there seemed to be little doubt as to whom he would represent at senior level.\n\"My heart beats only for Greece - my homeland fulfils me completely,\" he was quoted as saying.\nHe was warmly welcomed into the fold by the Greek fans on Thursday and his performance was so impressive BBC Scotland's co-commentator James McFadden fully expects him to start at Hampden.\n\"I thought he looked really classy, composed, willing to take people on and, when he came on, he was their main outlet,\" he said. \"They were just desperate to get the ball to him, so I think he comes straight into the team.\"\nPat Nevin, working at the game for BBC Radio Scotland and Five Live, was similarly impressed.\n\"I thought he made a huge difference, probably the main reason the game changed massively in the second half,\" the former Scotland winger added.\n\"Chatting to Steve Clarke afterwards, he agreed the young lad is pretty special and somebody that needs to be kept a really close eye on.\"\nKaretsas himself clearly does not lack confidence.\n\"Already, I feel like I belong in the national team. I'm really happy I made the decision to be here,\" he said afterwards.\n\"I was up against Andy Robertson. He is a very good player, but when I go one on one, I don't see who's in front of me.\n\"We lost, but we played well in the second half and that is how we have to play on Sunday in Scotland. I think, if we play like that, we will win.\"\nTrying to ensure that does not happen will be Craig Gordon, who acknowledged the threat his young adversary posed.\n\"He looked fantastic when he came on,\" said the Hearts goalkeeper. \"He's someone we'll need to look out for in the second leg.\n\"I haven't seen many debuts like that from someone so young. It was an impressive first cap for him, but thankfully we managed to keep him out.\n\"We'll see what Sunday brings and he might get more minutes at Hampden. But I'm sure we'll have a plan to deal with that as well.\"\nMcFadden does not believe head coach Clarke will adapt his gameplan to deal with the teenager.\n\"I think you respect the fact he's a very good player, but it's Andy Robertson that's going to be playing against him,\" McFadden said. \n\"I think if you said to him, 'I'm going to get someone to help you with this young player', I don't think he'd be too happy.\"\nNevin added: \"I think he'll consider it, because if you don't consider it and he has a great game, you've made a mistake.\n\"I think it's more, don't change your entire attitude but be very aware, if it starts being a problem, you can adapt to it.\"",

        "article_text": "When Rebecca, a 48-year-old mother from Michigan, needed help for her disabled son, she turned to the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights.\nRebecca's 13-year-old adopted son had foetal alcohol syndrome, ADHD, and other mental health diagnoses that required specialised educational support. His symptoms could include aggression towards peers, faculty or objects, and he received suspensions last fall following outbursts.\nRebecca said the school district isolated her son from his peers for months, with only special education teachers and limited faculty for contact.\nIn October 2024, Rebecca filed a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights alleging the school violated federal disability law and her son had been \"discriminated against and denied a free appropriate public education\". She alleged the school only allowed him to \"attend school for two hours per school day and in a 1:1 segregated setting\". Hours were gradually added back, Rebecca said, but he remained isolated. The school district did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThough Rebecca had a private lawyer and an education advocate, an OCR lawyer in the Cleveland office was facilitating mediation with the school district as soon as April.\nBut before that could happen, the Trump administration fired the Cleveland office's entire staff, including the attorney helping Rebecca's son, throwing her case - and others like it - into limbo. \n\"I don't have any other option for this kid,\" said Rebecca, who asked the BBC to withhold her last name and her son's name to protect his privacy. \"They're playing politics with my little boy. And I don't think that's fair.\"\nThe sudden firings, and ensuing confusion, were precursors of President Donald Trump's next big move: to try and dismantle the Department of Education entirely.\nOn Thursday, he signed an executive order that directed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin to \"facilitate the closure\" of the department. Congress, not the president, actually holds the power to dismantle a federal agency, and the order will likely spark legal challenges. \nBut the move has left many Americans like Rebecca uncertain about their children's future.\n\nPress Secretary Karoline Leavitt told media on Thursday that while the department will not be shut down completely, what will remain will be much smaller, and will focus on \"critical functions,\" such as federal student loans.\nOCR, she said, will be greatly reduced in \"scale and the size\".\nCuts have already begun: On 11 March, the Trump administration made drastic cuts to the department using a process known as a reduction in force, halving its staff. \nMcMahon said the downsizing showed a \"commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers.\"\nAlthough the Department of Education has little oversight over the day to day operations of most schools in the US, it plays a key role in enforcing federal education guidelines and policies.\nThe Office for Civil Rights was one of the hardest hit divisions in that first round of firings. The administration shuttered 7 of the 12 regional offices, including major metropolitan areas like New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco. \nThis month, as Rebecca and her husband tried to figure out what the changes at the department meant for their son's case, the entire staff at OCR's Cleveland office received an email that their unit was \"being abolished\" \u2013 along with their positions.\nThe news left one Cleveland attorney who works on disability cases with a \"complete feeling of desperation.\"\nThe attorney worried not only about the individual cases still underway, they told the BBC.\n\"The effect of each individual case is sometimes much bigger, in terms of educating the school and making good for the others in the district,\" said the attorney, who requested anonymity because they feared retaliation from the administration. \nParents and OCR attorneys had long been frustrated with the agency's growing backlog and diminishing staff. They fear new cuts will make it impossible for the already overwhelmed division to handle the tens of thousands of complaints it receives each year.\nTasked with making sure schools are following America's civil rights laws, the OCR's job is to help ensure that students are not discriminated against because of their disability, sex, race or religion. Remedies the office helps institute could be as straightforward as adding accessibility features to school buildings or seating a near-sighted child at the front of the class. But the office also tackles complex cases involving discrimination or bullying, as well as sexual harassment and assault.\nBefore his executive order, there were already signs that the office's mission was changing. \nOCR staff had received guidance for the office to prioritise cases involving antisemitisim, the AP reported. Craig Trainor, the department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, has said they will take on cases involving transgender athletes at universities in order to combat \"radical transgender ideology\".\nOn 14 March, the Department of Education said it had launched investigations into more than 50 universities as part of the administration's move to end diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, which it views as exclusionary. \nStaffers who remained in their jobs said the Department of Education's new leadership had provided little to no guidance about how thousands of pending cases, including Rebecca's, would be reassigned. They also worried that cases involving racial minorities, or people with disabilities, will not receive the appropriate attention.\nThe office received a record 22,687 complaints in fiscal year 2024, according to OCR's annual report. Headcount had declined even as cases increased over the years. In 1981, OCR had 1,100 full time employees. By 2024, it was down to 588.\n\"We were already so incredibly flooded with cases,\" the Cleveland attorney said. \"I was never proud of our processing time.\"\nWith the new cuts, they said, \"this work will not be able to be done\".\nBut parents and educators say they will not let the Department of Education be shut down without a fight. Nikki Carter, a mother and disability advocate in Alabama, is one of two plaintiffs in a lawsuit brought by the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, which is suing the Department of Education, McMahon, and Trainor over the mass job cuts.\nThe lawsuit alleges that McMahon's actions have stalled Ms Carter's racial discrimination case that was being handled by the OCR and she \"has received no indication that the investigation has resumed\".\n\"There was a lack of communication throughout the entirety of the process,\" Ms Carter told the BBC. \"When the Trump administration came in, it made that situation even worse and even more difficult.\"\nDespite her frustrations with OCR, she believed the office was still necessary to help victims of racial discrimination. She hoped the lawsuit would not only restore the office, but improve it.\n\"Children, family, as well as advocates, they don't get due process,\" Ms Carter said. \"They are being denied just basic federal educational rights. And so when you can't get that on the local and state level, the only hope that we have is to turn to the federal government.\n\"We do need OCR to go back to work,\" she said. \"And we also need OCR to be accountable for their actions \u2013 or lack thereof.\"\nMeanwhile, Rebecca has transferred her son to a district school for students with emotional impairments. But she still wants OCR to negotiate special tutoring for her son, and to educate the district staff about how to help students like him. She recently learned her son's case would transfer to the still-operating Denver office, but has received no other updates.\n\"He was treated so poorly and differently because of the way his brain was structured,\" she said. \"I want to see somebody held accountable for the way he was treated.\" ",

        "summary": "The school district did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Though Rebecca had a private lawyer and an education advocate, an OCR lawyer in the Cleveland office was facilitating mediation with the school district as soon as April.But before that could happen, the Trump administration fired the Cleveland office's entire staff, including the attorney helping Rebecca's son, throwing her case - and others like it - into limbo. His symptoms could include aggression towards peers, faculty or objects, and he received suspensions last fall following outbursts.Rebecca said the school district isolated her son from his peers for months, with only special education teachers and limited faculty for contact.In October 2024, Rebecca filed a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights alleging the school violated federal disability law and her son had been \"discriminated against and denied a free appropriate public education\". 'They're playing politics with my little boy': What Department of Education cuts mean for one mum3 hours agoShareSaveKayla EpsteinBBC NewsShareSaveGetty ImagesThe Department of Education headquarters in Washington, DCWhen Rebecca, a 48-year-old mother from Michigan, needed help for her disabled son, she turned to the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights.Rebecca's 13-year-old adopted son had foetal alcohol syndrome, ADHD, and other mental health diagnoses that required specialised educational support. Staffers who remained in their jobs said the Department of Education's new leadership had provided little to no guidance about how thousands of pending cases, including Rebecca's, would be reassigned. This month, as Rebecca and her husband tried to figure out what the changes at the department meant for their son's case, the entire staff at OCR's Cleveland office received an email that their unit was \"being abolished\" \u2013 along with their positions.The news left one Cleveland attorney who works on disability cases with a \"complete feeling of desperation.",

        "article_text": "Scenes playing out in Nigeria during holiday periods could be in a movie: emotional reunions at airport terminals, champagne flowing like water in high-end clubs and A-list Afrobeats performers dominating stages to packed audiences nationwide.\nThis is when Nigerians abroad return for a visit to the home country. They are nicknamed I Just Got Back (IJGB) and bring with them more than full suitcases.\nTheir Western accents dip in and out of Pidgin, their wallets are boosted by the exchange rate, and their presence fuels the economy.\nBut it also highlights an uncomfortable truth.\nThose who live in Nigeria, earning in the local naira currency, feel shut out of their own cities, especially in the economic hub of Lagos and the capital, Abuja, as prices go up during festive periods.\nResidents say this is particularly the case for \"Detty December\", a term used to refer the celebrations around Christmas and New Year.\nDetty December makes Lagos almost unliveable for locals - traffic is horrible, prices inflate and businesses stop prioritising their regular customers, a radio presenter based in Lagos tells the BBC.\nThe popular media personality asked not to be named for voicing what some might consider controversial opinions.\nBut he is not the only one to hold these views and has some are pondering, with Easter and the diaspora summer holiday season approaching, whether the IJGBs are helping bridge Nigeria's class divide or are making it even wider.\n\"Nigeria is very classist. Ironically, we're a poor country, so it's a bit silly,\" the radio presenter adds.\n\"The wealth gap is massive. It's almost like we're worlds apart.\"\nIt is true that despite oil-rich Nigeria being one of Africa's biggest economies and the continent's most populous country, its more than 230 million citizens face huge challenges and limited opportunities.\nAt the beginning of the year, the charity Oxfam warned the wealth gap in Nigeria was reaching a \"crisis level\".\nStatistics from 2023 are startling. \nAccording to the World Inequality Database more than 10% of the population owned more than 60% of Nigeria's wealth. For those with jobs, 10% of the population took home 42% of the income.\nThe World Bank says the figure of those living below the poverty line is 87 million - \"the world's second-largest poor population after India\". \nMartins Ifeanacho, professor of sociology at the University of Port Harcourt, says this gap and resulting class divide has grown since Nigeria's independence from the UK in 1960.\n\"We've gone through so much economic hardship,\" the academic, who returned to Nigeria after studying in Ireland in the 1990s, tells the BBC.\nHe points the finger at the greed of those who are in position of political power - be it at a federal or state level.\n\"We have a political elite that bases its calculations on how to acquire power, amass wealth for the purpose of capturing more power.\n\"The ordinary people are left out of the equation, and that's why there is a lot of hardship.\"\nBut it is not just about money in the bank account.\nWealth, real or perceived, can dictate access, status and opportunity - and the presence of the diaspora can magnify the class divide.\n\"Nigeria's class system is hard to pinpoint. It's not just about money, it's about perception,\" explains the radio presenter.\nHe gives the example of going out for a meal in Lagos and how peacocking is so important.\nAt restaurants, those arriving in a Range Rover are quickly attended to, while those in a Kia may be ignored, says the radio presenter.\nSocial mobility is difficult when the nation's wealth remains within a small elite.\nWith odds stacked against those trying to climb the ladder, for many Nigerians the only realistic path to a better life is to leave.\nThe World Bank blames \"weak job creation and entrepreneurial prospects\" that stifle the absorption of \"the 3.5 million Nigerians entering the labour force every year\".\n\"Many workers choose to emigrate in search of better opportunities,\" it says.\nSince the 1980s, middle-class Nigerians have sought opportunities abroad, but in recent years, the urgency has intensified, especially among Gen Z and millennials.\nThis mass exodus has been dubbed \"japa\", a Yoruba word meaning \"to escape\".\nA 2022 survey found that at least 70% of young Nigerians would relocate if they could.\nBut for many, leaving is not simple. Studying abroad, the most common route, can cost tens of thousands of dollars, not including travel, accommodation and visa expenses.\n\"Japa creates this aspirational culture where people now want to leave the country,\" says Lulu Okwara, a 28-year-old recruitment officer.\nShe went the UK to study finance in 2021 - and is one of the IJGBs, having returned to Nigeria at least three times since moving.\nMs Okwara notes that in Nigeria there is a pressure to succeed. A culture where achievement is expected.\n\"It's success or nothing,\" she tells the BBC. \"There is no room for failure.\"\nThis deeply embedded sentiment makes people feel they must do anything to succeed.\nEspecially for those who come from more working-class backgrounds. The IJGBs have a point to prove.\n\"When people go out there, their dream is always to come back as heroes, mostly during Christmas or other festivities,\" says Prof Ifeanacho.\n\"You come back home and you mix with your people that you've missed for a long time.\n\"The type of welcome they will give to you, the children that will be running to you, is something that you love and cherish.\"\nSuccess is chased at any cost and putting on a foreign accent can help you climb Nigeria's social ladder - even if you have not been abroad.\n\"People fake accents to get access. The more you sound British, the higher your social status,\" says Prof Ifeanacho.\nHe recalls a story about a pastor who preached every Sunday on the radio.\n\"When they told me that this man had not left Nigeria, I said, 'No, that's not possible.' Because when you hear him speak, everything is American,\" he says in disbelief.\nAmerican and British accents, especially, act as a different kind of currency, smoothing paths in both professional and social settings.\nPushback on social media suggests some IJGBs are all front - they may lap up the returning hero adulation but in fact lack financial clout.\nBizzle Osikoya, the owner at The Plug Entertainment, a business that hosts live music events in West Africa, says he has encountered some issues that reflect this.\nHe tells the BBC about how several IJGBs have attended his events - but who have gone on to try and get their money back.\n\"They went back to the US and Canada and put a dispute on their payments,\" he says.\nThis may reflect the desperate effort to maintain a fa\u00e7ade of success in a society where every display of wealth is scrutinised.\nIn Nigeria, it seems, performance is key - and the IJGBs who are able to show off will certainly be able to climb the class ladder.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Oscar (left) joined Shanghai Port from Chelsea for a reported \u00a360m in January 2017\nWhen China's president, Xi Jinping, visited Manchester in October 2015, there followed a bizarre photo opportunity and a bold statement.\nThe former was an image of two global leaders - Xi and then UK Prime Minister David Cameron - posing alongside Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero. The unlikely selfie went viral on social media.\nThe latter laid out a target that seemed much more likely for a nation of 1.4 billion people - and the football world took notice.\nIn a written interview with the news agency Reuters, President Xi said he wanted China's national team to become \"one of the best in the world\".\nSix months after Xi's visit to the UK, the Chinese government launched a strategy that aimed to make the country a \"world football superpower\" by 2050.\nIn the long term, the president wanted China to host and be competitive at the men's World Cup. By 2030, he wanted China to be one of the best teams in Asia.\nWhen the strategy was announced, China were 81st in the Fifa world rankings. Today, they sit 90th - wedged between New Zealand and the Caribbean island of Curacao.\nChina's only appearance at a men's World Cup remains at the 2002 tournament in Japan and South Korea, where they were eliminated in the group stage.\nShould they lose to Saudi Arabia and Australia in this month's international break, it would almost certainly end their hopes of reaching the next edition in 2026.\nDespite that, some of Xi's aims are already taking shape - his strategy having been set out over three stages, spanning 34 years.\nOne of them was to get tens of millions of young people playing the sport regularly. China's community football projects have indeed been hugely upscaled, with pitches now accessible all over the country.\n\"This absolutely kicked into high gear from 2016 - football pitches were springing up everywhere,\" says Dr Mike Gow - an expert in contemporary China at Edge Hill University.\n\"You're never more than about 10 minutes' walk from either a half-size or full-size all-weather pitch. The scale of it is quite impressive.\"\nXi Jinping posed for a selfie with Sergio Aguero and David Cameron when he visited the UK in 2015\nBut while access has improved, adopting a football culture similar to Europe and the UK is proving more challenging.\nIn 2018, David Sproer was working as a coach in Cologne when he was presented with an opportunity to work for the Shanghai Football Association as a youth coach in the women's game.\n\"It felt like a gold rush,\" he says. \"It felt like things were really taking off, and that Chinese football could make huge steps towards a brighter future.\"\nSproer left the country, along with many other European coaches, during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nHe says he has no regrets about his time in China, but believes parts of his experience shone a light on why the country is so dominant in Olympic sports such as gymnastics, diving and table tennis but has struggled in football, where cohesion and communication play a more important role.\n\"Chinese kids are educated and socialised a little differently from European kids,\" he says. \"They grow up with an understanding that there is always a right and a wrong answer.\n\"You have to be a little bit more versatile in football than, say, diving. It's not about perfection, it's also about creativity.\"\nThe growth of the game among young people has also suffered as a result of the perception of football in the country.\nIn December 2024, former Everton midfielder Li Tie was sentenced to 20 years in prison for fixing matches and accepting bribes. He had been China's men's national team coach from January 2020 to December 2021.\nThe saga was the latest in a string of corruption cases that have blighted Chinese football over many years. According to Sproer, they have had an impact on the number of parents willing to volunteer to help in organising youth teams.\n\"Kids are under enormous academic pressure. The parents are under pressure in their jobs,\" he says.\n\"So there isn't much time to volunteer, and there is also not this culture of volunteering, because football in China in the professional leagues doesn't have the greatest image.\"\nHulk spent five season in the Chinese Super League, scoring 51 goals in 100 games\nThree months before Li Tie's sentencing, Chinese football had suffered a blow, with a 7-0 defeat by bitter rivals Japan in World Cup qualifying.\n\"This is like England getting hammered by Germany,\" says Dr Gow.\n\"Fans were angry, but they were more exasperated. Exasperated at the state of the game, and exasperated at the level of corruption in the game.\"\nWhen Xi set out his football plan in 2016, it led to a wave of investment from Chinese private investors in British and European clubs.\nThe Chinese Super League (CSL) had its own resurgence, with wealthy owners pumping money into clubs to finance moves for players such as Oscar, from Chelsea, and Hulk from Zenit St Petersburg.\nNow, only two Chinese investors have overall control of professional clubs in England - the Fosun International Group at Wolverhampton Wanderers, and Dai Yongge, whose tenure at Reading has been beset by financial crises and successive points deductions.\nAnd clubs in the CSL are counting the cost of their transfer spending, with Guangzhou Evergrande, who won eight domestic titles and two Asian Champions Leagues between 2011 and 2019, forced into liquidation in January as a result of unpaid debts.\n\"A lot of entrepreneurs used the China football strategy as a pretext to move money out of China,\" Dr Gow says.\n\"It's very difficult to get your money out of China, so they seized on this opportunity that there was a national policy.\n\"Fairly quickly, within a two- or three-year period, the authorities came along and said 'no, this is not what we want you to be doing,' so they kind of closed the door on that outward investment.\"\nWith the presence of Chinese investors dwindling at European clubs, and with the men's national team still struggling to make inroads on the pitch, it is tempting to write off Xi's ambitions already.\nBut those who've spent time in the country still feel the targets can be met by 2050, with China's results in younger age groups signalling some progress.\n\"Never underestimate them,\" says Dr Gow.\n\"When you have the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Republic of China, and they come out with a plan like this, they tend to deliver the objectives.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Repeated failures in how CTs, X-rays and other medical scans are being interpreted are leading to avoidable patient deaths and delays in diagnosing cancer, England's health ombudsman has warned. \nThe most common problems include doctors failing to spot abnormalities, scans being delayed or not carried out, and results not being followed up properly.\nThe ombudsman has upheld or partially upheld 45 cases which include failures in medical imaging in the last four years, and says lessons must be learned to avoid the same mistakes again. \nNHS England said staff work extremely hard to keep patients safe but acknowledged there was more to do to improve the \"response to serious health issues\".\nIn one case, medical staff at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough repeatedly failed to diagnose an 82-year-old man with bowel cancer and left him suffering prolonged pain, according to the parliamentary and health service ombudsman (PHSO).\nThe man, from Buckinghamshire, went to A&E five times between August and October 2021. \nA scan taken in August showed a lesion in the bowel.\nHowever, clinicians reported no abnormalities, the investigation found, leading to a six-week delay in diagnosis and surgery.\nThe patient also had an X-ray in October that suggested an obstruction in his small bowel, but this X-ray was not reviewed and he was discharged and sent home. \nLater that month the cancer was diagnosed and he had an operation to remove part of the bowel. The surgery uncovered another mass elsewhere in his body. \nJust months later, the man took his life, leaving a note saying he could no longer deal with the pain. \nThe ombudsman, Rebecca Hilsenrath KC, said staff failed to manage his pain on five occasions. \nFailings in his care \"were probably contributory factors to the patient's decision to end his life\", her report suggests. \nThe man's daughter said: \"I really tried to get the doctors to listen. \n\"I had a feeling something was wrong and I pleaded numerous times for them to keep him in the hospital, but they just kept discharging him and not doing anything to help him.\"\nA statement provided by the hospital trust says: \"We are very sorry for our failing in care in this case and we have a further meeting with the patient's family shortly to update them on the changes we have since made. \n\"This includes ensuring that older patients presenting with abdominal pain are appropriately reviewed.\"\nThe trust has also agreed to pay the family \u00a34,000, as recommended by PHSO. \nIn another investigation, the ombudsman found a cancerous tumour was incorrectly identified as benign (non-cancerous) - despite repeated scans suggesting otherwise. \nThe patient, a 54-year-old man, had his first scan in Tenerife, after becoming unwell on holiday. \nHis brother said: \"When my brother collapsed in Tenerife, the hospital immediately identified the tumour for what it was [an aggressive brain tumour] and even offered to remove it. \n\"But my brother wanted to come home, he thought the best place for him to have the treatment was in the NHS.\"\nThe man returned to Gillingham, where the local hospital carried out further scans identifying the tumour, and referred him to specialists at King's College Hospital.\nHowever, staff there \"downgraded the diagnosis\", saying the tumour was not cancerous. The man was not offered chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\nHe died in hospital, a month after an operation to remove the tumour, which was confirmed to be cancerous.\nIf the cancer had been identified correctly, he could have had surgery months earlier and potentially the option of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, PHSO said.\nWhile the survival rate for this cancer is poor, the ombudsman's investigation suggests the man may have had a few extra months of life.\nHis brother said: \"I wanted King's College Hospital to acknowledge their mistakes so that I can stop picking at the scab of trying to understand what happened to him and remember my brother as he was when he was alive.\"\nIn a statement, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: \"We fully recognise that errors were made in this patient's care, and we apologised to his family at the time of the incident.\n\"Learning from mistakes when they occur is crucial, and we have made a number of changes as a result of this case to improve the safety and effectiveness of the care our teams provide.\"\nThe trust has agreed to pay the family \u00a33,500. \nMs Hilsenrath, whose team independently investigates complaints, said: \"Each of the cases we have investigated and upheld represent a real person whose life has been impacted by failings in care. \n\"They are also all instances where the organisations involved failed to identify that anything had gone wrong\"\nThe 2021 ombudsman report into medical imaging issues recommended system-wide improvements, but Ms Hilsenrath said while there had been some progress, she was still seeing instances where people's care was \"sub-optimal, often with devastating consequences\".\nIt is \"critical\" that action is taken to improve the digital infrastructure in the NHS and ensure people are diagnosed and treated swiftly, she added.\nDr Katharine Halliday, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, agreed digital infrastructure needed improvements. \n\"The ombudsman highlights some devastating failures in the NHS, and we must collectively learn from these experiences to drive meaningful change,\" she said. \n\"However, it must also be recognised that these findings reflect a system that is overburdened and under-resourced.\"\nThe college says it faces a 30% shortfall of clinical radiologists, which is projected to rise to 40% by 2028. \nAn NHS spokesperson said: \"The NHS had delivered a record number of tests and checks in 2024, a fifth more than pre-pandemic but we know there is more to do to improve the recognition and response of serious health issues.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"Our deepest sympathies are with all those who have been affected by the failings highlighted in this shocking report.\"\nThe spokesperson added that they were opening more Community Diagnostic Centres (CDCs), and using new technology like AI so \"all patients can receive world-class care\".\nChanges were also being introduced in cancer care, the spokesperson said, which would see 100,000 more patients who are referred receiving a diagnosis within four weeks and up to 19,000 more people starting their treatment within two months each year.",

        "article_text": "When you see pasta, your brain probably doesn't jump to the secrets of the universe. But for almost a century, physicists have puzzled over spaghetti's counterintuitive properties.\nYou might think physicists only ask the big questions. We mostly hear about the physics of the cosmic and the miniscule, the shape of our universe and the nature of the particles that fill it. But physicists, of course, have ordinary lives outside of the laboratory, and sometimes their way of questioning the universe spills over to their daily habits. There's one everyday item that seems to especially obsess them: spaghetti.\nGoing back at least a century, spaghetti has been the subject of rigorous studies. Through this research, physicists continue to learn new things about the solid state of matter, the chemistry of food and even draw connections to the origin of life. The steady torrent of spaghetti science helps to demonstrate that deep questions lurk in our ordinary routines, and that there are plenty of hungry physicists who can't stop asking them.\nFor example: how thin can spaghetti get? The typical spaghetto \u2013 the word for an individual strand of spaghetti \u2013 is between one and two mm thick (0.04-0.08in). But other long noodles vary widely in diameter, from udon at 4mm (0.16in) to angel hair at 0.8mm (0.03in). The thinnest handmade strands are called su filindeu, coming in at 0.4mm (0.02in), so slender that only a few women in Nuoro, Italy know how to make them.\nBut recently, a team of researchers at the University College London wondered if 21st Century lab equipment could do better. They used a technique called \"electro-spinning\". First, they dissolved flour into a special, electrically charged solution in a syringe. Then they held the syringe over a special, negatively-charged plate. \"This pulls the solution through the dispenser needle down towards the collector plate in a very stringy noodle-type shape,\" says Beatrice Britton, lead author of the study.\nWhen the solution dried, the researchers were left with a crisscrossing thread of incredibly thin spaghetti. \"To the naked eye, all you see is a sort of lasagna sheet,\" Britton says, but a powerful microscope reveals a mat made of strands as thin as 0.1mm (0.004in). These noodles are also much stiffer than regular spaghetti. Britton and her colleagues hope their research can be a step towards biodegradable alternatives to plastic \"nanofibres\", which are now used to filter liquids and treat wounds.\nThe world's thinnest spaghetti is just one recent example of how physicists can't seem to stop plying their tools on everybody's favourite carb. But physicists using their noodle on their noodles is no new thing. In 1949, Brown University physicist George F Carrier posed \"the spaghetti problem\" in The American Mathematical Monthly, which he deemed to be \"of considerable popular and academic interest\". Essentially, the problem amounts to: \"Why can't I slurp up a strand of spaghetti without getting sauce on my face\"?\nHis equations showed how the exposed strand swings about more wildly as it gets shorter and shorter, guaranteeing an eventual slap of the noodle against the slurper's lip \u2013 and the fateful sauce eruption Carrier so deplored. Sadly, his mathematical formulas offered no way around the face-slap. It's as deeply etched in the laws of the universe as the Big Bang.\nLater, two scientists inverted Carrier's pioneering study, exploring what happens when a stringy object slips out of a hole instead of being sucked in. They called their version the \"reverse spaghetti problem\", familiar to any impatient eater who's had to spit out burning pasta because they hadn't waited for it to cool. For now, no theoretical physicist has attempted the more complicated problem of two dogs slurping from either end of the same spaghetti strand.\u00a0\nThe great mid-century American physicist Richard Feynman helped unlock the riddles of quantum mechanics, explaining how the elementary particles that make up atoms interact with one another. But Feynman's enormous contribution to spaghetti physics is less widely known. One night, Feynman wondered why it's almost impossible to break a stick of spaghetti into two pieces instead of three. He and a colleague spent the rest of the evening snapping spaghetti sticks until they covered the kitchen floor.\nFeynman's interrogation into the counterintuitive physics of dry spaghetti sparked a quarter century of attempts to explain it. This finally happened in 2005, when two French researchers showed that spaghetti always breaks into two pieces \u2013 at first. But after the fracture, as the two bent pieces snap straight again, all their pent-up strain gets released in a shockwave, causing further splintering.\nIn 2018, a team of MIT scientists figured out how to stifle the shockwave \u2013 delicately twist the spaghetti strand before snapping it. Their method required lab equipment, but it reliably produced a perfect pair of fragments. Their work provided a new and deeper understanding of brittle rods that goes beyond spaghetti; the phenomenon of three-way fracturing is well-known to pole vaulters, for example.\nMy (Italian-American) mother taught me to break a bundle of dry spaghetti in half before putting it in boiling water, so it fits horizontally in the pot. I guess Feynman did the same, but it's an outrage to many of the world's spaghetti-eaters. If you're in the latter camp, then you place your dried spaghetti bundle upright in the pot of boiling water, then watch it slowly soften, buckle and submerge itself.\nThis familiar spaghetti behaviour may not seem like a puzzle, but try removing a recently-curled piece of spaghetti from the pot and letting it dry. It will stay curved rather than returning to its original straight length \u2013 something in those first few minutes irreversibly changes the composition of the spaghetti. In 2020, two physicists finally explained this spaghetti transmutation. It's due to a feature called \"viscoelasticity\" \u2013 a name for the unique way materials like spaghetti respond to physical stress. This special property allows water to flow through the strand's outer layers.\nThe strange mechanics of cooked spaghetti go even further. In one study, scientists dropped strands on the ground and measured how they coiled to learn about other elastic materials, from rope to DNA strands. In another, physicists tied spaghetti into knots and studied what types of strain would cause them to tear.\nSpaghetti physics even goes beyond the pasta itself \u2013 sauce is loaded with its own scientific mysteries. When eight Italian physicists met while doing research abroad in Germany, they found a shared frustration in the classic Roman dish cacio e pepe.\nThe sauce requires very few ingredients \u2013 it's basically a mixture of reserved pasta water and grated pecorino cheese \u2013 but they'd all experienced its mystifying fickleness. Often the cheese irreversibly clumps up, ruining the sauce. This is especially common when you cook it in large batches, which made the physicists hesitant to invite their German colleagues to dinner. \"We can't mess up cacio e pepe in front of German people,\" says Ivan Di Terlizzi, who studies statistical and biological physics at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, Germany.\nFortunately, among them were some of the world's foremost experts on the physics of \"phase separation\", exactly the kind of congealing phenomenon that plagued their group dinners. Arguing about the phase separation of cacio e pepe, they realised it was flummoxing from a scientific perspective as well.\n\"This is actually a very interesting problem,\" says Daniel Maria Busiello, co-author on the cacio\u00a0study. \"So we decided to design an experimental apparatus to actually test all these things.\"\nThe \"apparatus\" consisted of a bath of water heated to a low temperature, a kitchen thermometer, a petri dish and an iPhone camera attached to an empty box. They invited as many hungry friends as they could find to Di Terlizzi's apartment and hunkered down to cook a weekend's worth of cacio e pepe.\u00a0\nThey found that the \"simple\" sauce was enormously complex. Chemically, it's a water-based solution with only a few components: starch (from the pasta water), lipids (from the cheese) and two kinds of protein (also from the cheese). Using their apparatus, they found a physical explanation for the sauce-wrecking clumps, which they termed the \"mozzarella phase\".\nProteins, unlike most molecules, get stickier when they're hot. As the sauce is heated, the researchers found this leads to these proteins sticking to the lipids and forming mozzarella-like clumps. In a well-made cacio e pepe, what prevents this is the starch, which forms a protective coat around the lipid molecules so they can't stick to the proteins. If the sauce gets too hot, the increased stickiness of the proteins overcomes this barrier.\nOnce they understood the science behind the sauce, it was clear how to fix it. \"If you add enough starch above a certain threshold, you don't get this kind of separated state,\" says Di Terlizzi. Pasta water doesn't typically contain enough starch to guarantee this threshold, so they suggest adding a mixture of corn starch dissolved in water.\nThe group decided to conclude their manuscript with a foolproof recipe for the classic dish. But in surveying the rich scientific literature, they realised they weren't the first to reach this cacio epiphany. In the name of academic integrity, they cited a YouTube video wherein the Michelin-star Roman chef Luciano Monosilio suggests the same tweak for a foolproof recipe \u2013 a dash of corn starch. \"It's the only non-scientific reference in our paper,\" says Di Terlizzi.\nThe physics they used connects the clumping of cacio e pepe to ideas about the origin of life on Earth. Biophysicists use phase separation to understand how droplets of liquid can congeal and divide within a solution. \"A droplet dividing pretty much looks like a proto-cell,\" says Giacomo Bartolucci, another co-author on the study. Inside the little blobs that preceded actual cells, some believe, the building blocks of life may have come together via a process much like the Italians\u2019 mozzarella phase. The same ideas are helping biologists understand how the plaques that cause Alzheimer's coalesce in the brain.\nWhy is spaghetti such a locus of speculation and study for physicists?\nFor one, it's simple \u2013 flour, water and heat, says Vishal Patil, one of the discoverers of the twist-and-break method who is now a professor of mathematics at the University of California, San Diego. The fact that a combination of so few components raises so many deep questions speaks to how physics underlies everything they see and do, Patil says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why sarcastic teens are the smartest\n\u2022 The French towns giving away free chickens\n\u2022 YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know\nIt also shows that no matter how deep physicists probe the big and the small, the answers can still fall short of explaining phenomena we see every day. When it comes to cacio e pepe, all the tools of theoretical physics can only tell us what every Italian grandmother knows: keep the stove burning low when you make it. Laboratory electrospinning can only achieve marginally thinner spaghetti than what the women of Nuoro, Italy make daily by hand.\n\"Spaghetti is just a very accessible thing you can play with,\" Patil says. The low cost of flour-based noodles is what made them a democratic delicacy for so many cultures around the world \u2013 spaghetti was popularised in Naples as street food. That's why Feynman didn't hesitate to snap pounds of the stuff onto his kitchen floor.\nAfter a long day at the blackboard, plugging away at the impenetrable math of quantum mechanics or black holes, the mechanical wonders of spaghetti are the perfect fodder for scientists' mealtime probing.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "With her award-winning Wolf Hall series of books, Hilary Mantel made Tudor bad guy Thomas Cromwell sympathetic. But as TV adaptation Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light premieres in the US, the question is: did she also 'sidestep crucial matters'?\nNearly 500 years after his death, Thomas Cromwell lives again, reborn in the popular imagination thanks to novelist Hilary Mantel, and her Wolf Hall trilogy. For decades, historians piled layer after layer of interpretation upon Henry VIII's astute chief minister, a key figure in the Reformation, when King Henry broke from the Catholic Church to establish his own Church of England. But now, with the emergence of Mantel's fictional Cromwell \u2013 so attractive, so splendidly presented \u2013 the real man is in danger of being buried forever.\nGoing forward, Cromwell's name will likely call to mind the lean, canny look of actor Mark Rylance \u2013 star of the television adaptations of the Wolf Hall series \u2013 rather than the grumpy, heavy-jowled visage captured by artist Hans Holbein in a portrait done from life circa 1534. And a figure once counted among history's villains will retain the glow of Mantel's revisionist high regard for many years to come.\n\u00a0\nStarting on 23 March, US audiences can watch Rylance play Cromwell, alongside Damian Lewis as King Henry, one more time. Six hours of Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light, based on the third and final book, make up the last tranche of episodes of the BBC's lavish costume drama. The script takes the complicated story of Cromwell's fall, culminating in his execution for treason in 1540 after six years as the King's right-hand man, and renders it (relatively) easy to follow. Especially impressive is the dialogue, often lifted directly from Mantel's text. The author, who died of a stroke in 2022, had a gift for rendering 16th-Century speech in a non-risible way. (The Wolf Hall novels have also been adapted into two plays.)\nAlthough critics consider The Mirror and the Light to be the least successful of the novels \u2013 it's the only one of the three not to win the Booker Prize \u2013\u00a0the TV version received rapturous reviews when broadcast in the UK last autumn. The Guardian's five-star review proclaimed: \"The final instalment of Hilary Mantel's masterpiece is the most intricate television you are ever likely to see. It is so beautifully made it's breathtaking.\"\nBut where do sumptuous production values end, and the facts begin? Such questions have accompanied Mantel's project from the start. Tracy Borman, Chief Historian at Historic Royal Palaces and author of 2015's Thomas Cromwell: The Untold Story of Henry VIII's Most Faithful Servant, tells the BBC about the impact Mantel's first Tudor novel, Wolf Hall, had on her upon its publication in 2008. \"All through my education, from early school days until university, I was taught that Henry VIII's chief minister was a grasping, ruthless, cynical henchman, driven by greed and power.\u00a0Then I read\u00a0Wolf Hall\u00a0and it gave such a different perspective\u2026 I was inspired to write a non-fiction biography so that I could find out where the truth lay.\"\u00a0\nResearching her book, Borman discovered a sharp-witted and enterprising Cromwell, as Mantel did, and realised just how thorough the novelist had been in mining primary sources for innumerable details, including Tudor swear words, Cromwell's favourite wines, and the names of his servants. \"Granted, she took artistic license when she needed to,\" Borman says. \"Notably in downplaying Cromwell's role in Anne Boleyn's execution, and in making him something of a heartthrob at court.\"\nSamantha Rogers, who teaches early modern history at Vanderbilt University, agrees. \"There are a great many popular novels about the Tudors I can't bear to read,\" she tells the BBC. \"Mantel's work is the gold standard \u2013 well-researched and rooted in history. However, to paint a largely sympathetic portrait of Cromwell, she does sidestep some crucial matters.\"\nRogers notes that when King Henry wanted to rid himself of his second wife, Anne Boleyn, the court musician Mark Smeaton, under torture, implicated her in serious crimes \u2013 adultery with five men including her own brother. Cromwell most certainly supervised his torture, and yet in the taut and chilling Bring Up the Bodies, the second of Mantel's Tudor novels, Smeaton is merely threatened, put in a dark closet, and never physically assaulted.\nLiterary critic and biographer Megan Marshall, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Margaret Fuller: A New American Life, explains to the BBC how, in writing about a historical figure, both a biographer and novelist \"will pluck out what concerns us, and what concerns the audience\u2026 although the novelist likely has a more conscious agenda than a biographer\".\nMantel's view of Cromwell is inevitably coloured by her personal perspective. She made no secret of her rejection, during adolescence, of the Catholic faith she was brought up in, nor her scorn for the representation of Cromwell and his staunchly Catholic nemesis Sir Thomas More in Robert Bolt's play A Man for All Seasons, which, as a film, won the Oscar for best picture in 1967. In Bolt's telling, Cromwell is the big baddie, both ruthless and underhanded in his methods. More, Lord High Chancellor of England, and later venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church, is the hero, executed for refusing to swear an oath recognising the monarch as the supreme head of the Church in England. More's eloquent resistance, and faithfulness to the dictates of his own conscience, resonated amid the counter-culture of the 1960s.\nEamon Duffy, emeritus professor of history at the University of Cambridge, has accused Mantel of going too far with her demythologising of More. He says that she made More into a monster, \"a torturer and a misogynist whose wife and womenfolk were afraid of him,\" he said in a recent interview with the Idler magazine, adding, \"I think that [More] portrayal was the least successful bit of Wolf Hall.\"\u00a0\nYet as she drags More down, Mantel is simultaneously rehabilitating Cromwell. And in the process, does she not give readers a Cromwell that fits the 21st Century? A hero for our time? Rogers believes that she does, pointing out that writer and actor Lin-Manuel Miranda, with his hit musical Hamilton, recast Founding Father Alexander Hamilton in a similar way. \"Both are appealing, scrappy guys who come from nothing,\" says Rogers. Appealing, in other words, to audiences preoccupied by the structural barriers \u2013 be they based on class, race, wealth or gender \u2013 that prevent people today from flourishing.\nBorman concurs. \"Henry VIII's court was far from being a meritocracy: most of its members were blue-blooded nobles and the top positions were practically hereditary. Then in comes Cromwell, the son of a blacksmith from a seedy part of London, and he takes the court \u2013 and its king \u2013 by storm. It's a story as dramatic as it is seductive.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0How History got Henry VIII wrong\n\u2022\u00a0Did a gay affair spark a 14th Century royal crisis?\n\u2022\u00a0America's most vilified First Lady\u00a0\nWhat Wolf Hall leaves out, however, is of particular interest to the leading Cromwell scholar working today. Diarmaid MacCulloch, emeritus professor of history at the University of Oxford, and author of 2018's Thomas Cromwell: A Life, argues that rather than Cromwell pursuing the country's religious change for political ends, he was a sincere Protestant, determined throughout his years in the King's service to bring church reform to England. And while MacCulloch greatly admires Mantel's novels, in a 2018 interview with the podcast History Extra, he said that \"the one thing she played down\u2026 is the religion\". He added: \"Perhaps for a modern novel-reading audience, you simply can't do it.\"\nHistorical fiction may indeed reveal as much about the time it is written in, as the time it is written about. Mantel referred to this duality in her Reith Lectures on the craft, presented for the BBC in 2017, along with the many challenges of weaving fiction out of fact. \"The pursuit of the past makes you aware, whether you are novelist or historian, of your own fallibility and inbuilt bias,\" she declared. It's in the gaps in the official record that a writer of fiction can do her most valuable work, she said.\nThat audiences \u2013 readers, theatregoers, TV viewers \u2013 all find Mantel's Cromwell so compelling testifies not only to her skill at filling in gaps, but to her love for the protagonist \u2013 the witty, affectionate, energetic, all-seeing polymath \u2013 she contrived after emerging from the archives. \"When I sat down to write at last,\" Mantel recalled in a 2012 essay, \"it was with relish for his company.\"\nThe Mirror and the Light premieres on 23 March on PBS Masterpiece in the US and is available now to stream on BBC iPlayer in the UK\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\n\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

There was no communication from them until 11:00 and even this it was only that they could take us back on Monday, which would involve an eight hour stay at Heathrow.\n \"If you didn't want the flight you had to phone a number that took forever to get through, but I suspect it was a minor inconvenience compared to some.\"\nLess fortunate was Liz Steele, who missed her youngest son Paddy's graduation in Stirling on Friday.\nShe told BBC News: \"It was devastating. \n\"I know that there are people that have been affected much worse than this, but I've been to every other graduation that my kids have had, Masters and undergrads, and I just always thought that I would be there.\"\nHeathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye denied the incident - caused by a transformer catching fire within the North Hyde electrical substation - had made the airport a \"laughing stock\".\nHe told the BBC's Today programme: \"We have other substations but to switch them in takes time.\n\"The situation was not created at Heathrow Airport, it was created outside the airport and we had to deal with the consequences.\" \nA spokesperson for British Airways said around 85% of its services would be able to fly today.\nOn social media Heathrow Airport advised all passengers to check flights in advance before travelling.",

        "article_text": "Heather Knight led England to 134 wins from her 199 matches in charge\nConsidering the catastrophic nature of the Ashes defeat at the beginning of the year, it was inevitable that England would be starting the summer of 2025 with a new coach and captain. \nBut this is unfamiliar territory. \nSince 2000, England have only had three permanent women's captains and all three could still be playing a huge role in the next era. \nClare Connor is the current managing director of women's cricket and will therefore oversee the process of appointing the next leader, Charlotte Edwards is a candidate to become the next coach and Heather Knight, who has fulfilled the job for the past nine years before she was sacked on Saturday, will likely return to the batting ranks. \nKnight's era of captaincy is one which started under the immense pressure of filling the shoes of an all-time great in Edwards, delivered a World Cup win just a year after her appointment and throughout it all, she was tasked with bridging the amateur generation with the professional. \nBut it came to a cruel end - a 16-0 humiliation at the hands of their greatest rivals, where she had to continuously fight back the emotions after each difficult interview and stand on the vast Melbourne Cricket Ground outfield to watch Australia's triumphant celebrations as her own side had unravelled.\nAnd while it should not be defined by the most recent thrashing, it has been a turning point with head coach Jon Lewis also making way on Friday. \nProfessional sport is merciless, and Ashes defeats usually more so than most. \nSo England's slate is wiped clean, and Knight's too - she has stated her desire to continue playing and if she can rediscover the spark that was dimmed by Australia, she will be a valuable asset to the next captain, hopefully channelling Joe Root's run-scoring feats since he relinquished the men's Test leadership. \nKnight sacked as England captain after Ashes thrashing\nWhat next for England after Lewis' sacking?\nIn some ways, ending the captaincy on 199 matches in charge feels fitting to summarise Knight's captaincy. \nAn immense achievement of longevity, desire and determination - but also falling just short. \nThe scenes at Lord's in July 2017, when England beat India by nine runs to win the 50-over World Cup, promised so much. \nKnight had delivered success immediately with then-coach Mark Robinson, who had made the ruthless call a year earlier to move on from Edwards and breed the next generation. \nBut ultimately, there has been little progress since then - the wait for another World Cup or an Ashes win is now up to eight years, despite all of the increased investment into England's domestic structure, The Hundred, and the franchise opportunities for players all over the world.  \nOf course, Knight is not to blame for all of that. As captain, she has averaged just shy of 58 in Tests, 37.10 in one-day internationals and 30.19 in T20s, and became the first woman in international cricket to score a century in all three formats.\nShe is also not only defined by the on-field contributions. Knight has always led from the front with her professionalism, her work ethic and her relations with the media, stepping up to answer difficult questions after defeats and has never shied away from advocating for women's rights in the game. \nBefore the start of day one of the Ashes Test match last month, amid all of the ongoing chaos with her team and the speculation about her own future, Knight was at Melbourne's Junction Oval to support Afghanistan's female cricketers play their historic exhibition match, having previously called on the International Cricket Council (ICC) to provide more support for them. \nThere was the charge from the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) in September 2024, where Knight was fined for being pictured in blackface when she was 21.\nKnight admitted the charge and apologised, saying she had learned from the past and the CDC found there was \"no racist intent\".\nFormer England bowler and current Test Match Special commentator Isa Guha said Knight had been \"brilliant with people, selfless, resilient and accountable\". \nIt may have come to an abrupt and difficult end, but England need to get back to winning ways, and Knight has left enormous shoes to fill in all aspects. \nThis is the biggest question of all. \nKnight's steady, reassuring presence at the helm has been a double-edged sword, and the management's lack of succession planning is now coming back to haunt them at a very tricky time. \nThey have until 21 May to appoint a new coach and captain in time for the white-ball series against West Indies, which is followed by India's arrival at the end of June, before a potentially very difficult 50-over World Cup in India at the end of the summer. \nBut there is no excuse. England have had nine years to plan for the future, and they have not done it.\nConsider the seamless transition from Alyssa Healy to Tahlia McGrath when the former injured her calf before the first Ashes T20, and the likes of Phoebe Litchfield, Annabel Sutherland and Ash Gardner who all appear to be competent, future candidates. \nNat Sciver-Brunt seems the most likely successor considering she has been Knight's deputy and stated her desire to fulfil the role during the Ashes, but England imploded under her leadership during the Commonwealth Games when Knight was injured, and the same happened during last year's shambolic T20 World Cup group-stage exit. \nEngland also need to be wary of adding any more to Sciver-Brunt's workload where she already carries the batting line-up and is one of the most experienced bowlers, and is soon to become a mother for the first time.\nAmy Jones is another who has deputised for Knight in the past but admitted the role did not come naturally to her, which makes her return unlikely, while other senior players in Kate Cross and Tammy Beaumont do not play all formats. \nOff-spinner Charlie Dean has been earmarked as a future England captain for the past couple of years but has yet to be given an opportunity. \nSophie Ecclestone, the world's best bowler, is another outside contender having had leadership experience with Manchester Originals in The Hundred, but her refusal to be interviewed by former team-mate and now pundit Alex Hartley during the Ashes led to unwanted headlines and attention on England's team culture and perception.\n\"There isn't a standout candidate to take over - that has been one of the biggest downfalls of the past five or six years,\" Hartley told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"They need a really strong coach moving forward, someone who can get the culture right and they can control the group and sort out the problems within the changing room and then the captain can come in and have strong ideas and work alongside the coach. \n\"I want a young person, a fresh person, someone like Charlie Dean - I think she'd be an exceptional leader who will play for England for a number of years.\"\nA nine-year tenure is unlikely to be repeated again, but with Knight still in the dressing room, there is nobody better for the new leader to learn from. \nA new era begins here.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has accused a federal judge of attempting to usurp White House authority after he dismissed a government court filing on migrant deportation flights as \"woefully insufficient\".\nJudge James Boasberg, the top federal judge in Washington DC, said the government had \"evaded its obligations\" to answer his questions about how alleged Venezuelan gang members were flown to an El Salvador mega-prison last weekend.\nTrump earlier this week called for Judge Boasberg to be impeached, labelling him a \"troublemaker and agitator\", although he did not name him in that social media post. \nThose remarks had led to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts Jr issuing a rare rebuke, saying impeachment is \"not an appropriate response to disagreement\" with a judge.\nJudge Boasberg had asked the government last Saturday to halt the deportation flights, but the White House said it was too late.\nOn Thursday, government attorneys provided a six-paragraph declaration from an immigration official, but the judge said they did not supply the flight information he had requested. \nIn response, Judge Boasberg gave justice department lawyers a new deadline to submit the requested information. He also accused the Trump administration of continuing to withhold information from the court.\nTrump hit back at the judge in a Truth Social post later on Thursday.\n\"Judge James Boasberg is doing everything in his power to usurp the Power of the Presidency,\" he wrote.\n\"He is a local, unknown Judge, a Grandstander, looking for publicity, and it cannot be for any other reason, because his \"Rulings\" are so ridiculous, and inept. SAVE AMERICA!\"\nIn another Truth Social post, Trump called for a stop to \"nationwide injunctions\" against his administration's policies, calling such court rulings \"unlawful\".\nHe also said \"our country is in very serious trouble\", urging Chief Justice Roberts and others on the Supreme Court to \"fix this toxic and unprecedented situation immediately\".\nIn the Venezuelan migrants deportation case, government lawyers submitted a six-paragraph declaration from an immigration official.\nThey also told the court they needed another day to consider whether to invoke a state secrets clause that allows federal authorities to withhold sensitive national security information in lawsuits.\nBut Judge Boasberg was not satisfied.\n\"To begin, the Government cannot proffer a regional ICE official to attest to Cabinet-level discussions of the state-secrets privilege,\" he wrote.\nThe judge initially gave a deadline of Wednesday, before extending it to Thursday. Now he has given the Trump administration until Friday morning to provide a sworn declaration from a cabinet-level official.\nJudge Boasberg will also hold a previously scheduled hearing on Friday about Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.\nThe president last weekend cited the 18th Century measure to deport more than 200 Venezuelans, alleging almost all were members of the gang Tren de Aragua.\nBut an immigration attorney working on behalf of one of the deported men told a court on Thursday that her client was a professional soccer player in Venezuela without a criminal record, CBS News, the BBC's US news partner, reported. \nThe man, Jerce Reyes Barrios, had applied for asylum to escape political persecution, his attorney argued, saying that he was falsely accused of being connected to Tren de Aragua because of a tattoo on his arm. \nThe attorney said the tattoo honoured the football team Real Madrid. \nThe flights - which Mr Barrios and others were aboard - were halted by Judge Boasberg verbally over the weekend. Any flights currently in the air were to be turned back. \nBut the White House said the planes were already in international airspace, arguing that the judge's order was therefore invalid.",
