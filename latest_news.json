        "article_text": "Luka Modric, Kylian Mbappe and Cristiano Ronaldo have shown their intent to own or invest in football clubs\nLuka Modric became the latest high-profile footballer to signal his interest in swapping the dressing room for the boardroom.\nOn Monday, it was announced the Real Madrid midfielder was \"investor and co-owner\" with a minority stake in Championship side Swansea City.\nBBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team looks into why more and more footballers are investing in football clubs, rather than going into management.\nIn February, Cristiano Ronaldo expressed a lack of desire to move into the dugout, once his playing days are over.\n\"Me as a manager? I don't see it\u2026 it's more difficult than being a player,\" said Ronaldo.\n\"If I can be a club owner, why would I be a manager, sporting director or CEO? That is a dream of mine and I am sure I'll be a club owner. I hope to have not just one club, but several clubs.\"\nOther players have gone one step further by investing in football clubs before retirement.\nKylian Mbappe (SM Caen), Sadio Mane (Bourges Foot 18) Juan Mata (San Diego FC), Wilfried Zaha (AFC Croydon), Cesar Azpilicueta (Hashtag United) and Hector Bellerin (Forest Green) are just some of the names who appear to be planning for life after football.\n\"I've got no interest in being a manager. It's not a passion of mine,\" said David Beckham (co-owner of Inter Miami and Salford City).\n\"Being a coach is too much work,\" said Zlatan Ibrahimovic (investor in Hammarby and senior advisor at AC Milan).\nBoth Beckham and Ibrahimovic had public run-ins with managers during their playing careers and it could be argued they are better suited at the top of the tree, rather than managing a squad of 25 players and taking instructions from a board of directors.\nFootball finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport: \"Footballers do not necessarily want to go into a coach/management role because of the stresses it brings. It also doesn't suit some personalities.\"\nBallon d'Or to boardroom \u2013 why Swansea for Modric?\nModric becomes Swansea 'investor and co-owner'\nThe majority of football clubs do not make enough profit to financially benefit their owners and investors.\nSwansea's revenue stream has dwindled since their seven-year spell in the top flight ended in 2018 and the club have accumulated losses of \u00a339m over the past three years.\n\"I don't believe it's a financial move for the player. Swansea is losing \u00a3450,000 a week. He will bring his expertise to the table,\" said Maguire.\n\"Luka Modric is not a brand like Ronaldo, Beckham or Mbappe. He is just a very good footballer. Modric wouldn't be named in a list of top 10 well-known players. \nMaguire added: \"If a player is a brand in their own right, there are financial benefits for them and their clubs. But they do it for the love of the game and it allows them to stay in the realms of football.\"\nThat is not to say pursuing football club ownership is not without risk.\nIn July 2024, Mbappe completed the takeover of Ligue 2 side Caen, investing \u00a312.6m in a majority stake. His first season in club ownership is likely to end with relegation for the French team.\nSpain's all-time top goalscorer David Villa was a co-founder of Queensboro FC. Since the club was announced in November 2019, they are yet to make their debut in the USL Championship, the second tier of football in the United States.\nEden Hazard was announced as the co-owner - along with former Chelsea team-mate Demba Ba - of San Diego 1904, who were set to play in the North American Soccer League (NASL). The league collapsed before the club could play their first game.\nMeanwhile, the 'Class of 92' led by Gary Neville are aiming to take Salford City to the Championship by 2029. The club reached the English Football League with four promotions in five years but have remained in League Two since 2019.\nPlayers are actively seeking out opportunities to learn about the business side of the game.\nAjax's Jordan Henderson, Aston Villa's Tryone Mings, and Manchester City's Ilkay Gundogan are just some of those taking courses in football business management.\n\"The PFA [Professional Footballers Association] has its own business school. Helping assist players from dressing room to boardroom. Rather than the dugout,\" Maguire added.\n\"Footballers have a unique understanding of the game. They can combine skills they have gained from their playing days and can bring that to the boardroom\".\nFormer Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler is enrolled on the PFA Business School's Sporting Directorship programme.\n\"There is more to football than playing and coaching. It just isn't about playing and I find that fascinating,\" said Fowler.\n\"We want to see the game grow and be part of it. Coaching and managing is difficult and this job is extremely difficult. It is an avenue to stay within the parameters of football.\"\nHow do athletes manage sleep, and how can you improve yours?\nHow does BBC report on big stories about itself?\nWhy are there so many international breaks in football?\nWhen does it get too hot to play tennis?\nHow does the new Club World Cup work & why is it so controversial?\nWe're looking for your questions for the Ask Me Anything team.

        "article_text": "Officially, all lines of enquiry are still open into a wave of arson and gun attacks at French prisons. \nThat means police haven't ruled out the extremist left, or a foreign power such as Russia or Algeria.\nBut the conviction is growing that the attacks - 12 since Sunday night - can only have been the work of drugs gangs, hitting back at the government's latest crackdown.\nThat is certainly the belief of the government itself.\nSpeaking on Thursday morning, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said he was \"certain that what we're dealing with is the drugs-yobs [in French, narco-racaille]\".\n\"It's not they who have declared war on us. It's we who declared war on them with our new law on drugs trafficking. They know we're going to be hitting their wallets.\"\nIn what was obviously a co-ordinated plan over three nights, gangs set fire to cars outside prisons and a prison officer training centre. In two locations, guns were used.\nIn many attacks, the perpetrators sprayed graffiti bearing the initials DDPF, which stands for Droits des Prisonniers Fran\u00e7ais - Rights for French Prison Inmates.\nThe group was previously unheard of, but on Tuesday it posted a video on the messaging platform Telegram showing the burning of a prison officer's car.\nIn French that is full of mistakes, the video's text accuses Justice Minister G\u00e9rard Darmanin of declaring \"war\" on prisoners.\n\"All we want is that human rights be respected,\" the text reads. \"If in 2025 we can watch TV, smoke and eat our meals without being bothered in our cells, it's only because our elders fought for these fundamental rights.\"\nPresenting themselves as defenders of human rights may not be the usual methodology of drugs gangs.\nBut nor does the DDPF come across as a classic far-left or anarchist organisation, which might more naturally be fighting for the cause.\nFor one thing, such groups tend to have intellectual underpinning which means they write grammatical and properly spelled French. Nor have far-left groups till now made prisoners' rights a particular issue.\nInvestigators have said that perpetrators of the attacks caught on video were dressed more like drugs-gang foot soldiers rather than far-left militants, who tend to come from a different social background.\nAnd in one location they wrote the wrong set of initials \u2013 DDFM \u2013 suggesting that their attachment to the supposed organisation was not exactly deep.\nThe theory of foreign manipulation is taken seriously \u2013 especially after proven cases of Russian interference such as the spraying of Stars of David in Paris after the October 7 attacks.\nRelations with Algeria are also at an all-time low at the moment.\nBut if the drugs gang theory is the favoured one, it is because means and motivation are both so easy to grasp.\nThe French government currently includes an unusual tandem: an interior and a justice minister who are not rivals; who are both on the political right; and who have pledged to fight head-on the scourge that they say is the drugs trade.\nTo this end Darmanin and Retailleau are currently steering a bill through parliament that they say will seriously hamper the drugs lords' ability to operate.\nA dedicated branch of the prosecutors' office will be created. There will be extra powers for investigators, and a special, protected status for informers.\nEven more of a threat to the drugs barons \u2013 so the government says \u2013 will be two newly converted prisons, where the 100 most powerful of them will be interned from later this year.\nIn these top-security jails, there will be much stricter rules governing visits and communication with the outside world. New measures will be in place to stop the infiltration of mobile telephones (of which tens of thousands are known to circulate in French jails).\nThe purpose is to prevent gang leaders from continuing their operations from behind bars \u2013 a security breach which has become widespread.\nThe case of Mohamed Amra, the drugs-lord whose escape last year led to the murder of two prison-officers near Rouen, is typical. \nPrison staff who went on strike in protest told the BBC how laxity inside jails was undermining morale and presenting a growing security risk. \nAmra was recaptured in Romania last month.\nThe French government sees in the prison attacks a sign that for once the drugs gangs feel intimidated \u2013 and that's why they're hitting back.\nOf course it suits the French government to say that, because it's evidence they can present to the voters that they are indeed getting tough.\nThe clincher will be when they catch one of the perpetrators and get him to explain why he did it.

        "summary": "Amra was recaptured in Romania last month.The French government sees in the prison attacks a sign that for once the drugs gangs feel intimidated \u2013 and that's why they're hitting back.Of course it suits the French government to say that, because it's evidence they can present to the voters that they are indeed getting tough.The clincher will be when they catch one of the perpetrators and get him to explain why he did it. In two locations, guns were used.In many attacks, the perpetrators sprayed graffiti bearing the initials DDPF, which stands for Droits des Prisonniers Fran\u00e7ais - Rights for French Prison Inmates.The group was previously unheard of, but on Tuesday it posted a video on the messaging platform Telegram showing the burning of a prison officer's car.In French that is full of mistakes, the video's text accuses Justice Minister G\u00e9rard Darmanin of declaring \"war\" on prisoners. Nor have far-left groups till now made prisoners' rights a particular issue.Investigators have said that perpetrators of the attacks caught on video were dressed more like drugs-gang foot soldiers rather than far-left militants, who tend to come from a different social background.And in one location they wrote the wrong set of initials \u2013 DDFM \u2013 suggesting that their attachment to the supposed organisation was not exactly deep.The theory of foreign manipulation is taken seriously \u2013 especially after proven cases of Russian interference such as the spraying of Stars of David in Paris after the October 7 attacks.Relations with Algeria are also at an all-time low at the moment.But if the drugs gang theory is the favoured one, it is because means and motivation are both so easy to grasp.The French government currently includes an unusual tandem: an interior and a justice minister who are not rivals; who are both on the political right; and who have pledged to fight head-on the scourge that they say is the drugs trade.To this end Darmanin and Retailleau are currently steering a bill through parliament that they say will seriously hamper the drugs lords' ability to operate.A dedicated branch of the prosecutors' office will be created. \"Getty ImagesInterior Minister G\u00e9rard Darmanin visited one of the jails that came under attackPresenting themselves as defenders of human rights may not be the usual methodology of drugs gangs.But nor does the DDPF come across as a classic far-left or anarchist organisation, which might more naturally be fighting for the cause.For one thing, such groups tend to have intellectual underpinning which means they write grammatical and properly spelled French. That means police haven't ruled out the extremist left, or a foreign power such as Russia or Algeria.But the conviction is growing that the attacks - 12 since Sunday night - can only have been the work of drugs gangs, hitting back at the government's latest crackdown.That is certainly the belief of the government itself.Speaking on Thursday morning, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said he was \"certain that what we're dealing with is the drugs-yobs [in French, narco-racaille]\".",

        "article_text": "The Trump administration has said it is freezing more than $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) in federal funds for Harvard University, hours after the elite college rejected a list of demands from the White House.\n\"Harvard's statement today reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges,\" the Department of Education said in a statement.\nThe White House sent a list of demands to Harvard last week which it said were designed to fight antisemitism on campus. They included changes to its governance, hiring practices and admissions procedures.\nHarvard rejected the demands on Monday and said the White House was trying to \"control\" its community.\nIt is the first major US university to defy pressure from the Trump administration to change its policies. The sweeping changes demanded by the White House would have transformed its operations and ceded a large amount of control to the government.\nPresident Trump has accused leading universities of failing to protect Jewish students when college campuses around the country were roiled by protests against the war in Gaza and US support for Israel last year.\nIn a letter to the Harvard community on Monday, its President Alan Garber said the White House had sent an \"updated and expanded list of demands\" on Friday alongside a warning that the university \"must comply\" in order to maintain its \"financial relationship\" with the government.\n\"We have informed the administration through our legal counsel that we will not accept their proposed agreement,\" he wrote. \"The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.\"\nMr Garber added that the university did not \"take lightly\" its obligation to fight antisemitism, but said the government was overreaching. \n\"Although some of the demands outlined by the government are aimed at combating antisemitism, the majority represent direct governmental regulation of the 'intellectual conditions' at Harvard,\" he said.\nShortly after his letter was sent, the education department said it was freezing $2.2bn in grants and $60m in contracts to Harvard immediately.\n\"The disruption of learning that has plagued campuses in recent years is unacceptable,\" it said. \n\"The harassment of Jewish students is intolerable. It is time for elite universities to take the problem seriously and commit to meaningful change if they wish to continue receiving taxpayer support,\" the statement added.\nThe White House said in its own letter on Friday that Harvard had \"in recent years failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment\".\nThe letter included 10 categories for proposed changes that the White House said were needed in order for Harvard to maintain its \"financial relationship with the federal government\".\nSome of the changes included: reporting students to the federal government who are \"hostile\" to American values; ensuring each academic department is \"viewpoint diverse\"; and hiring an external government-approved party to audit programs and departments \"that most fuel antisemitic harassment\". \nThe letter orders the university to take disciplinary action for \"violations\" that happened during protests on campus over the past two years. It also demands an end the university's diversity, equity and inclusion policies and programmes.\nSince taking office, President Trump has put pressure on universities to tackle antisemitism and end diversity practices. \nIn December 2023, the president's of top US universities were questioned in a tense congressional hearing in which they were accused of failing to protect Jewish students following the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war two months earlier.\nClaudine Gay, who was then president of Harvard, later apologised after telling the hearing that calls for the killing of Jews were abhorrent, but it would depend on the context whether such comments would constitute a violation of Harvard's code of conduct.\nThat comment, as well as allegations of plagiarism, led her to resign from the post a month later.\nIn March, the Trump administration said it was reviewing roughly $256m in federal contracts and grants at Harvard, and an additional $8.7bn in multi-year grant commitments.\nHarvard professors filed a lawsuit in response, alleging the government was unlawfully attacking freedom of speech and academic freedom. \nThe White House had previously pulled $400m in federal funding from Columbia University and accused it of failing to fight antisemitism and protect Jewish students on its campus. \nWhen the $400m was pulled, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said: \"Universities must comply with all federal antidiscrimination laws if they are going to receive federal funding\".\nShortly after, Columbia agreed to several of the administration's demands, drawing criticism from some students and faculty. \nEarlier on Monday, a lawyer for an organiser of pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University said her client had been arrested by immigration officials as he attended an interview as part of his application for US citizenship.\nMohsen Mahdawi, a green card holder who is due to graduate next month, was detained on Monday in Colchester, Vermont.\nOthers who took part in campus protests against the war, including Columbia University's Mahmoud Khalil and Tufts University's Rumeysa Ozturk, have been detained in recent weeks.",

        "article_text": "The rate of rising prices - inflation - has eased for the second month in a row, official figures show.\nIn March, prices rose at an annual rate of 2.6%, far slower than the 11% inflation peak seen in 2022.\nPetrol and toy prices have fallen, a relief for drivers and parents, while food prices are unchanged.\nHowever, this data is for last month, and analysts suggest it is the \"calm before a storm\".\nExact predictions are difficult, but here are three key areas where inflation is expected to rise.\nA host of household bills went up at the start of April, on top of continued rent rises.\nThey included utilities such as domestic energy and water. Council tax also rose significantly for millions of people, and there were hikes for many on phone and broadband contracts, as well as the TV licence.\nFor businesses, the rise in employer National Insurance contributions in April may have led them to immediately put up their prices.\nSome of these increased costs will feed into the next set of inflation data published in May. As a result, analysts think this will see the inflation rate quickly climb over 3% (remember the government and Bank of England's target is 2%).\nAfter that, there's significant uncertainty. Commentators suggest inflation may not stay as high, for as long, as previously thought, for reasons we'll come to next.\nThe rollercoaster ride of US tariff policy has dominated the headlines and airwaves in the last few weeks.\nThe US president announced taxes on goods imported into the US from around the world, then rowed back or delayed many, but doubled down on Chinese imports. \nSome countries have hit back with tariffs of their own; others - such as the UK - are trying to negotiate.\nWe are in relatively unknown territory in modern economics and the picture seems to change almost every day, so predictions have to be taken with a large dose of salt.\nIn theory, when tariffs are announced, and retaliation comes, then higher taxes all round will make goods more expensive for consumers.\nBut, particularly for the UK, things are far more nuanced. The 10% tariff on UK goods imported by the US is lower than feared, and retaliation looks unlikely. \nIndeed, there are heightened expectations of a UK-US trade deal, rather than a trade war.\nSo, any price rises would be limited.\nChina is facing massive 145% tariffs on all its goods bound for the US. If that puts up barriers to the US market, it may find other places to sell its - often cheaply manufactured - products, such as the UK.\nA so-called dumping of cheap Chinese products in the UK will increase price competition and could slow the rate of inflation.\nGrowth in the UK economy has been sluggish for some time, although the latest data was more positive than many had expected.\nBut, again connected to the issue of tariffs, there are warnings that the improvement in UK economic growth could be short-lived with some even predicting a recession.\nThat's not good news for the government, which has made economic growth its priority. \nNor is it good news for workers, whose job security becomes less stable if businesses draw back on investment and start to cut costs.\nNo job means less money to spend. That would bring down the inflation rate, but would be small mercy to anyone who is suddenly unemployed.\nAlternatively, the government's drive for growth could successfully propel the economy against these headwinds. \nAnd there is even greater pressure on policymakers at the Bank of England to help boost growth by cutting interest rates, lowering the cost of borrowing for loans and mortgages.\nCutting interest rates usually adds to consumer demand, and risks raising prices and the rate of inflation further from its 2% target.\nSo the Bank's rate-setters face a delicate balancing act for the rest of the year, starting at their next meeting in May, particularly because nobody is sure how much the tightrope is going to wobble.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.",

Lovely.\"\nMurphy's ball in for Fabian Schar at the end of the first half got the finish it deserved when the Newcastle defender glanced a header into the far corner to make it 4-0.\nMurphy had a goal, an assist and a whole host of other chances created all before half-time.\nIt means, of all the English players in the Premier League this season, only Cole Palmer and Ollie Watkins have more goal involvements than Murphy.\nOr, put another way, Murphy has a higher combined goals and assists total this term than Phil Foden, Anthony Gordon, Morgan Rogers, Marcus Rashford, Eberechi Eze and Dominic Solanke - who were all in the last England squad.\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\nGet Newcastle news sent straight to your phone",

'I did mean it, yeah' - Murphy on openerImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Murphy's opener was hit from a very narrow angleIt is quite odd for a player to have a breakthrough season aged 30, but that is exactly what is happening with Murphy, who did not start more than 17 Premier League matches in a single season until this campaign.Boyhood Toon fan Murphy joined the club from Norwich in 2017.For seven years he was on the fringes of the Newcastle squad, and had been loaned out to West Bromwich Albion and Sheffield Wednesday.But, this season, he has become a star - and a big reason is down to his connection with Alexander Isak.Only Mohamed Salah (18) has more assists than Murphy's 11 in the Premier League this season.Seven of those assists have been for Newcastle striker Isak. \"Murphy's ball in for Fabian Schar at the end of the first half got the finish it deserved when the Newcastle defender glanced a header into the far corner to make it 4-0.Murphy had a goal, an assist and a whole host of other chances created all before half-time.It means, of all the English players in the Premier League this season, only Cole Palmer and Ollie Watkins have more goal involvements than Murphy.Or, put another way, Murphy has a higher combined goals and assists total this term than Phil Foden, Anthony Gordon, Morgan Rogers, Marcus Rashford, Eberechi Eze and Dominic Solanke - who were all in the last England squad.Related topicsPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedFootballMore on this storyLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan viewsGet Newcastle news sent straight to your phonePublished26 July 2022 Lovely. \"He's such a character in the changing room and deserves everything he's getting.",

        "article_text": "She jets around the world for her high-profile beauty career, but her heart is in Seoul. Here are her top K-beauty experiences in town, from face lasers to body scrubs.\nFor Chriselle Lim \u2013 style guru, digital creator and creative director of PHLUR fragrances \u2013 self-care is a way of life. Especially when she visits South Korea, the birthplace of the viral \"K-beauty\"\u2013 \u00a0beloved for its multi-layer \"glass skin\" skincare regimens and high-tech sun creams.\nThe SpeciaList\n(Credit: Chriselle Lim)\nChriselle Lim is a Korean American fashion stylist, entrepreneur and digital influencer. She founded the fashion and lifestyle blog The Chriselle Factor in 2011, leading to collaborations with luxury brands including Dior and Chanel.\n\"Beauty and self-care in Korea is a daily thing,\" says the fresh-faced and flawlessly stylish Lim, who spent her formative years in the glamorous South Korean capital and returns with her daughters each year. \"It's not about hitting a certain age and then taking care of your skin. You just do it since you're a very young girl. As we're trying to reverse [sun damage] here in the States, in Korea, the women have been taught to protect themselves early on. We were always embarrassed about our moms taking us around in their crazy massive sun hats and their gloves. But now I get it. I've become that lady.\"\nWhile innovative Korean products like collagen sheet masks continue to dominate the international market, Korea is also seeing an uptick in beauty tourism. Consumers can visit \"skin clinics\" for medical aesthetic treatments powered by ultra-modern Korean technologies; often not yet approved by the FDA. Adding to the appeal, patients can get several treatments \u2013 from Botox to Titanium skin lifting to liquid laser sun spot removal \u2013 in one sitting with jaw-dropping transformations and little downtime \u2013 compared to Western protocols, which require patients wait 28 days between treatments.\u00a0\n\"I have a lot of followers that ask me for tips and where to go,\" says Lim. \"It makes a lot of sense. One, the technology is there. And two, it's so much cheaper [than the US], at least by five times. The flight there, renting an Airbnb or a hotel; it actually makes a lot of sense because you are saving money in the long run.\"\nNot that Lim ever needs a reason to visit Seoul. \"It's a fast-paced city that is extremely clean, chic, sophisticated,\" she says. \"Just imagine fashion and art and beauty all combined in one. It's one of those places I go whenever I'm feeling like I need inspiration.\"\nHere is Lim's go-to plan for a self-care holiday in Seoul.\nGangnam, the stylish district made world-famous by a certain 2012 K-pop song, is considered Seoul's K-beauty and medical tourism hot spot\u00a0 \u2013 and it's where Lim's self-care holidays start. First stop: Eun Skin Clinic in the affluent Cheongdam neighbourhood, south of the Han River.\nTip:\n\"A tip that people don't realise when planning is that you have to see what side of the river [Han] these places are and try to plan accordingly,\" says Lim. \"Because crossing that river can take so long; traffic is really bad, so you have to figure out the subway system or try to plan everything out in advance.\"\n\"They do incredible lasers, the best I've experienced,\" says Lim. \"They speak really good English there, which is a big make or break for me because I'm not fluent in Korean. And because [the doctor] deals with a lot of English-speaking people, I think she realises that a lot of them are here to explore and have fun, so she doesn't want to be so aggressive with their face. They do a very customised approach.\"\nKorean skin lasers, notes Lim, are so gentle they can even be layered on top of each other to compound their transformative effects.\u00a0\n\"It's very, very gentle,\" says Lim of her most recent visit. \"I did something called Ruby toning; helps with even skin tone and brightening. And there's another laser that I did called MeDioStar\u00ae, which is brightening and tightening. And then on top of that, I did PRP [platelet-rich plasma treatment]. And then I also did microneedling and then salmon DNA. It takes maybe an hour and a half to do.\"\nShe cautions:\u00a0 \"The next day, if you get five to eight treatments, your skin will be slightly bruised, but it goes away within, I would say, 48 hours. [These lasers are] effective on the deeper surface level, but on the topical level, you can't really tell that you've gotten anything done\u2026 But then after I went home, and people were like, 'Wait, did you, did you do something to your face? ' And you're like, 'Okay, I think it's kicking in'.\"\nLim recommends visitors hit skin clinics at the beginning of their trip \u2013 \"first thing when they land\u2026 because these clinics like to check up on you after three-to-five days. During that downtime, you could do coffee and check out some incredible museums and do some shopping.\"\u00a0\nWebsite: \nwww.eunskin.co.kr/\nAddress: 88-37 Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam District, Seoul\nPhone: +\n82 2 546 3322\nInstagram: @eunskinclinic/\nAs part of her downtime from skin procedures, Lim also likes to indulge in relaxing body treatments.\nTip:\nAs exciting as high tech and holistic body treatments may be, the traditional Korean spa experience happens at the jjimjilbang; the public bathhouse. \"Bathhouses in Korea are really interesting,\" says Lim. \"People go there to meet their friends, hang out and eat. They even go there after hours, after the club to detox the alcohol and sweat it out. It's fascinating; they don't really go there for the experience; it's to hang out with their friends.\"\n\"There's this spa called Gogyeol,\" says Lim. \"I love this place to reset my body. They do a traditional Korean massage and scrub.\"\nLike Eun Skin Clinic, Spa Gogyeol is found in Cheongdam; a two-minute walk from the Gangnam-Gu Office metro station. Lim notes that Spa Gogyeol is a not a jjimjilbang (a public Korean bathhouse). \"A lot of people love Korean bathhouses [because] they do this intensive scrub where they literally scrub off all the dead cells off your skin and it just comes purging off your body. It's pretty disgusting. But [Spa Gogyeol does] that treatment in a private setting, so you can get the body scrub, the upgrade massage and a detox wrap. They literally scrub off every dead skin cell on your body, and it just feels so soft. You feel like you're floating.\"\nSpa Gogyeol also offers a rich menu of holistic medical treatments, working with the body's five Tae energies. \"In Korean health, a lot of it is about balance,\" says Lim. \"So they'll really analyse your body to see what they need to focus on, and they'll customise it for you.\u00a0\n\"I think a lot of people that are on holiday just want to relax,\" she adds. \"A lot of tired mamas. It's a very calming space.\"\nWebsite: \nhttps://spa-gogyeol.com/\nAddress: 3F&4F, 13, Seolleung-ro 132-gil, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, South Korea \nPhone: +82 10-7682-1297\nInstagram: @spa_gogyeol\nWhere Eun Skin Clinic is expressly high tech and Spa Gogyeol takes a holistic approach, Lim's next spa pick \u2013 Trinity Spa in Seoul's Yongsan District \u2013\u00a0 is all about pampering and beautification.\nWhen to go\n\"Springtime is beautiful, but autumn is also stunning,\" says Lim. \"I would say a five-day trip would be incredible. There's so much to see in Korea, but even a three-day trip is worth it, just because, again, that the value that you're getting for these treatments are you getting the bang for your buck.\"\n\"It's a little tricky with Trinity spa because their English isn't the best,\" says Lim. \"But I think they're working on it. They're more of a general spa; that's why I feel okay recommending it. They do everything from amazing facials, really focussing on lifting the face and focussing on your lines, and brightening and tightening to body contouring, massages. They cover it all.\"\nTrinity Spa's array of facial and body treatments toe the line between technology and relief \u2013 like the Real Jade Stone V-line jaw contour treatment or the lymphatic drainage leg massages \u2013 all administered in private guest rooms with cushy spa beds designed for ultimate relaxation.\u00a0\n\"It's just a very relaxing experience for someone that wants a general spa experience,\" says Lim.\u00a0\nWebsite: \nwww.trinityspa.co.kr/\nAddress: 3rd floor, Taeseok Building 116 Dokseodang-ro, Hannam-dong, Yongsan District, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-420-0797\nInstagram: \n@the_trinityspa_official/\nThe Korean skincare craze began in the early 2010s; global cosmetic purveyor Sephora's website now features a K-beauty section and Lim herself often provides K-beauty product recommendations on social media.\nSo when in Korea, shop as the Koreans do.\n\"Everyone needs to go to Amorepacific World Headquarters,\" declares Lim. Known as the inventor of the cushion foundation, Amorepacific now also owns many popular Korean skincare companies including Sulwhasoo, Innisfree, Cosrx and Laneige. \"It's open to the public, which a lot of people don't know,\" says Lim. \"In their lobby, you can get your face scanned; a lot of people go there to get their cushion foundation customised\u2026 they have a beauty store in their lobby, so you can experience all of their brands at once. [There's also] an interactive Amorepacific store called AMORE Seongsu. It's in this warehouse-y cement building; it's like you're walking through a store, but with a bathroom installation in front of you while you try things. Everything is technology-driven; you can get customised lip treatments, customised foundation. I could spend hours there.\"\u00a0\nLim adds: \"There's also the Sulwhasoo flagship store, which is just beautiful in itself.\"\nSulwhasoo, a luxury skin line, is headquartered in Seoul's upscale shopping district Sinsa-dong, in a modular structure channelling a golden lantern. \"The shopping is great, and it looks like you're entering an installation,\" says Lim. \"It has two spas. You could have, like, a foot scrub [or] a therapist with the singing bowl around your abdomen.\"\nLim also enjoys shopping for her favourite Korean brands at Olive Young. \"It's the Sephora of Korea,\" she says. \"They're on every corner. But the key thing is to know which one to go to. There's one in Myeongdong, which is the largest. Then the newest one is in Seongsu and it's a lot more tech-driven.\" Apart from beauty shopping, the five-storey Olive Young in Seongsu houses a cafe and a skin and scalp clinic as well as professional makeup services and a \"trend pod\" showroom. \"Olive Young can be slightly outdated depending which one you go to,\" says Lim. \"But this one feels like the future of what Olive Young will be.\"\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.apgroup.com/int/en/our-culture/amorepacific-space/amorepacific-headquarters/amorepacific-headquarters.html (Amorepacific World Headquarters)\nAddress: 100 Hangang-daero, Yongsan District, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-604-05114\nInstagram: \n@amorepacificgroup.official/\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.amoremall.com/kr/ko/store/display?storeCode=001 (Amorepacific Seongsu)\nAddress: 7 Achasan-ro 11-gil, Seongdong-gu, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-469-8600\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.sulwhasoo.com/int/en/flagship/dosan/index.html (Sulwhasoo flagship)\nAddress: 18 Dosan-daero 45-gil, Sinsa-dong, Gangnam District, Seoul\nPhone: +82 2-541-9270\nInstagram: \n@sulwhasoo.official/\nWebsite: \nhttps://global.oliveyoung.com/ (Olive Young Seongsu)\nAddress: 300-65 Seongsu-dong 2(i)-ga, Seongdong-gu, SeoulPhone:  +82 2-461-5290\nInstagram: @oliveyoung_global/\nTo cap off a day of beauty, Lim heads straight for the hair salon. \"This is actually quite common in Korea,\" she says. \"After you get all your skin treatments, you go get your hair done.\"\nLim favours ABYBOM, a massive, three-storey salon on Seolleung-ro that boasts a client roster of Korean celebs like Sandara Park. \"A lot of people that go to events get the full service of hair and makeup done,\" says Lim. \"They do amazing cuts. They style, they detoxify your scalp, if needed. They're incredible.\"\u00a0\nAfterwards, Lim always likes to visit a caf\u00e9. \"Caf\u00e9 life in Korea is so major,\" she says. \"Between caf\u00e9s and skin, you will never see the end of day.\" One of her favourite stops is inside the Dosan Park Gentle Monster branch; 35 minutes outside of Seoul proper. \"Gentle Monster is a sunglass brand; they have the coolest shops ever,\" says Lim. \"It's like an art installation. Then downstairs, there is a cafe called Nudake; they have conceptual coffees and baked goods.\"\nNudake Caf\u00e9 proffers its coffees and whimsical pastries on stark countertops, like modern art displays. \"It sounds so ridiculous, but they have these tiny, tiny, tiny, miniature croissants,\" says Lim. \"They're literally the size of your pinky nail bed, but it's so good, and it's just so fun to take a photo with. [And] they have incredible coffee. It's actually quite hard to find non-dairy milks, but they have non-dairy milk there. So that's personally the reason why I like to go to that caf\u00e9, to just get my lattes without dairy milk.\"\u00a0\n\"There's a lot of things that we have been doing in Korea that I feel like the world is finally noticing,\" adds Lim. \"It's something that I'm very proud of.\"\u00a0\nWebsite: \nwww.abybom.com/\nAddress: 3\n\uce35\n, 40 Seolleung-ro 152-gil, Gangnam District, Seoul\nPhone: + 82-2-516-8765\nInstagram: \n@abybom__official/reels/ \nWebsite: \nhttps://nudake.com/en\nAddress: 26 Seongsui-ro 7-gil, Seongdong-gu, Seoul\nPhone: +82-7-041-284408\nInstagram: \n@nu_dake/\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

A judge denied bail.\nAuthorities say Mr Balmer used Molotov cocktails to start the blaze overnight on Saturday.\nShapiro, his wife, his four children, and guests and staff members were able to escape unscathed, but the official residence in the state capital of Harrisburg was severely damaged.\nAccording to a police report, Mr Balmer, a Harrisburg resident, walked for about an hour from his home, scaled a perimeter fence, used a hammer to break two windows and set the building alight at around 01:30 local time Sunday.\nPennsylvania State Police said Mr Balmer had admitted to them that he removed petrol from a lawn mower and poured it into beer bottles to make the Molotov cocktails he allegedly used in the attack.\nAn arrest affidavit said Mr Balmer had admitted to \"harbouring hatred\" towards Shapiro.\nThe suspect initially evaded state troopers but turned himself in to authorities several hours later. Police said they searched Mr Balmer's home, and found clothes and a hammer matching the items that the attacker was seen wearing and holding on surveillance video captured at the governor's residence. \nAn ex-girlfriend of Mr Balmer contacted police and said that he was responsible for setting the fire, according to the police report. \nOn Monday, Pennsylvania officials said Mr Balmer was transported to a local hospital due to a medical event unconnected with the incident or his arrest.\nIn an interview with CBS, the BBC's US news partner, his mother, Christie Balmer, said her son had struggled with mental illness and recently stopped taking psychiatric medication.\n\"So he was mentally ill, went off his meds, and this is what happened,\" she said.\n\nA Facebook account that matches the name, location and other personal details of the suspect included a number of posts both criticising former President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and mocking supporters of President Donald Trump, a Republican.\nMr Balmer served in the US Army Reserve from 2004-12, according to a US Army spokesperson.\nAt a news conference on Sunday, Shapiro said he was not \"fearful\" but said: \"I'm obviously emotional, worried about my family. I want my kids to be OK.\"\n\"This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society,\" the governor added. \n\"And I don't give a damn if it's coming from one particular side or the other, directed at one particular party or another, or one particular person or another. It is not OK, and it has to stop.\"\nShapiro, who is Jewish, said his family had celebrated the first night of Passover just hours before the arson attack.\nThe governor, a Democrat, was among the top contenders to be Kamala Harris's running mate during the 2024 election but was ultimately passed over in favour of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. He has frequently been mentioned as a possible future presidential candidate.\nShapiro said FBI Director Kash Patel had promised \"all the resources of the federal government\" in investigating the attack.\nIn an online post, Attorney General Pam Bondi praised the swift work of police and wrote: \"I am deeply relieved that Governor Shapiro and his family are safe.\"\nThe governor's residence in Harrisburg is a 29,000 sq ft (2,700 sq m) Georgian-style home built in 1968.\nShapiro has served as Pennsylvania's governor since 2023, after working as the state's attorney general.",

Even then, she reached the semi-finals.\nPoland's Swiatek won both WTA 1,000 titles in Madrid and Italy, before picking up another 2,000 points from defending her French Open title.\nSimply put, she's defending 54% of her 7,276 points over the next six weeks - and world number three Jessica Pegula, breathing down her neck, is defending none.\nClay is Swiatek's best surface, the slower conditions giving her more time on her pacey forehand, backed up by her superb movement around the court.\nBut it's been a tricky year for Swiatek. She lost in the Australian Open semi-finals from match point up, was stunned at the Miami Open by Filipina teenager Alexandra Eala and has cut a stressed, irritable figure on court.\nSwiatek has also had to deal with an upsetting incident off the court, being verbally abused by an \"aggressive and taunting fan\" in Miami.\nA return to her favoured clay might provide a reset for her - as Carlos Alcaraz has shown.\nLike Swiatek, Alcaraz is the defending French Open champion. He too has had a mixed start to the year. He too had a surprise loss in Miami and, like Swiatek, has a tendency to be overly self-critical.\nThe new Monte Carlo champion did not have it all his own way on his run to the title. His quarter-final against Arthur Fils was a tricky, tight encounter, and the Spaniard was second-best in the early stages of the final against Lorenzo Musetti.\nBut Alcaraz found a way through and, ultimately, a way to win. That is something Swiatek can emulate this week in Stuttgart and beyond.\nKatie Boulter and Jodie Burrage teamed up in a brilliant doubles performance to secure Great Britain's place in September's Billie Jean King Cup Finals.\nEmma Raducanu is in talks with former player turned commentator Mark Petchy about appointing him as her new coach.\nThe legendary Billie Jean King received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nThere has been very little movement on the WTA side, with players either practising or competing at the Billie Jean King Cup, which does not offer ranking points.\nOn the men's side, Lorenzo Musetti's Monte Carlo run has left him knocking on the door of the world's top 10.\nOwner of a one-handed backhand - one of the most beautiful sights in tennis - Musetti beat defending champion Stefanos Tsitsipas and 10th-ranked Alex de Minaur to reach the final. \nHe will be hoping the thigh injury that hampered him against Alcaraz will not hold up his clay season too much.\nThe Stuttgart Open, where the winner walks away with a new Porsche, is the big event on the WTA Tour this week.\nSeven of the world's top 10 are there, including Aryna Sabalenka, Jessica Pegula and Mirra Andreeva.\nFormer US Open champion Bianca Andreescu, who has been plagued by injury since her 2019 win, is set to make her first appearance of the year at the Open de Rouen in France.\nOn the men's side, Alcaraz heads up the Barcelona Open field, alongside defending champion Casper Ruud and Andrey Rublev, while Alexander Zverev is top seed at the Munich Open.\nBritish doubles pair Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool began their clay swing strongly, reaching the final of the Monte Carlo Masters.\nThe duo won the first set but ultimately fell 1-6 7-6 (10-8) 10-8 to home favourite Romain Arneodo and France's Manuel Guinard.\nHenry Patten and Finnish partner Harri Heliovaara also reached the semi-finals in Monaco, losing to the eventual champions, while Giles Hussey triumphed at the ITF M15 in Monastir.\nSonay Kartal, fresh from her impressive BJK Cup debut, is the eighth seed at the Open de Rouen, with Harriet Dart also competing.\nCameron Norrie came through qualifying to reach the main draw in Barcelona. Jacob Fearnley lost in the last round but is into the main draw as a lucky loser, as is Billy Harris in Munich.\nElsewhere, Lucy Shuker and Ben Bartram are among four Britons in the wheelchair singles and doubles at the Japan Open.\nWith so many professional tennis tournaments taking place across the world, and across so many levels, it can be hard to keep up with everything from one week to the next.\nAs part of BBC Sport's commitment to offer more for tennis fans, Second Serve will be your weekly round-up of the biggest stories in the sport.\nAs well as the main talking point, you can see which ATP and WTA players are making significant progress - or struggling for form, how the British contingent are doing and what the next stops on the calendars are.\nYou can also sign up to get the latest tennis news from BBC Sport delivered straight to your mobile phone.

The company said it does not expect \"any impact on the continued delivery of reliable rail services\" as it built up a stockpile of steel in anticipation of the plant's possible closure.\nThe virgin steel made in Scunthorpe is also critical for large-scale infrastructure developments, such as building nuclear power plants like the ongoing Hinkley Point C project in Somerset. \nHowever, in March, Jingye said the Scunthorpe site was losing \u00a3700,000 a day, which it said was \"no longer financially sustainable\", and the company began a consultation on job cuts.\nTalks with Jingye last week failed to produce a breakthrough. The government said the company had demanded more than double the government's original \u00a3500m offer with few guarantees it would keep the plant open.\nSpeaking about the company's actions on Sunday, Reynolds said \"it might not be sabotage, it might be neglect\". Rayner said there was \"no evidence\" of corporate sabotage.\nThe Conservatives have criticised the government for not stepping in sooner to save the plant.\nTory shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the party had supported the emergency law because \"it's the least worst option on the table\".",

        "article_text": "As a Brit, I didn't learn about the American Revolution in school. But my children all grew up in the US \u2013 and they did. And I noticed that while the Civil War is often portrayed in all its violence and gruesomeness, stories from the revolution focus on heroism.\nWhen I think of the American Revolution, my mind conjures images of impassioned colonists dumping tea into Boston Harbour. Paul Revere's midnight ride through Massachusetts. George Washington crossing the Delaware River. America united, alone and in the right.\u00a0\nBut 250 years since the war began, it's time for a different, more complex look at America's origin story. I recently spoke with Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Rick Atkinson about the realities of the Revolutionary War that often go overlooked. His latest book on the conflict, The Fate of the Day, comes out later this month on 29 April.\nIt was an eye-opening discussion that taught me a lot \u2013 you can watch or read our conversation here:\nBelow are excerpts from the above conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0\nKatty Kay: It wasn't until recently that I really became aware just of how gruesome the Revolutionary War was. One in 10 Americans who fought in it died, as you recount in your book. The stories from the Battles of Saratoga of 16- and 17-year-olds freezing to death in the fields. I was wondering why you felt it was important to tell that side of the story in your books.\nRick Atkinson: The revolution has kind of a faded lithograph quality to it. The blood has been leached out, but it was a terribly bloody affair. There were at least 25,000 Americans, maybe as many as 35-40,000, who died. That's a larger proportion of the American population at the time to die in any of our wars other than the Civil War. I think the reason that it hasn't been acknowledged to be the bloody affair that it was is in part because of distance. 250 years of distance makes it hard to really feel an emotional connection to the dead. The Civil War, for instance, has photographs of the dead at places like Gettysburg and Antietam. There's none of that in the revolution.\u00a0\nKK: I can see why there was a need in the Revolutionary War to build up the founding fathers into almost Greek gods. Do you think they were sort of put on a pedestal because America needed that as the kind of launch pad of its narrative?\nRA: Yeah, I think that's true. When you've been through an ordeal like the eight-year revolution was, there's a natural sense of believing that those are demigods who managed to win through. But George Washington had feet of clay like all of us do. He had almost 600 slaves at Mount Vernon during his lifetime. It is an awful reminder that the prosperity of this country was largely predicated on bondage.\u00a0\nThe propagandists who were running this country at the time were so effective as propagandists that they had really portrayed the British as evildoers, even though there were atrocities committed by both sides. If you were a loyalist in this country, you were subject to expropriation, jail without a bond, torture and sometimes even execution. We kind of whitewashed that part of the revolution for years, decades, centuries even. We haven't fully acknowledged it, I think, even today.\u00a0\nKK: One thing that you make very clear is that there weren't just two sides in the Revolutionary War; there were actually many sides. There were Americans who didn't want to be independent. Americans who just didn't want to fight. Americans who thought of themselves as British. Benjamin Franklin's own son didn't want independence. Again, I come back to the idea that the story is muddier, perhaps, than we were told for a couple of centuries.\nRA: It makes it a much more interesting story. Benjamin Franklin's beloved son, William, was the royal governor of New Jersey. He got the job partly through his father's influence. And he just refused to buy into the notion that rebellion was legitimate. And he went to jail and eventually into exile. You multiply that by thousands and you see families split apart the same way they were in the Civil War.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Civil War qualities of the revolution extend in other ways. The Six Nations of the Iroquois had gotten along very well for more than a century. And the revolution forces them to choose sides. Four of them align with the British and two with the rebels \u2013 and they're killing each other.\u00a0\nThis is one of the aspects of the revolution that I think has not been fully appreciated by us in our history: the extent to which the war was not just between us and them, but us and us \u2013 on several levels.\u00a0\nKK: I was talking to historian and filmmaker Ken Burns recently about the revolution and he compared the intense divisions in the colonies to South Vietnam during the Tet Offensive. I'm wondering whether you feel that understanding all the muddiness and complexity of the revolution makes the war feel more relevant to a modern audience.\u00a0\nRA: I think when you look at America in 2025 and see these fractious people, you can follow that thread right back to the beginning of the origins of the country. We are a fractious people. We are a bellicose people. We are a violent people. It's not easy to acknowledge. We like to think of ourselves as peacemakers and a force for good, but that is not the only thing we are. I think that understanding who those people were and how difficult they could be at times can help us to reconcile ourselves with the people we are 250 years later.\u00a0\nKK: I also think there can often be this origin-story idea that America did it mostly alone in the Revolutionary War. But your book starts with Benjamin Franklin asking for support from the French. Was that sense of doing it alone something that you were conscious of revisiting when you wrote the book?\u00a0\nRA: Yeah, because otherwise it's not a true story. We don't win the war in 1783 without the French. Franklin's job is to persuade Louis XVI that France \u2013 an absolute monarchy, a Catholic monarchy \u2013 should throw in its lot with Protestant, rebellious, Republican wannabes.\u00a0\nKK: Okay, put like that, I see the diplomatic challenge.\nRA: It took him years! But he was very gifted, and he persuaded the French that joining the war was in their best interest, because the French had grievances against the British. And then, the Spanish come in with support. And then, the Dutch come in. America needed help; that's an important part of the story. When we give a thumb in the eye to our closest friends today, we should remember that we've needed those friends in the past. We will need them again in the future. It's a lesson directly from American wars in the past, starting with the revolution. Winston Churchill said that the only thing worse than fighting with allies is fighting without them.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

From your heart health to your overall risk of an early death, your reaction times can provide a window into the inner workings of the body.\u00a0\n\"Some people just tend to be faster than others, even before ageing effects really kick in,\" says Simon Cox, professor of brain and cognitive ageing at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. \"But a decline in reaction times probably indicates an accumulation of age-related degradation. It's a marker which tells us a lot about the combined functioning of quite a lot of biological systems.\"\nBut how can you assess your reaction time in the comfort of your home?\nOne easy assessment is a well-known experiment known as the \"ruler drop test\". You'll need the assistance of a family member or friend for this one, as well as a ruler:\n\u2022 Sit in a chair, resting your arm on a table so that your wrist is hanging off the edge, with your thumb and forefingers facing up.\n\u2022 Ask your partner to hold a ruler vertically, over your hand, with the \"zero\", where the numbers start, aligned with your thumb.\n\u2022 Without warning, your partner should drop the ruler, while you try to catch it as quickly as possible.\n\u2022 The distance the ruler falls before being caught is an assessment of your reaction time.\nBroadly speaking, an excellent performance equates to catching the ruler at a distance less than 7.5cm, above average counts as 7.5-15.9cm, average is 15.9-20.4cm, while below average is anything over 20.4cm and poor is more than 28cm.\nPopulation studies have noticed a correlation between the speed of decline in reaction times and risk of multiple age-related illnesses. In addition to a person's overall risk of death \u2013 one study found that there was a significant link between a person's reaction times and the likelihood of death from all major causes \u2013 there is also a strong relationship between this metric and the risk of death from specific conditions. This includes coronary heart disease, stroke and respiratory disease.\nA person's reaction times are also associated with their susceptibility to falls, losing the ability to live independently and the onset of dementia.\nHowever, according to Cox, a single reaction time measurement doesn't reveal all that much, as reaction speeds vary considerably from one person to another due to factors ranging from gender to genetics, physical fitness, lifestyle habits and even personality type. Cox notes that what is likely to be more important is how your reaction speed varies if you compare your performance on the same test over time \u2013 for example, at yearly intervals over the course of a decade - and whether it starts to noticeably decline.\nAs Cox points out, our ability to react relies on a network of interconnected sensory systems: how well we see, hear or even smell a given stimulus, how quickly our brain can process the information it's receiving from our eyes or ears and issue a signal in response, and finally how quickly our nerve fibres, muscles and tendons can enact what the brain is telling them to do. \"All these pieces of the jigsaw can be affected by ageing, and not necessarily to the same extent in all people,\" says Cox.\nThere are two components to a reaction to the ruler drop test \u2013 the brain's ability to make a quick assessment that it has been dropped, and the speed with which the body can act on the brain's instructions to catch it.\u00a0\nResearchers have found that the first component of this network which tends to break down, beginning in midlife, is our physical ability to act on the brain's signals. So, our brains might notice that the ruler has been let go within milliseconds \u2013 but it still takes a while for the body to catch up.\u00a0\nAt the University of Colorado Boulder, biomedical professor Alaa Ahmed\u00a0has found\u00a0that as we get older, our reaction times may depend more heavily on our overall bodily health than our brain. She says this may be because things like fast-twitch muscle fibres which enable our physical ability to respond quickly,\u00a0have waned, or because our mitochondria \u2013 the components within our cells which generate energy \u2013\u00a0are working less well, meaning that we're less efficient at moving swiftly.\n\"Making a faster movement is more costly to older adults, so they rely primarily on reacting faster,\" says Ahmed.\nAt the same time, if we stay relatively well, our brain and central nervous system can still function strongly into our latter years. According to Matthew Pain, a professor of biomechanics at Loughborough University in the UK, scientists have assessed this\u00a0by measuring\u00a0the \"startle reflex\" in the ankles of healthy elderly adults in response to a loud sound. The results showed their brain's ability to respond to the sound and send a \"move\" signal to the ankle tends to remain relatively intact.\n\"The raw nervous system hardware in healthy elderly [people] is not that [much] worse,\" says Pain. \"Purely based on the startle reflex, they could still react quickly enough to be disqualified at the Olympics for a false start. They wouldn't, however, be able to get out of the blocks very quickly.\"\u00a0\nAs well as the ruler test, reaction times can be assessed through simple computer games such as the\u00a0Human Benchmark Reaction Time Test which involves waiting for a red box to turn green and then clicking on it as quickly as possible. Sharp deteriorations in performance over time can reflect a combination of sensory systems breaking down, as well as a slowing of the brain's decision-making.\u00a0One study last year\u00a0found that loss of visual sensitivity in seeing and responding to patterns can be one of the earliest signs of dementia, beginning more than a decade before symptoms begin.\n\"With age, the nerve fibres in the brain's white matter can start to communicate signals less efficiently, resulting in slower information processing,\" says Cox. \"Once the decision has been made to react, the nerves that connect your brain to your muscles also need to be in good condition to transmit that message quickly, and these age too.\"\nBut there are things that we can all do to either slow or prevent this decline from happening. Pain recommends so-called dual task training, which involves simultaneous movement and cognitive training activities to tune both the brain and body. Examples include walking while turning your head from side to side, balancing on one leg while reciting the alphabet, or tossing a ball while verbally associating words.\nEven things like such as participating in fitness classes via a TV screen or tablet can help with your reaction times. \"This improves the ability to perceive [a stimulus] and respond with meaningful coordinated motions,\" says Pain.\nCox says that many of the activities which are often linked with healthy ageing, such as continuing to play a sport into later life, learning a musical instrument in retirement or simply keeping engaged with intellectual pursuits such as board games can have knock-on benefits for our reaction times.\n\"Sports performance drills which require fast responses could boost reaction times by enhancing both brain and body,\" says Cox. \"And there's some evidence that generally keeping more socio-intellectually engaged is related to slower cognitive ageing across aspects of complex thinking.\"\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The leaders of Canada's four major federal parties have been grilled about their response to US President Donald Trump and clashed over energy and housing in their first televised debate of the country's election campaign.\nThe French-language face-off marked a key moment in the election as it gave leaders a chance to woo voters in the seat-rich province of Quebec. \nIt was also a big test for Liberal leader Mark Carney, who has a slight lead in the polls, but whose French is the weakest among the federal leaders. He at times struggled to articulate his points on stage.\nThere is a second debate in English on Thursday, before Canadians vote on 28 April. \nOn the stage were the four main party candidates: Liberal leader and current Prime Minister Carney, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, and leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP), Jagmeet Singh. \nThe debate was moderated by Radio-Canada journalist Patrice Roy. \nMr Roy opened the forum saying that Canada's short 36-day federal election had been \"hijacked by Trump\", and asked each leader to outline two campaign promises unrelated to the US or its tariffs.\nBut soon afterwards, Mr Roy plunged into a question on how each party would handle the trade war with the US, calling it the \"elephant in the room\". \nTrump has implemented blanket 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, with an exemption on products covered by the USMCA - a North American free trade deal. Canada is also hit with global US tariffs on steel and aluminium and cars. \nThe president has also publicly mused about Canada becoming the 51st US state. \nPoilievre, of the opposition Conservatives, accused the governing Liberals of weakening the country over the past decade, making Canada more vulnerable to economic threats.\nCarney touted his experience as a former central banker for both Canada and the UK, as well as his time in the private sector.\n\"[Trump] respects people who understand the world and how the private sector works,\" Carney said. \nSingh, of the left-leaning NDP, sought to paint both Poilievre and Carney as the wrong option for Canadians whose jobs may be affected by US tariffs.\n\"Both will cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires,\" he said.\nFor Carney, the French-language debate was arguably the first major test of the campaign trail. \nA second debate will be held on Thursday night with the contenders speaking in English.\nThat forum will be more widely watched nationwide, but the stakes were high on Wednesday for Carney's Liberals, which are leading in Quebec where the majority of French-speaking Canadians live.\nHis French was the weakest on stage, and he often kept his answers brief and sometimes struggled to get his points across in a debate format with opportunities for rapid exchanges.\nHe also faced the most frequent attacks as the others leaders tried to tie him to the Liberal record of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who resigned last month. \n\"We are still talking about the same party, the same caucus,\" the Bloc's Blanchet said. \nHe added: \"It's not because you change the leader that you change your philosophy.\"\nCarney countered that he had accomplishments despite only being sworn in as PM last month. He had \"just arrived\", he said. \nThere was a moment of levity when Mr Roy asked the leaders if they were buying fewer US products - like many Canadians are in the face of tariffs - at the grocery store. \nCarney had admitted in an interview early this month that he does not do his own groceries when asked if he still buys US strawberries. \nSingh and Blanchet both said they bought Canadian berries. Carney said he had given up US wine, while Poilievre said he buys Canadian beef. \nTrump was not the only issue on the agenda. The leaders were asked about their plan to address Canada's housing crisis, and how they would balance climate and the economy.\nOn housing, Poilievre vowed to cut taxes and red tape that he says act as a barrier to home building. \n\"We don't need more bureaucracy, we need more front doors,\" the Conservative leader said in a jab directed at Carney. \nBut the two found common ground on energy, saying the country should ramp up its oil and gas production. \nCarney said climate remains a priority for his party, adding that he would focus on producing \"low-risk\", \"low-carbon\" oil. \nOn immigration, there was also wide agreement that Canada must look at its capacity to integrate newcomers and asylum seekers. \nCanada has seen a rapid population boom in recent years and social and housing infrastructure has struggled to catch up.\nCanadian border officials recently noted an uptick in asylum seekers looking to cross the Quebec-US border as a result of the Trump administration's hardline  immigration policies.\nAbsent from the debate stage was the Green Party. In a last-minute decision by the debate commission, it was disqualified for failing to meet the criteria by not endorsing candidates in at least 90% of Canada's federal ridings, or constituencies. \nThe party, which had two MPs in parliament when the election was called, also failed to meet the threshold of at least 4% in national support. \nGreen Party co-leader Jonathan Pedneault called the commission's decision \"baseless\" and \"undemocratic\". \nIt wasn't the only change to the debate. \nOn Tuesday, the start time was officially moved forward by two hours to accommodate an NHL game between the Montreal Canadiens and the Carolina Hurricanes, with a spot in the Stanley Cup play-offs at stake.",

        "article_text": "Actress Cate Blanchett has said she wants to quit acting to do other things, joining a long line of big Hollywood stars who gave up the red carpets for a different lifestyle.\nThe 55-year-old is seen as one of the most talented and bankable actresses in film, but she has indicated several times in recent years that she's keen to break away from the big screen.\n\"My family roll their eyes every time I say it, but I mean it. I am serious about giving up acting,\" she told the Radio Times in a new interview. \"[There are] a lot of things I want to do with my life.\"\nSpeaking about her experience of being a celebrity she added: \"When you go on a talk show, or even here now, and then you see soundbites of things you've said, pulled out and italicised, they sound really loud. I'm not that person.\n\"I make more sense in motion - it's been a long time to remotely get comfortable with the idea of being photographed.\"\nHer remarks echoed comments she made to BBC Radio 4's This Natural Life last year, when she said she \"absolutely loved\" acting, but also said it would be \"brilliant\" to give it up and spoke about her passion for nature and conservation.\nBlanchett is best known for appearing in films such as T\u00e1r, Notes on a Scandal and Elizabeth: The Golden Age, and won Oscars for her performances in Blue Jasmine and The Aviator.\nShe wouldn't be the first successful actor to switch careers slightly later in life. Here are 10 other actors who retired from acting (including a few who came back):\nThe US actress was one of Hollywood's biggest stars in the 90s and 00s, having made her debut at the age of 21 opposite Jim Carey in The Mask more than 30 years ago.\nInitially finding fame for her goofy performances in romcoms such as My Best Friend's wedding, and comedies including There's Something About Mary, Diaz went on to prove her dramatic acting chops in movies like Being John Malkovich and Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York.\nBut she took a hiatus from Hollywood following her turn as Ms Hannigan in 2014's remake of the musical Annie, confirming her \"retirement\" in 2018. \"I was free to be [like] 'I'm a mum, I'm a wife, I'm living my life' - it was so lovely.\"\nShe said the decade she spent in retirement from acting was \"the best 10 years\" of her life. But she was eventually persuaded to return to screens earlier this year for spy thriller Back in Action with actor Jamie Foxx.\n\nThe Oscar-winning star, considered one of his generation's finest actors, apparently retired in 2017, but it wasn't the first time he had stepped away from the spotlight.\nDay-Lewis, who holds both British and Irish citizenship, has won an incredible three best actor Academy Awards for roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln.\nKnown for leaving long stretches between roles, in the 1990s Day-Lewis went into what he called \"semi-retirement\" and became a shoemaker's apprentice in Florence, Italy.\nHe was coaxed back to acting by Martin Scorsese and his offer of the role in Gangs of New York.\nA statement issued through the star's agent in 2017, when he was aged 60, said he \"will no longer be working as an actor\".\nAgain, however, that proved not to be permanent. Day-Lewis is soon to star in Anemone, the debut feature film from his son Ronan Day-Lewis. Daniel and Ronan co-wrote the script which \"explores the intricate relationships between fathers, sons and brothers, and the dynamics of familial bonds\".\nWhether it's a one-off due to the family connection or the start of a big return to film remains to be seen.\n\nNicholson is one of only three actors (including Day-Lewis, above) to have won three Academy Awards for acting. Two of Nicholson's were for best actor (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and As Good As It Gets) and another for best supporting actor (Terms of Endearment).\nThe legendary star's other famous roles include Easy Rider, The Shining, The Departed, A Few Good Men, Batman and The Departed.\nAlthough he's never formally announced he is quitting or retiring, he previously said his retreat from the spotlight was brought on by a desire to not \"be out there anymore\".\nHis last film role was in 2010 romcom How Do You Know.\nBut just last week, that film's director James L Brooks told Hollywood Reporter: \"I wouldn't be surprised to see Jack work again. I mean, it's been a hunk of time but I don't know. Maybe it could be the right thing. He's reading scripts all the time, I think.\"\nLegendary Swedish screen siren Greta Garbo declared in 1941 at the ripe old age of 36 that she would be taking a \"temporary\" retirement. \nIt proved to be permanent. The Camille and Queen Christina star never appeared on film again.\nAlways the reluctant celebrity, the reclusive actress never played the Hollywood game, refusing interviews and avoiding film premieres and other public appearances.\nThe enigmatic star, whose famous line \"I want to be alone\" from Grand Hotel somewhat mirrored her desire in real life as well as on screen, only succeeded in increasing her mystique by stepping away from the spotlight.\nHowever, she later clarified in an interview: \"I never said: 'I want to be alone.' I only said, 'I want to be let alone! There is all the difference'.\"\nOne of the few silent movie stars to transition successfully to the \"talkies\", Garbo moved away from Hollywood to New York, where she lived until her death in 1990 at the age of 84.\nSynonymous with James Bond, the late Scottish star first found fame through modelling and body-building before landing a few small theatre and TV roles.\nHe made his film debut in No Road Back in 1957, but playing Secret Service agent 007 in Dr No a few years later gave him his big breakthrough. He went on to star in five further Bond movies including From Russia with Love and Goldfinger.\nConnery appeared in numerous other films over his long career, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie, The Man Who Would Be King opposite Sir Michael Caine, The Untouchables (for which he won an Oscar) and The Hunt for Red October. But he would forever be wedded to 007. \nIn 2005, however, he said he was \"fed up with the idiots\" adding there was an \"ever-widening gap between people who know how to make movies and the people who greenlight the movies.\"\nThat declaration came a couple of years after he starred in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which many concluded was one of the main reasons for his retirement.\nThe poorly received comic book caper was to be his final screen appearance.\nKids of the 80s and 90s: You know. This guy was a huge star back in the day, the comedy backbone of popular films such as Ghostbusters, Honey I Shrunk The Kids and the musical Little Shop of Horrors (Suddenly, Seymour anyone?).\nBut then he just seemed to disappear off the face of the earth. So what happened?\nHe began to cut back on work after his wife died of cancer in 1991 to concentrate on raising his children, with his final big screen outing being the 1997 sequel Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves.\n\"I'm a single parent, and I just found that it was too difficult to manage raising my kids and doing the travelling involved in making movies,\" he told USA Today in 2005.\n\"So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn't miss it.\"\nHe did continue to do voiceover work, however, and Moranis was set to make a comeback in a Honey I Shrunk the Kids reboot, which sadly fell through.\nWe sadly lost this acting legend earlier this year, along with his second wife Betsy Arakawa, but the star hadn't been seen on screen for years after retiring from the profession on the advice of his heart doctor - opting for a quiet life in New Mexico. \nHackman shot to fame in Bonnie and Clyde at the end of the 60s and was rarely out of work - in films like The French Connection, Mississippi Burning and Superman.\nHe chose to bow out from acting in the political satire Welcome to Mooseport in 2004.\nExplaining his decision, he told Reuters that he didn't want to risk going out on a sour note.\n\"The business for me is very stressful. The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast,\" he said, \"and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it any more.\"\n\nFonda, from the famous family dynasty, is another star who quit at the height of her fame. \nStarring in 80s and 90s hits such as Scandal (about the Profumo Affair), Cameron Crowe's Singles, The Godfather Part III and Single White Female (everyone wanted to copy that elfin crop, not just Jennifer Jason Leigh). And then... nothing.\nFonda never formally retired, she just seemed to retreat. Her last big screen appearance was in The Whole Shebang in 2001.\nWhen asked in 2023 by a reporter if she would return to acting at some point, she replied: \"I don't think so, it's too nice being a civilian.\" Fair enough!\nFonda's aunt Jane also quit acting in 1990 for several years, explaining later in Vogue that \"she wasn't having fun anymore\". \nBut she later came out of retirement for the romcom movie Monster-in-Law. \n\"It was just a gut feeling of, Why the hell not? It'd been 15 years, and I wanted to act again.\"\nAnother star we sadly lost in the last year, Shelley Duval was best known for her roles in film like The Shining, Annie Hall and Nashville.\nHer step back from the spotlight wasn't just her choice. Movie roles began to drop off in the 90s and then she decided to move back to Texas after her brother was diagnosed with cancer.\nA year before her death, she told People magazine: \"It's the longest sabbatical I ever took but it was for really important reasons - to get in touch with my family again.\"\nDuvall did return to acting in horror movie, 2023's The Forest Hills. \n\"Acting again - it's so much fun. It enriches your life,\" she told People.\n\"[Jessica Tandy] won an Oscar when she was 80. I can still win,\" she joked. Sadly, she didn't get the chance.\nWho could forget 2024 award season's most charming star, Oscar winner and Everything, Everywhere All At Once actor Ke Huy Quan?\nHe first found fame as a child actor in the 80s when he landed the role of Short Round in Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom, before taking another starring role in childhood adventure hit The Goonies. \nA couple of TV roles followed but then the work largely dried up, and he settled for working behind the scenes as a stunt co-ordinator and assistant director.\n\"It's always difficult to make the transition from a child actor to an adult actor,\" he told the Telegraph. \"But when you're Asian, then it's 100 times more difficult.\"\nHe reluctantly gave up - only due to lack of opportunity - and it took years before he took a punt on inventive, off-the wall movie Everything, Everywhere, All At Once, where his role as Waymond Wang won him an Oscar and made him a Hollywood darling once again.\nAdditional reporting by Steven McIntosh",

        "article_text": "The World Health Organization has said conditions at hospitals in Gaza are \"beyond description\", after a major facility was put out of service by an Israeli air strike.\nSpokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris told the BBC it was seeing \"attack after attack\" on hospitals and healthcare workers, and medical supplies were critically low due to Israel's blockade of the territory.\nOn Sunday, staff at al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City said an Israeli strike had destroyed its laboratory and damaged its emergency room. They did not report any direct casualties, but said a child died due to disruption of care.\nThe Israeli military said it hit a \"command-and-control centre\" used by Hamas to plan attacks.\nThe hospital is run by the Church of England, whose bishops said they shared \"grief, sorrow and outrage\" with Palestinians over the attack and called on Israel to provide evidence to support its claim.\nA ceasefire in Gaza ended when Israel resumed its air and ground campaign four weeks ago, saying that military pressure would force Hamas to release the hostages it is still holding.\nAl-Ahli hospital was struck by two missiles around midnight on Sunday - the fifth time it has been hit since the beginning of the war.\nAccording to the Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem, the two-storey genetic laboratory was demolished and the pharmacy and emergency department buildings were damaged. Surrounding buildings were also damaged, including St Philip's Church.\nThe diocese said the Israel military gave a 20-minute warning to hospital staff and patients to evacuate before the attack.\nThere were no casualties as a result of the strike, but one child who had previously suffered a head injury died as a result of the rushed evacuation process, it added.\nLater, WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the UN agency had been told by al-Ahli's director that the emergency room, laboratory, emergency room X-ray machines, and the pharmacy were \"destroyed\".\nThe hospital was forced to move 50 patients to other hospitals, but 40 patients in a critical condition could not be moved, he added.\n\"Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law. Attacks on health care must stop. Once again we repeat: patients, health workers and hospitals must be protected.\"\nThe Israeli foreign ministry said it was a \"precise strike on a single building that was used by Hamas as a terror command and control centre\" and where there was \"no medical activity take place\".\nIt also stressed that an \"early warning\" was issued, and that the strike was \"carried out while avoiding further damage to the hospital compound, which remained operational for continued medical treatment\".\nHamas condemned the attack as a \"savage crime\" and rejected the claim that it was using the facility for military purposes.\nOn Monday, the Church of England's House of Bishops said in a statement they were \"dismayed that hospitals have become battlegrounds in Gaza\" and that Israel had \"yet to provide clear and compelling evidence to substantiate its claim\" that the hospital was being used by Hamas.\n\"Against that backdrop, we call for an independent, thorough and transparent investigation into this attack as well as the alleged misuse of the hospital.\"\nThe bishops also said that \"the extremely limited time given to staff and patients to evacuate the hospital was a further assault on fundamental human rights and basic human dignity\".\nWHO representative Dr Rik Peeperkorn meanwhile told the BBC that al-Ahli was now unable to receive new patients pending repairs, and that this would \"heavily impact trauma patients\".\n\"Al-Ahli was a key trauma hospital north of Wadi Gaza. It is the hospital with the only functional CT scanner north of Wadi Gaza,\" he said, referring to the valley that effectively divides the territory in two because it is an Israeli-designated \"no-go\" area.\nThe charity Medical Aid for Palestinians also quoted an orthopaedic surgeon at al-Ahli as saying that the level of care the hospital could provide to the 40 remaining patients was \"quite similar to that of a hostel\".\n\"We are unable to perform any surgical procedures, as these patients require laboratory diagnostics, pharmacy support, and emergency referrals in case of complications - all of which have ceased entirely due to the recent attack,\" Dr Ahmed al-Shurafa said.\nDr Harris warned: \"We're seeing attack after attack on hospitals, healthcare workers, ambulance workers... the very people that are relied on, who give their all to save lives. But they don't give their all to lose their lives.\"\nOn 23 March, the Israeli military struck the surgical department of Nasser hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, killing Hamas finance chief Ismail Barhoum and one other person.\nHamas said Barhoum was being treated for injuries that he suffered in an earlier Israeli attack. The military denied this, saying he was in the hospital \"in order to commit acts of terrorism\".\nThat same day, 15 emergency workers, including eight Palestinian Red Crescent paramedics, were shot and killed by Israeli troops in nearby Rafah as they responded to a report of wounded people.\nThe Israeli military said the troops \"opened fire due to a perceived threat\" and that six of those killed were \"Hamas terrorists\", without giving evidence. The Red Crescent denied the allegation and accused Israel of a \"full-fledged war crime\".\nOn Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it had received information that a ninth paramedic who had been missing since the attack was being held \"in an Israeli place of detention\".\nThe ICRC's head of sub-delegation in Gaza, Adrian Zimmermann, also warned that the wider shortage of medical supplies \"puts the life and the wellbeing of Gazans who require healthcare services at risk\".\nDr Peeperkorn said they were running critically low because Israel had not allowed in any deliveries of humanitarian aid for more than six weeks.\nHe added that the WHO had stockpiled some supplies in its warehouses during the recent ceasefire, but that the Israeli military was not facilitating transfers between northern and southern Gaza.\n\"Last week, we had a discussion with one of the medical specialists at al-Ahli. He was telling us that they had to use the same surgical gowns and the same surgical gloves for various operations, while we have surgical gloves and gowns in our warehouse in Deir al-Balah [south of Wadi Gaza],\" he recalled. \"We want to bring them, but we are not facilitated.\"\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 50,980 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nA ceasefire deal that began in January and lasted two months saw Hamas release 33 Israeli hostages \u2013 eight of them dead \u2013 and five Thai hostages in exchange for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and a surge in humanitarian aid entering Gaza.\nIsrael resumed its offensive on 18 March, blaming Hamas's refusal to accept a proposal for an extension of the agreement's first phase and the release of more of the 59 hostages it is still holding, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive.\nHamas accused Israel of violating the original deal, according to which there would be a second phase where all the remaining living hostages would be handed over and the war brought to a permanent end.\nOn Monday, a Hamas delegation led by the group's chief negotiator left Cairo without making any progress in talks with Egyptian mediators aimed at reaching a new ceasefire agreement, a senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC.\n\"No breakthrough was achieved due to Israel's refusal to commit to ending the war and withdrawing from the Gaza Strip,\" the official said.\n\"Hamas showed flexibility, regarding the number of hostages to be released in order to make progress. But Israel wants the hostages back without ending the war,\" he claimed.\nIsrael has said it is waiting for a response to its latest proposal, sent at the end of last week.\nIt is understood to have reduced slightly the number of hostages it is demanding should be released in exchange for an extension of the truce and the entry of humanitarian aid.\nA group of hostages' families, known as the Tikvah Forum, said on Monday that the parents of Eitan Mor had been told by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the government was working on a deal that would see 10 hostages freed - down from 11 or 12.

They did not report any direct casualties, but said a child died due to disruption of care.The Israeli military said it hit a \"command-and-control centre\" used by Hamas to plan attacks.The hospital is run by the Church of England, whose bishops said they shared \"grief, sorrow and outrage\" with Palestinians over the attack and called on Israel to provide evidence to support its claim.A ceasefire in Gaza ended when Israel resumed its air and ground campaign four weeks ago, saying that military pressure would force Hamas to release the hostages it is still holding.Gaza medic missing since deadly attack being detained by Israel, Red Cross saysIsraeli air strike destroys part of last fully functional hospital in Gaza CityAl-Ahli hospital was struck by two missiles around midnight on Sunday - the fifth time it has been hit since the beginning of the war.According to the Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem, the two-storey genetic laboratory was demolished and the pharmacy and emergency department buildings were damaged. \"The Israeli foreign ministry said it was a \"precise strike on a single building that was used by Hamas as a terror command and control centre\" and where there was \"no medical activity take place\".It also stressed that an \"early warning\" was issued, and that the strike was \"carried out while avoiding further damage to the hospital compound, which remained operational for continued medical treatment\".Hamas condemned the attack as a \"savage crime\" and rejected the claim that it was using the facility for military purposes.Footage shows damage at Gaza City hospital siteOn Monday, the Church of England's House of Bishops said in a statement they were \"dismayed that hospitals have become battlegrounds in Gaza\" and that Israel had \"yet to provide clear and compelling evidence to substantiate its claim\" that the hospital was being used by Hamas. The Red Crescent denied the allegation and accused Israel of a \"full-fledged war crime\".On Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it had received information that a ninth paramedic who had been missing since the attack was being held \"in an Israeli place of detention\".EPASt Philip's Church, which is on the hospital site, was also damagedThe ICRC's head of sub-delegation in Gaza, Adrian Zimmermann, also warned that the wider shortage of medical supplies \"puts the life and the wellbeing of Gazans who require healthcare services at risk\".Dr Peeperkorn said they were running critically low because Israel had not allowed in any deliveries of humanitarian aid for more than six weeks.He added that the WHO had stockpiled some supplies in its warehouses during the recent ceasefire, but that the Israeli military was not facilitating transfers between northern and southern Gaza. \"We are unable to perform any surgical procedures, as these patients require laboratory diagnostics, pharmacy support, and emergency referrals in case of complications - all of which have ceased entirely due to the recent attack,\" Dr Ahmed al-Shurafa said.Dr Harris warned: \"We're seeing attack after attack on hospitals, healthcare workers, ambulance workers... the very people that are relied on, who give their all to save lives.",

        "article_text": "Decades of industrialisation have polluted the waters of Italy's Mar Piccolo and brought mussel farming to its knees. Can harnessing the power of plants bring back a traditional way of life?\nAdriano Lippo grips the tiller of his small boat, staring out over the dark blue waters of the Mar Piccolo. \"I don't think it will happen this year,\" he says, shaking his head. \"Everything is dead.\" The air carries a scent of salt, heat, and the bittersweet nostalgia of summer's end.\nFor the past decade, Lippo has made the same journey at the end of every summer, steering his boat between the port and the looming smokestacks of Taranto, southern Italy. His task: to transfer mussels from one inlet to the other across the Mar Piccolo, a semi-enclosed bay located between the city and the open sea. The narrow strait connecting the Mar Piccolo's two inlets has always been a lifeline for mussel farmers \u2013 a vital passage to shield their harvests from the contamination that has plagued the first inlet after years of relentless industrial growth.\nThe first inlet has historically been the best site for collecting larvae, and mussel farmers have passed down this knowledge over the generations, explains Giovanni Fanelli, a researcher working with mussel farmers at the National Research Council in the Istituto di Ricerca Sulle Acque (CNR-IRSA). \"The first inlet is closer to the open sea, allowing cooler water to stream in. But for years, it has not been possible to complete mussel growth in that area,\" says Fanelli, as he bends from his boat to collect a submarine data logger, a device used to record and store environmental data underwater.\nWhen mussels reach a certain size, farmers must transfer them to the second inlet, which lies further from the sources of pollution, to complete their growth. This allows the mussels to purge any toxins they may have absorbed during their early growth phase in the first inlet. But last year, rising temperatures killed the mussels before they could even make the trip. Ninety per cent of mussels were lost in the final weeks of September, devastating current yields and jeopardising future harvests.\nOnce the lifeblood of a centuries-old tradition, the Mar Piccolo supported generations of mussel farmers, producing an impressive 60,000 tonnes of mussels annually at the sector's peak in the early 2000s. Since then, mussel farming has been in decline, with pollution and heatwaves exerting ever greater pressure on an already precarious sector.\nNow, researchers and mussel farmers are pinning their hopes on a plan to restore the contaminated Mar Piccolo through phytoremediation, a process where plants are used to absorb harmful toxins. While the approach holds promise for both the environment and the livelihoods of mussel farmers, its implementation faces significant hurdles, including logistical challenges, funding constraints and the ongoing impact of heavy industry in the region.\nKnown as \"the city of the two seas\" because of its location between the Mar Grande \u2013 the open sea \u2013 and the Mar Piccolo, Taranto has long wrestled with the impacts of industrial development. Since 1889, it has hosted Italy's largest naval base and military shipyard, and a major oil refinery and cement plant have been operating since the second half of the 20th Century. More recently, the city has been home to one of the biggest steel factories in Europe, Acciaierie d'Italia \u2013 still referred to locally by the name of its former owners, the state-owned Ilva Group.\nOperational since 1965, at its peak, the factory produced more than 11 million tonnes of steel every year. Over the years, various scientific studies have identified alarmingly high levels of heavy metals and organic pollutants in marine sediments, alongside elevated cancer rates in the areas closest to the factory.\nA trial in 2021 convicted 37 people and three companies for allowing the steelworks plant to emit deadly pollution, which the trial found had caused a surge in cancer in Taranto. However the verdicts were overturned by an appeals court in 2024. New legal proceedings are now underway.\nA vibrant ecosystem home to seahorses, rare seaweeds\u00a0and endangered fan mussels, the Mar Piccolo's low salinity levels create an ideal environment for mussel cultivation. \"What should be, according to human logic, practically a putrid pond is instead a sea rich in biodiversity,\" says Giovanni De Vincentis, President of the Taranto branch of the World Wildlife Fund. The vitality of this ecosystem is largely attributed to the citri \u2013 submarine springs that help maintain relatively stable temperatures, ranging between 15C (59F) and 18C (64F) throughout the year. \"This unique feature acts as a natural temperature regulator for the Mar Piccolo, supporting its rich biodiversity and fostering the growth of the Taranto black mussel,\" explains De Vincentis.\nAs filter-feeding organisms, mussels can accumulate toxic contaminants in their tissues. In 2011, concentrations of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, that exceeded European Union standards were found in mussels grown in Mar Piccolo's first inlet, leading to a temporary ban on mussel farming in the area. Since then, stringent pollution controls have been implemented. \"The local health authority takes samples to analyse. If the product is free of PCBs, dioxins, and other contaminants, they approve us to transfer the mussels from the first inlet to the second,\" explains Lippo.\nFor Lippo and other mussel farmers, the need to relocate their entire mussel crop to the second inlet is increasingly jeopardising their harvest. \"From the moment all this started, mussel farming has been brought to its knees, and the mussel farmers have paid the price. The climate crisis has further accentuated these problems,\" says Fanelli. This past July, the temperature in the second inlet climbed to 31.5C (89F), reports Fanelli \u2013 a level that scientific research indicates can be fatal to mussels. An estimated 9,000 tonnes of mussels, valued at \u20ac8m (\u00a36.72m, $9.07m), perished last year.\nEnvironmental remediation in Taranto has a long and complex history. \"An endless story,\" says Vera Corbelli, the former special commissioner for Taranto's remediation efforts. Corbelli was appointed in 2014 with a mandate to lead targeted interventions to deal with the contamination. During her six-year tenure, she oversaw remediation projects and carried out extensive research covering an area of 564 sq km (218 sq miles), which includes the Mar Piccolo. \"We realised that much of the Mar Piccolo had been used as a dumping ground,\" says Corbelli. \"We found everything \u2013 cars, hospital equipment, washing machines, refrigerators. Removing this debris was our first step.\" Yet further progress on the ground remained frustratingly slow.\nIt wasn't until early 2024, when geologist Vito Felice Uricchio became the new special commissioner for Taranto's remediation efforts, that significant progress began to take shape. Although Uricchio had been working on environmental solutions for years, his efforts are only now translating into tangible policy actions.\n\"It started over 15 years ago,\" Uricchio recalls, of his environmental work in the area. \"There was not only an environmental need but also a social one.\" At the time, Uricchio served as a researcher and coordinator. Alongside Reverend Nicola Preziuso, a priest in the Tamburi district which lies adjacent to the factory, Uricchio and his team of researchers launched a pilot project aimed at providing both ecological restoration and employment opportunities for workers who had lost their jobs. The initiative focused on decontaminating one hectare of polluted land using plants such as the Monviso clone, a species known for promoting PCB biodegradation through its root system.\n\"The first 600 [poplars] were planted, then another 600,\" Preziuso says. \"We kept planting and planting. At first, the plants ranged from 50cm (20in) to 60cm (24in) in height. Over time, they've grown to about 12 to 13m (40 to 43ft), with strong, consistent trunks \u2013 a beautiful sight on a terrain condemned to be contaminated.\"\nAfter a year of planting, chemical analyses revealed significant improvements, demonstrating the method's ability to address both organic and inorganic contamination. Inspired by this success, Uricchio now aims to deploy the technology on a larger scale, targeting the heavily polluted first inlet of the Mar Piccolo.\nThe process can treat soil up to 5m (16.5ft) deep \u2013 the reach of the plant roots \u2013 at a fraction of the cost of traditional remediation methods. \"Traditional soil removal, or 'scarification', involves excavating contaminated soil and sending it to landfills, which is both wasteful and harmful,\" Uricchio explains. \"It takes thousands of years to form just one centimetre of soil from bedrock. Discarding that is criminal.\"\nThe idea of using living organisms to clean up toxic areas is not new. Early research\u00a0primarily focused on the use of microbes to break down waste materials and pollutants. Over time, scientists expanded their studies to include plants capable of performing similar functions. In the 1990s, Rutgers University biologist Ilya Raskin, who first coined the term \"phytoremediation\", demonstrated the technique's potential by using mustard seeds to extract heavy metals from contaminated soil around Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant.\nWhile many plants can absorb organic compounds such as dioxins and PCBs, only certain types, known as hyperaccumulators, are capable of effectively absorbing and tolerating high concentrations of heavy metals. This group includes poplar trees, used in Uricchio's research, as well as other species like sunflowers, some types of grass, and hemp.\nThough current research so far shows promise, Werther Guidi Nissim, an assistant professor at the University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy, says phytoremediation alone is unlikely to fully decontaminate an area as large as the Mar Piccolo. The long timeframes needed \u2013 from a few years for the easiest pollutants to centuries for some metal and organic compounds \u2013 are another bottleneck, according to Nissim.\nInstead, the technique should be combined with other more traditional remediation methods like excavation and soil removal, he says. \"Since, in most cases, sites are polluted by different contaminants, an integration between conventional and green approaches such as phytoremediation could be an interesting idea to explore.\"\nAcknowledging these limitations, the remediation plan for Taranto encompasses both typical remediation approaches alongside more innovative approaches, says Uricchio. \"Phyto-assisted bioremediation will be used in cases where contamination affects the most superficial soil layers or depths compatible with the root systems of the species intended for use,\" he explains.\nIn addition, most phytoremediation projects have so far focused on the use of terrestrial plants on land, says Nissim. In saline environments, salt-tolerant species of plants, known as halophytes, must be used, and while research is still ongoing, they also form part of Uricchio's plan for the Mar Piccolo. Algae species, such as sea lettuce, can also play a role. According to Uricchio, these algae not only help restore ecosystems but also have valuable industrial applications, including in bioethanol production.\nTaranto is one of 42 contaminated areas in Italy designated a \"site of national interest\" because of the urgent need for remediation. The sixth Sentieri Report \u2013 an epidemiological study of communities living in industrially contaminated areas in Italy \u2013\u00a0highlights the severe health risks associated with living in polluted environments. It also warns that even the most well-executed remediation efforts risk being compromised by ongoing or future recontamination.\n\"In places like Taranto, even if we managed to carry out the best possible remediation, the benefits would be completely nullified by the continuation of polluting activities,\" says Agostino di Ciaula, a doctor and researcher of the effects of pollution on human health.\nDespite a ruling by the European Court of Justice last year stating that the heavily indebted steel plant should be shut down if it continues to pose environmental and health risks, it remains operational. Under state ownership since 2020, the plant plans to produce 3.5 million tonnes of steel in 2025, as the Italian government searches for new owners.\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 40kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view.\u00a0Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nIn a joint statement, Giovanni Fiori, Davide Tabarelli and Giancarlo Quaranta, the current commissioners of Acciaierie d'Italia, tell the BBC investments in maintenance have improved efficiency and sustainability, and emissions reductions have been achieved through upgrades to cooling and gas purification systems. \"These efforts are driven by the determination to lift Acciaierie d'Italia out of a period of decline, ensure production continuity, and create the conditions for a more sustainable future.\"\nMeanwhile, Uricchio's broader vision to restore Mar Piccolo faces significant hurdles. Securing full operational permission from the Ministry of Environment and Energy Security took nearly a year, and he is still waiting for the necessary funding. Of the estimated \u20ac500m (\u00a3423m, $566m) needed for Taranto's decontamination, only \u20ac52m (\u00a344m, $58m) is currently available. The Ministry has acknowledged the uphill battle. \"The funds available in the Special Accounting [funds allocated for sites that have yet to be remediated] are partially being used to settle debts left by previous commissioners. Soon additional resources will be unlocked,\" a spokesperson tells the BBC.\u00a0\nMore like this:\u00a0 \n\u2022 Mar Menor: cleaning Europe's largest saltwater lagoon\n\u2022 The rewilded golf courses teeming with life\n\u2022 The giant battery that was once a UK coal plant\nA significant portion of funding was expected from the Contratti Istituzionali di Sviluppo (CIS) \u2013 a government-led instrument aimed at accelerating strategic projects in regions facing economic or environmental challenges, using EU and national funding. In a move criticised by trade unions and environmental groups, a decision about CIS funding for the remediation of the Mar Piccolo was effectively halted in December 2020.\nSubstantial funding is expected this year from the Just Transition Fund, a European Union fund aimed at supporting economic diversification and the energy transition, and the EU Fund for Development and Cohesion. Uricchio has submitted seven funding proposals on green supply chains that the Just Transition Fund could potentially support. These initiatives focus on soil and surface water decontamination and reducing particulate matter.\u00a0 However, Uricchio fears these funds might be insufficient, even if they are approved. \"For this reason, I am advocating for the exploration of additional funding channels,\" he says.\nWith promises of action and new funding on the horizon, the question remains: will it be enough to restore Taranto's future and protect the livelihoods of mussel farmers and citizens?\nThe embattled Uricchio remains full of fight. \"I want to act; I want to remediate as much as possible.\"\n* The travel for this article was supported by a grant from Journalismfund Europe.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\n",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'A long time coming' - BBC Sport NI's interview with Rory McIlroy\nThe clubhouse clock was ticking towards 11pm on the night of Rory McIlroy's greatest day in golf.\nIn the hours that followed his dramatic play-off win over Justin Rose to land his first Masters Green Jacket, the Northern Irishman talked and talked and talked. \nFirst to CBS's Jim Nantz and Augusta chairman Fred Ridley in the Butler Cabin, then to the assembled members for the formal prize presentation. Then numerous television interviews, the media in the sumptuous press building.\nThen to the clubhouse, where he joined club members in the Grill Room to discuss the dramatic preceding hours that had captivated the sporting world. And then more television interviews.\nEventually he emerged into an adjacent room where we had been waiting - BBC Northern Ireland's Stephen Watson and RTE's Greg Allen - colleagues with whom I've shared so much time covering McIlroy's extraordinary career.\nAs he entered the room, the new Masters champion saw us waiting, puffed out his cheeks, leaned forward resting his elbows on the back of a sofa and gave us a look that said it all.\nWordlessly his eyes said: \"Can you believe what has happened? What is happening?\"\nThis video can not be played\nMcIlroy wins Masters play-off to complete career Grand Slam\nThe jacket was a perfect fit, a deeper green than you might imagine and in that moment came the realisation that he had actually done it. The burden had lifted, never again would we be able to ask the questions that had nagged him for more than a decade.\nNow, aged 35, he is an all-time great. Indisputably. He sits alongside Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Ben Hogan and Gene Sarazen - the only male golfers to have won all four of the tournaments that matter most.\nThe Grand Slam eluded some of golf's greatest names; Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson, Lee Trevino, Seve Ballesteros, Sir Nick Faldo and Phil Mickelson.\nNow with five majors, McIlroy moves alongside Ballesteros and trails Faldo by one.  Given that he is the first man from the continent to complete the Slam, Northern Ireland's sporting superstar might have eclipsed Faldo.\nIt could be argued that way, given McIlroy's 28 PGA Tour victories including two Players Championships. Outside his three Masters and three Open titles, Faldo won only three other events that count on the PGA Tour.\nBut it would be churlish to say either way, comparing eras is a fool's errand. What can be said is that McIlroy is in the conversation for being Europe's greatest men's golfer.\nAnd now he has shed a family of gorillas from his back he will be unburdened for future majors. The next one is at Quail Hollow, where he has enjoyed so much success in PGA Tour events.\nThen it's the US Open, a championship he has narrowly missed winning in the past two years, before The Open at Royal Portrush in his native Northern Ireland. Opportunities abound in 2025.\nWhat does McIlroy get for Masters triumph?\nHow coping with 'heartbreak' changed everything for McIlroy \nMasters & Slam success will 'free me up' - McIlroy\nMcIlroy's golfing talent is beyond question. The same could not be said of his temperament because of the weighty burden of an 11-year wait for his fifth major win.\nThe Masters was the biggest hurdle. He feels he should have won it in 2011 when he capitulated to a final round 80.\nIt is the tournament that inspired him to play the game, the one he wanted most. It is why nerves so very nearly got the better of him last Sunday.\nThe biggest battle was with himself.  Golf is a test of nerve and that element undermines any technical gifts, no matter how grand they might be.\nBut somehow he clung on to deny Rose - a 44-year-old, who surely deserves another major and plays this game with commendable grace and class.\nToo often golf sits in the sporting shadows, but last Sunday these two titans dragged the game into a spotlight that has rarely shone brighter.\nMcIlroy now sits alongside the greatest of UK sporting icons. \nSir Roger Bannister, Sir Steve Redgrave, Sir Lewis Hamilton, Sir Andy Murray, Sir Bradley Wiggins, Sir Mark Cavendish, Sir Chris Hoy, Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill, Dame Laura Kenny, Sir Jimmy Anderson - the list goes on and the order can be argued any which way. \nBut you can see where McIlroy might end up.\nThe bottom line is that in golf and in sport in general, McIlroy is right up there. Supremely talented to the extent that he could conquer vulnerabilities that had threatened an under-achiever tagline.\nWe can't say that any longer. There is so much more to talk about when it comes to Rory McIlroy.\nNot speaking to DeChambeau 'part of game plan'\nMcIlroy could win 'five or six more majors'",

Given that he is the first man from the continent to complete the Slam, Northern Ireland's sporting superstar might have eclipsed Faldo.It could be argued that way, given McIlroy's 28 PGA Tour victories including two Players Championships. The same could not be said of his temperament because of the weighty burden of an 11-year wait for his fifth major win.The Masters was the biggest hurdle. Golf is a test of nerve and that element undermines any technical gifts, no matter how grand they might be.But somehow he clung on to deny Rose - a 44-year-old, who surely deserves another major and plays this game with commendable grace and class.Too often golf sits in the sporting shadows, but last Sunday these two titans dragged the game into a spotlight that has rarely shone brighter.McIlroy now sits alongside the greatest of UK sporting icons. He sits alongside Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Ben Hogan and Gene Sarazen - the only male golfers to have won all four of the tournaments that matter most.The Grand Slam eluded some of golf's greatest names; Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson, Lee Trevino, Seve Ballesteros, Sir Nick Faldo and Phil Mickelson.Now with five majors, McIlroy moves alongside Ballesteros and trails Faldo by one.",

Too Late should have lowered Interest Rates, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now.\"\nWhile oil prices have fallen since the start of the month when Trump unveiled his tariff regime, eggs prices have risen to $6.23 per dozen, according to official data. \nMeanwhile, the BBC has found no evidence for Trump's claims about how much money the US is collecting from tariffs.\nAs Trump attacked Powell, Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB defended her American counterpart. \n\"I have a lot of respect for my friend and esteemed colleague Jay Powell,\" said Lagarde as she discussed the decision to cut European interest rates from 2.5% to 2.25%. \n\"We have a solid, steady relationship amongst central bankers.\"\nThe president lashed out after Powell said on Wednesday that US economic growth will be hit and prices will rise for consumers as a result of Trump's tariffs.\nHe said the import taxes were larger than the bank had expected, going beyond the higher end of its estimates.\nThere has been turmoil on global stock markets as investors reacted to the tariffs and an escalating trade war between the US and China.\nMr Powell said: \"The level of the tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated. \n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.\"\nThe US president has said tariffs will boost US manufacturing and jobs but economists have warned they risk fuelling inflation. Trump campaigned on cutting inflation. \nIt is not the first time that Trump has targeted Powell, who he nominated to replace Janet Yellen who the president accused of keeping interest rates too low.\nThe president's campaign promises included calls for lower interest rates in order to bring relief to borrowers.\nSince returning to office, Trump has stoked a trade war by introducing a 10% tax on goods being imported to the US from the vast majority of countries.\nHe has escalated tariffs further with China by putting a 145% tax on Chinese goods, though there are some exemptions for smartphones. China has hit back with tariffs of 125% on US products. The White House said on Wednesday that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nMr Powell said that despite the uncertainty and ructions in the markets, the \"US economy is still in a solid position\".\nFor now, he said, the Fed could keep its benchmark interest rate steady \"to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments\".\nThe Fed's benchmark interest rate is currently set in a range between 4.25% and 4.5%, where it has been since December following a series of rate cuts late last year.\nIf tariffs push up inflation, as many economists expect, the Fed could decide to hold or even raise rates. Traders on Wednesday kept their bets it will continue to cut rates this year.\nBut the Fed also has a mandate to maintain maximum employment as well as stable prices.\nShould it be caught between rising inflation and a rising unemployment rate, Mr Powell said \"we would consider how far the economy is from each goal\" and then look at \"the potentially different time horizons\" for getting prices under control and bringing the unemployment rate down.\n\"As that great Chicagoan Ferris Bueller once noted, \"life moves pretty fast\", he added.",

I have all this adrenaline and I'm just standing here.\"\n\"Whatever you dream of is in our reach, especially in today's day and age. Dream big, wish for the stars\u2014and one day, you could maybe be amongst them,\"\u200b she added.\nOprah Winfrey spoke about her friend Gayle King, and revealed she was a nervous flier.\n\"I mean, for her\u2014whew\u2014anytime we're on a flight, she's in somebody's lap at the slightest bit of turbulence. She has real, real-world anxiety when it comes to flying. And this... this is her overcoming a wall of fear,\" she said.\nThe spacecraft was fully autonomous, requiring no pilots, and the crew did not manually operate the vehicle.\nThe last all-female spaceflight was over 60 years ago when Soviet Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to travel into space on a solo mission aboard the spacecraft Vostok 6. \nSince then, there have been no other all-female spaceflights but women have made numerous significant contributions. \nThe space tourism  industry is still in its infancy, so every successful launch is significant and demonstrates that these short, commercial flights can be carried out safely.\nBut some critics stress it is tourism, not space science, and professional astronauts undertake missions, including scientific research, for the benefit of humankind.\n\"A celebrity isn't an envoy of humankind - they go into space for their own reasons,\" Dr Kai-Uwe Schrogl, special advisor for political affairs at the European Space Agency, told BBC News.\n\"These flights are significant and exciting, but I think maybe they can also be a source of frustration for space scientists,\" he added. \"We see space flight as being for science, knowledge and the interests of humanity.\n\"Celebrities do it for amusement but get a lot more attention than the regular astronauts.\"\nThe space flight also generated a range of response on social media, from enthusiasm to hostility.\nDr Tanya Harrison, from the Outer Space Institute experts network said: \"A lot of the comments that I saw on social media were things about, 'Oh, it's like the Real Housewives go to Mars' or 'It's the oligarchy in space, read the room, the timing is terrible.'\"\nBut: \"There were a lot of positive takes as well. People were like, 'Oh, this is so cool. Katy Perry is going to space.'\"\nDr Harrison, who had previously worked on Nasa missions to Mars said: \"The cynical part of me wants to call it a marketing stunt. This is a company promoting the fact they can launch tourists into space.\"\nHowever she noted the all-women team might \"change the demographics a little bit of who might want to do something like this.\"\n\"Socially, they might have had some impact\", she said.\nIn a news conference after the flight, two of the women took issue with some of the criticism the mission had received, related for example to its cost.\n\"I feel that anybody who is criticising doesn't really understand what's happening here,\" said Gayle King.\nShe said that the astronauts had had a huge, positive response from young women and young girls.\nLauren S\u00e1nchez said she had got \"fired up\" about the criticism and would love to have the naysayers come to Blue Origin and see the thousands of employees who \"put their heart and soul into\" the missions.\nBlue Origin is a private space company founded in 2000 by Bezos, the billionaire entrepreneur who also started Amazon.\nAlthough Blue Origin has not released full ticket prices, a $150,000 (\u00a3114,575.85) deposit is required to reserve a seat\u2014underlining the exclusivity of these early flights.\nAlongside its suborbital tourism business, the company is also developing long-term space infrastructure, including reusable rockets and lunar landing systems. \nThe New Shepard rocket is designed to be fully reusable and its booster returns to the launch pad for vertical landings after each flight, reducing overall costs.\nAccording to US law, astronauts must complete comprehensive training for their specific roles.\nBlue Origin says its New Shepard passengers are trained over two days with a focus on physical fitness, emergency protocols, details about the safety measures and procedures for zero gravity.\nAdditionally, there are two support members referred to as Crew Member Seven: one provides continuous guidance to astronauts, while the other maintains communication from the control room during the mission.\nThe rise of space tourism has prompted criticism that it is too exclusive and environmentally damaging.\nSupporters argue that private companies are accelerating innovation and making space more accessible.\nProfessor Brian Cox told the BBC in 2024: \"Our civilisation needs to expand beyond our planet for so many reasons,\" and believes that collaboration between NASA and commercial firms is a positive step.\nRocket engine exhaust contains gases and particles that can affect Earth's climate and ozone layer.\nOn its web page under the title \"Protecting our Planet\" Blue Origin claims: \"During flight, the only byproduct of New Shepard's engine combustion is water vapor with no carbon emissions.\"\nHowever, Eloise Marais, a professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Air Quality\u00a0at University College London points out that water vapour too is a greenhouse gas and is a chemical that is not supposed to be in the upper layers of the atmosphere.\n\"It alters the chemistry of the stratosphere, depleting the ozone layer, and also forms clouds that affect climate,\" she says.\nExperts say that as more rockets are launched, the risks of harming the ozone layer increases.\nThe high cost of space tourism makes it inaccessible to most people, with these expensive missions out of reach for the majority.\nCritics, including actress Olivia Munn, questioned the optics of this particular venture, remarking \"there's a lot of people who can't even afford eggs,\" during an appearance on Today with Jenna & Friends.\nAdditonal reporting by Kate Stephens, BBC Climate and Science.",

        "article_text": "\"What's in the box?\"\nThat's the question fans of Lost Records: Bloom & Rage have been asking since February, when the first part of the narrative adventure game dropped.\nThe story follows a group of female friends, hopping between their lives as teenagers in the 1990s and as adults in the present.\nThey are reunited by a mysterious package that threatens to expose a dark secret they've suppressed for 27 years.\nPart one, Bloom, was praised by fans for its characters and LGBT representation, even if it left them with an almighty cliffhanger to ponder. \nBBC Newsbeat caught up with creative director Michel Koch, executive producer Luc Baghadoust and lead actress Olivia Lepore to discuss the reaction to it, and what to expect from part two - Rage.\nLost Records is made by Don't Nod, the original developers of The Life is Strange series, first released in 2015.\nThe episodic adventure's narrative unfolded depending on player choices, and was praised for its emotional depth.\nIt was also unafraid to tackle difficult subjects rarely seen in video games at the time. \nLost Records is seen as a spiritual successor and uses a similar, episodic structure, split across two \"tapes\".\nWhile the first was well-received by critics, a common criticism was its slow pacing, with a heavy focus on characters and relationships over big story moments.\nMichel admits that was \"definitely a gamble\".\nBut he says the team wanted to recreate the feeling of a never-ending teenage summer, focusing on \"those moments of enjoying doing nothing in a world where we are always pressurised to do something\". \n\"Just sometimes having the opportunity to enter a world where you can be peaceful and enjoy the mood, I think it's important,\" he says.\nLost Records features an all-female cast, LGBT themes and touches on social issues such as body image.\nThat made it a target for what Luc and Michel call a \"vocal minority\" online who target releases they consider to be \"woke\".\n\"We are in a weird time for that right now,\" says Michel.\n\"We are making games for people who want those kind of games.\n\"I think video games need to start to be more mature about that. \n\"It's OK that there are a lot of different games and different genres and different audiences. \n\"It doesn't mean that because something exists, it's a threat to the other things you like.\" \nExec producer Luc admits the game is not for everyone but has so far had a \"great reaction\" from fans who've clicked with it.\n\"We made a game we would want to play,\" he says.\n\"It's a way to really express what you wanted to and reach a different audience.\"\nLost Records has generated discussion around its portrayal of issues many teenagers deal with.\nWhen the game was first revealed there was a focus on the fact characters had visible acne scars - an unusual feature for a video game - and references throughout to Swann's struggles with her weight. \nMichel says the creators didn't want to make issues like this a main theme of the game.\n\"But it's still present, because in the '90s, there was still, of course, the peer pressure from the parents to, I don't know, just start a diet,\" he says.\nThe main focus of tape one, Michel says, was having the characters find a group of close friends who would accept them for who they were.\n\"That's where you can start to accept yourself even more,\" he says. \n\"Because they are the reflection of who you are and if they like you, it means that you are likeable and you can love yourself.\"\nOlivia Lepore, who plays main character Swann Holloway, tells Newsbeat a lot of the game's themes - and her character's story - resonated with her.\n\"I think part of the reason I got this role is because we have so much in common,\" she says. \n\"And I didn't feel like I had to put on a character playing her. I definitely just, in many ways, got to be myself.\"\nOlivia says that she's been blown away by the response from fans, who've identified with many of the themes and issues raised in the game.\n\"I have gotten some really beautiful messages from fans about how they feel like they connect with Swann,\" she says.\n\"I've been really touched by some of the messages to the point where it could be a bit overwhelming, because I just empathise so much with everybody's story.\"  \nAs for the conclusion of the story, Olivia says \"expect the unexpected\".\n\"Wherever you think it's going. It's probably not,\" she says.\nMichel says choices players made in part one will play out in the second, which is set to go to some darker places - and be much more dramatic.\n\"You can expect things to be, let's say, less happy and sunny and more gloomy than tape one.\n\"And we can't wait for you to open the box.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

But they are not alone in feeling the pain of this economic war.\n\"We are worried. What if Trump doesn't change his mind? That will be a dangerous thing for our factory,\" says Mr Xu.\nNearby, Amy is helping to sell ice cream makers at her booth for the Guangdong Sailing Trade Company. Her key buyers, including Walmart, are also in the US.\n\"We have stopped production already,\" she says. \"All the products are in the warehouse.\"\nIt was the same story at nearly every booth in the sprawling Canton Fair in the trading hub of Guangzhou.\nWhen the BBC speaks to Mr Xu, he is getting ready to take some Australian buyers to lunch. They have come looking for a bargain and hope to drive down the price.\n\"We will see,\" he says about the tariffs. He believes Trump will back down.\n\"Maybe it will get better in one or two months,\" Mr Xu adds with his fingers crossed. Maybe, maybe...\"\nLast week, President Trump temporarily paused the vast majority of tariffs after global stock markets tumbled, and a sell-off in the US bond market. \nBut he kept the import levies targeted at Chinese goods being shipped to the US. Beijing responded by imposing its own 125% levies on American imports.\nThis has bewildered traders from more than 30,000 businesses who have come to the annual fair to show off their goods in several exhibition halls the size of 200 football pitches.\nIn the homeware section, firms displayed everything from washing machines to tumble dryers, electric toothbrushes to juicers and waffle makers. Buyers come from all over the world to see the products for themselves and make a deal.\nBut the cost of a food mixer or a vacuum cleaner from China with the added tariffs are now too high for most American firms to pass on the cost to their customers.\nThe world's two largest economies have hit an impasse and Chinese goods meant for US households are piling up on factory floors.\nThe effects of this trade war will likely be felt in kitchens and living rooms across America, who will now have to buy these goods at higher prices.\nChina has maintained its defiant stance and has vowed to fight this trade war \"until the end.\"\nIt is a tone also used by some at the fair. Hy Vian, who was looking to buy some electric ovens for his firm, waved off the effects of tariffs.\n\"If they don't want us to export \u2013 then let them wait. We already have a domestic market in China, we will give the best products to the Chinese first.\"\nChina does have a large population of 1.4 billion people and in theory this is a strong domestic market.\nChinese policymakers have also been trying to stimulate more growth in a sluggish economy by encouraging consumers to spend.\nBut it is not working. Many of the country's middle classes have invested their savings in buying the family home, only to watch their house prices slump in the last four years. Now they want to save money \u2013 not spend it.\nWhile China may be better placed to weather the storm than other countries, the reality is that it is still an export-driven economy. Last year, exports accounted for around half of the country's economic growth.\nChina also remains the world's factory \u2013 with Goldman Sachs estimating that around 10 to 20 million people in China may be working on US-bound exports alone. \nSome of those workers are already feeling the pain. \nNot far from the Canton Fair, there are warrens of workshops in Guangdong making clothes, shoes and bags. This is the manufacturing hub for companies such as Shein and Temu.\nEach building houses several factories on several floors where workers will labour for 14 hours a day.\nOn a pavement near some shoe factories, a few workers were squatting down to chat and smoke.\n\"Things are not going well,\" says one, who was unwilling to give his name. His friend urges him to stop talking. Discussing economic difficulties can be sensitive in China.\n\"We've had problems since the Covid pandemic, and now there's this trade war. I used to be paid 300-400 yuan ($40-54) a day, and now I will be lucky if I get 100 yuan a day.\"\nThe worker says it is difficult to find work these days. Others making shoes on the street also told us they only earned enough to live a basic life.\nWhile some in China feel pride in their product, others feel the pain of increasing tariffs and wonder how this crisis will end.\nChina is facing the prospect of losing a trading partner which buys more than $400bn (\u00a3302bn) worth of goods each year, but the pain will also be felt on the other side, with economists warning that the US could be heading for a recession.\nAdding to the uncertainty is President Trump, who is known for his brinkmanship. He has continued to push Beijing and China has refused to back down.\nHowever, Beijing has said it will not add any more to the current 125% tariff rate on US goods. They could retaliate in other ways \u2013 but it offers the two sides some breathing room from a week that sparked an economic war.\nThere is reportedly little contact between Washington and Beijing and neither side appears willing to head to the negotiating table any time soon.\nIn the meantime, some companies at the Canton Fair are using the event to try to find new markets.\nAmy hopes her ice cream makers will head in a new direction.\n\"We hope to open the new European market. Maybe Saudi Arabia - and of course Russia,\" she adds.\nOthers believe there is still money to be made in China. Among them is Mei Kunyan, 40, who says he is earning around 10,000 yuan a month at his shoe firm which sells to Chinese customers. Many major shoe manufacturers have moved to Vietnam where labour costs are cheaper.\nMr Mei has also realised something that businesses around him are now discovering: \"The Americans are too tricky.\"",

I don't see it\u2026 it's more difficult than being a player,\" said Ronaldo.\n\"If I can be a club owner, why would I be a manager, sporting director or CEO? That is a dream of mine and I am sure I'll be a club owner. I hope to have not just one club, but several clubs.\"\nOther players have gone one step further by investing in football clubs before retirement.\nKylian Mbappe (SM Caen), Sadio Mane (Bourges Foot 18) Juan Mata (San Diego FC), Wilfried Zaha (AFC Croydon), Cesar Azpilicueta (Hashtag United) and Hector Bellerin (Forest Green) are just some of the names who appear to be planning for life after football.\n\"I've got no interest in being a manager. It's not a passion of mine,\" said David Beckham (co-owner of Inter Miami and Salford City).\n\"Being a coach is too much work,\" said Zlatan Ibrahimovic (investor in Hammarby and senior advisor at AC Milan).\nBoth Beckham and Ibrahimovic had public run-ins with managers during their playing careers and it could be argued they are better suited at the top of the tree, rather than managing a squad of 25 players and taking instructions from a board of directors.\nFootball finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport: \"Footballers do not necessarily want to go into a coach/management role because of the stresses it brings.

Swansea is losing \u00a3450,000 a week. He will bring his expertise to the table,\" said Maguire.\n\"Luka Modric is not a brand like Ronaldo, Beckham or Mbappe. He is just a very good footballer. Modric wouldn't be named in a list of top 10 well-known players. \nMaguire added: \"If a player is a brand in their own right, there are financial benefits for them and their clubs. But they do it for the love of the game and it allows them to stay in the realms of football.\"\nThat is not to say pursuing football club ownership is not without risk.\nIn July 2024, Mbappe completed the takeover of Ligue 2 side Caen, investing \u00a312.6m in a majority stake. His first season in club ownership is likely to end with relegation for the French team.\nSpain's all-time top goalscorer David Villa was a co-founder of Queensboro FC. Since the club was announced in November 2019, they are yet to make their debut in the USL Championship, the second tier of football in the United States.\nEden Hazard was announced as the co-owner - along with former Chelsea team-mate Demba Ba - of San Diego 1904, who were set to play in the North American Soccer League (NASL). The league collapsed before the club could play their first game.\nMeanwhile, the 'Class of 92' led by Gary Neville are aiming to take Salford City to the Championship by 2029. The club reached the English Football League with four promotions in five years but have remained in League Two since 2019.\nPlayers are actively seeking out opportunities to learn about the business side of the game.\nAjax's Jordan Henderson, Aston Villa's Tryone Mings, and Manchester City's Ilkay Gundogan are just some of those taking courses in football business management.\n\"The PFA [Professional Footballers Association] has its own business school. Helping assist players from dressing room to boardroom. Rather than the dugout,\" Maguire added.\n\"Footballers have a unique understanding of the game. They can combine skills they have gained from their playing days and can bring that to the boardroom\".\nFormer Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler is enrolled on the PFA Business School's Sporting Directorship programme.\n\"There is more to football than playing and coaching. It just isn't about playing and I find that fascinating,\" said Fowler.\n\"We want to see the game grow and be part of it. Coaching and managing is difficult and this job is extremely difficult.

        "article_text": "Harvard University says it will not acquiesce to US President Donald Trump's demands - whether it continues to get federal funding or not.\n\"No government - regardless of which party is in power - should dictate what private universities can teach,\" Harvard's president Alan Garber said in a letter posted on the university's website.\nNot long after Harvard refused to agree to the White House's sweeping list of demands - which included directions on how to govern, hire and teach - the Trump administration froze $2.2bn (\u00a31.7bn) of federal funds to the institution. \n\"Everyone knows that Harvard has 'lost its way,'\" Donald Trump wrote on social media on Wednesday morning. \"Harvard is a JOKE, teaches Hate and Stupidity, and should no longer receive Federal Funds.\"\nMany students and alumni lauded the university's decision to stand its ground, despite the consequences. Former President Barack Obama, an alumnus himself, called Trump's move \"ham-handed\" and praised Harvard as \"an example for other higher-ed institutions\". \nIn response to Harvard's decision to refuse the government's demands, the education department accused the university of a \"troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges \u2013 that federal investment does not come with the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws\".\nWith billions in the balance, the battle for the higher ground in the case of Harvard may just be the opening salvo in a war of attrition between the federal government and higher education.   \nTrump's attacks on Harvard are not isolated - the government's antisemitism task force has identified at least 60 universities for review.\nNor did the latest move come out of the blue. Trump and his Vice-President JD Vance have long railed against higher education institutions. In 2021, Vance gave a speech that described universities as the \"enemy\". \nTrump pitched a funding crackdown on universities in his presidential campaign, painting them as hostile to conservatives. Almost a year before the present conflict in Gaza began in October 2023, he introduced a free speech policy initiative that promised to \"shatter the left-wing censorship regime\" - in part targeting campuses.\nPolling by Gallup last summer suggested that confidence in higher education had been falling over time among Americans of all political backgrounds, partly driven by a growing belief that universities push a political agenda. The decline was particularly steep among Republicans.\nAt issue now, Trump's team says, is last year's pro-Palestinian campus protests, which roiled colleges across the country. During the demonstrations and sit-ins, some Jewish students said they felt unsafe and faced harassment. Others joined the protests against Israel's military action in Gaza and US support for it.\nLast month, Columbia University agreed to many of the administration's demands in the wake of the protests - after the government cut $400m in funding.\nHarvard, too, made concessions.  It agreed to engage with the administration's task force to combat antisemitism. The school dismissed the leaders of its Center for Middle Eastern Studies and suspended its Religion, Conflict, and Peace Initiative over accusations of anti-Israel bias. \nAnd in January, Harvard settled two lawsuits brought by Jewish students alleging antisemitism. It did not admit any wrongdoing, and said the settlement showed its commitment to supporting its Jewish students and staff.\nBut the university drew the line at the White House's list of demands on Friday. \nHarvard student Sa'maia Evans, who is an activist and member of the university's African and African American Resistance Organization, said the university's decision to take a stand was a long time coming.\n\"Harvard will only do that of which it is held accountable to,\" she told the BBC. She pointed to campus protests in the past few weeks - and the widespread criticism of Columbia's agreement with the Trump administration - as helping to put pressure on university officials. \n\"They know the public - they would experience public backlash\" if they capitulated, Ms Evans said.\n\"It would be atypical (for) Harvard to do anything outside of what would be in its own interest.\"\nWith a $53.2bn endowment - a figure that is larger than the GDP of some small countries - Harvard is uniquely able to weather the storm. But experts say it is still left in a crunch.\n\"Most policymakers think of endowments as a chequing account, a debit card where you can withdraw money and use it for any purpose,\" said Steven Bloom, the spokesperson for American Council on Education. \"But it's not.\"\nWhile Harvard's endowment is eye-popping, it says 70% of the money is earmarked for specific projects - which is typical for educational endowments, according to Mr Bloom. \nHarvard has to spend the money the way the donors have directed, or it risks legal liability.\nAnd Harvard's expenses are huge - its 2024 operating budget was $6.4bn. About a third of that was funded by the endowment - with 16% coming from the federal government, often to help with things that are supposed to create good for the whole of the US, such as biomedical research. \nMr Bloom said the golden rule for endowment finance was that universities should not spend more than 5% of their total endowment each year. Making up for a $2bn loss means the school will need to boost its endowment by $40bn.\n\"You can't find 40 billion dollars under a rock,\" Mr Bloom said. \nAnd that pain will only increase if Trump is able to make good on his threat to remove Harvard's tax-exempt status. That status helps the school avoid paying taxes on its investments and properties. Harvard has campuses all over the Greater Boston area, and is estimated by Bloomberg to have saved $158m on its property tax bills in 2023.\nIn his latest comments on the university, early on Wednesday, Trump attacked the \"radical left\" Harvard leadership and said the institution could \"no longer be considered even a decent place of learning\".\nThe realities of the situation have made some students sceptical about how long it can go on.\n\"There's more the government can do if it wants to attack Harvard, and I'm not optimistic that it's going to stop after cutting $2.2 billion,\" Matthew Tobin, the academic representative on Harvard's student council.\nMr Tobin said the idea that the Trump administration was making these demands to help Harvard is \"malarkey\".\n\"Its a total bad-faith attack,\" he told the BBC. \"The funding cuts have to do with Trump attacking an institution that he views as liberal, and wanting to exercise more control over what people teach and how students learn and think.\"\nWith additional reporting from Isabella Bull in London",

Buyers come from all over the world to see the products for themselves and make a deal.\nBut the cost of a food mixer or a vacuum cleaner from China with the added tariffs are now too high for most American firms to pass on the cost to their customers.\nThe world's two largest economies have hit an impasse and Chinese goods meant for US households are piling up on factory floors.\nThe effects of this trade war will likely be felt in kitchens and living rooms across America, who will now have to buy these goods at higher prices.\nChina has maintained its defiant stance and has vowed to fight this trade war \"until the end.\"\nIt is a tone also used by some at the fair. Hy Vian, who was looking to buy some electric ovens for his firm, waved off the effects of tariffs.\n\"If they don't want us to export \u2013 then let them wait. We already have a domestic market in China, we will give the best products to the Chinese first.\"\nChina does have a large population of 1.4 billion people and in theory this is a strong domestic market.\nChinese policymakers have also been trying to stimulate more growth in a sluggish economy by encouraging consumers to spend.\nBut it is not working. Many of the country's middle classes have invested their savings in buying the family home, only to watch their house prices slump in the last four years. Now they want to save money \u2013 not spend it.\nWhile China may be better placed to weather the storm than other countries, the reality is that it is still an export-driven economy. Last year, exports accounted for around half of the country's economic growth.\nChina also remains the world's factory \u2013 with Goldman Sachs estimating that around 10 to 20 million people in China may be working on US-bound exports alone. \nSome of those workers are already feeling the pain. \nNot far from the Canton Fair, there are warrens of workshops in Guangdong making clothes, shoes and bags. This is the manufacturing hub for companies such as Shein and Temu.\nEach building houses several factories on several floors where workers will labour for 14 hours a day.\nOn a pavement near some shoe factories, a few workers were squatting down to chat and smoke.\n\"Things are not going well,\" says one, who was unwilling to give his name. His friend urges him to stop talking. Discussing economic difficulties can be sensitive in China.\n\"We've had problems since the Covid pandemic, and now there's this trade war. I used to be paid 300-400 yuan ($40-54) a day, and now I will be lucky if I get 100 yuan a day.\"\nThe worker says it is difficult to find work these days. Others making shoes on the street also told us they only earned enough to live a basic life.\nWhile some in China feel pride in their product, others feel the pain of increasing tariffs and wonder how this crisis will end.\nChina is facing the prospect of losing a trading partner which buys more than $400bn (\u00a3302bn) worth of goods each year, but the pain will also be felt on the other side, with economists warning that the US could be heading for a recession.\nAdding to the uncertainty is President Trump, who is known for his brinkmanship. He has continued to push Beijing and China has refused to back down.\nHowever, Beijing has said it will not add any more to the current 125% tariff rate on US goods. They could retaliate in other ways \u2013 but it offers the two sides some breathing room from a week that sparked an economic war.\nThere is reportedly little contact between Washington and Beijing and neither side appears willing to head to the negotiating table any time soon.\nIn the meantime, some companies at the Canton Fair are using the event to try to find new markets.\nAmy hopes her ice cream makers will head in a new direction.\n\"We hope to open the new European market. Maybe Saudi Arabia - and of course Russia,\" she adds.\nOthers believe there is still money to be made in China. Among them is Mei Kunyan, 40, who says he is earning around 10,000 yuan a month at his shoe firm which sells to Chinese customers. Many major shoe manufacturers have moved to Vietnam where labour costs are cheaper.\nMr Mei has also realised something that businesses around him are now discovering: \"The Americans are too tricky.\"",

        "article_text": "Actress Cate Blanchett has said she wants to quit acting to do other things, joining a long line of big Hollywood stars who gave up the red carpets for a different lifestyle.\nThe 55-year-old is seen as one of the most talented and bankable actresses in film, but she has indicated several times in recent years that she's keen to break away from the big screen.\n\"My family roll their eyes every time I say it, but I mean it. I am serious about giving up acting,\" she told the Radio Times in a new interview. \"[There are] a lot of things I want to do with my life.\"\nSpeaking about her experience of being a celebrity she added: \"When you go on a talk show, or even here now, and then you see soundbites of things you've said, pulled out and italicised, they sound really loud. I'm not that person.\n\"I make more sense in motion - it's been a long time to remotely get comfortable with the idea of being photographed.\"\nHer remarks echoed comments she made to BBC Radio 4's This Natural Life last year, when she said she \"absolutely loved\" acting, but also said it would be \"brilliant\" to give it up and spoke about her passion for nature and conservation.\nBlanchett is best known for appearing in films such as T\u00e1r, Notes on a Scandal and Elizabeth: The Golden Age, and won Oscars for her performances in Blue Jasmine and The Aviator.\nShe wouldn't be the first successful actor to switch careers slightly later in life. Here are 10 other actors who retired from acting (including a few who came back):\nThe US actress was one of Hollywood's biggest stars in the 90s and 00s, having made her debut at the age of 21 opposite Jim Carey in The Mask more than 30 years ago.\nInitially finding fame for her goofy performances in romcoms such as My Best Friend's wedding, and comedies including There's Something About Mary, Diaz went on to prove her dramatic acting chops in movies like Being John Malkovich and Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York.\nBut she took a hiatus from Hollywood following her turn as Ms Hannigan in 2014's remake of the musical Annie, confirming her \"retirement\" in 2018. \"I was free to be [like] 'I'm a mum, I'm a wife, I'm living my life' - it was so lovely.\"\nShe said the decade she spent in retirement from acting was \"the best 10 years\" of her life. But she was eventually persuaded to return to screens earlier this year for spy thriller Back in Action with actor Jamie Foxx.\n\nThe Oscar-winning star, considered one of his generation's finest actors, apparently retired in 2017, but it wasn't the first time he had stepped away from the spotlight.\nDay-Lewis, who holds both British and Irish citizenship, has won an incredible three best actor Academy Awards for roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln.\nKnown for leaving long stretches between roles, in the 1990s Day-Lewis went into what he called \"semi-retirement\" and became a shoemaker's apprentice in Florence, Italy.\nHe was coaxed back to acting by Martin Scorsese and his offer of the role in Gangs of New York.\nA statement issued through the star's agent in 2017, when he was aged 60, said he \"will no longer be working as an actor\".\nAgain, however, that proved not to be permanent. Day-Lewis is soon to star in Anemone, the debut feature film from his son Ronan Day-Lewis. Daniel and Ronan co-wrote the script which \"explores the intricate relationships between fathers, sons and brothers, and the dynamics of familial bonds\".\nWhether it's a one-off due to the family connection or the start of a big return to film remains to be seen.\n\nNicholson is one of only three actors (including Day-Lewis, above) to have won three Academy Awards for acting. Two of Nicholson's were for best actor (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and As Good As It Gets) and another for best supporting actor (Terms of Endearment).\nThe legendary star's other famous roles include Easy Rider, The Shining, The Departed, A Few Good Men and Batman.\nAlthough he's never formally announced he is quitting or retiring, he previously said his retreat from the spotlight was brought on by a desire to not \"be out there anymore\".\nHis last film role was in 2010 romcom How Do You Know.\nBut just last week, that film's director James L Brooks told Hollywood Reporter: \"I wouldn't be surprised to see Jack work again. I mean, it's been a hunk of time but I don't know. Maybe it could be the right thing. He's reading scripts all the time, I think.\"\nLegendary Swedish screen siren Greta Garbo declared in 1941 at the ripe old age of 36 that she would be taking a \"temporary\" retirement. \nIt proved to be permanent. The Camille and Queen Christina star never appeared on film again.\nAlways the reluctant celebrity, the reclusive actress never played the Hollywood game, refusing interviews and avoiding film premieres and other public appearances.\nThe enigmatic star, whose famous line \"I want to be alone\" from Grand Hotel somewhat mirrored her desire in real life as well as on screen, only succeeded in increasing her mystique by stepping away from the spotlight.\nHowever, she later clarified in an interview: \"I never said: 'I want to be alone.' I only said, 'I want to be let alone! There is all the difference'.\"\nOne of the few silent movie stars to transition successfully to the \"talkies\", Garbo moved away from Hollywood to New York, where she lived until her death in 1990 at the age of 84.\nSynonymous with James Bond, the late Scottish star first found fame through modelling and body-building before landing a few small theatre and TV roles.\nHe made his film debut in No Road Back in 1957, but playing Secret Intelligence Service agent 007 in Dr No a few years later gave him his big breakthrough. He went on to star in five further Bond movies including From Russia with Love and Goldfinger.\nConnery appeared in numerous other films over his long career, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie, The Man Who Would Be King opposite Sir Michael Caine, The Untouchables (for which he won an Oscar) and The Hunt for Red October. But he would forever be wedded to 007. \nIn 2005, however, he said he was \"fed up with the idiots\" adding there was an \"ever-widening gap between people who know how to make movies and the people who greenlight the movies.\"\nThat declaration came a couple of years after he starred in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which many concluded was one of the main reasons for his retirement.\nThe poorly received comic book caper was to be his final screen appearance.\nKids of the 80s and 90s: You know. This guy was a huge star back in the day, the comedy backbone of popular films such as Ghostbusters, Honey I Shrunk The Kids and the musical Little Shop of Horrors (Suddenly, Seymour anyone?).\nBut then he just seemed to disappear off the face of the earth. So what happened?\nHe began to cut back on work after his wife died of cancer in 1991 to concentrate on raising his children, with his final big screen outing being the 1997 sequel Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves.\n\"I'm a single parent, and I just found that it was too difficult to manage raising my kids and doing the travelling involved in making movies,\" he told USA Today in 2005.\n\"So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn't miss it.\"\nHe did continue to do voiceover work, however, and Moranis was set to make a comeback in a Honey I Shrunk the Kids reboot, which sadly fell through.\nWe sadly lost this acting legend earlier this year, along with his second wife Betsy Arakawa, but the star hadn't been seen on screen for years after retiring from the profession on the advice of his heart doctor - opting for a quiet life in New Mexico. \nHackman shot to fame in Bonnie and Clyde at the end of the 60s and was rarely out of work - in films like The French Connection, Mississippi Burning and Superman.\nHe chose to bow out from acting in the political satire Welcome to Mooseport in 2004.\nExplaining his decision, he told Reuters that he didn't want to risk going out on a sour note.\n\"The business for me is very stressful. The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast,\" he said, \"and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it any more.\"\n\nFonda, from the famous family dynasty, is another star who quit at the height of her fame. \nStarring in 80s and 90s hits such as Scandal (about the Profumo Affair), Cameron Crowe's Singles, The Godfather Part III and Single White Female (everyone wanted to copy that elfin crop, not just Jennifer Jason Leigh). And then... nothing.\nFonda never formally retired, she just seemed to retreat. Her last big screen appearance was in The Whole Shebang in 2001.\nWhen asked in 2023 by a reporter if she would return to acting at some point, she replied: \"I don't think so, it's too nice being a civilian.\" Fair enough!\nFonda's aunt Jane also quit acting in 1990 for several years, explaining later in Vogue that \"she wasn't having fun anymore\". \nBut she later came out of retirement for the romcom movie Monster-in-Law. \n\"It was just a gut feeling of, Why the hell not? It'd been 15 years, and I wanted to act again.\"\nAnother star we sadly lost in the last year, Shelley Duval was best known for her roles in film like The Shining, Annie Hall and Nashville.\nHer step back from the spotlight wasn't just her choice. Movie roles began to drop off in the 90s and then she decided to move back to Texas after her brother was diagnosed with cancer.\nA year before her death, she told People magazine: \"It's the longest sabbatical I ever took but it was for really important reasons - to get in touch with my family again.\"\nDuvall did return to acting in horror movie, 2023's The Forest Hills. \n\"Acting again - it's so much fun. It enriches your life,\" she told People.\n\"[Jessica Tandy] won an Oscar when she was 80. I can still win,\" she joked. Sadly, she didn't get the chance.\nWho could forget 2024 award season's most charming star, Oscar winner and Everything, Everywhere All At Once actor Ke Huy Quan?\nHe first found fame as a child actor in the 80s when he landed the role of Short Round in Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom, before taking another starring role in childhood adventure hit The Goonies. \nA couple of TV roles followed but then the work largely dried up, and he settled for working behind the scenes as a stunt co-ordinator and assistant director.\n\"It's always difficult to make the transition from a child actor to an adult actor,\" he told the Telegraph. \"But when you're Asian, then it's 100 times more difficult.\"\nHe reluctantly gave up - only due to lack of opportunity - and it took years before he took a punt on inventive, off-the wall movie Everything, Everywhere, All At Once, where his role as Waymond Wang won him an Oscar and made him a Hollywood darling once again.\nAdditional reporting by Steven McIntosh",

        "article_text": "California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's spate of tariffs that have upended global trade.\nThe suit, which marks the first time a state has sued over the levies, challenges an emergency power Trump cited giving him authority to enact them.\nCalifornia is the world's fifth largest economy - outpacing every US state and most countries - and is home to the largest shares of manufacturing and agricultural production in the US.\nThe White House, which has argued the tariffs are tackling imbalances in international trade, dismissed the lawsuit and said it would continue addressing \"this national emergency that's decimating America's industries\". \n\"Instead of focusing on California's rampant crime, homelessness, and unaffordability, Gavin Newsom is spending his time trying to block President Trump's historic efforts to finally address the national emergency of our country's persistent goods trade deficits,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said. \nNewsom and the state's Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the lawsuit at a news conference at an almond farm - one of the biggest crops California produces.\nNearly 82% of the world's almonds come from the Golden State. It's also the nation's sole producer of artichokes, figs, olives, walnuts and raisins.\nNewsom argued California has been \"disproportionately affected\" by the tariffs and that's why the state, which has already filed 15 lawsuits against Trump since January, would lead the charge against the levies - which currently are 10% on most countries and 145% on China. \n\"That's our state of mind,\" the governor said. \"That's why we're asserting ourselves on behalf of 40 million Americans.\"\nThe lawsuit challenges Trump evoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to enact the tariffs, arguing the act had never been used for such levies and such powers rest with the US Congress. \nThe lawsuit cites multiple times from rulings by the US Supreme Court against the Biden administration in its quest to forgive student debt, noting the high court called Biden's manoeuvres a \"transformative expansion\" of presidential authority. \nNewsom said if the Supreme Court is \"consistent, then this lawsuit is a lock\" for the state. \nThe act has never been used to issue tariffs by any president, congressional research shows. \nWhile California is the first state to file legal action against the Trump administration over the levies, several other lawsuits filed by small businesses and a civil rights group have similarly challenged Trump's authority on the matter. \nSince Trump's inauguration in January there has been a flurry of announcements on tariffs.\nThe US president says the import taxes will encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised, and lead to huge levels of investment in the country.\nCritics argue that bringing manufacturing back to the US is complicated and could take decades and that the economy will struggle in the meantime.\nTrump has also backtracked on many of his announcements.\nJust hours after steep levies against roughly 60 of America's trading partners kicked in earlier this month, Trump announced a 90-day pause on those tariffs to all countries except China, in the face of mounting opposition from politicians and the markets.",

Since Trump's inauguration in January there has been a flurry of announcements on tariffs.The US president says the import taxes will encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised, and lead to huge levels of investment in the country.Critics argue that bringing manufacturing back to the US is complicated and could take decades and that the economy will struggle in the meantime.Trump has also backtracked on many of his announcements.Just hours after steep levies against roughly 60 of America's trading partners kicked in earlier this month, Trump announced a 90-day pause on those tariffs to all countries except China, in the face of mounting opposition from politicians and the markets.Good cops, bad cops - how Trump's shifting tariff team kept world guessingUS tariffs will make global trade shrink, says WTOTrump threatens new tariffs on smartphones days after exempting themOregonLos AngelesHomelessness in the United StatesDonald TrumpUnited StatesCalifornia \"That's why we're asserting ourselves on behalf of 40 million Americans.",

But, Mourinho believed he could glean an extra few percent out of the Cameroonian if he told him the completely opposite.\nLess ghost goal, more ghosting.\n\"Psychology is part of the job and is part of the game with the players,\" said Mourinho.\n\"The way you deal with the press is not going to win matches. Not at all.\n\"But, with the players? Yes. And, you know, I had I think, hundreds of players [during my career].\n\"I always looked at each one of them as a different guy than the other guys. Every person is one individual.\n\"I give you an example of a very strong-minded guy, Samuel Eto'o. The week before that match at Stamford Bridge, I fought him every day. Big, big discussions, big level of pressure.\n\"I told him: 'I'm not going to play you. You are not in your best level. You are not going to play'.\n\"He said: 'Please Mr, let me play'.\n\"I said: 'No, there is no 'please Mr' - you are not going to play. You are not performing. I don't trust you'.\n\"It was one week of an emotional work with him.\"\nSamuel Eto'o scored in the 78th minute to help Inter Milan win 1-0 at Stamford Bridge and 3-1 on aggregate \nMourinho has been infamous for his emotional pre-match mind games throughout his career. The pre-match news conference effectively acting as a de-facto kick-off for the game itself.\nBut, usually, this manipulation was trained on the opposition, not his own squad. So, how did Eto'o react?\n\"Samuel won us that quarter-final against Chelsea. He scored the winning goal at Stamford Bridge. He played a fantastic match,\" says Mourinho of a performance from Eto'o in which he scored the only goal and sent the Italian side through to the quarter-finals of a tournament they would go on to win.\n\"He was such a strong guy that I knew that he would react the way he did react.\"\nHow to Win the Champions League: Jose Mourinho focuses on the Portuguese manager's two Champions League triumphs - in 2004, with Porto, and that 2010 win with Inter.\nModern-day Mourinho has had his man-management sometimes called into question - think Dele Alli at Tottenham and Paul Pogba at Manchester United.\nBut, as the Portuguese manager happily explains, and Eto'o embodied, Mourinho, circa 2010, was in his perfect phase of extracting the best from his players. It's a bullish approach that feels a little outdated in the current climate of player power - but, as Eto'o and Mourinho explain, it worked perfectly back then.\n\"It made me extremely happy that Mourinho told me he needed me to do something particular,\" Eto'o said at the time. \"He wanted a very disciplined role and, because I respect him so much, I said, 'Yes, coach' and stuck to my task exactly.\"\nFifteen years later, in a west London hotel, Mourinho is similarly happy to reflect on his methodology. \n\"That individual way of communicating, of motivation, is always something very, very important,\" he says. \"There is no secret. It is just to look at each one of them, to know them, to understand them, and to deal with them as a complete individual. Like you would if you had one son and one daughter.\u202fYou cannot educate both in the same way because they are different.\"\nThis video can not be played\nHow to win the Champions League: Jose Mourinho\nLatest Champions League table\nChampions League scores & fixtures\nFollow the latest Champions League news\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone\nWatch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.\nThere will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.",

They are spread across six buildings that used to make up the city's first hospital, founded in the 19th Century and notorious in Helsinki for treating patients with the plague.\nNow, the current 20,000 sq m site is a hub for companies developing innovative health technologies, alongside AI, cybersecurity, gaming and defence tech start-ups.\n\"The whole place is really based on community,\" says Maria 01's CEO Sarita Runeberg. \"We bring people together so they can network\u2026 and find different kinds of resources to grow their businesses.\"\nThere are also office perks including a pool table, table football, running and ice bathing clubs, and in true Finnish-style, a sauna.\n\"We wouldn't be a proper start-up hub if we didn't have our own sauna here!\" laughs Ms Runeberg.\nWhile co-working spaces for tech companies are well established across the Nordics, Maria 01 is the largest of its kind in the region.\nIt is run as a not-for-profit organisation partly funded by the city of Helsinki, which has invested more than \u20ac6m ($6.7m; \u00a35.2m) in the hub since its launch in 2016.\nMs Runeberg believes it will become the biggest start-up campus in Europe following the completion of three new buildings by 2028, adding a 50,000 sqm floor area.\nLater this year it is launching an accelerator programme designed to support and guide high-growth start-ups.\n\nThe hub's current and former members have already collectively raised over \u20ac1bn in funding.\nThis represents around 40% of all early stage funding raised annually by Finnish start-ups.\nRuben Byron is the Belgian co-founder of a start-up offering cloud services to AI developers.\nHe has already scaled his business from a handful of staff using the hub's hot desks to a team of around 40 working from private offices in the former hospital, as well as remotely.\n \"That has been a great experience, that we've kind of been able [to] be nurtured here in a way,\" he says.\nAlthough not as mature \u2013 or well known globally \u2013 as other European start-up hubs like Sweden and the UK, Finland has been steadily making a name for itself in the tech scene over the last two decades.\nThe small Nordic nation, which has a population of around 5.6 million, has spawned 12 unicorn businesses \u2013 firms worth a billion dollars or more \u2013 including sleep and fitness tracking ring Oura, game developers Supercell, Rovio (the creators of the Angry Birds game), and food delivery platform Wolt.\nLast year, Startup Blink, a global index mapping more than 100 countries ranked Finland's start-up ecosystem the 7th best in western Europe, and 14th in the world.\nThe index cites factors including hubs like Maria 01, alongside high levels of state and university support, and Slush - a huge annual non-profit gathering for global start-ups and investors.\nIt also highlights Finland's transparent and open business culture.\n\"There is an authenticity with the Finns,\" says Jack Parker, a Helsinki-based founder originally from Newcastle upon Tyne, who runs a healthcare innovation start-up. \n\"Ego doesn't really play a part. So if I reach out to somebody, it's quite likely eight out of 10 times that they will respond.\"\nFinland's right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2023, is on a mission to push the country even further up global indices, stating in its official government programme that it wants the Nordic nation to become a leader in fostering a dynamic start-up and growth company ecosystem.\n\"It's not just about rankings,\" says Marjo Ilmari, who runs the start-up services team at Business Finland, the government agency that promotes investment and innovation.\nIn 2024 Business Finland alone invested \u20ac112m in start-ups, an increase of 30% compared to the previous year.\n\"The real goal is to create an environment where our ground-breaking start-ups can emerge and really tackle global challenges.\"\nThe agency hopes this will help drive growth in the Finnish economy, which went into recession in 2023 and is currently making a sluggish recovery, with the Bank of Finland forecasting an increase of less than 1% this year.\nThe country is also trying to attract more global talent by offering start-up permits for international founders who want to grow their businesses in Finland.\nThese entrepreneurs are eligible for a so-called soft-landing support package provided by Business Finland.\n\"They give you advice, support, sometimes grants to support the initiation phase,\" explains Lalin Keyvan, a Turkish-born entrepreneur at Maria 01 who says the scheme was one of the main reasons why she relocated to Helsinki.\nBusiness Finland's marketing campaigns for would-be movers highlight social and lifestyle factors too: Finns tend to prioritise wellbeing, plus there's free education and subsidised healthcare and childcare.\n\"You don't really have to choose between building a high-growth company and enjoying life, because you can do both,\" says Ms Ilmari.\nBut whether all this is enough for Finland to compete with Europe's more established start-up hubs is up for debate.\nData suggests it still has a long way to go to catch up with neighbouring Sweden, long the Nordic darling of the European start-up scene.\nIt is home to more than 40 unicorn businesses including Spotify, payments platform Klarna and game developer King.\nIn Startup Blink's ecosystem ranking Sweden ranks second in Europe after the UK, and top in the EU.\nIn the last decade it has attracted more than $29bn in funding compared to just over $8bn in Finland, according to the annual State of European Tech report by investment company Atomico.\n\"I love Finland's bold approach,\" says Charlotte Ekelund, deputy CEO of Sting, a non-profit organisation that helps develop start-ups in Stockholm. However she believes Finland is still years behind Sweden in terms of pulling in capital and developing its ecosystem.\n\"We observe some of the things that the Finnish ecosystem is doing now, Sting was part of driving 10 or 15 years ago here - co-working spaces, [and] new organisations in the ecosystem that can support in different ways.\"\nMikael Pentikainen, CEO of the Federation of Finnish Enterprises, says the country's government is currently losing support amongst entrepreneurs despite its pro-start-up and pro-business approach.\nA recent survey for the organisation found 41% of small and medium-sized business owners are satisfied with the coalition's actions, down from 54% in June.\nOne likely reason for the dip, says Mr Pentikainen, is a decision to raise VAT from 24% to 25.5% last September, the highest rate in western Europe. The government said this was a \"difficult but necessary\" move designed to stabilise public finances. \nBut Mr Pentikainen suggests it could make Finland's start-up ecosystem less competitive for international founders.\nThe Finnish government has also recently toughened up citizenship requirements, meaning foreign entrepreneurs now need to stay at least eight years instead of five in order to obtain a passport, and will soon also be required to pass a test on Finnish society and culture if they want to settle long-term.\nBack at Maria 01, Mr Parker, the health company founder, says he's confident Finland's start-up ecosystem will continue to expand and attract international talent. But he warns it might lose some of the aspects that have so far made it an attractive option for entrepreneurs.\n\"The advantage of the ecosystem right now is this kind of 'small town, everybody knows each other' [feeling]. Scaling that up, there is the risk of actually losing that element of it.\"",

On Sunday the group said it had taken control of Zamzam but denied reports of atrocities.\nThe camps, Zamzam and Abu Shouk, provide temporary homes to more than 700,000 people, many of whom are facing famine-like conditions.\nNews of the attacks comes on the eve of the second anniversary of the start of the civil war between the RSF and the army.\nContacting the BBC on Sunday morning, one Zamzam resident who works at a community kitchen providing food for those in the camp, said \"a large number of young people\" had been killed.\n\"Those who were working in the community kitchen have been killed, and the doctors who were part of the initiative to reopen the hospital were also killed,\" Mustafa, 34, said in a WhatsApp audio message.\n\"My uncle and my cousin were killed. People are wounded, and there is no medicine or hospital to save them - they are dying from bleeding.\n\"The shelling is still ongoing, and we are expecting more attacks in the morning.\"\nHe added that all routes out of the camp were closed and it was \"surrounded from all four directions\".\nAnother resident, Wasir, said that \"nothing [was] left in Zamzam\".\n\"A large number of civilians have fled, and we are still trying to leave, but we haven't succeeded, all the roads are blocked, and we have children with us.\n\"Death is everywhere. As I speak to you now from inside the trench, there is shelling happening.\"\nSome camp residents have got out and made the 15km (nine mile) journey to el-Fasher, according to North Darfur's Health Minister Ibrahim Khater.\n\"I am observing many people walking from Zamzam - mostly children, women and the elderly,\" he said in a message to the BBC.\n\"Some were injured, tired and saying they lost their family - dead on the streets. The situation is catastrophic.\"\nThe UN's humanitarian co-ordinator in Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, said she was \"appalled and gravely alarmed\" by reports from Darfur.\n\"This represents yet another deadly and unacceptable escalation in a series of brutal attacks on displaced people and aid workers,\" she added in a statement.\nThe US State Department also said it was \"deeply alarmed by reports of attacks by the RSF on Zamzam and Abu Shouk\", adding: \"We condemn the RSF's attacks on the most vulnerable of civilians.\"\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who is hosting a conference on Sudan on Tuesday, described the reports of \"indiscriminate RSF attacks\" as \"shocking\".\nAid organisation Relief International said nine of its workers \"were mercilessly killed including doctors, referral drivers and a team leader\" in the attack on Zamzam.\nThe charity, which said it was the last provider of critical health services in the camp, alleged RSF fighters were to blame.\n\"We understand that this was a targeted attack on all health infrastructure in the region to prevent access to healthcare for internally displaced people.\n\"We are horrified that one of our clinics was also part of this attack - along with other health facilities in el-Fasher.\"\nKashif Shafique, the charity's Sudan director, told the BBC's Newshour programme that what happened was not random. \nRelaying what two surviving female members of staff had described, he said RSF fighters went into a safety bunker and shot the nine victims in the head and chest.\nIn a statement released on Saturday, the RSF said it was not responsible for attacks on civilians and that scenes of killing in Zamzam were staged to discredit its forces.\nThe following day, the group said it had completed a \"successful liberation\" of the camp from Sudan's army. The RSF accused the army of using Zamzam as \"a military barracks, and innocent civilians as human shields\".\nAssessing satellite images, a team of specialists at Yale University in the US said on Friday that \"this attack conservatively represents the most significant ground-based attack on Zamzam... since fighting erupted in the el-Fasher area in spring of 2024\".\nThe Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab said it had observed that \"arson attacks have burned multiple structures and significant areas of the camp in the center, south, and southeast portions of the camp\".\nThe war - a power struggle between the army and the RSF - has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis, forcing more than 12 million people from their homes and pushing communities into hunger.\nIt began on 15 April 2023, after the leaders of the army and RSF fell out over the political future of the country.\nEl-Fasher is the last major town in Darfur under army control and has been under siege by the RSF for a year.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

The newspaper ceased operations in 2008 but was later relaunched as a digital publication. \nThe Congress maintains that it bailed out the publisher due to its historical legacy and had lent more than 900m rupees to AJL over the years.\nIn 2010, AJL became debt-free by swapping its debt for equity and assigning the shares to a newly created company called Young Indian, which the party says is a \"not-for-profit company\" with no dividends paid to its shareholders and directors.\nSonia and Rahul Gandhi are among Young Indian's directors and they each own 38% of the company. The remaining 24% is owned by Congress leaders, including Motilal Vora and Sam Pitroda. \nLast week, the Enforcement Directorate said Young Indian had acquired AJL properties worth 20bn rupees for just 5m, significantly undervaluing their worth.\nIt also served several notices to seize assets worth 6.6bn rupees across several Indian cities - including Delhi and Mumbai - which are connected to Young Indian. \nThe case is scheduled to come up for hearing on 25 April. \nIn recent years, the opposition has repeatedly accused the Narendra Modi government of weaponising the Enforcement Directorate against its political opponents.\nAccording to data compiled by Reuters in 2024, the agency has summoned, questioned or raided around 150 opposition politicians since Modi came to power in 2014.\nLast year, the ED arrested former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in connection with an alleged liquor scam just a month before key general elections. He spent five months in jail before being freed on bail. \nThe National Herald newspaper was founded in 1938 by Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister and Rahul Gandhi's great-grandfather. \nIt ceased publication in 2008 after running into financial troubles but was later acquired by the Congress in 2010 and relaunched as a digital news outlet in 2016.\nIt was published by Associated Journals Limited (AJL), which was established in 1937 with 5,000 freedom fighters as shareholders. AJL also published Qaumi Awaz in Urdu and Navjeevan in Hindi.\nThe National Herald became known for its association with India's freedom struggle and its nationalist stance. \nNehru often wrote strong-worded columns, which led to the British government banning the paper in 1942. It reopened three years later.\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, Nehru resigned as chairman of the newspaper to become prime minister. \nBut the Congress continued to play a huge role in shaping the newspaper's ideology. \nIn a message to the National Herald on its silver jubilee in 1963, Nehru spoke about the paper \"generally favouring Congress policy\" while maintaining \"an independent outlook\".\nOver the years, the National Herald grew to be a leading English daily, supported by the Congress party, until it shut down in 2008 after years of financial troubles.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'A long time coming' - BBC Sport NI's interview with Rory McIlroy\nThe clubhouse clock was ticking towards 11pm on the night of Rory McIlroy's greatest day in golf.\nIn the hours that followed his dramatic play-off win over Justin Rose to land his first Masters Green Jacket, the Northern Irishman talked and talked and talked. \nFirst to CBS's Jim Nantz and Augusta chairman Fred Ridley in the Butler Cabin, then to the assembled members for the formal prize presentation. Then numerous television interviews, the media in the sumptuous press building.\nThen to the clubhouse, where he joined club members in the Grill Room to discuss the dramatic preceding hours that had captivated the sporting world. And then more television interviews.\nEventually he emerged into an adjacent room where we had been waiting - BBC Northern Ireland's Stephen Watson and RTE's Greg Allen - colleagues with whom I've shared so much time covering McIlroy's extraordinary career.\nAs he entered the room, the new Masters champion saw us waiting, puffed out his cheeks, leaned forward resting his elbows on the back of a sofa and gave us a look that said it all.\nWordlessly his eyes said: \"Can you believe what has happened? What is happening?\"\nThis video can not be played\nMcIlroy wins Masters play-off to complete career Grand Slam\nThe jacket was a perfect fit, a deeper green than you might imagine and in that moment came the realisation that he had actually done it. The burden had lifted, never again would we be able to ask the questions that had nagged him for more than a decade.\nNow, aged 35, he is an all-time great. Indisputably. He sits alongside Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Ben Hogan and Gene Sarazen - the only male golfers to have won all four of the tournaments that matter most.\nThe Grand Slam eluded some of golf's greatest names; Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson, Lee Trevino, Seve Ballesteros, Sir Nick Faldo and Phil Mickelson.\nNow with five majors, McIlroy moves alongside Ballesteros and trails Faldo by one.  Given that he is the first man from the continent to complete the Slam, Northern Ireland's sporting superstar might have eclipsed Faldo.\nIt could be argued that way, given McIlroy's 28 PGA Tour victories including two Players Championships. Outside his three Masters and three Open titles, Faldo won only three other events that count on the PGA Tour.\nBut it would be churlish to say either way, comparing eras is a fool's errand. What can be said is that McIlroy is in the conversation for being Europe's greatest men's golfer.\nAnd now he has shed a family of gorillas from his back he will be unburdened for future majors. The next one is at Quail Hollow, where he has enjoyed so much success in PGA Tour events.\nThen it's the US Open, a championship he has narrowly missed winning in the past two years, before The Open at Royal Portrush in his native Northern Ireland. Opportunities abound in 2025.\nWhat does McIlroy get for Masters triumph?\nHow coping with 'heartbreak' changed everything for McIlroy \nMasters & Slam success will 'free me up' - McIlroy\nMcIlroy's golfing talent is beyond question.

Even its temperature dropping too low can cause permanent damage.\nAn emergency law was rushed through Parliament on Saturday, giving the government control of the Lincolnshire site after it \"became clear\" that Jingye was intent on shutting the site.\nBusiness Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the House of Commons that Jingye had intended to \"cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders\" of raw materials, and therefore \"irrevocably and unilaterally closed down\" the plant.\nOn Monday, the government appointed two long-standing British Steel employees to run the plant on an interim basis.\nThe situation at British Steel has raised questions about Chinese investment in industries the UK government has deemed strategically critical.\nTreasury minister James Murray told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that, while Jingye had \"clearly behaved irresponsibly\", the actions of one firm did not \"speak to all companies who are based in China\".\nHe also said there needed to be a \"high level of scrutiny\" for any foreign investment in critical infrastructure.\nThe UK government has so far stopped short of taking British Steel back into full public ownership, but has not ruled out nationalisation, while also looking for potential private investors to fund operations at Scunthorpe. \nWhile Rayner said the government wanted to work with the company to continue production at the site, as well as explore alternative private investment, she said no option was off the table.\nChina's embassy in the UK has urged ministers to negotiate with Jingye to \"find a solution acceptable to all parties\", while its foreign ministry urged the UK government to hold further talks with Jingye. \nSpokesman Lin Jian said: \"It is hoped that the British government will... avoid politicising trade cooperation or linking it to security issues, so as not to impact the confidence of Chinese enterprises in going to the UK for normal investment,\" according to news agency AFP.\nOn Monday morning, Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the Community Union - which represents the majority of steelworkers - said the blast furnaces are \"in a far better position\" than before the government stepped in.\nMr Rickhuss told Today he was certain the plant would remain running and that the furnaces were \"secure\".\nCharlotte Brumpton-Childs, from the GMB Union, told BBC Breakfast that she had spoken to British Steel on Sunday night and had been reassured the raw materials would be secured by the government.\nThe Scunthorpe plant employs 2,700 people and is the last site in the UK that can produce virgin steel - a high-grade product which is needed for large construction projects.\nWithout the plant, the UK would be the only member of the G7 group of leading economies without the ability to make virgin steel - which the government believes would pose a risk to the country's economic security.\nThe site produces the majority of rail tracks used by Network Rail. The company said it does not expect \"any impact on the continued delivery of reliable rail services\" as it built up a stockpile of steel in anticipation of the plant's possible closure.\nThe virgin steel made in Scunthorpe is also critical for large-scale infrastructure developments, such as building nuclear power plants like the ongoing Hinkley Point C project in Somerset. \nHowever, in March, Jingye said the Scunthorpe site was losing \u00a3700,000 a day, which it said was \"no longer financially sustainable\", and the company began a consultation on job cuts.\nTalks with Jingye last week failed to produce a breakthrough. The government said the company had demanded more than double the government's original \u00a3500m offer with few guarantees it would keep the plant open.\nSpeaking about the company's actions on Sunday, Reynolds said \"it might not be sabotage, it might be neglect\". Rayner said there was \"no evidence\" of corporate sabotage.\nThe Conservatives have criticised the government for not stepping in sooner to save the plant.\nTory shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the party had supported the emergency law because \"it's the least worst option on the table\".",

Then numerous television interviews, the media in the sumptuous press building.\nThen to the clubhouse, where he joined club members in the Grill Room to discuss the dramatic preceding hours that had captivated the sporting world. And then more television interviews.\nEventually he emerged into an adjacent room where we had been waiting - BBC Northern Ireland's Stephen Watson and RTE's Greg Allen - colleagues with whom I've shared so much time covering McIlroy's extraordinary career.\nAs he entered the room, the new Masters champion saw us waiting, puffed out his cheeks, leaned forward resting his elbows on the back of a sofa and gave us a look that said it all.\nWordlessly his eyes said: \"Can you believe what has happened? What is happening?\"\nThis video can not be played\nMcIlroy wins Masters play-off to complete career Grand Slam\nThe jacket was a perfect fit, a deeper green than you might imagine and in that moment came the realisation that he had actually done it. The burden had lifted, never again would we be able to ask the questions that had nagged him for more than a decade.\nNow, aged 35, he is an all-time great. Indisputably. He sits alongside Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Ben Hogan and Gene Sarazen - the only male golfers to have won all four of the tournaments that matter most.\nThe Grand Slam eluded some of golf's greatest names; Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson, Lee Trevino, Seve Ballesteros, Sir Nick Faldo and Phil Mickelson.\nNow with five majors, McIlroy moves alongside Ballesteros and trails Faldo by one.  Given that he is the first man from the continent to complete the Slam, Northern Ireland's sporting superstar might have eclipsed Faldo.\nIt could be argued that way, given McIlroy's 28 PGA Tour victories including two Players Championships. Outside his three Masters and three Open titles, Faldo won only three other events that count on the PGA Tour.\nBut it would be churlish to say either way, comparing eras is a fool's errand. What can be said is that McIlroy is in the conversation for being Europe's greatest men's golfer.\nAnd now he has shed a family of gorillas from his back he will be unburdened for future majors. The next one is at Quail Hollow, where he has enjoyed so much success in PGA Tour events.\nThen it's the US Open, a championship he has narrowly missed winning in the past two years, before The Open at Royal Portrush in his native Northern Ireland. Opportunities abound in 2025.\nWhat does McIlroy get for Masters triumph?\nHow coping with 'heartbreak' changed everything for McIlroy \nMasters & Slam success will 'free me up' - McIlroy\nMcIlroy's golfing talent is beyond question.

        "article_text": "Sir Richard Branson has responded to BBC Radio 1's Greg James' bid for an \"Air Force Hun\" mission to create a British version of the all-female flight that sent pop star Katy Perry to the edge of space. \nThe Firework singer was one of six women on Monday's 11-minute space flight, organised by billionaire Amazon owner Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin.\nInspired by a listener texting in, Greg floated the idea of a UK equivalent called Air Force Hun with British billionaire Sir Richard, using his company Virgin Galactic.\nThe presenter suggested it be crewed by Gemma Collins, Alison Hammond, Carol Vorderman, Natalie Cassidy and Denise Welch.\nAnd during the Radio 1 Breakfast show, the businessman got in touch with Greg to suggest starting with an \"astronaut experience\" for the crew.\nHe revealed Sir Richard followed him on Instagram and responded positively when he sent a message pitching the space flight, though he stopped short of committing to a full space mission.\nThe reply, according to Greg was: \"As we embark on these giant leaps for hunkind, why don't we first start with an astronaut experience for you all while we continue to reach for the stars.\"\nBBC Newsbeat has contacted Sir Richard's representatives for further comment. \nReality star Gemma \"might be claustrophobic, Darren\", but since Sir Richard's response that might be the only thing stopping her blasting to the edge of space.\nSpeaking to Radio 1, she says she is \"ready to go to space\".\n\"I'd like to see if there's aliens really up there and I'd also like to make an absolute fortune out of it.\n\"The only thing I'm worried about is I'm claustrophobic,\" she adds. \"I'm totally claustrophobic.\"\nAs for her proposed crew mates, Gemma says she \"couldn't think of a better five women to go\".\nListeners suggested she be accompanied by Great British Bake Off presenter Alison, Countdown legend Carol, EastEnders actress Natalie, and Loose Women panellist Denise. \n\"We are the ultimate huns and we all need to go to space,\" Gemma says. \"We would have such fun.\"\nCarol says going to space has always been a dream of hers and she'd definitely be up for being on board.\n\"When I was growing up, it was the first Apollo missions,\" she says.\n\"Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landing on the moon was the biggest thing to happen in my primary school years and I always wanted to be an astronaut.\n\"And then I realised when I got to the age of going to uni and I was a free school meals kid and I thought, well I'm not American and I'm a woman so I've got no chance.\"\nBut it drove her to pursue an engineering degree and now Carol even has a pilot's licence.\nCarol says if she goes to space it might create some family friction as her daughter, scientist Katie King, founded a company that uses the conditions in space to help manufacture drugs. \n\"She's proper clever,\" says Carol. \n\"You've got Carol who can actually fly a plane, I can fly a kite,\" says Alison, adding: \"I am ready for Air Force Huns\".\n\"I think this could become serious,\" the presenter says. \"It starts off as a joke but this could actually be real.\n\"I'm gonna be nervous, I might have a little bit of a panic attack, but absolutely I'm in.\"\nMonday's Blue Origin flight was fully autonomous, meaning it did not need pilots to fly the six women more than 100km (62 miles) above Earth, to the Karman line - widely recognised as the boundary of space. \nThe crew, which included Bezos's fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez and CBS presenter Gayle King alongside Katy Perry, experienced a few moments of weightlessness during the 11-minute flight. \nHowever critics have questioned the environmental cost of sending celebrities to space. \nThere has also been backlash from some scientists as well as celebrities like reality star Vicky Pattinson and model and actress Emily Ratajkowski.\n\"This isn't feminism,\" Vicky said on Instagram after the launch.\n\"I don't think we need to see a bunch of uber rich women fired into space... for five minutes,\" she wrote. \n\"When I think of all the things this money could have been used to do, I honestly feel ashamed.\"\nEmily said on TikTok the mission was \"beyond parody\", adding there was a \"very small group of people who are interested in going to space for the sake of getting a new lease on life while most people on planet Earth are worried about paying rent\".\nThe cost of the flight has not been disclosed, however a $150,000 (\u00a3114,575.85) deposit is required to reserve a seat. \nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "article_text": "A trial in the landmark antitrust case against social media giant Meta kicked off in Washington on Monday.\nLawyers for the US competition and consumer watchdog allege Meta unlawfully quashed rivals by purchasing Instagram and WhatsApp over a decade ago.\n\"They decided that competition was too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them,\" said Federal Trade Commission (FTC) lawyer Daniel Matheson.\nMeta countered that the lawsuit from the FTC, which reviewed and approved those acquisitions, is \"misguided.\"\nMeta \"acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to improve and grow them alongside Facebook,\" the company's attorney Mark Hansen argued. \nA win by the FTC could force CEO Mark Zuckerberg break up the company.\nThat could include spinning off photo sharing app Instagram and messaging service WhatsApp.\nThe FTC says the company overpaid when it acquired Instagram for $1 billion in 2012. Two years later, it purchased the WhatsApp for $19 billion.\n\"The [FTC's] argument is the acquisition of Instagram was a way of neutralising this rising competitive threat to Facebook,\" says Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor of antitrust law at Vanderbilt Law School.\nMs Allensworth says Mr Zuckerberg's own words, including those from his emails, may offer the most convincing evidence at trial.\n\"He said it's better to buy than to compete. It's hard to get more literal than that,\" Ms Allensworth says.\nOn Monday, Matheson referenced a 2012 memo from Zuckerberg in which he discusses the importance of \"neutralising\" Instagram. Matheson called the message \"a smoking gun.\" \nMeta, on the other hand, said the purchases made the consumer experience better.\n\"Acquisitions to improve and grow\" have never been found unlawful, Hansen said Monday, \"and they should not be found unlawful here.\"\nThe company maintains that it faces competition from a slew of other apps, including TikTok, X, YouTube, and iMessage.\nMr Zuckerberg and the company's former chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg are both expected to testify at the trial, which could run for several weeks.\nThe case, FTC v Meta, was filed during US President Donald Trump's first administration but risks becoming politicised during his second term.\nMr Zuckerberg has lobbied Trump in person to have the FTC drop the case, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nWhen asked by the BBC to confirm that report, Meta sidestepped the question but said in a statement: \"The FTC's lawsuits against Meta defies reality.\"\n\"More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the commission's action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final,\" a Meta spokesperson told the BBC.\nRelations between Mr Zuckerberg and Trump had been frosty partly because Trump was barred from Meta's social media platforms after the US Capitol riot in January 2021.\nSince then, the relationship has thawed somewhat.\nMeta contributed $1m (\u00a3764,400) to Trump's inaugural fund, and has added former Trump adviser Dina Powell McCormick and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) boss Dana White, a Trump ally, to Meta's board of directors this year.\nThe company also announced in January that it was doing away with independent fact-checkers and had agreed to pay Trump $25 million to settle a lawsuit over the suspension of his accounts after the 6 January Capitol riots in 2021.\n\nPresident Trump's move to fire two FTC commissioners in March also hangs over the case.\nAs Democrats, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya were in the minority on the five-seat commission.\nUntil Wednesday, just two seats of those seats were filled, both by Republicans. Another Republican was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday.\nSlaughter and Bedoya - who are suing the Trump administration to be reinstated - say the move to push them out was meant to intimidate.\n\"The president sent a very clear signal not only to us but to Chairman Ferguson and Commissioner [Melissa] Holyoak that if they do something he doesn't like, he could fire them too,\" Slaughter told the BBC in a recent interview.\n\"So if they don't want to do a favour for his political allies, they're on the chopping block as well,\" Slaughter said.\nSlaughter and Bedoya both expressed alarm at recent reports about Zuckerberg's lobbying efforts. \n\"My hope is that there is no political interference,\" Mr Bedoya told the BBC.\nThe FTC did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.\nFerguson, who was appointed as FTC chair by Trump, recently told The Verge he would \"obey lawful orders\" when asked what he would do if the president directed him to drop a lawsuit like the one against Meta. \nFerguson added that he would be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\nThe FTC is considered a key antitrust watchdog. In recent years, it has returned hundreds of millions of dollars to victims of fraud, in addition to passing laws that ban junk fees and subscription traps.\nBut as the Meta trial begins, it's among the many independent regulatory agencies that the administration seems keen to rein in.\nChair Ferguson is also recently quoted reaffirming his belief that independent regulatory bodies are \"not good for democracy.\"\n\nFTC v Meta begins as another major antitrust case - USA v Google - gets set to enter what's known as the remedies phase.\nThe Department of Justice won the first phase of that case last summer when Judge Amit Mehta found that Google holds a monopoly in online search, with a market share of around 90%.\nLast month, the DOJ reiterated a demand made during the Biden administration that a court break up Google's search monopoly.\nThe FTC's case against Meta will be tougher to prove, says Laura Phillips-Sawyer, an associate professor of business law at the University of Georgia.\n\"I think they have a real uphill battle,\" Ms Phillips-Sawyer said of the FTC.\n\"They have a long road before any consideration of divestiture of Instagram or WhatsApp is considered.\"\nThat's because compared to online search, there's more competition in the personal network services space that Meta operates in, Ms Phillips-Sawyer said.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

I remember going to see the Star Wars films and I and many others cheered when Yoda was involved in his first lightsaber duel,\" he said.\nMr McEwen said it was a \"visceral and legitimate reaction\" because viewers had been long-time fans of the franchise and the reaction was emotional rather than sparked by a social media trend. \nHe said the cinema had a similar experience back in 2022 when Minions: The Rise of Gru was screening. \n\"There was a TikTok trend called Gentle Minions and young people dressed up in suits and were rowdy during the film,\" he said.\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

This valuable tax break, though, can be removed if the groups become involved in political activities or move away from their stated purposes.\n\"Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting \"Sickness?\" he wrote on Truth Social. \"Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!\"\nLosing the exemption could cost Harvard millions of dollars each year. \nThe Ivy League institution also has a fund of assets, or endowment, valued at $53bn.\nLater on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump wanted the university to apologise for what his administration says is continuing tolerance of antisemitism.\n\"[Trump] wants to see Harvard apologize, and Harvard should apologize,\" Leavitt said. \nThe sweeping changes demanded by the White House would have transformed Harvard's operations and ceded a large amount of control to the government.\nIts letter to Harvard on Friday, obtained by the New York Times, said the university had failed to live up to the \"intellectual and civil rights conditions\" that justify federal investment.\nThe letter included 10 categories for proposed changes, including:\nPresident Trump has accused leading universities of failing to protect Jewish students when college campuses around the country saw protests against the war in Gaza and US support for Israel last year.\nThe letter orders the university to take disciplinary action for \"violations\" during protests.\nIn explaining its rejection of these demands, Harvard president Alan Garber said the university would not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights under the First Amendment protecting free speech.\n\"Although some of the demands outlined by the government are aimed at combating antisemitism, the majority represent direct governmental regulation of the 'intellectual conditions' at Harvard,\" he said.\nShortly after his letter of resistance was sent, the education department said it was freezing $2.2bn in grants and $60m in contracts to Harvard immediately.\n\"Harvard's statement today reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges,\" the Department of Education said in a statement.\nThe disruption of learning plaguing campuses is unacceptable and the harassment of Jewish students intolerable, the statement said. \nA professor of history at Harvard, David Armitage, told the BBC that the school could afford to resist as the richest university in the US and no price was too high to pay for freedom.\n\"It's a not unexpected act of entirely groundless and vengeful activity by the Trump administration which wants nothing more than to silence freedom of speech,\" he said.\nIn March, the Trump administration said it was reviewing roughly $256m in federal contracts and grants at Harvard, and an additional $8.7bn in multi-year grant commitments.\nCongresswoman Elise Stefanik, a Republican from New York, said on X: \"It is time to totally cut off US taxpayer funding to this institution.\" \nHarvard professors filed a lawsuit in response, alleging the government was unlawfully attacking freedom of speech and academic freedom. \nHarvard is one of a number of elite universities in the crosshairs of the new presidency. \nColumbia University in New York City agreed to a number of demands last month after the White House pulled $400m in federal funding.\nBut on Monday Columbia struck a less compliant tone, releasing its own letter that said it was continuing \"good faith talks\" with the government as it seeks to win back its funding, but also said it would \"reject any agreement that would require us to relinquish our independence\".\nPolling by Gallup last summer suggested that confidence in higher education has been falling over time among Americans of all political backgrounds, partly driven by a growing belief that universities push a political agenda. The decline was particularly steep among Republicans.\nEarlier on Monday, a lawyer for an organiser of pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University said her client had been arrested by immigration officials as he attended an interview as part of his application for US citizenship.\nMohsen Mahdawi, a green card holder who is due to graduate next month, was detained on Monday in Colchester, Vermont.\nOthers who took part in campus protests against the war, including Columbia University's Mahmoud Khalil and Tufts University's Rumeysa Ozturk, have been detained in recent weeks.",

        "article_text": "Seventy years old this year, Henri-Georges Clouzot's film about two women plotting murder is a masterclass in macabre dread \u2013 and inspired Hitchcock's classic among others.\nFamous for writing the novel Psycho (1959), the basis for the influential 1960 Alfred Hitchcock film of the same name, author Robert Bloch understood the horror genre more than most. So when you read that he called a film his \"favourite horror of all time\", as he did in an interview with French magazine L'Ecran Fantastique, you have to take that appraisal seriously. The film referred to by Bloch wasn't the adaptation of his own story, nor a Hollywood classic, but instead a quietly influential French feature, 70 years old this year, that packs as much of a macabre punch as his own morbid masterpiece: Henri-Georges Clouzot's Les Diaboliques (1955).\nAdapted from the novel She Who Was No More (1952) by French crime-writing partnership Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac (also known as Boileau-Narcejac), Clouzot's film was a revolution in chilling cinema. It mixed techniques from film noir and horror to great effect, creating a hybrid that was deeply influential with its heart-stopping atmosphere of suspense.\nLes Diaboliques concerns the tumultuous relationships of several teachers in a private boarding school situated in outer Paris. The weak heart of Christina \u2013 played by Clouzot's own wife V\u00e9ra \u2013 is continually strained by the actions of her abusive husband Michel (Paul Meurisse), the school's headmaster, especially since fellow teacher Nicole (Simone Signoret) became his mistress. However, Michel's volatile behaviour is now hurting both women, so they hatch a plan. Though reluctant, Christina is convinced by Nicole to help murder Michel and make it appear accidental. Luring him to Nicole's out-of-town flat, they drown him in a bath and dump the body in the school's swimming pool, ready to be found as if the result of a drunken accident. However, when the body disappears the following day, the women are terrified as to what has happened. Did Michel survive? Or are his haunted remains wandering the school in search of revenge?\nClouzot's work was often laced with cynicism and pessimism. As Susan Hayward suggests in her 2005 book exploring the film, \"the thriller is the genre we most readily associate with him. But not just any thriller. His take on the genre is dark, relentless, stifling, cruel\". Beginning his career as a screenwriter before switching to directing in the 1940s, Clouzot was a divisive figure in France. His work for the Nazi-controlled and funded Continental Films, run by Goebbels-appointed party member Alfred Greven, during the occupation played a role in his being barred from directing for two years following the end of the war. At this time, his drama Le Corbeau (1943), about a small town whose citizens are beset by poison pen letters, was read as anti-French and collaborationist, which was ironic considering that the Vichy Government had previously pulled the film from cinemas because of its own negative reading of it. Clouzot's pessimism made him adept at making enemies.\nSurviving this furore, Clouzot went on to make some of France's most celebrated films, often indebted to the work of Hitchcock, but still uniquely Gallic. Unlike Hitchcock, however, the French critics of the period, many of whom would form the Nouvelle Vague \u2013 a radical and inventive group of French film-makers, who sought new ways of film-making while exhibiting a deep knowledge of cinema history \u2013 had little time for him or his work due to the somewhat traditional nature of his film-making. He seemed to embody what was known as la tradition de qualit\u00e9, the pre-Nouvelle Vague style of French cinema which prioritised story over formal innovation. As Hayward writes, \"the\u00a0Nouvelle\u00a0Vague\u00a0consigned him thus to the purgatorial ranks of the cinema de papa [dad's cinema], and Clouzot was an auteur no more\".\nIn hindsight, though, films such as Quai des Orf\u00e8vres (1947), The Wages of Fear (1953), and, of course, Les Diaboliques, were ahead of their time, representing a new pessimistic variety of thriller that became more commonplace from the 1960s onwards, both in France and internationally. Many thrillers up to this point had rigidly defined concepts of good and evil, while certainly never daring to end on an unhappy note. But Clouzot was at the forefront of a breed of thrillers which refused simplistic notions of morality, and resisted the need for happy, comforting endings. They became less about heroes walking off into the sunset and more about who could escape the least scathed from their scenarios.\nRobert Bloch didn't limit his praise of Les Diaboliques to mere hyperbole. In L'Ecran Fantastique, he noted the fact \"there is very little bloodshed\" as a reason for its success. Though possessing a few moments of disturbing violence, Les Diaboliques avoids showing much in the way of blood and guts. What it possesses instead is a grim foreboding that builds to an unforgettable climax.\nProfessor Claire Gorrara of the University of Cardiff, an academic specialising in French cultural memory, attributes the film's effectiveness to the \"incredible atmosphere of rising paranoia and suspense surrounding the main female protagonist [Christina]\", she tells BBC Culture. \"And [also] the twist at the end, which, in the original film reel, viewers were asked not to reveal outside the cinema to future spectators.\" While Clouzot certainly had film-making forebears in Hollywood like Jacques Tourneur and Robert Wise, when it came to film-making in Europe, no director had created such levels of tension.\nClouzot works a kind of push-pull psychology throughout Les Diaboliques, teasing a possible solution to the mystery one minute, only to utterly subvert it the next; all the while putting his characters through the emotional mixer and taking the audience along with them. In particular, he inserts supernatural insinuations to keep the characters (and the viewer) on the back foot. A young boy swears that he was punished by the supposedly-now-dead Michel. The suit Michel was murdered in somehow reappears newly pressed from a Parisian drycleaners. And then, most alarmingly, his ghostly face appears at the window in a school photo.\nIt would be remiss not to discuss the film's famous finale and its aforementioned twist. It sees Christina come upon Michel submerged in a bath, only for him to suddenly rise out of it as if waking from the dead, at which point Christina's heart finally gives way \u2013 a demise that was bizarrely echoed five years later when V\u00e9ra herself would die of a heart attack aged just 46, leading Clouzot into a depressive spiral that haunted the rest of his life. As it transpires, Nicole and Michel have been in cahoots all along, the real plot being to eliminate Christina so they can sell off the school and live happily ever after.\nGorrara believes the twist \"is so well plotted through cinematographic 'sleight of hand' that I would defy uninitiated viewers to discover it before the ending\". Said sleight of hand arises once again from Clouzot's skilful blending of genre \u2013 he films the finale exactly as if it was a supernatural ghost story, right until the death of Christina. Even then, the film has one last twist, this time with a real supernatural insinuation, when a boy claims to have seen the now-deceased Christina, just as he had seen Michel earlier when he was supposedly dead.\nIn an interview with Time magazine, even Stephen King, modern horror's most celebrated author, declared that the finale in the bath was the \"single scariest moment I have ever had in entertainment\". King is also a great admirer of British horror writer Ramsey Campbell, himself a fan of Les Diaboliques. When asked if he agrees with Bloch's original assessment of Les Diaboliques as the ultimate psychological horror, Campbell tells the BBC: \"It may well have been at the time, certainly in terms of commitment to sheer terror of an intensity not previously encountered in the cinema (just as\u00a0Psycho\u00a0would up the ante several years later)\u2026 and I've seen\u00a0Les Diaboliques\u00a0disquiet a recent audience as much as I imagine it did in its day.\"\nIn her mixed 1955 review of Les Diaboliques for The Observer, critic CA Lejeune described a trend in cinema of the period that the film exemplified. \"Since there seems to be a vogue at the moment for the horrid in entertainment,\" she opined, \"Henri-Georges Clouzot's Les Diaboliques is likely to do well.\" Undoubtedly this trend was in part down to Hitchcock and his skill in making artful, popular thrillers that increasingly toyed in nastiness, such as Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Rope (1948) and Strangers on a Train (1951). Yet Clouzot's contribution was just as impactful, not simply on the thrillers that came after but also upon Hitchcock himself, with a sense of competitiveness growing between the two in the 1950s. As King suggested in a 2007 interview with the British Film Institute about his favourite films, Clouzot \"out-Hitchcocked Hitchcock\". Les Diaboliques clearly raised the stakes for Hitch.\nIn fact, Hitchcock himself had wanted to adapt Boileau-Narcejac's original novel. According to Hayward, V\u00e9ra introduced Clouzot to it, and he secured the screen rights just before Hitchcock. \"He\u2026 blocked those rights for a year,\" she wrote, \"thus effectively preventing Alfred Hitchcock getting his hands on the story.\" Cinematic folklore suggests that Clouzot's insomnia meant he was up early enough to secure the rights mere hours before Hitchcock \u2013 though there is scant evidence to suggest it was such a close call.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How Monty Python and the Holy Grail changed comedy\n\u2022 The violent French film that transformed crime cinema\n\u2022 11 of the best films to watch this April\nOnce they were secured, Clouzot would play fast and loose with the original work. In particular, he moved the action to the closed environment of a school, something Gorrara believes is one of Clouzot's improvements. \"From my point of view,\" she says, \"the key improvement is setting the film in a boys' boarding school which provides the 'hermetically sealed' community so beloved of the whodunit/ locked-room mystery, but also provides a fascinating socio-cultural context for the trio's passion, corruption and horror.\"\nClouzot also shifted the relationships around, changing the plot from it being the husband and mistress seemingly ganging up to kill the wife, whose body then disappears, to making the two women the apparent plotters and the husband the ostensible victim. \"Making the husband the 'victim' and a sadist to boot allows Clouzot to entice us into complicity with the crime, which may well add to our dread when things go Gothically wrong,\" suggests Campbell of the change. In the book, the final twist is that the two women are the actual co-conspirators, as they are lovers; in changing the set-up, Clouzot removes the novel's more overt lesbian overtones but retains an implication of intimacy between the women, which seemingly helps to foster Christina's misplaced trust in Nicole.\nHitchcock would be quicker off the mark in securing Boileau-Narcejac's third novel, The Living and the Dead (1954), though perhaps the director wouldn't have been so determined if Clouzot hadn't snatched the previous work and made such a fine film from it. The resulting Hitchcock adaptation was Vertigo (1957), regularly considered one of cinema's greatest achievements. While Vertigo feels thematically connected to Les Diaboliques because of their shared authorship, many other films also took aspects from Clouzot's film without having such an overt connection.\nFrance wasn't particularly known for horror in the post-war period, but it's difficult to imagine the country's other great shocker, Georges Franju's Eyes Without a Face (1960), existing without Clouzot's film, if only because French film as a whole still veered away from too much cinematic darkness back then. Indeed, Clouzot opened the door for French cinema's return to horror and all things morbid, while the outbreak of psychologically tense, Gothic thrillers in Western cinema more generally seems spurred on by Les Diaboliques as much as by Hitchcock. It's difficult, without Les Diaboliques, to imagine the cinematic landscape later dominated by psychological thriller/horror hybrids such Jack Clayton's The Innocents (1961), Robert Wise's The Haunting (1963) and Roman Polanski's Repulsion (1965), to name but a few. In Italy especially, its imprint can be felt in the Giallo genre, with films by the likes of Mario Bava and Dario Argento taking the atmospheres and domestic tensions of Clouzot's film and often adding a dose of bloody violence, as well as visuals more obviously cribbed from Psycho.\nWhich brings us back to Robert Bloch, Les Diaboliques' great fan. Clouzot's film undoubtedly had a profound effect on both the writing of Psycho and Hitchcock's subsequent film, as evidenced by their shared mixture of the psychological and the insinuated supernatural, grim atmospherics, and a quintessential moment of terror unfolding in that most ordinary of spaces, the bathroom. As Campbell notes, despite being beaten to the rights of She Who Was No More, Hitchcock admired Clouzot's version and reportedly \"played it to the film crew while making\u00a0Psycho\u00a0\u2013 very possibly also emulating Clouzot's plea to the audience not to give away the ending\". In Hitchcock's case, he wove an anti-spoiler message throughout the film's advertising with one of the taglines being, \"If you can't keep a secret, please stay away from people after you see Psycho.\"\nConsidering Psycho's vast influence on cinema, Les Diaboliques' macabre DNA has undeniably been spread far and wide. \"I think that is the epitome of what the horror film should be,\" Bloch concluded of Les Diaboliques in the interview in L'Ecran Fantastique. With its wealth of scares, its chilling precision and undeniable lasting impact on Bloch and others, it certainly remains an essential benchmark the horror genre should aspire to.\n--\nIf you liked this story\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X, and\u00a0Instagram",

        "article_text": "When investigators smashed through a hastily built wall, they uncovered a set of secret jail cells.\nIt turned out to be a freshly bricked-up doorway \u2013 an attempt to hide what lurked behind.\nInside, off a narrow hallway, were tiny rooms to the right and left. It was pitch-black.\nThe team may never have found this clandestine jail \u2013 a stone's throw from Dhaka's International Airport \u2013 without the recollections of Mir Ahmad Bin Quasem and others.\nA critic of Bangladesh's ousted leader, he was held there for eight years.\nHe was blindfolded for much of his time in the prison, so he leaned on the sounds he could recall - and he distinctly remembered the sound of planes landing.\nThat was what helped lead investigators to the military base near the airport. Behind the main building on the compound, they found the smaller, heavily guarded, windowless structure made of brick and concrete where detainees were kept.\nIt was hidden in plain sight.\nInvestigators have spoken to hundreds of victims like Quasem since mass protests toppled Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed's government last August, and inmates in the jails were released. Many others are alleged to have been killed unlawfully.\nThe people running the secret prisons, including the one over the road from Dhaka airport, were largely from an elite counter-terrorism unit, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), acting on orders directly from Hasina, investigators say.\n\"The officers concerned [said] all the enforced disappearance cases have been done with the approval, permission or order by the prime minister herself,\" Tajul Islam, the chief prosecutor for the International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh, told the BBC.\nHasina's party says the alleged crimes were carried out without its knowledge, that it bears no responsibility and that the military establishment operated alone - a charge the army rejects.\nSeven months on, Quasem and others may have been released, but they remain terrified of their captors, who are serving security force members and are all still free.\nQuasem says he never leaves home without wearing a hat and mask.\n\"I always have to watch my back when I'm travelling.\"\nHe slowly walks up a flight of concrete steps to show the BBC where he was kept. Pushing through a heavy metal door, he bends his head low and goes through another narrow doorway into \"his\" room, the cell where he was held for eight years.\n\"It felt like being buried alive, being totally cut off from the outside world,\" he tells the BBC. There were no windows and no doors to natural light. When he was inside, he couldn't tell between day or night.\nQuasem, a lawyer in his 40s, has done interviews before but this is the first time he has taken the media for a detailed look inside the tiny cell where he was held.\nViewed by torchlight, it is so small an average-sized person would have difficulty standing up straight. It smells musty. Some of the walls are broken and bits of brick and concrete lie strewn on the ground - a last-ditch attempt by perpetrators to destroy any evidence of their crimes.\n\"[This] is one detention centre. We have found that more than 500, 600, 700 cells are there all through the country. This shows that this was widespread and systematic,\" says Islam, the prosecutor, who accompanied the BBC on the visit to the jail.\nQuasem also clearly remembers the faint blue tiles from his cell, now lying in pieces on the floor, which led investigators to this particular room. In comparison to the cells on the ground floor, this one is much larger, at 10ft x 14ft (3m x 4.3m). There is a squatting toilet off to one side.\nIn painful detail, Quasem walks around the room, describing how he spent his time during his years in captivity. During the summers, it was unbearably hot. He would crouch on the floor and put his face as close to the base of the doorway as he could, to get some air.\n\"It felt worse than death,\" he says.\nComing back to relive his punishment seems cruel. But Quasem believes it is important for the world to see what was done.\n\"The high officials, the top brass who aided and abetted, facilitated the fascist regime are still in their position,\" he says.\n\"We need to get our story out, and do whatever we can to ensure justice for those who didn't return, and to help those who are surviving to rehabilitate into life.\"\nPrevious reports said he was kept inside a notorious detention facility - known as Aynaghor, or \"House of Mirrors\" - inside the main intelligence headquarters in Dhaka, but investigators now believe there were many such sites.\nQuasem told the BBC he spent all his detention at the RAB base, apart from the first 16 days. Investigators now suspect the first site was a detective branch of police in Dhaka. \nHe believes he was disappeared because of his family's politics. In 2016 he'd been representing his father, a senior member of the country's largest Islamist party, the Jamaat-e-Islami, who was on trial and later hanged.\nFive other men the BBC spoke to described being taken away, blindfolded and handcuffed, kept in dark concrete cells with no access to the outside world. In many cases they say they were beaten and tortured.\nWhile the BBC cannot independently verify their stories, almost all say they are petrified that one day, they might bump into a captor on the street or on a bus.\n\"Now, whenever I get into a car or I'm alone at home, I feel scared thinking about where I was,\" Atikur Rahman Rasel, 35, says. \"I wonder how I survived, whether I was really supposed to survive.\nHe says his nose was broken and his hand is still painful. \"They put handcuffs on me and beat me a lot.\"\n\nRasel says he was approached by a group of men outside a mosque in Dhaka's old city last July, as anti-government protests raged. They said they were from law enforcement and he had to go with them.\nThe next minute, he was taken into a grey car, handcuffed, hooded and blindfolded. Forty minutes later, he was pulled out of the car, taken into a building and put in a room.\n\"After about half an hour, people started coming in one by one and asking questions. Who are you? What do you do?\" Then the beatings started, he says.\n\"Being inside that place was terrifying. I felt like I would never get out.\"\nRasel now lives with his sister and her husband. Sitting on a dining chair in her flat in Dhaka, he describes his weeks in captivity in detail. He speaks with little emotion, seemingly detached from his experience.\nHe too believes his detention was politically motivated because he was a student leader with the rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), of which his father was a senior member. His brother, who lived abroad, would frequently write social media posts critical of Hasina.\nRasel says there was no way of knowing where he was held. But after watching interim leader Muhammad Yunus visiting three detention centres earlier this year, he thinks he was kept in Agargaon district in Dhaka.\nIt was an open secret that Hasina had no tolerance for political dissent. Criticising her could get you \"disappeared\" without a trace, former detainees, opponents and investigators say.\nBut the total number of people who went missing may never become clear.\nA Bangladeshi NGO that has tracked enforced disappearances since 2009 has documented at least 709 people who were forcibly disappeared. Among them, 155 people remain missing. Since the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances was created in September, they have received more than 1,676 complaints from alleged victims and more people continue to come forward.\nBut that doesn't represent the total number, which is believed to be much higher.\nIt is through speaking to people like Quasem that Tajul Islam is able to build a case against those responsible for the detention centres, including Sheikh Hasina.\nDespite being held at different sites, the narrative of victims is eerily similar.\nMohammad Ali Arafat, spokesperson for Hasina's Awami League party, denies any involvement. He says if people were forcibly disappeared, it was not done under the direction of Hasina  - who remains in India, where she fled - or anyone in her cabinet.\n\"If any such detention did occur, it would have been a product of complex internal military dynamics,\"  said Arafat. \"I see [no] political benefit for the Awami League or for the government to keep these people in secret detention.\"\nThe military's chief spokesman said it \"has no knowledge of the things being implied\".\n\"The army categorically denies operating any such detention centres,\" Lt Col Abdullah Ibn Zaid told the BBC.\n\nTajul Islam believes the people held in these prisons are evidence of Awami League involvement. \"All the people who were detained here were from different political identities and they just raised their voice against the previous regime, the government of that time, and that is why they were brought here.\"\nTo date they have issued 122 arrest warrants, but no one has yet been brought to justice.\nWhich is why victims like Iqbal Chowdhury, 71, believe their lives are still in danger. Chowdhury wants to leave Bangladesh. For years after he was released in 2019, he didn't leave his house, not even to go to the market. Chowdhury was warned by his captors never to speak of his detention.\n\"If you ever reveal where you were or what happened, and if you are taken again, no one will ever find or see you again. You will be vanished from this world,\" he says he was told.\nAccused of writing propaganda against India and the Awami League, Chowdhury says that is why he was tortured.\n\"I was physically assaulted with an electric shock as well as being beaten. Now one of my fingers is heavily damaged by the electric shock. I lost my leg's strength, lost physical strength.\" He remembers the sound of others being physically tortured, grown men howling and crying in agony.\n\"I am still scared,\" says Chowdhury.\nRahmatullah, 23, is also terrified. \"They took away a year and a half of my life. Those times won't ever be returned,\" he says. \"They made me sleep in a place where a human being should not even be.\"\nOn 29 August 2023, he was taken from his home at midnight by RAB officers, some in uniform and others dressed in plain clothes. He was working as a cook in a neighbouring town while training to be an electrician.\nAfter repeated interrogations, it became clear to Rahmatullah he was being forcibly detained for his anti-India and Islamic posts on social media. Using a pen and paper, he draws the layout of his cell, including the open drain he would use to relieve himself.\n\"Even thinking about that place in Dhaka makes me feel horrible. There was no space to lie down properly, so I had to sleep being curled up. I couldn't stretch my legs while lying down.\"\n\nThe BBC also interviewed two other former detainees \u2013 Michael Chakma and Masrur Anwar \u2013 to corroborate some of the details about the secret prisons and what is alleged to have gone on inside them.\nSome of the victims live with physical scars from their detentions. All of them talk about the psychological torment that follows them everywhere they go.\nBangladesh is at a pivotal moment in its history as it tries to rebuild after years of autocratic rule. A crucial test of the country's progress towards democracy will be its ability to hold a fair trial for the perpetrators of these crimes.\nIslam believes it can, and must happen. \"We must stop the recurrence of this type of offence for our future generations. And we have to do justice for the victims. They suffered a lot.\"\nStanding in what remains of his concrete cell, Quasem says a trial must take place as soon as possible so the country can close this chapter.\nIt's not so simple for Rahmatullah.\n\"The fear has not gone away. The fear will remain until I die.\"",

It's one of the reasons why athletic performance tends to drop off from our 30s onwards.\nScientists are finding that being able to maintain an average reaction speed can be a key indicator that our brain is still in good working order, even into our latter decades. But that isn't all they can reveal. From your heart health to your overall risk of an early death, your reaction times can provide a window into the inner workings of the body.\u00a0\n\"Some people just tend to be faster than others, even before ageing effects really kick in,\" says Simon Cox, professor of brain and cognitive ageing at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. \"But a decline in reaction times probably indicates an accumulation of age-related degradation. It's a marker which tells us a lot about the combined functioning of quite a lot of biological systems.\"\nBut how can you assess your reaction time in the comfort of your home?\nOne easy assessment is a well-known experiment known as the \"ruler drop test\". You'll need the assistance of a family member or friend for this one, as well as a ruler:\n\u2022 Sit in a chair, resting your arm on a table so that your wrist is hanging off the edge, with your thumb and forefingers facing up.\n\u2022 Ask your partner to hold a ruler vertically, over your hand, with the \"zero\", where the numbers start, aligned with your thumb.\n\u2022 Without warning, your partner should drop the ruler, while you try to catch it as quickly as possible.\n\u2022 The distance the ruler falls before being caught is an assessment of your reaction time.\nBroadly speaking, an excellent performance equates to catching the ruler at a distance less than 7.5cm, above average counts as 7.5-15.9cm, average is 15.9-20.4cm, while below average is anything over 20.4cm and poor is more than 28cm.\nPopulation studies have noticed a correlation between the speed of decline in reaction times and risk of multiple age-related illnesses. In addition to a person's overall risk of death \u2013 one study found that there was a significant link between a person's reaction times and the likelihood of death from all major causes \u2013 there is also a strong relationship between this metric and the risk of death from specific conditions. This includes coronary heart disease, stroke and respiratory disease.\nA person's reaction times are also associated with their susceptibility to falls, losing the ability to live independently and the onset of dementia.\nHowever, according to Cox, a single reaction time measurement doesn't reveal all that much, as reaction speeds vary considerably from one person to another due to factors ranging from gender to genetics, physical fitness, lifestyle habits and even personality type. Cox notes that what is likely to be more important is how your reaction speed varies if you compare your performance on the same test over time \u2013 for example, at yearly intervals over the course of a decade - and whether it starts to noticeably decline.\nAs Cox points out, our ability to react relies on a network of interconnected sensory systems: how well we see, hear or even smell a given stimulus, how quickly our brain can process the information it's receiving from our eyes or ears and issue a signal in response, and finally how quickly our nerve fibres, muscles and tendons can enact what the brain is telling them to do. \"All these pieces of the jigsaw can be affected by ageing, and not necessarily to the same extent in all people,\" says Cox.\nThere are two components to a reaction to the ruler drop test \u2013 the brain's ability to make a quick assessment that it has been dropped, and the speed with which the body can act on the brain's instructions to catch it.\u00a0\nResearchers have found that the first component of this network which tends to break down, beginning in midlife, is our physical ability to act on the brain's signals. So, our brains might notice that the ruler has been let go within milliseconds \u2013 but it still takes a while for the body to catch up.\u00a0\nAt the University of Colorado Boulder, biomedical professor Alaa Ahmed\u00a0has found\u00a0that as we get older, our reaction times may depend more heavily on our overall bodily health than our brain. She says this may be because things like fast-twitch muscle fibres which enable our physical ability to respond quickly,\u00a0have waned, or because our mitochondria \u2013 the components within our cells which generate energy \u2013\u00a0are working less well, meaning that we're less efficient at moving swiftly.\n\"Making a faster movement is more costly to older adults, so they rely primarily on reacting faster,\" says Ahmed.\nAt the same time, if we stay relatively well, our brain and central nervous system can still function strongly into our latter years. According to Matthew Pain, a professor of biomechanics at Loughborough University in the UK, scientists have assessed this\u00a0by measuring\u00a0the \"startle reflex\" in the ankles of healthy elderly adults in response to a loud sound. The results showed their brain's ability to respond to the sound and send a \"move\" signal to the ankle tends to remain relatively intact.\n\"The raw nervous system hardware in healthy elderly [people] is not that [much] worse,\" says Pain. \"Purely based on the startle reflex, they could still react quickly enough to be disqualified at the Olympics for a false start. They wouldn't, however, be able to get out of the blocks very quickly.\"\u00a0\nAs well as the ruler test, reaction times can be assessed through simple computer games such as the\u00a0Human Benchmark Reaction Time Test which involves waiting for a red box to turn green and then clicking on it as quickly as possible. Sharp deteriorations in performance over time can reflect a combination of sensory systems breaking down, as well as a slowing of the brain's decision-making.\u00a0One study last year\u00a0found that loss of visual sensitivity in seeing and responding to patterns can be one of the earliest signs of dementia, beginning more than a decade before symptoms begin.\n\"With age, the nerve fibres in the brain's white matter can start to communicate signals less efficiently, resulting in slower information processing,\" says Cox. \"Once the decision has been made to react, the nerves that connect your brain to your muscles also need to be in good condition to transmit that message quickly, and these age too.\"\nBut there are things that we can all do to either slow or prevent this decline from happening. Pain recommends so-called dual task training, which involves simultaneous movement and cognitive training activities to tune both the brain and body. Examples include walking while turning your head from side to side, balancing on one leg while reciting the alphabet, or tossing a ball while verbally associating words.\nEven things like such as participating in fitness classes via a TV screen or tablet can help with your reaction times. \"This improves the ability to perceive [a stimulus] and respond with meaningful coordinated motions,\" says Pain.\nCox says that many of the activities which are often linked with healthy ageing, such as continuing to play a sport into later life, learning a musical instrument in retirement or simply keeping engaged with intellectual pursuits such as board games can have knock-on benefits for our reaction times.\n\"Sports performance drills which require fast responses could boost reaction times by enhancing both brain and body,\" says Cox. \"And there's some evidence that generally keeping more socio-intellectually engaged is related to slower cognitive ageing across aspects of complex thinking.\"\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The sweltering heat during Buddhist New Year calls for Thailand's cooling khao chae, a fragrant and refreshing bowl of rice delicately scented with flowers.\nBy the time Songkran, Thailand's new year based on the Buddhist calendar, arrives in April, the temperatures in the Southeast Asian country are soaring. The sky is typically blue and spotless, so reprieve under the shade of a passing cloud is non-existent while the humidity is as thick as a fleece blanket. One way to cool off is in the country-wide water fights that take place during the annual celebrations (this year from 13-15 April), which include water guns, buckets and coloured powder smeared onto the face like war paint. Another way to celebrate and cool off is to eat khao chae.\nKhao chae (soaked rice) is an icy, seasonal treat that marks the beginning of summer in Thailand. The history of the dish can be traced back hundreds of years to the Mon people, an ethnic group that originated throughout Myanmar and Thailand and integrated into what was then Siamese society in the 16th Century.\n[jump to recipe]\n\"The form of khao chae that we're looking at right now, especially in Bangkok, has very little resemblance to the Mon khao chae,\" says Leela Punyaratabandhu, a Thai scholar and the author of the 2017 cookbook Bangkok, which includes a recipe for khao chae. In the 16th Century, the soaked rice porridge was served in terracotta pots to keep the dish cold because ice wasn't readily available. The accompanying side dishes were also not nearly as intricate as they would eventually become.\nIt was within the kingdom of Siam's royal family, dating back to King Rama IV's rule in the 19th Century, that the dish blossomed into something far more complex \u2013 a metamorphosis of its humble origins. A lot of effort was made to ensure that khao chae looked visually beautiful, so side dishes included delicately carved vegetables shaped into flowers. In addition, ice, which was impossible for commoners to get at the time, distinguished kaho chae as an exclusively royal dish.\nThe recipe that exists now has been passed down through generations of royal cooks and aristocratic families. The dish starts by vigorously washing jasmine rice to remove all the starch. \"You have to wash the rice more than regular steamed rice so it doesn't stick together when cooked,\" explains Max Wittawat, the executive chef of New York City's Bangkok Supper Club. Wittawat grew up in Bangkok and was taught to make khao chae by culinary artist and teacher Jantararat Hemvej, who is known in Bangkok for having perfected khao chae.\nSince the rice also needs to withstand being soaked for long periods without falling apart, which would render the dish cloudy, washing it is especially important. After it's steamed, the rice is submerged in ice water that's perfumed with the scent of flowers, ranging from jasmine, ylang ylang, damask roses and bread flowers. \"It's a mark of summer when the flowers bloom,\" adds Wittawat.\nPunyaratabandhu has childhood memories of her grandfather using a spreadsheet to track the specific times that the flowers bloomed in his garden. \"All of this was very systematic,\" she says. It's important to pick the flowers at the precise time \u2013 typically the evening before preparing khao chae \u2013 in order to achieve the optimal fragrance. From there, the flowers are submerged in water for at least two hours to imbue their aroma.\u00a0\nEven the process of soaking the flowers is very intentional. If the flowers are left in the water for too long, they will bruise and go bad, leaving the water with a pungent and off-putting flavour. If they aren't steeped long enough, the bouquet will not be impactful enough to stand up to the side dishes served alongside khao chae. To enhance the dish's fragrance even further, a Thai culinary candle known as tian op may be used to smoke the flowery water.\nAnd that's just the base of the dish. Khao chae is an experience that includes many elaborate accoutrements. \"It's not only hard to make, but it's hard to eat as well,\" says Punyaratabandhu. This is because there are a lot of pungent, salty and fishy flavours that could be unfamiliar to some. \"Shrimp paste balls mixed with fish and then dipped in egg and fried? It's a far cry from pad see ew [stir-fried noodles].\"\nWhen Punyaratabandhu began writing her cookbook, she struggled with whether or not she should include a recipe for khao chae, knowing how impractical and challenging the dish can be to prepare at home. \"I knew it was going to be a tough sell, but also it's a part of Bangkok,\" she explains. \"My job was to be faithful to whatever is happening in Bangkok.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A rice dish with 'sexual power'\n\u2022 The 3,000-year-old new year's celebration\n\u2022 The Thai noodles eaten for breakfast\nEven Wittawat admits that khao chae, outside of the aristocratic society of Bangkok, was not really in Thailand's zeitgeist until the past 10 years, when many chefs began reflecting on their Thai heritage and exploring culturally significant and historical dishes. \"Before that, it was very old school and not common in restaurants,\" he says. \"But nowadays, with technology, the flowers can bloom throughout the year, and it has risen so much in popularity.\"\u00a0\nRecently, khao chae has become a social media darling due to its myriad side dishes, like shrimp paste dumplings, elaborately carved vegetables, stuffed shallots and peppers, sweetened beef and pork jerky and delicate egg nests. It's visually stunning, especially when served in traditional Thai pots or tiffins. \"Sometimes, it's too pretty to eat,\" Wittawat says.\nThere is a particular way to enjoy the dish to avoid muddying the crystal-clear flower-scented water. \"You're not supposed to put all the condiments with the rice,\" Wittawat says. Instead, you should alternate eating the rice and side dishes. Vegetables and pickles can cut through the heavier flavours of sweetened beef and salty shrimp paste. \"This is the fun thing about khao chae,\" Wittawat says, acknowledging that the various flavours work in tandem to keep the meal fresh and exciting. \"You can continue eating more and more.\"\nWittawat is happy that khao chae, once exclusive to the royal family and upper echelon of Thai society, is now more readily available and accessible to everyone \u2013 especially during Songkran, when Thailand is so hot. \"Thai people are returning to their roots,\" he says. \"They're appreciating their history and culture.\nKhao chae recipe\nby Max Wittawat\nServes 8\nThis is a general overview of how to make the rice for khao chae, along with two side dishes. Feel free to include additional sides to your liking.\nIngredients\n1 qt jasmine rice\nFlower-scented water (see Note)\nFor the shrimp paste balls:\n300g grilled catfish\n250g coconut milk\n200g coconut sugar \n100g fish sauce\n100g shrimp paste\n100g lemongrass\n100g lesser ginger or fingeroot\n100g garlic cloves\n100g shallots\n100g coriander root or stem\n50g pounded dried shrimp\n50g toasted desiccated coconut\n1 tbsp black peppercorns, ground \nsalt (to taste)\nbeaten eggs, for coating\n1 qt canola oil\nFor the stuffed green peppers:\n50g coriander root or stem\n50g garlic cloves\n10g white peppercorns\n250g pork mince\n100g minced shrimp\n1 tbsp sugar\n1 tsp salt\n8 green peppers, seeded and cored from the top (leave the peppers whole)\n2 chicken eggs\n1 duck egg\nMethod\nStep 1\nRinse the jasmine rice in water 4 to 5 times. Cook the rice in boiling water until half-cooked, then strain. Wash the rice in water again, using your hands to rub the rice; rinse and repeat until the water becomes clear. Transfer the rice to a steamer and steam until fully cooked. Let cool.\nStep 2\nTo make the shrimp balls, blend all the ingredients (except the eggs and oil) in a blender until smooth. Pour into a large nonstick frying pan and cook until thick paste forms. Let cool slightly, then roll into small balls.\nStep 3\nHeat the oil in a medium pot. Dip the shrimp balls into beaten eggs, then deep-fry until golden brown. Set aside. (Reserve the oil for the green peppers.)\nStep 4\nPound the coriander, garlic and peppercorns in a mortar with a pestle until smooth, then mix with the minced pork and shrimp. Season with sugar and salt. Stuff the mixture into the green peppers. Set the peppers into a steamer and steam for 10mins.\nStep 5\nTo make the egg net,\u00a0reheat the oil in the pot. Beat all the eggs together and strain through a sieve. Dip 5 fingers in the beaten eggs and shake into the pot of heated oil left to right, then up and down to form an egg net. When the eggs turn golden brown, transfer the egg net to a kitchen towel and place the steamed stuffed peppers on top, then roll the egg net around the peppers.\u00a0Repeat with the remaining peppers.\nStep 6\nSpoon the steamed rice into bowls and pour the cold scented over it. Enjoy the khao chae with the shrimp balls and stuffed peppers, as well as sliced cucumber, green mango, scallion and lesser ginger.\u00a0\nNote\nTo make the scented water, steep jasmine, ylang-ylang (\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e14\u0e31\u0e07\u0e07\u0e32) and chommanard (\u0e0a\u0e21\u0e19\u0e32\u0e14) flowers with drinking water and (if using) smoke with a Thai aromatic candle (\u0e40\u0e17\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e2d\u0e21) overnight. Once the water is infused, strain it, then chill thoroughly.\nThis story was originally published in 2024.\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n--\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on X, and Instagram.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",

        "article_text": "The number of plays and musicals staged by the UK's main subsidised theatres last year was down by almost a third compared with 10 years earlier, BBC research suggests.\nIn 2024, the 40 best-funded theatre companies that make their own productions - ranging from the National Theatre to the Colchester Mercury - opened 229 original productions, compared with 332 in 2014, a drop of 31%.\nFunding cuts and rising costs took much of the blame, with National Theatre executive director Kate Varah recently saying many in the industry are at \"breaking point\".\nBut some venues said the shows they do stage are on a bigger scale than a decade ago, with the aim of running for longer on tour or in the West End.\nLast week, actress Lesley Manville warned that new talent had \"less opportunity\" to develop than when she was starting out in the 1970s.\n\"It's going to be a diminishing discipline, because there's not always the amount of stage work available for them to go and do,\" she told BBC Radio 4 after winning an Olivier Award.\nLeeds Playhouse chief executive and artistic director James Brining said the venue had cut its number of homegrown shows from 12 to eight a year.\n\"That decision to contract has been forced upon theatres because it's so expensive, and increasingly so, to make work,\" he told BBC News.\n\"We love making work. So it's heartbreaking that the amount of work you can make is reducing, and it is reducing the pipeline opportunities for artists at the beginning of their careers.\"\nBritish theatre has \"a serious problem\" with the reduction in opportunities, added Brining, who is about to move from Leeds to run the Edinburgh Lyceum.\nMany performers and crew start their careers in theatres before going on to work in TV and film, arts education consultant and theatre blogger Carl Woodward said.\n\"A lot of Netflix stars and a lot of those people we see on dramas like Mr Bates vs the Post office and Adolescence cut their teeth in regional theatres.\n\"And if those opportunities are no longer there, then those pathways don't exist. And that is a national scandal, I think.\"\nThe theatre industry's financial pressures have had an impact on the workforce, with \"chronic low pay, job insecurity, poor work/life balance,\" he added.\nMany venues said they now co-produce more shows with other theatres or commercial operators to spread the costs and risks. That also means those productions can be on a bigger scale.\n\"Some individual productions that are made with the commercial sector are much bigger than anything we ever used to make,\" Birmingham Rep chief executive Rachael Thomas said.\n\"So for us, yes there are fewer productions coming out, but we are spending more because the productions that we are making are so much bigger than they ever used to be.\"\nHowever, the Rep has lost all of its annual local council funding - once worth more than \u00a31m a year - and smaller shows have often been squeezed out, Thomas said.\n\"I suppose the subsidy enables you to take the risk on the productions that are never going to recoup what they've cost, and often that will be the smaller-scale productions.\"\nIn 1995, the Rep's studio theatre staged the premiere of East Is East, four years before it became a hit British film. It couldn't afford to do a play of that scale in its studio today.\n\"I cannot see a world in which we could now launch a play which has got a cast size of nine or 10 in our 133-seater studio space now as a new play,\" Thomas said.\n\"For our model, and I would say for the vast majority of regional producing theatres, that is nigh on impossible.\"\nSalisbury Playhouse artistic director Gareth Machin said audience tastes had also changed, meaning it's harder to put on \"serious drama\", especially outside London.\n\"When money is tight, people want a good night out and they don't want to take a risk,\" he said.\n\"They're probably not coming out as much as they were, so when they do come out they don't want to take a chance on something they're not sure is going to be entertaining and a fun experience.\n\"So there's less misery and risk.\"\nNottingham Playhouse chief executive and UK Theatre joint president Stephanie Sirr said she didn't recognise the picture of a drop in productions, pointing out that \"it does fluctuate from year to year\".\n\"I do think it's more difficult to produce these days,\" she continued.\n\"The costs have gone up exponentially. Things like the energy costs really impact you if you're building scenery all day, or if you're running theatre lanterns all night.\"\nHowever, making more co-productions is a positive thing in most ways, and has meant \"we've been able to really increase the scale of the work we produce\", she said, with Nottingham's production of Dear Evan Hansen now on a major UK tour.\nA handful of venues staged more original shows in 2024 than 2014. They include Leicester Curve, which has put a focus on making musicals in collaboration with commercial producers, which can then go on the road.\nCurve has doubled its box office receipts over the past decade.\n\"By sharing resources and risk, we're able to, by default, do more work and create and present more work,\" chief executive Chris Stafford said.\n\"We are doing more with less in terms of public investment,\" he continued, but said the biggest challenge for many theatres would be affording essential building repairs and upgrades in the coming years.\nAnnual funding from Arts Councils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the Scottish equivalent has largely been stagnant for the past 10 years - while inflation has risen sharply - and many venues have had their local council subsidies cut. Many are also still recovering from the fallout from the pandemic.\nLast year, a survey by the group Freelancers Make Theatre Work depicted \"a workforce that is at breaking point\".\nPerformer and group spokesman Paul Carey Jones said the BBC research \"would come as no surprise to most theatre freelancers in the UK, who have been struggling with low rates of pay, career precarity and vulnerability, a lack of job certainty and a skills retention crisis for many years now.\n\"It shows the need for action from government in terms of funding for the arts, but also from the theatre industry to support its freelance workforce, on which it entirely depends.\"\nThe research for this story counted original and co-productions that opened in 2014 and 2024, including revivals, transfers and tours. They had to be professional in-person theatre productions, at least an hour long, and to have run for at least a week.

        "article_text": "As museums around the world celebrate the 250th birthday of JMW Turner, it's time to reappraise his beloved and celebrated painting, The Fighting Temeraire.\nJMW Turner's The Fighting Temeraire became a national celebrity when it was first unveiled in 1839, and its fame has endured to the present day. It was once voted Britain's favourite painting\u00a0and currently features on \u00a320 banknotes. But the widely accepted interpretation of this iconic painting's message might, in fact, contradict Turner's true intentions.\nThe \"Temeraire\" of the title refers to a 98-gun warship of the British Navy, which is depicted in the painting's background. It was a hero in Britain's defence against France during the Napoleonic Wars, but it caught the nation's attention in 1838 when it was dismantled and its parts sold off. Turner's painting depicts this once-mighty gladiator of the seas being towed down a burnished River Thames by a much more recently invented steam-powered tugboat.\nA brief segment in the 2012 James Bond film Skyfall captures a popular view about the painting. In the scene, Bond (Daniel Craig) meets Q (Ben Whishaw), his new head of research and development, in London's National Gallery, and they sit in front of The Fighting Temeraire. \"It always makes me feel a little melancholy\", says the young, tech-savvy Q, in a pointed jibe to 007, an old-school field agent. \"A grand old warship being ignominiously hauled away for scrap.\"\nThis echoes the widely held belief that the painting evokes a sense of nostalgia and faded national glory. According to this view, the ghostly Temeraire is the painting's heroine, and the tugboat its villain. In the 19th Century, the English writer William Makepeace Thackeray referred to the smaller vessel as \"a little, spiteful, diabolical steamer\" and the American novelist Herman Melville called it \"a pygmy steam-tug\" by comparison to the \"Titan Temeraire\".\nYou can see why Turner's original audience may have sympathised with the humbled HMS Temeraire and been saddened by her fate. Back in 1804, she had played a critical role in blockading French ports and defending the British coast. But her finest moment came on the afternoon of 21 October 1805, in the Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of south-west Spain.\nAt this pivotal hour, the Battle of Trafalgar, a deadly sea battle between the British Royal Navy and the combined fleets of Spain and France, was at its climax. Admiral Lord Nelson's flagship HMS Victory had led the attack but was being pummelled by the French vessel Redoubtable. Then, out of the cannon smoke, surged HMS Temeraire, followed by a war-hungry flotilla of British vessels. The Temeraire blasted the Redoubtable with her guns and endured a hailstorm of cannon volleys in return \u2013 an onslaught that lacerated the ship and spattered her decks with blood. But like a stalwart prize-fighter, the Temeraire weathered the bout. She valiantly protected her flagship and played a vital part in the British navy's ultimate victory in the Battle of Trafalgar.\nTurner was 64 when he painted The Fighting Temeraire. He was born in 1775 in a down-at-heel area of London near Covent Garden but managed to enrol at the prestigious Royal Academy of Arts aged 14. He became an Academician at the precocious age of 24, and a Professor of Perspective when he was just 32. But although he rubbed shoulders with the great and the good, he refused to soften his Cockney accent or refine his manners. He was also fiercely entrepreneurial \u2013 he opened his own private gallery, sought wealthy patrons, and was always on the lookout for captivating and lucrative new artistic projects that might have widespread appeal. On one level, The Fighting Temeraire achieves his desire for broad popularity by harnessing people's sense of national pride.\nBut there's an even more important message to learn from the painting than its patriotism and sentimentality. It concerns that much maligned tugboat: the true focal point of the painting.\u00a0 \u00a0\nSteam power was the new mechanical wonder of Turner's age, and his attitude to this recent technology was much more complicated than Thackeray, Melville or Q recognised. In other Turner artworks, like Snow Storm \u2013 Steam-Boat (1842) and Rain, Steam and Speed (1844), you can see his fascination with modern machinery and its transformative influence on individual experience, the environment, and society as a whole. This is in stark contrast with Turner's great rival John Constable, whose parents were from the elite, and whose paintings tended to overlook some of the most seismic changes that were reshaping the British Isles at the time.\nIn Constable's iconic 1821 painting The Hay Wain, an archaic cart rolls gently away from the viewer into a bucolic English landscape. Turner's The Fighting Temeraire gives us the exact opposite, putting the spectator on a collision course with the unstoppable force of industry.\nThis reflected contemporary reality. At the time The Fighting Temeraire was painted, the Royal Navy was increasingly using steamboats for towing bigger vessels. Moves were already afoot to replace its sail-powered fleet with new steam frigates. But the demise of the Temeraire didn't reflect a routine upgrade in armaments. This was a one-of-a-kind revolution in seafaring. Sailors around the world had relied on wind-and-sail or oar-propulsion for thousands of years. Now, steam engines could allow seafarers to overcome the vagaries of gusts, shallows and tidal patterns \u2013 to supersede nature itself. The future was steam-powered, but how this was going to affect the future of transport, trade and naval combat was still anybody's guess in the 1830s. What Turner did know was that as far back as Homer's Odyssey, sailing functioned as a profound symbol of the life journey in art and literature. And so, by hitching the old and the new so unforgettably in his painting, he shows us a compelling metamorphosis \u2013 the beginning of a new, post-industrial lifecycle in human history.\nTurner was awake to the responsibility of artists in times of irreversible historical change. For him, the age-old skill of depicting wooden sailing ships, their rigging, sails and ornately carved figureheads was becoming obsolete. The challenge for every artist (and every member of society) in the modern age, he realised, was to discover beauty and significance in newness, and in artefacts that had not previously been depicted in art, like iron funnels, pistons, valves, and paddle wheels. In The Fighting Temeraire, his rise to this challenge is captured in a very memorable and uncompromising symbol.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The forgotten Monet finally getting her moment\n\u2022 The schmaltzy paintings that divided the US\n\u2022 The surprising story of Van Gogh's guardian angel \nTurner even adapted his painting technique to express the technological and social transformations in the world around him. He used newly invented paint hues like Lemon Yellow and Scarlet Lake in The Fighting Temeraire. Pigment analysis of the painting also indicates that he raided from his kitchen for substances to add his paint to achieve desired effects, like tallow, cooking fat or even salad oil.\nHis interest in new technology, and his search for innovative techniques with which to represent them, had a direct impact on the next generation of avant-garde painters. Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro were both wowed by Turner's art. An engraving of Turner's Rain, Steam and Speed (which depicts a train hurtling over Maidenhead bridge) was even displayed at the first Impressionist Exhibition in Paris in 1874 \u2013 a pivotal event in the history of modern art.\nIn 2025 various exhibitions will celebrate the 250th anniversary of Turner's birth, from Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool (Turner: Always Contemporary), to Turner's House in Twickenham (Turner's Kingdom: Beauty, Birds and Beasts), and from the Yale Centre for British Art, Connecticut (JMW Turner: Romance and Reality) to Tate Britain (Turner and Constable). But to fully appreciate this extraordinary artist, it's important to grasp the true meaning of his masterpiece, The Fighting Temeraire.\nFrequently it's been accepted as a melancholy image, a forlorn lament for past glories and a lost way of life. But this misses its essential point. The Fighting Temeraire is really about transformation and the inevitability of change rather than nostalgia. The most important lessons to learn from The Fighting Temeraire are about Turner's attitude and outlook. It embodies his refusal to be daunted by newness or enslaved by traditional artistic values. His quest to find the beauty and grandeur of modern experience, and leave the past behind, is magnificently on display in The Fighting Temeraire. And these qualities are truly his lasting legacy to modern art.\nThe 250th anniversary of JMW Turner's birth is on 23 April 2025.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "She jets around the world for her high-profile beauty career, but her heart is in Seoul. Here are her top K-beauty experiences in town, from face lasers to body scrubs.\nFor Chriselle Lim \u2013 style guru, digital creator and creative director of PHLUR fragrances \u2013 self-care is a way of life. Especially when she visits South Korea, the birthplace of the viral \"K-beauty\"\u2013 \u00a0beloved for its multi-layer \"glass skin\" skincare regimens and high-tech sun creams.\nThe SpeciaList\n(Credit: Chriselle Lim)\nChriselle Lim is a Korean American fashion stylist, entrepreneur and digital influencer. She founded the fashion and lifestyle blog The Chriselle Factor in 2011, leading to collaborations with luxury brands including Dior and Chanel.\n\"Beauty and self-care in Korea is a daily thing,\" says the fresh-faced and flawlessly stylish Lim, who spent her formative years in the glamorous South Korean capital and returns with her daughters each year. \"It's not about hitting a certain age and then taking care of your skin. You just do it since you're a very young girl. As we're trying to reverse [sun damage] here in the States, in Korea, the women have been taught to protect themselves early on. We were always embarrassed about our moms taking us around in their crazy massive sun hats and their gloves. But now I get it. I've become that lady.\"\nWhile innovative Korean products like collagen sheet masks continue to dominate the international market, Korea is also seeing an uptick in beauty tourism. Consumers can visit \"skin clinics\" for medical aesthetic treatments powered by ultra-modern Korean technologies; often not yet approved by the FDA. Adding to the appeal, patients can get several treatments \u2013 from Botox to Titanium skin lifting to liquid laser sun spot removal \u2013 in one sitting with jaw-dropping transformations and little downtime \u2013 compared to Western protocols, which require patients wait 28 days between treatments.\u00a0\n\"I have a lot of followers that ask me for tips and where to go,\" says Lim. \"It makes a lot of sense. One, the technology is there. And two, it's so much cheaper [than the US], at least by five times. The flight there, renting an Airbnb or a hotel; it actually makes a lot of sense because you are saving money in the long run.\"\nNot that Lim ever needs a reason to visit Seoul. \"It's a fast-paced city that is extremely clean, chic, sophisticated,\" she says. \"Just imagine fashion and art and beauty all combined in one. It's one of those places I go whenever I'm feeling like I need inspiration.\"\nHere is Lim's go-to plan for a self-care holiday in Seoul.\nGangnam, the stylish district made world-famous by a certain 2012 K-pop song, is considered Seoul's K-beauty and medical tourism hot spot\u00a0 \u2013 and it's where Lim's self-care holidays start. First stop: Eun Skin Clinic in the affluent Cheongdam neighbourhood, south of the Han River.\nTip:\n\"A tip that people don't realise when planning is that you have to see what side of the river [Han] these places are and try to plan accordingly,\" says Lim. \"Because crossing that river can take so long; traffic is really bad, so you have to figure out the subway system or try to plan everything out in advance.\"\n\"They do incredible lasers, the best I've experienced,\" says Lim. \"They speak really good English there, which is a big make or break for me because I'm not fluent in Korean. And because [the doctor] deals with a lot of English-speaking people, I think she realises that a lot of them are here to explore and have fun, so she doesn't want to be so aggressive with their face. They do a very customised approach.\"\nKorean skin lasers, notes Lim, are so gentle they can even be layered on top of each other to compound their transformative effects.\u00a0\n\"It's very, very gentle,\" says Lim of her most recent visit. \"I did something called Ruby toning; helps with even skin tone and brightening. And there's another laser that I did called MeDioStar\u00ae, which is brightening and tightening. And then on top of that, I did PRP [platelet-rich plasma treatment]. And then I also did microneedling and then salmon DNA. It takes maybe an hour and a half to do.\"\nShe cautions:\u00a0 \"The next day, if you get five to eight treatments, your skin will be slightly bruised, but it goes away within, I would say, 48 hours. [These lasers are] effective on the deeper surface level, but on the topical level, you can't really tell that you've gotten anything done\u2026 But then after I went home, and people were like, 'Wait, did you, did you do something to your face? ' And you're like, 'Okay, I think it's kicking in'.\"\nLim recommends visitors hit skin clinics at the beginning of their trip \u2013 \"first thing when they land\u2026 because these clinics like to check up on you after three-to-five days. During that downtime, you could do coffee and check out some incredible museums and do some shopping.\"\u00a0\nWebsite: \nwww.eunskin.co.kr/\nAddress: 88-37 Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam District, Seoul\nPhone: +\n82 2 546 3322\nInstagram: @eunskinclinic/\nAs part of her downtime from skin procedures, Lim also likes to indulge in relaxing body treatments.\nTip:\nAs exciting as high tech and holistic body treatments may be, the traditional Korean spa experience happens at the jjimjilbang; the public bathhouse. \"Bathhouses in Korea are really interesting,\" says Lim. \"People go there to meet their friends, hang out and eat. They even go there after hours, after the club to detox the alcohol and sweat it out. It's fascinating; they don't really go there for the experience; it's to hang out with their friends.\"\n\"There's this spa called Gogyeol,\" says Lim. \"I love this place to reset my body. They do a traditional Korean massage and scrub.\"\nLike Eun Skin Clinic, Spa Gogyeol is found in Cheongdam; a two-minute walk from the Gangnam-Gu Office metro station. Lim notes that Spa Gogyeol is a not a jjimjilbang (a public Korean bathhouse). \"A lot of people love Korean bathhouses [because] they do this intensive scrub where they literally scrub off all the dead cells off your skin and it just comes purging off your body. It's pretty disgusting. But [Spa Gogyeol does] that treatment in a private setting, so you can get the body scrub, the upgrade massage and a detox wrap. They literally scrub off every dead skin cell on your body, and it just feels so soft. You feel like you're floating.\"\nSpa Gogyeol also offers a rich menu of holistic medical treatments, working with the body's five Tae energies. \"In Korean health, a lot of it is about balance,\" says Lim. \"So they'll really analyse your body to see what they need to focus on, and they'll customise it for you.\u00a0\n\"I think a lot of people that are on holiday just want to relax,\" she adds. \"A lot of tired mamas. It's a very calming space.\"\nWebsite: \nhttps://spa-gogyeol.com/\nAddress: 3F&4F, 13, Seolleung-ro 132-gil, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, South Korea \nPhone: +82 10-7682-1297\nInstagram: @spa_gogyeol\nWhere Eun Skin Clinic is expressly high tech and Spa Gogyeol takes a holistic approach, Lim's next spa pick \u2013 Trinity Spa in Seoul's Yongsan District \u2013\u00a0 is all about pampering and beautification.\nWhen to go\n\"Springtime is beautiful, but autumn is also stunning,\" says Lim. \"I would say a five-day trip would be incredible. There's so much to see in Korea, but even a three-day trip is worth it, just because, again, that the value that you're getting for these treatments are you getting the bang for your buck.\"\n\"It's a little tricky with Trinity spa because their English isn't the best,\" says Lim. \"But I think they're working on it.

They do everything from amazing facials, really focussing on lifting the face and focussing on your lines, and brightening and tightening to body contouring, massages. They cover it all.\"\nTrinity Spa's array of facial and body treatments toe the line between technology and relief \u2013 like the Real Jade Stone V-line jaw contour treatment or the lymphatic drainage leg massages \u2013 all administered in private guest rooms with cushy spa beds designed for ultimate relaxation.\u00a0\n\"It's just a very relaxing experience for someone that wants a general spa experience,\" says Lim.\u00a0\nWebsite: \nwww.trinityspa.co.kr/\nAddress: 3rd floor, Taeseok Building 116 Dokseodang-ro, Hannam-dong, Yongsan District, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-420-0797\nInstagram: \n@the_trinityspa_official/\nThe Korean skincare craze began in the early 2010s; global cosmetic purveyor Sephora's website now features a K-beauty section and Lim herself often provides K-beauty product recommendations on social media.\nSo when in Korea, shop as the Koreans do.\n\"Everyone needs to go to Amorepacific World Headquarters,\" declares Lim. Known as the inventor of the cushion foundation, Amorepacific now also owns many popular Korean skincare companies including Sulwhasoo, Innisfree, Cosrx and Laneige. \"It's open to the public, which a lot of people don't know,\" says Lim. \"In their lobby, you can get your face scanned; a lot of people go there to get their cushion foundation customised\u2026 they have a beauty store in their lobby, so you can experience all of their brands at once. [There's also] an interactive Amorepacific store called AMORE Seongsu. It's in this warehouse-y cement building; it's like you're walking through a store, but with a bathroom installation in front of you while you try things. Everything is technology-driven; you can get customised lip treatments, customised foundation. I could spend hours there.\"\u00a0\nLim adds: \"There's also the Sulwhasoo flagship store, which is just beautiful in itself.\"\nSulwhasoo, a luxury skin line, is headquartered in Seoul's upscale shopping district Sinsa-dong, in a modular structure channelling a golden lantern. \"The shopping is great, and it looks like you're entering an installation,\" says Lim. \"It has two spas. You could have, like, a foot scrub [or] a therapist with the singing bowl around your abdomen.\"\nLim also enjoys shopping for her favourite Korean brands at Olive Young. \"It's the Sephora of Korea,\" she says. \"They're on every corner. But the key thing is to know which one to go to. There's one in Myeongdong, which is the largest. Then the newest one is in Seongsu and it's a lot more tech-driven.\" Apart from beauty shopping, the five-storey Olive Young in Seongsu houses a cafe and a skin and scalp clinic as well as professional makeup services and a \"trend pod\" showroom. \"Olive Young can be slightly outdated depending which one you go to,\" says Lim. \"But this one feels like the future of what Olive Young will be.\"\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.apgroup.com/int/en/our-culture/amorepacific-space/amorepacific-headquarters/amorepacific-headquarters.html (Amorepacific World Headquarters)\nAddress: 100 Hangang-daero, Yongsan District, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-604-05114\nInstagram: \n@amorepacificgroup.official/\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.amoremall.com/kr/ko/store/display?storeCode=001 (Amorepacific Seongsu)\nAddress: 7 Achasan-ro 11-gil, Seongdong-gu, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-469-8600\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.sulwhasoo.com/int/en/flagship/dosan/index.html (Sulwhasoo flagship)\nAddress: 18 Dosan-daero 45-gil, Sinsa-dong, Gangnam District, Seoul\nPhone: +82 2-541-9270\nInstagram: \n@sulwhasoo.official/\nWebsite: \nhttps://global.oliveyoung.com/ (Olive Young Seongsu)\nAddress: 300-65 Seongsu-dong 2(i)-ga, Seongdong-gu, SeoulPhone:  +82 2-461-5290\nInstagram: @oliveyoung_global/\nTo cap off a day of beauty, Lim heads straight for the hair salon. \"This is actually quite common in Korea,\" she says. \"After you get all your skin treatments, you go get your hair done.\"\nLim favours ABYBOM, a massive, three-storey salon on Seolleung-ro that boasts a client roster of Korean celebs like Sandara Park. \"A lot of people that go to events get the full service of hair and makeup done,\" says Lim. \"They do amazing cuts.

[And] they have incredible coffee. It's actually quite hard to find non-dairy milks, but they have non-dairy milk there. So that's personally the reason why I like to go to that caf\u00e9, to just get my lattes without dairy milk.\"\u00a0\n\"There's a lot of things that we have been doing in Korea that I feel like the world is finally noticing,\" adds Lim. \"It's something that I'm very proud of.\"\u00a0\nWebsite: \nwww.abybom.com/\nAddress: 3\n\uce35\n, 40 Seolleung-ro 152-gil, Gangnam District, Seoul\nPhone: + 82-2-516-8765\nInstagram: \n@abybom__official/reels/ \nWebsite: \nhttps://nudake.com/en\nAddress: 26 Seongsui-ro 7-gil, Seongdong-gu, Seoul\nPhone: +82-7-041-284408\nInstagram: \n@nu_dake/\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

I want to stay in football but if I can't find anything - there are not that many professional teams in England in the women's game - then I need to look at maybe going back into estate agency work or something like that,\" added Beard.\n\"It would probably be a last resort for me. But at the end of the day I have a family I need to support. I need to look at all options.\"\nBeard believes losing his job is \"part and parcel\" of being a football manager and he was supported by the League Managers' Association (LMA) when he left Liverpool.\nBut his family moved up to north-west England from London, where the children started new schools, and he is conscious of disrupting things as he contemplates his next steps. \n\"I want to stay in the game and continue managing. I have my pro licence and degree in business management,\" said Beard. \n\"I think people see me as a fixer who can build something but I know I'm much more than that when I look back at my time as a football manager.\n\"Roles like a technical director or sporting director are something I would maybe consider. I might also look at high performance workshops or even podcasts.\"\nBeard left Liverpool on strong terms having guided the club to back-to-back WSL titles in 2013 and 2014 during his first spell, before winning the Women's Championship in 2022 on his return.\nHe says getting sacked with a year and a half left on his contract was \"difficult\" but he only has respect for the club and the support they gave him.\n\"It was going to happen at some point in my career,\" said Beard.\n\"You have to take emotions out of the conversation. I have no qualms with the decision but I still think we would have finished in the top five this season. \n\"It's frustrating losing your job. Was I owed time? I don't know. I have nothing but pride when I look at the journey. \n\"I have a great relationship with the club and the people. I respected the decision and it's just one of those things. I'm ready to go again now.\"\nTime away has allowed Beard to reflect on the state of the game and what it was like competing financially with WSL leaders Chelsea.\nHe says other clubs must find ways to invest and grow simultaneously - but not at the expense of losing their connection with the fanbase. \n\"I think you've seen the game grow so much in such a short space of time. I'm always concerned that we run before we walk,\" added Beard.\n\"I have always been an advocate for the bond we have with the fans. That's what makes our game unique and I don't want to see that go.\n\"I also look at Chelsea and the money they have spent\u2026 who can compete with that? They spent more on two players than we did on our entire squad. It's crazy.\n\"It's everyone else's problem. Arsenal have got it right, I think. They can compete financially, they have marketed their games well and get good crowds at the Emirates. I think that's probably the way forward.\"\nHead here to get involved\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

Then numerous television interviews, the media in the sumptuous press building.\nThen to the clubhouse, where he joined club members in the Grill Room to discuss the dramatic preceding hours that had captivated the sporting world. And then more television interviews.\nEventually he emerged into an adjacent room where we had been waiting - BBC Northern Ireland's Stephen Watson and RTE's Greg Allen - colleagues with whom I've shared so much time covering McIlroy's extraordinary career.\nAs he entered the room, the new Masters champion saw us waiting, puffed out his cheeks, leaned forward resting his elbows on the back of a sofa and gave us a look that said it all.\nWordlessly his eyes said: \"Can you believe what has happened? What is happening?\"\nThis video can not be played\nMcIlroy wins Masters play-off to complete career Grand Slam\nThe jacket was a perfect fit, a deeper green than you might imagine and in that moment came the realisation that he had actually done it. The burden had lifted, never again would we be able to ask the questions that had nagged him for more than a decade.\nNow, aged 35, he is an all-time great. Indisputably. He sits alongside Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Ben Hogan and Gene Sarazen - the only male golfers to have won all four of the tournaments that matter most.\nThe Grand Slam eluded some of golf's greatest names; Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson, Lee Trevino, Seve Ballesteros, Sir Nick Faldo and Phil Mickelson.\nNow with five majors, McIlroy moves alongside Ballesteros and trails Faldo by one.  Given that he is the first man from the continent to complete the Slam, Northern Ireland's sporting superstar might have eclipsed Faldo.\nIt could be argued that way, given McIlroy's 28 PGA Tour victories including two Players Championships. Outside his three Masters and three Open titles, Faldo won only three other events that count on the PGA Tour.\nBut it would be churlish to say either way, comparing eras is a fool's errand. What can be said is that McIlroy is in the conversation for being Europe's greatest men's golfer.\nAnd now he has shed a family of gorillas from his back he will be unburdened for future majors. The next one is at Quail Hollow, where he has enjoyed so much success in PGA Tour events.\nThen it's the US Open, a championship he has narrowly missed winning in the past two years, before The Open at Royal Portrush in his native Northern Ireland. Opportunities abound in 2025.\nWhat does McIlroy get for Masters triumph?\nHow coping with 'heartbreak' changed everything for McIlroy \nMasters & Slam success will 'free me up' - McIlroy\nMcIlroy's golfing talent is beyond question. The same could not be said of his temperament because of the weighty burden of an 11-year wait for his fifth major win.\nThe Masters was the biggest hurdle. He feels he should have won it in 2011 when he capitulated to a final round 80.\nIt is the tournament that inspired him to play the game, the one he wanted most. It is why nerves so very nearly got the better of him last Sunday.\nThe biggest battle was with himself.  Golf is a test of nerve and that element undermines any technical gifts, no matter how grand they might be.\nBut somehow he clung on to deny Rose - a 44-year-old, who surely deserves another major and plays this game with commendable grace and class.\nToo often golf sits in the sporting shadows, but last Sunday these two titans dragged the game into a spotlight that has rarely shone brighter.\nMcIlroy now sits alongside the greatest of UK sporting icons. \nSir Roger Bannister, Sir Steve Redgrave, Sir Lewis Hamilton, Sir Andy Murray, Sir Bradley Wiggins, Sir Mark Cavendish, Sir Chris Hoy, Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill, Dame Laura Kenny, Sir Jimmy Anderson - the list goes on and the order can be argued any which way. \nBut you can see where McIlroy might end up.\nThe bottom line is that in golf and in sport in general, McIlroy is right up there. Supremely talented to the extent that he could conquer vulnerabilities that had threatened an under-achiever tagline.\nWe can't say that any longer. There is so much more to talk about when it comes to Rory McIlroy.\nNot speaking to DeChambeau 'part of game plan'\nMcIlroy could win 'five or six more majors'",

        "article_text": "As the trade war between China and the US escalates, attention has been focused on the increasingly high levels of tit-for-tat tariffs the two countries are imposing on one another.\nBut slapping reciprocal tariffs on Washington is not the only way Beijing has been able to retaliate. \nChina has now also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets, dealing a major blow to the US.\nThe move has laid bare how reliant America is on these minerals.\nThis week, Trump ordered the commerce department to come up with ways to boost US production of critical minerals and cut reliance on imports - an attempt by Washington to reclaim this critical industry.  But why exactly are rare earths so important and how could they shake up the trade war? \n\"Rare earths\" are a group of 17 chemically similar elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products.\nMost are abundant in nature, but they are known as \"rare\" because it is very unusual to find them in a pure form, and they are very hazardous to extract.\nAlthough you may not be familiar with the names of these rare earths - like Neodymium, Yttrium and Europium - you will be very familiar with the products that they are used in.\nFor instance, Neodymium is used to make the powerful magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, EV motors and jet engines that enable them to be smaller and more efficient.\nYttrium and Europium are used to manufacture television and computer screens because of the way they display colours.\n\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" explains Thomas Kruemmer, Director of Ginger International Trade and Investment.\nRare earths are also critical to the production of medical technology like laser surgery and MRI scans, as well as key defence technologies.\nChina has a near monopoly on extracting rare earths as well as on refining them - which is the process of separating them from other minerals.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China accounts for about 61% of rare earth production and 92% of their processing.\nThat means it currently dominates the rare earths supply chain and has the capacity to decide which companies can and cannot receive supplies of rare earths.\nBoth the extraction and processing of these rare earths are costly and polluting. \nAll rare earth resources also contain radioactive elements, which is why many other countries, including those in the EU, are reluctant to produce them.\n\"Radioactive waste from production absolutely requires safe, compliant, permanent disposal. Currently all disposal facilities in EU are temporary,\" says Mr Kruemmer.\nBut China's dominance in the rare earth supply chain didn't take place overnight - but rather, is the result of decades of strategic government policies and investment.\nIn a visit to Inner Mongolia in 1992, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw China's economic reform, famously said: \"The Middle East has oil and China has rare earths\". \n\"Beginning in the late 20th century, China prioritised the development of its rare earth mining and processing capabilities, often at lower environmental standards and labour costs compared to other nations,\" said Gavin Harper, a critical materials research fellow at the University of Birmingham.\n\"This allowed them to undercut global competitors and build a near-monopoly across the entire value chain, from mining and refining to the manufacturing of finished products like magnets.\"\nIn response to tariffs imposed by Washington, China earlier this month began ordering restrictions on the exports of seven rare earth minerals - most of which are known as \"heavy\" rare earths, which are crucial to the defence sector. \nThese are less common and are harder to process than \"light\" rare earths, which also makes them more valuable.\nFrom 4 April, all companies now have to get special export licenses in order to send rare earths and magnets out of the country.\nThat is because as a signatory to the international treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, China has the ability to control the trade of \"dual use products\".\nAccording to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), this leaves the US particularly vulnerable as there is no capacity outside China to process heavy rare earths.\nA US Geological report notes that between 2020 and 2023, the US relied on China for 70% of its imports of all rare earth compounds and metals.\nThis means that the new restrictions have the ability to hit the US hard.\nHeavy rare earths are used in many military fields such as missiles, radar, and permanent magnets.\nA CSIS report notes that defence technologies including F-35 jets, Tomahawk missiles and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles all depend on these minerals.\nIt adds that this comes as China \"expands its munitions production and acquires advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States\".\n\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial,\" said Mr Kroemmer.\nAnd it's not only in the field of defence.\nUS manufacturing, which Trump has said he hopes to revive through the imposition of his tariffs, stand to be severely impacted.\n\"Manufacturers, particularly in defence and high-tech, face potential shortages and production delays due to halted shipments and limited inventories,\" said Dr Harper.\n\"Prices for critical rare earth materials are expected to surge, increasing the immediate costs of components used in a wide range of products, from smartphones to military hardware,\" he says, adding that this could result in potential production slowdowns for affected US companies. \nIf such a shortage from China persists in the long-run, the US could potentially begin diversifying its supply chains and scaling up its domestic and processing capabilities, though this would still require \"substantial and sustained investment, technological advancements and potentially higher overall costs compared to the previous dependence on China\".\nAnd it's clear this is something already on Trump's mind. This week, he ordered an investigation into the national security risks posed by the US' reliance on such  critical minerals. \n\"President Trump recognises that an overreliance on foreign critical minerals and their derivative products could jeopardise US defence capabilities, infrastructure development, and technological innovation,\" said the order.\n\"Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, are essential for national security and economic resilience.\"\nThe US has one operational rare earths mine, but it does not have the capacity to separate heavy rare earths and has to send its ore to China for processing.\nThere used to be US companies that manufactured rare earth magnets - until the 1980s, the US was in fact the largest producer of rare earths.\nBut these companies exited the market as China began to dominate in terms of scale and cost.\nThis is largely believed to be part of why US president Donald Trump is so keen to sign a minerals deal with Ukraine - it wants to reduce dependency on China.\nAnother place Trump has had his eye on is Greenland - which is endowed with the eighth largest reserves of rare earth elements. \nTrump has repeatedly showed interest in taking control of the autonomous Danish dependent territory and has refused to rule out economic or military force to take control of it. \nThese might have been places that the US could have sourced some of its rare earth exports from, but the adversarial tone Trump has struck with them means the US could be left with very few alternative suppliers.\n\"The challenge the U.S. faces is two-fold, on the one hand it has alienated China who provides the monopoly supply of rare earths, and on the other hand it is also antagonising many nations that have previously been friendly collaborators through tariffs and other hostile actions,\" said Dr Harper. \n\"Whether they will still prioritise collaboration with America remains to be seen in the turbulent policy environment of this new administration.\"",

China has now also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets, dealing a major blow to the US.The move has laid bare how reliant America is on these minerals.This week, Trump ordered the commerce department to come up with ways to boost US production of critical minerals and cut reliance on imports - an attempt by Washington to reclaim this critical industry.",

He previously served as a deputy permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva and has held several key jobs in the commerce ministry.\nSpeaking to Reuters, one expert said the change in jobs was \"very abrupt and potentially disruptive\" given the current trade tensions - adding that Wang also had experience negotiating with US since the first Trump administration. \n\"It might be that in the view of China's top leadership, given how tensions have continued escalating, they need someone else to break the impasse... and finally start negotiating,\" said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, a senior adviser to the Conference Board's China Centre. \nHowever, another analyst who spoke to Reuters suggested the move could just be a \"routine promotion\" that just happened to come at a particularly tense period in time. \nSpeaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Sheng Laiyun, deputy commissioner of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) warned that US levies would put pressure on China's foreign trade and economy, but added that China's economy is resilient and should improve in the long term. \n\"We firmly oppose the US practice of tariff barriers and trade bullying,\" said Sheng.\n\"It violates the economic laws and the principles of the World Trade Organization, has a serious impact on the world economic order, and drags down the recovery of the world economy.\"\nIn an editorial by state news outlet China Daily earlier this week, the outlet described the US's behaviour as \"capricious and destructive\", adding that it should \"stop whining about itself being a victim in global trade\". \n\"The US is not getting ripped off by anybody...rather... [it] has been taking a free ride on the globalisation train,\" the editorial went on to say. \nBeijing's GDP figures for the first quarter have beaten analysts' expectations - which hovered around 5.1%.\nGrowth in the world's second-largest economy was underscored by strong retail sales and promising factory output.\nBut US tariffs on China soared only in recent weeks. Trump raised them to 145% early last week, and Beijing retaliated by raising levies on US goods to 125%.\nSo some of the expansion could be down to factories rushing out shipments to beat Trump's tariffs - a concept called \"front loading\".\nAnalysts say a surge in China's exports in March will be sharply reversed in the months ahead as tariffs take full effect.\nChina's property downturn is also still dragging on growth. Property investment fell by almost 10% in the first three months of 2025 compared to the same period last year.\nNew home prices also were unchanged compared to the previous month - a sign that there are still too many empty homes, and not enough people buying them.\nOfficials have said there is ample room for stimulus measures, and plenty of tools that they can use to bolster the economy and roll out more support measures.\nBut it will be especially important for China to boost domestic demand and spending this year as Washington's tariffs hits Beijing's crucial export sector.

However, she has been granted safe passage to Brazil after seeking asylum in the Brazilian embassy.\nHumala's lawyer said he would appeal against the conviction. \nUnlike her husband, Heredia was not present in court when Judge Nayko Coronado passed sentence - she had entered the Brazilian embassy along with the couple's son before an arrest warrant could be executed. \nBrazil offered her asylum and the Peruvian government said it would honour the 1954 asylum convention to grant both Heredia and her son safe passage.\nThe former president, 62, was meanwhile taken to Barbadillo prison, where two other former leaders, Alejandro Toledo and Pedro Castillo, are already being held.\nHumala was the first of four Peruvian presidents to be investigated in connection with the Odebrecht scandal.\nToledo, who governed from 2001 to 2006, was sentenced last year to more than 20 years in prison for taking $35m (\u00a326m) in bribes from the company.\nAlan Garc\u00eda, president from 1985 to 1990 and 2006 to 2011, killed himself in 2019 as he faced imminent arrest over allegations he was bribed by Odebrecht. He had denied the accusations.\nPedro Pablo Kuczynski, in office from 2016 to 2018, faced impeachment proceedings after it emerged that Odebrecht had paid him millions of dollars in his previous government role. \nThe investigation is ongoing. Kuczynski has always maintained the payments were not illegal. \nProsecutors said that Humala and his wife, with whom he cofounded the Nationalist Party, had accepted $3m in illegal contributions from the firm, which they used to finance his 2011 presidential campaign.\nThey also accused of taking $200,000 from Venezuelan leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to bankroll the 2006 campaign. \nThe couple have always maintained that they are the victims of political persecution. \nHumala's lawyer, Wilfredo Pedraza, also said that their 15-year sentence was \"excessive\".\nProsecutors had asked for 20 years for the ex-president and 25 and a half years for Heredia. \nHumala is a former army officer who fought against the Maoist Shining Path rebels. He first came to national prominence in 2000 when he led a short-lived military rebellion against then-president Alberto Fujimori.\nIn 2006, he ran for president on a platform inspired by the socialist revolution of Venezuela's Ch\u00e1vez.\nAlan Garc\u00eda, Humala's election rival, warned voters \"not to let Peru turn into another Venezuela\" and won the presidency. \nIn 2011, Humala ran on a more moderate platform emulating the policies of Brazil's then-president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva to defeat right-wing rival Keiko Fujimori, the eldest daughter of Alberto Fujimori. \nViolent social conflicts quickly dented his popularity, and he lost the support of many members of Congress.\nHis legal troubles started shortly after his term finished in 2016, when Odebrecht admitted to bribing Latin American government officials and political parties with hundreds of millions of dollars to win business.\nProsecutors accused Humala and his wife of receiving millions from Odebrecht, as well as the illegal funding from Ch\u00e1vez to finance the 2006 presidential campaign.\nA year later, a judge ordered that the couple be placed in pre-trial detention. They were released after a year but the investigations against them continued, culminating in today's verdict.",

        "article_text": "A leading GP has said that people ordering illicit weight loss drugs online are \"dicing with death\" after a BBC investigation found illegal injections are being sold over social media and sent to people in Northern Ireland.\nBBC News NI made test purchases of syringes which claimed to contain semaglutide, a prescription-only drug, via Facebook from sellers based in England.\nWhen tested, the liquid was not semaglutide but did contain carnitine \u2013 a supplement that can be bought on the high street.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it was working at an international level to root out criminal gangs selling illicit jabs manufactured in unhygienic labs.\nDr Frances O'Hagan, chair of the BMA Northern Ireland GP Committee, said taking medication without knowing what it contains is \"really dangerous\".\n\"These drugs properly prescribed can be dangerous if not taken correctly.\n\"But for people to put stuff in their bodies that isn't the drug in the first place with no directions coming with it, wrapped up in kitchen roll I'm led to believe, is just so incredibly dangerous.\"\n\"You can die,\" she added.\nSo-called skinny jabs are prescribed weight loss injections that work by making you feel fuller and less hungry.\nIn Great Britain, semaglutide is available on the NHS as part of a weight management programme.\nHowever, in Northern Ireland it is not as there is no specialist weight management service.\nBut it is available on private prescription.\nThe Department of Health in Northern Ireland said people were putting themselves at serious risk buying from sellers on social media sites.\nThe BBC purchased the alleged weight loss injections from an account on Facebook.\nFour syringes, with needles attached, arrived wrapped in kitchen roll with no labels or guidance of what they contained.\nProf Panagiotis Manesiotis, head of the School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Queen's University Belfast, screened two of the syringes.\n\"It is absolutely shocking that people are taking the risk to purchase pharmaceuticals like this in an injectable form off the internet,\" he said.\n\"You don't know whether you're allergic to the content of it, you don't know if it's being manufactured in a clean way.\n\"Seeing how those samples arrived to me, I have serious concerns about health effects that they might have on the public.\"\nHe added that the needles themselves could be a carrier for bacterial infections, and could cause sepsis, which is a condition that needs to be treated immediately and requires urgent care.\n\"It could ultimately result in someone's death,\" he said.\nThe Department of Health said people should consider the implication of buying drugs online from dubious sources.\n\"There is no way of knowing what you are buying is what you think it is, and this can have serious consequences for your health,\" the department said.\nBBC News NI identified a number of social media accounts across multiple platforms promoting the availability of weight loss injections without prescription or medical supervision.\nFollowing our investigation, TikTok and Telegram shut down accounts we engaged with for violating their policies on the trade of regulated goods and services.\nMeta did not request the details of the user accounts.\nThe PSNI also warned people about buying drugs online without consulting a medical professional.\n\"These unregulated drugs are often produced in illicit, unhygienic laboratories and are made to look like the genuine product, meaning that they can be incredibly dangerous to take,\" it added.\nTikTok told the BBC it did not the allow the trade or marketing of regulated, prohibited, or high-risk goods, including prescription drugs.\n\"In Q3 2024 we removed 96% of content found to violate these policies before it was reported to us,\" a statement added.\nThe messaging service Telegram said the sale of prescription drugs is explicitly forbidden on its platform and is removed when discovered.\nAdding it would \"proactively monitor public parts of the platform and accept reports from users and organisations in order to remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day.\"\nMeta told the BBC: \"We don't allow the sale of pharmaceutical drugs on Instagram or Facebook and we remove content about weight loss that contains a miracle claim and attempts to buy, sell, trade, donate or gift weight loss products.\"\nFrom 2022 to 2024, the Department of Health's Medicines Regulatory Group (MRG) conducted 18 investigations focusing on the unlawful possession, advertisement and/or supply of counterfeit or unlicensed weight loss medicinal products.\nTo date, one person has been successfully prosecuted and a further four prosecutions are pending.\nMRG has also issued 10 formal Advice and Warning letters, seized over 340 weight loss medicinal products and reported two persons to their professional regulatory bodies.\nJulianne Dickenson, a dietician in south Belfast, said the problem was access to the medications.\n\"I've heard of people getting them from criminal gangs and social media,\" she said.\n\"So, if something is a lot cheaper than normal, that's a red flag.\n\"Try and check that your doctor is registered with the General Medical Council, that your pharmacy is registered, if you have any concerns always go and talk to your GP.\"\nShe added that a collaborative approach was needed to tackle obesity.\n\"It is a chronic, relapsing and progressive disease,\" she said.\n\"So everybody has to work together, it has to come from individuals, it has to come from communities, it has to come from schools, workplaces, food manufacturers, the NHS and the government.\"",

'Noise harm'The report by the council's planning department refused permission for the slide because it was in \"an unsuitable location which is heavily reliant on a private vehicle and is not accessible by a range of transport modes and fails to protect landscape character\".It also noted that the attraction \"would cause significant noise harm to neighbouring properties which would be considered unacceptable\".A resident of the hamlet, who did not want to be named, told the LDRS: \"He [Mr Lance] has six months to appeal after February's refusal so he can continue operating until the end of the summer. \"A spokesperson for Cornwall Council said it would \"consider the appropriate course of action\" when its investigation was complete.Follow BBC Cornwall on X, Facebook and Instagram.

        "article_text": "Luka Modric, Kylian Mbappe and Cristiano Ronaldo have shown their intent to own or invest in football clubs\nLuka Modric became the latest high-profile footballer to signal his interest in swapping the dressing room for the boardroom.\nOn Monday, it was announced the Real Madrid midfielder was \"investor and co-owner\" with a minority stake in Championship side Swansea City.\nBBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team looks into why more and more footballers are investing in football clubs, rather than going into management.\nIn February, Cristiano Ronaldo expressed a lack of desire to move into the dugout, once his playing days are over.\n\"Me as a manager? I don't see it\u2026 it's more difficult than being a player,\" said Ronaldo.\n\"If I can be a club owner, why would I be a manager, sporting director or CEO? That is a dream of mine and I am sure I'll be a club owner. I hope to have not just one club, but several clubs.\"\nOther players have gone one step further by investing in football clubs before retirement.\nKylian Mbappe (SM Caen), Sadio Mane (Bourges Foot 18) Juan Mata (San Diego FC), Wilfried Zaha (AFC Croydon), Cesar Azpilicueta (Hashtag United) and Hector Bellerin (Forest Green) are just some of the names who appear to be planning for life after football.\n\"I've got no interest in being a manager. It's not a passion of mine,\" said David Beckham (co-owner of Inter Miami and Salford City).\n\"Being a coach is too much work,\" said Zlatan Ibrahimovic (investor in Hammarby and senior advisor at AC Milan).\nBoth Beckham and Ibrahimovic had public run-ins with managers during their playing careers and it could be argued they are better suited at the top of the tree, rather than managing a squad of 25 players and taking instructions from a board of directors.\nFootball finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport: \"Footballers do not necessarily want to go into a coach/management role because of the stresses it brings. It also doesn't suit some personalities.\"\nBallon d'Or to boardroom \u2013 why Swansea for Modric?\nModric becomes Swansea 'investor and co-owner'\nThe majority of football clubs do not make enough profit to financially benefit their owners and investors.\nSwansea's revenue stream has dwindled since their seven-year spell in the top flight ended in 2018 and the club have accumulated losses of \u00a339m over the past three years.\n\"I don't believe it's a financial move for the player. Swansea is losing \u00a3450,000 a week. He will bring his expertise to the table,\" said Maguire.\n\"Luka Modric is not a brand like Ronaldo, Beckham or Mbappe. He is just a very good footballer. Modric wouldn't be named in a list of top 10 well-known players. \nMaguire added: \"If a player is a brand in their own right, there are financial benefits for them and their clubs. But they do it for the love of the game and it allows them to stay in the realms of football.\"\nThat is not to say pursuing football club ownership is not without risk.\nIn July 2024, Mbappe completed the takeover of Ligue 2 side Caen, investing \u00a312.6m in a majority stake. His first season in club ownership is likely to end with relegation for the French team.\nSpain's all-time top goalscorer David Villa was a co-founder of Queensboro FC. Since the club was announced in November 2019, they are yet to make their debut in the USL Championship, the second tier of football in the United States.\nEden Hazard was announced as the co-owner - along with former Chelsea team-mate Demba Ba - of San Diego 1904, who were set to play in the North American Soccer League (NASL). The league collapsed before the club could play their first game.\nMeanwhile, the 'Class of 92' led by Gary Neville are aiming to take Salford City to the Championship by 2029. The club reached the English Football League with four promotions in five years but have remained in League Two since 2019.\nPlayers are actively seeking out opportunities to learn about the business side of the game.\nAjax's Jordan Henderson, Aston Villa's Tryone Mings, and Manchester City's Ilkay Gundogan are just some of those taking courses in football business management.\n\"The PFA [Professional Footballers Association] has its own business school. Helping assist players from dressing room to boardroom. Rather than the dugout,\" Maguire added.\n\"Footballers have a unique understanding of the game. They can combine skills they have gained from their playing days and can bring that to the boardroom\".\nFormer Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler is enrolled on the PFA Business School's Sporting Directorship programme.\n\"There is more to football than playing and coaching. It just isn't about playing and I find that fascinating,\" said Fowler.\n\"We want to see the game grow and be part of it. Coaching and managing is difficult and this job is extremely difficult. It is an avenue to stay within the parameters of football.\"\nHow do athletes manage sleep, and how can you improve yours?\nHow does BBC report on big stories about itself?\nWhy are there so many international breaks in football?\nWhen does it get too hot to play tennis?\nHow does the new Club World Cup work & why is it so controversial?\nWe're looking for your questions for the Ask Me Anything team. Post them in the comments section and we'll look to answer the best of them in the future.\nBallon d'Or to boardroom \u2013 why Swansea for Modric?\nWhy on earth buy a football club?\nNeville acquires Lim's Salford City stake",

He previously served as a deputy permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva and has held several key jobs in the commerce ministry.\nSpeaking to Reuters, one expert said the change in jobs was \"very abrupt and potentially disruptive\" given the current trade tensions - adding that Wang also had experience negotiating with US since the first Trump administration. \n\"It might be that in the view of China's top leadership, given how tensions have continued escalating, they need someone else to break the impasse... and finally start negotiating,\" said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, a senior adviser to the Conference Board's China Centre. \nHowever, another analyst who spoke to Reuters suggested the move could just be a \"routine promotion\" that just happened to come at a particularly tense period in time. \nSpeaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Sheng Laiyun, deputy commissioner of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) warned that US levies would put pressure on China's foreign trade and economy, but added that China's economy is resilient and should improve in the long term. \n\"We firmly oppose the US practice of tariff barriers and trade bullying,\" said Sheng.\n\"It violates the economic laws and the principles of the World Trade Organization, has a serious impact on the world economic order, and drags down the recovery of the world economy.\"\nIn an editorial by state news outlet China Daily earlier this week, the outlet described the US's behaviour as \"capricious and destructive\", adding that it should \"stop whining about itself being a victim in global trade\". \n\"The US is not getting ripped off by anybody...rather... [it] has been taking a free ride on the globalisation train,\" the editorial went on to say. \nBeijing's GDP figures for the first quarter have beaten analysts' expectations - which hovered around 5.1%.\nGrowth in the world's second-largest economy was underscored by strong retail sales and promising factory output.\nBut US tariffs on China soared only in recent weeks. Trump raised them to 145% early last week, and Beijing retaliated by raising levies on US goods to 125%.\nSo some of the expansion could be down to factories rushing out shipments to beat Trump's tariffs - a concept called \"front loading\".\nAnalysts say a surge in China's exports in March will be sharply reversed in the months ahead as tariffs take full effect.\nChina's property downturn is also still dragging on growth. Property investment fell by almost 10% in the first three months of 2025 compared to the same period last year.\nNew home prices also were unchanged compared to the previous month - a sign that there are still too many empty homes, and not enough people buying them.\nOfficials have said there is ample room for stimulus measures, and plenty of tools that they can use to bolster the economy and roll out more support measures.\nBut it will be especially important for China to boost domestic demand and spending this year as Washington's tariffs hits Beijing's crucial export sector.

        "article_text": "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery falls to his knees after his side miss a chance against Paris St-Germain at Villa Park\nUnai Emery has enjoyed too much success in Europe to listen to talk of glorious failure but, if there is such a thing, Aston Villa delivered it on a night of pure theatre at Villa Park.\nVilla's Champions League odyssey ended with defeat by Paris St-Germain, but the manner in which they unnerved arguably the most impressive side in this season's competition demonstrated that they belonged in this elite company.\nIt has been 42 years since they were last in this competition, then as holders. It will not be as long again if they continue the progress under expert European operator Emery, who almost engineered yet another glory night to add to his stellar managerial CV.\nIt is probably just as long since the grand old stadium rocked like this in such an electric atmosphere, as Villa looked down and out when PSG struck twice early on to extend their 3-1 advantage from the first leg in Paris. \nAt 5-1 down on aggregate, it had all the makings of a long and painful night for Spanish boss Emery and his players as they were punished by this brutally brilliant PSG.\nBut they launched a stunning series of counter-punches that left PSG on the ropes, and Villa just one goal away from forcing extra time.\nVilla Park is a stadium built for the Champions League - although there was a mis-step before kick-off when the Europa League theme was played.\nIt is something they will not want to hear next season.\n'He was on fire' - so was Emery wrong to replace Rashford?\nHeroic Villa comeback falls just short against PSG\nChampions League debrief: Villa are out as fightback falls short\nVilla's John McGinn and PSG's Achraf Hakimi, who both scored, tumble together during a second-half incident\nThe pre-match build-up was more rock concert than football match, with flames and pyrotechnics lighting up Villa Park, fireworks flying over either side of the stadium from the roof of the towering stands.\nThe trademark stern expression of legendary former Villa manager Ron Saunders gazed down from the giant screens before kick-off as one of the most famous quotes in the club's history was revived, echoing around the stadium.\n\"Do you want to bet against us?\" is a message fixed in Villa folklore, Saunders delivering it when they stumbled and were doubted before winning the league title in 1981.\nEveryone inside Villa Park would have had a bet against them as Achraf Hakimi and Nuno Mendes put PSG 2-0 up inside the first half-hour.\n\"Start the car,\" said one despondent Villa fan. It is to be hoped he did not follow his own advice otherwise he would have missed a thriller that left the stadium knee-deep in chewed fingernails by the final whistle.\nInstead of subsiding, Villa rose to rattle PSG in a manner that was well beyond Manchester City and Liverpool in previous Champions League rounds this season.\nYouri Tielemans got one back, then it really was game on when John McGinn and Ezri Konsa struck twice in three minutes early in the second half.\nPSG's inexperience was exposed, but the brilliant keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma saved superbly from Marcus Rashford, Tielemans and Marco Asensio to repel Villa's assault.\nIn a deafening wall of sound and with PSG being given a fearful going over, Emery actually threw himself to the floor in a mixture of despair and disbelief when Konsa just failed to make contact with a header and the goal at his mercy.\nThe great comeback was just beyond Villa, but in the disappointment there was glory.\nEmery was animated throughout the game and at one point in the second half, sank to his knees when Villa missed another chance.\nThe task now is for Villa and Emery to ensure they are back on the Champions League stage next season because nights like this - and triumphs such as those against Bayern Munich earlier in the campaign - will have whetted the appetite and more.\nThose Villa will count on in the future, such as Konsa, Morgan Rogers and Boubacar Kamara, will benefit hugely from being exposed to the quality they faced at this level, while other such as keeper Emiliano Martinez, McGinn and Tielemans will believe this is their natural stage.\nEmery will also store away the knowledge and experience of this season, making it instantly clear he wants more, saying: \"It is now most important to get Europe again. The most important competition is the Champions League. \n\"The challenge we have for the last six matches in the Premier League is to try and get Europe and the Champions League.\"\nHe added: \"To get this level is the next step forward that I want to try to build with Aston Villa.\"\nEmery's standards are sky high, saying: \"We are in a process. This is a higher level we have achieved. We want to test ourselves and how we respond. I am so proud, happy, confident in our standards. Hopefully we can come back quickly.\n\"Our squad showed it can respond at this level. We competed. They deserve to be here. We are ambitious. It is a big challenge and we want the club to push for this level.\"\nWhether Rashford, on loan from Manchester United, will be part of wherever Villa are next season remains to be seen.\nHe struggled desperately through the first half here before mirroring Villa's own effort with a transformed second half performance, in which he set up Konsa's goal and was left in disbelief when a shot he thought was arrowing towards the top corner was turned away by the twisting Donnarumma.\nRashford was given the nod ahead of England striker Ollie Watkins, who has been nursing a knee injury and only came on for the last 14 minutes.\nThe final whistle at first brought groans of despair followed by a standing ovation for Villa's players and Emery as he marched down the touchline.\nVilla left nothing out there at Villa Park in their quest to reach the semi-final.\nAnd Emery, who has made Europe his speciality, will want this to be just the start of Villa's Champions League experiences.\nChampions League quarter-finals - how it stands & route to final\nLatest Aston Villa news, analysis and fan views\nGet Aston Villa news sent straight to your phone",

They want to show they are really confident and I can feel the other way. So I have the conversation but it is my decision in the end.\"\nAmorim was joined at his press conference by defender Harry Maguire, who backed Onana to recover his form.\n\"Andre has proven in the past that he is an excellent goalkeeper,\" said Maguire.\n\"In a career you always have spells when you go up and down - it is about how you build yourself up. You have times when you feel everything is going against you. \n\"He is a big personality and big character and will want to show everyone what he is all about. Playing in front of Andre is great.\"\nUnited's season rests on winning the Europa League in order to qualify for next season's Champions League.\nThe Red Devils will be without Joshua Zirzkee for the remainder of the season after the Dutchman sustained a hamstring injury against Newcastle.\nJoshua is out for the season so he is not going to play more,\" Amorim confirmed.\n\"Let's prepare him for the next one. It is tough, especially in the moment. He has to be ready now to recover.\"\nNetherlands international Matthijs de Ligt was once again missing from training, while defender Ayden Heaven has suffered a \"small setback\" after returning to the squad for the defeat by Newcastle.\nDefender Jonny Evans and goalkeeper Tom Heaton, both long-term absentees, returned to training on Wednesday. \nSimon Stone, Chief football news reporter\nReally, there was only one logical choice for Amorim to make around his goalkeeper.\nEven those close to Bayindir accept he did not do enough at Newcastle, having just recovered from injury and playing behind a much-changed defence and in a team lacking in confidence, to justify keeping his place for such an important game.\nThe problem for Amorim is that he cannot know whether he will get a good performance from Onana, a bad one, or something in between.\nSir Alex Ferguson used to talk about Denis Irwin being a seven-out-of-ten player.

        "article_text": "Michele Kang has been labelled the first tycoon in women's football\nSuccess is synonymous with Olympique Lyonnais Feminin.\nSince being established in 2004, the French club have become one of the superpowers in women's football, lifting 38 trophies across the domestic and European stage.\nTheir record in the Women's Champions League is unparalleled, winning the competition eight times in an 11-year period between 2011 and 2022.\nWhile Lyon remain a formidable force in the women's game, with a record-extending 12th European final appearance on the horizon if they overcome Arsenal over the next fortnight, other teams are catching up in terms of both investment and on-field success. \nIn recent years they have been usurped on the European stage by fellow semi-finalists Barcelona, who are just three matches from a third Champions League title in a row.\nAfter nearly two decades as the passion project of former Lyon owner Jean-Michel Aulas, the club have turned to trailblazing American businesswoman Michele Kang to give them a new lease of life. BBC World Service's World Football podcast has taken a closer look at the club's unique journey.\nOlympique Lyonnais: The Champions League trailblazers\nThe women's football investors 'ripping up blueprint' on club ownership\nIs this the future of the Women's Championship?\nAulas established OL Feminin in 2004\nFor more than 30 years, local businessman Aulas was Lyon.\nAfter becoming owner and president in 1987, following pleas from the city's mayor and F1 legend Alain Prost, he oversaw the men's club's transformation from a debt-ridden club languishing in the second tier to serial trophy-winners throughout the 2000s.\nDetermined to replicate that success in women's football, he launched OL Feminin in 2004 and, under his ownership, the club attracted top overseas players, championed French talent like Wendie Renard, and opened France's first mixed-gender academy.\nIt took three years to deliver silverware, winning the Premiere Ligue in 2006-07. The rest is history.\n\"This guy was ahead of his time,\" former Lyon defender Lucy Bronze told the BBC's World Service. \"To have someone that powerful say I want the women's team to do well, I want them to be the best, I want to give them everything.\n\"He was the first one [to invest in women's football], not just with his money but with physically being there and how much he cared about the team. He enjoyed it just as much as the girls. He celebrated just as hard as we did.\"\nBronze is one of a number of superstars in the women's game to have played for Lyon\nAulas' ownership ended in 2022 when Eagle Football became the majority shareholders of the OL Groupe, which encompassed both the men's and women's teams - as well as a majority stake in NWSL side Seattle Reign, and he resigned from his 36-year presidency the following year.\nIn 2023, the women's team changed hands again, with South Korea-born American businesswoman Kang, who made her fortune in healthcare IT, taking on majority ownership and making it a separate entity - \"independent\" - from the men's team.\n\"We have reached the end of our model a bit,\" chief executive Vincent Ponsot said. \"I think we needed a new lease of life, a new project. That is exactly what Michele brought with a much more global vision.\n\"We now see clubs like Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, Barcelona. There is competition and our ambition is to remain one of the best European clubs. If Michele had not arrived, I think it would have been almost impossible because we need France to move much faster than it does today.\"\nKang also owns Washington Spirit and London City Lionesses\nDescribed by the Financial Times as \"arguably the first tycoon in women's football\", Kang is a relative latecomer to football.\nShe first became interested in the sport after meeting the World Cup-winning US women's team in 2019 and has since built up a portfolio of teams under her Kynisca Sports International group. In addition to Lyon, she has been the majority owner of NWSL team Washington Spirit since 2022 and purchased Women's Championship side London City Lionesses in 2023.\n\"I realised these are the best of the best athletes around the world,\" Kang said, reflecting on her meeting with the USWNT.\n\"I saw a significant lack of resources and attention. I saw the possibility of how women's football could explode with a little nudge and a little investment. \n\"I am not alone and there are a lot of people who share the same passion. Two billion people watch the World Cup - it's growing.\"\nKang's interest isn't limited to multi-club ownership, however, with a number of multi-million pound investments in women's sport, including a \u00a339m global investment in improving the health of elite female athletes.\nHer plans for Lyon are no less grand. Her long-term ambitions include the construction of a dedicated women's centre, with a 15-18,000-seater stadium and a bigger training facility, while she has already invested heavily in improving the club's backroom staff.\n\"The first thing she said to me was 'Vincent, what do you have to do for the OL women's team to have the same supervisions as the professional men's team?'. That was in August 2023,\" Ponsot said.\n\"I told her, 'we have to hire 11 people to the staff', and she said, 'go on then'. Two months later, we had 11 more people and 24 staff to improve the support to players so they can perform.\n\"The main thing we have evolved is in the performance sector. We have full-time nutritionists, physiotherapists, doctors, a performance manager, a psychologist. We have everything we need for the players to be in the best conditions to perform like the men's team.\"\nLyon midfielder and USA captain Lindsey Heaps added: \"[Michele] is incredible. I have never seen anything like this in the women's game, the sort of investment but also the way she speaks.\n\"When she took over she was a bit shocked that it was such a prestigious club and still [have] things that we need. Sometimes you can look at it and think 'they have Champions League trophies, they are winning every single game' [but] it's still not to the standard we need.\"\nLyon have attracted some 15,000-20,000 fans to Groupama Stadium for big Champions League games, but play most of their home matches at the 1,500-seater Gerard Houllier Stadium  \nAnother of Kang's priorities is increasing attendances at Lyon fixtures. \n\"If you ask many female players what is at the top of your wishlist, they don't say I want to get paid more, I want bigger cars. They say, 'I want to play against the best players and best teams in a sellout stadium'. It's my job that we fill the stadium,\" she said.\nLyon will travel to Emirates Stadium on Saturday (12:30 BST) for the first leg of their Champions League semi-final with Arsenal - a stadium where the Gunners recorded an average attendance of 52,029 across six matches last season.\n\"When you see that Arsenal are filling Emirates Stadium, there is no reason why we can't,\" said Ponsot. \"We realised that women's football has an audience with a strong increase in appetite, but we are having trouble making it a reality.\"\nLyon are on course for a record-extending 18th league title this season, having already booked their place in May's end-of-season play-offs. Indeed, they have only lost two league matches over the past four seasons.\nThat sustained success, coupled with Aulas' unmatched support, is seen by some as having had a negative impact on crowds, media interest, and investment in France.\nWomen's football journalist Assile Toufaily said: \"Some will say 'why should we come and watch football that isn't attractive because the level isn't that good?' We know OL are going to smash the other clubs 7-0. Fans aren't intrigued to come and watch.\n\"They say if you want to have a better level of football, investors have to invest. Investors will then say why should we invest if the media isn't promoting the game? So you find yourself in a vicious circle and it's been like this for years.\"\nBut she does not see Aulas' investment as the problem. \n\"If he didn't invest in 2004, maybe no-one would ever have done it in France. Aulas isn't to blame, but maybe the problem is others didn't follow along.\"\nKang, unsurprisingly, is undaunted by this, working with Ponsot to \"find the profile\" of women's football fans, with their own research indicating only a 5% overlap between fans who watch men's and women's matches.\nShe will likely find a powerful ally in Aulas, who was elected vice-president of the French Football Federation in December 2023 and has taken over responsibility for development of women's football. \n\"The French league is going to be very strong in years to come,\" vowed Aulas.\n\"If I acted badly before by being too strong [when I was] with Lyon, you can expect me to act badly [in my role] with France.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

A low number of blazes in 2024 also left more vegetation to fuel them.\nCoed Cadw, the Woodland Trust in Wales, said an \"irreplaceable\" area of temperate Atlantic rainforest had been affected at Allt Boeth near Aberystwyth, with damage to protected bluebells too.\nAlso known as Celtic rainforest, the habitat harbours scarce plants, lichens and fungi, and is considered more threatened than tropical rainforest.\nIn England, the National Trust said several thousand newly planted trees at Marsden Moor, in West Yorkshire, had gone up in flames.\nWhile on the Morne Mountains, in Northern Ireland, invertebrates and ground dwelling animals like reptiles were \"simply being torched alive\".\n\"That then cascades through the food web because without the invertebrates you don't get the birds who are reliant on them for food,\" Mr McCarthy said.\nHe said government funding to help farmers and land managers restore peat bogs in the uplands, to prevent fires while also soaking in planet-warming carbon and providing habitat, was essential.\nConservation charities including The Wildlife Trusts and the Initiative for Nature Conservation Cymru (INCC) also voiced fears for the future of the water vole, which is already under serious threat from habitat loss and predation by American minks.\nSmall animals like water voles and shrews, which live in burrows, can survive fast-moving fires but their habitats and the food they rely on are destroyed.\nWater voles are \"the fastest-declining mammal ever\" according to Rob Parry of the INCC.\n\"Their last foothold [in Wales] is in the uplands so when those sites are burned it is awful for that particular population, but from a UK point of view we are one step closer to the extinction of an entire species,\" he said.\nThe INCC is also monitoring five breeding pairs of barn owls in the Amman Valley in south Wales, where wildfires have destroyed huge areas of habitat. \n\"A few weeks ago they had all of this area to find food for their chicks and suddenly they don't have that any more,\" said Mr Parry.\n\"I don't know how they are going to cope. A wildfire just makes that habitat disappear overnight.\"\nOther rare birds are also affected, including hen harriers, which have been subject to  recent conservation efforts to increase their numbers in the Welsh uplands, and skylarks, which have declined in huge numbers since the 1970s.\n\"We're worried enough as it is about wildlife,\" said Mr Parry.\n\"We're one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world and wildfires every spring at the worst possible time is a burden that wildlife and the environment just can't cope with.\"\nThe INCC has called for closer oversight of controlled burns by farmers and better monitoring of the impact of wildfires on the environment.\nNatural Resources Wales (NRW) said wildfires were a \"massive issue\", particularly in south Wales, where Welsh government figures showed more than half of wildfires in Wales took place last year.\nBecky Davies, a senior officer at NRW, said: \"In the last three days we've had over 75 fires in the south Wales valleys alone.\n\"We have a lot of hillsides that are linear, the valley side has a lot of bracken, a lot of heathland, grassland and coal spoil and that is the sort of hillside that goes up in flames.\"\nThe environmental impact of wildfires can also be felt more widely.\nWhen it rains after a fire, the newly bare soil and the phosphates that were trapped inside it can wash off into streams and rivers, affecting water quality.\nNumbers of wildfires vary year-on-year depending on when spells of dry weather happen.\nBut figures obtained by the BBC show that in south Wales, grassfires have increased by 1,200% from the same time period last year. \nFrom 1 January to 10 April 2024, there were 34 wildfires in the region, whereas there were 445 over the same dates in 2025.\nIn north Wales, crews have attended 170 fires this year, and Mid Wales Fire and Rescue said it had tackled 772 blazes.\nWildfires are also up in England and Northern Ireland compared to last year, while the fire service in Scotland has issued an extreme wildfire alert covering the whole country.\nStatistics show the majority of wildfires are started deliberately, but they can also be ignited from disposable BBQs or controlled burns that get out of hand.\nIn south Wales, firefighters are going to primary schools to teach children from a young age about the devastating impact.\nAt Pontnewydd Primary School in Cwmbran, staff from South Wales Fire and Rescue  Service and Gwent Police brought along animals like snakes, hedgehogs and foxes for children to meet.\nStation manager Mark Bowditch said his crews saw the damage to wildlife from wildfires first-hand.\n\"We see the death of local wildlife, we see the destruction of their habitat,\" he said.\n\"We accept that some fires can be accidental, but deliberate fire setting is a crime and that's the message we'd like to get out.\"\nAdditional reporting by Dylan Greene.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

        "article_text": "Once emptied of wildlife, South Africa's Babanango Game Reserve is now home to the Big Five \u2013 thanks to a bold rewilding project led by Zulu communities and global conservationists.\nDaybreak filters through the fever trees and umbrella thorns of South Africa's White Umfolozi River Valley, splintering orange light across a puckered grassland teeming with newly arrived wildlife. Bumping atop rough roads in an open-sided safari vehicle is field guide Eduan Balt, who's \"reading the bush newspaper\" \u2013 studying fresh prints on dirt trails for signs of apex predators.\u00a0\nBalt drives along some of the valley's 600km of roads \u2013 many built in recent years \u2013 passing bomas (enclosures) holding quarantined buffalo and a pond where hippos with giant jowls yawn into the morning air. The smell of wild anise wafts over the vehicle as it careens toward the valley floor. Then, suddenly, a lioness darts across the golden grassland to our left, muscling her way to a fallen tree where three kitten-like cubs bound into view.\u00a0\nThese are the first lions born in this part of KwaZulu-Natal province in at least 150 years. Lions, like most native animals, became locally extinct in the decades following the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, after which the British Empire gained control of the region, turning it into farmland. Zulu communities got large swathes of it back during the land reforms that followed the fall of apartheid. But after decades of cattle grazing and illicit hunting, the area was largely depleted of wildlife.\nThat changed starting in 2018, thanks to an innovative collaboration between philanthropic investors, local NGOs and three Zulu community trusts, who leased lands to create one of the most ambitious rewilding projects in South Africa in more than a decade. The 20,000-hectare Babanango Game Reserve has welcomed nearly 4,000 medium- to large-sized animals since the process of game translocation \u2013 and remediating landscapes \u2013 began, in earnest, five years ago. Many, like the lions, have reproduced. So, there are now about 5,000 wild animals roaming a landscape they were largely absent from for more than a century.\nGerman philanthropists Barbara and Hellmuth Weisser invested nearly 1 billion rand (\u00a342.5m) to rewild these animals. They also bankrolled the tourist infrastructure that should support Babanango's future operational costs. \"I don't know of anyone else doing something quite like this,\" Hellmuth tells me over dinner at the Zulu Rock Lodge, one of four safari lodges now spread across the park.\u00a0\nThe 77-year-old \u2013 a former energy executive and keen photographer \u2013 has been visiting southern Africa since the 1980s. In retirement, he and his wife wanted to find a place for a park that would uplift communities while restoring biodiversity. \"The problem for us is that there was no supermarket for finding projects,\" he recalls.\nBabanango is south of Kruger National Park in a poorer region of South Africa closer to Durban than Johannesburg that wasn't historically a safari destination. It appeared on Hellmuth's radar only because the NGO Conservation Outcomes had identified a community trust, Emcakwini, looking for a partner to lease its unpopulated lands.\nHellmuth visited Babanango in 2017 and says he fell in love with its wild topography, including the boulder-strewn hills that tumble down 700m from our hilltop perch at Zulu Rock. \"We didn't want to buy somewhere where there was an existing project that had been run into the ground,\" he recalls. \"When we got here, we found a landscape that was extremely interesting.\"\u00a0\nIn 2018, the Weissers signed a contract with the Emcakwini Community Trust. Two smaller neighbouring trusts, Esibongweni and Kwa Ngono, came onboard in 2019 and 2020 respectively. All told, about three-fourths of the game reserve is now leased from these communities, who earn a rental fee and share ownership of the animals. The community trusts will also receive 25% of park profits when the project becomes solvent.\nBabanango transformed into a Big Five game reserve in record time, but the process was not without its challenges. First, there was the 2,600 cows, 300 goats and 35 donkeys that the community trusts promised to remove from the land; something that didn't happen for more than three years. Then, in 2022, finally free of livestock, the park could complete its 81km perimeter fence, though much of what was initially laid was cut by ranchers and poachers. A majority of the wild animals arrived beginning in late 2022.\nPlan your trip:\nWhen to go: There's no bad time to visit. Summers (Sep to Apr) are hot and humid, while winters (May to Aug) are dry and cold.\u00a0\nHow to get there: The park is a three-hour drive from Durban International Airport or a six-hour drive from Johannesburg's OR Tambo International Airport.\nWhere to stay: Babanango has four lodging options ranging from the rustic Matatane Camp to the luxurious Madwaleni River Lodge. Book directly for special packages and rates.\nWhat to do: Beyond the daily safari drives, Babanango also offers guided bush walks, wildlife monitoring and battlefield tours.\n\"It was very important, becoming a nature reserve, that we have species that were endemic to the area,\" explains Chris Galliers, conservation manager at Conservation Outcomes, which consulted on the project. \"A number of species were completely removed from the system; others like kudu, bushbucks and warthogs were still there in low numbers, but we needed to top them up for genetic purposes.\"\nA few leopards roamed the land, too. Yet, rhinos, buffalo and lions were all reintroduced between May 2022 and March 2023. Elephants were the last of the Big Five to arrive in June 2023. \"It was a big milestone,\" says Galliers. \"It symbolised that everything we had to do to get to that point had been done correctly.\"\nAll rewilded animals live in bomas for several months before release to control for diseases such as foot-and-mouth. Most come from similar habitats to ensure they'll adapt and climatise as quickly as possible. There's also intense monitoring to ensure the balance of predator and prey remains intact. Efforts to discourage poaching include dehorning the rhinos (a procedure that conservationists use to increase the species' survival rates), which I spot my third day at Babanango behind fanning candelabra trees.\nGalliers is the first to acknowledge that the park is a massive disrupter for the region. \"People have, for a large part of the past 200 years, been trying to get rid of these animals because of the threats they posed,\" he says. \"Now, the animals are sitting on their doorsteps again. So, it's quite a thing to try and understand.\"\nOn my fourth and final day, I travel beyond the fence line, past browned fields trampled by cattle, to the village of Denny Dalton. Here, I meet with Thina Nyathi, manager of the African Habitat Conservancy Foundation (AHC), a registered public benefit organisation that supports Babanango with its community development work.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Zimbabwe's stunning 80km safari train\n\u2022 The African elephant in the room: Is there such a thing as guilt-free safari?\n\u2022 The vital tradition of naming baby gorillas\nNyathi, who was born in KwaZulu-Natal and is a native Zulu speaker, shows me one of the 17 solar-powered boreholes that AHC built to bring running water to neighbouring communities. She also tells me about AHC's efforts to remove invasive plants, such as black wattles, which suck up the region's groundwater. \"We see the direct impact this has on water scarcity because there are streams that were not flowing that, all of the sudden, are flowing again,\" she explains.\u00a0\nThe foundation works with communities within a 10km radius of Babanango's fence line on everything from conservation education to agricultural support. It also runs vocational training, including classes on ceramics and Zulu beadwork so that the lodges in Babanango can sell crafts that uplift local artisans. \"It's about teaching someone to fish, and not just giving them the fish,\" Nyathi says. \"Working together means we also understand what their challenges are and support them to get to a point where they no longer need our help.\"\nAbout 75% of the staff at Babanango comes from the surrounding communities, and for many, it's their first salaried employment. Dudu Ngcobo, who works as part of the park's ecological restoration team, sent her two daughters to university, which for Nyathi demonstrates the ripple effects of higher-paying job opportunities.\nThe park hires locally for short-term projects, such as land rehabilitation, which helps build a greater understanding of the reserve's potential paybacks and long-term impact.

I want to stay in football but if I can't find anything - there are not that many professional teams in England in the women's game - then I need to look at maybe going back into estate agency work or something like that,\" added Beard.\n\"It would probably be a last resort for me. But at the end of the day I have a family I need to support. I need to look at all options.\"\nBeard believes losing his job is \"part and parcel\" of being a football manager and he was supported by the League Managers' Association (LMA) when he left Liverpool.\nBut his family moved up to north-west England from London, where the children started new schools, and he is conscious of disrupting things as he contemplates his next steps. \n\"I want to stay in the game and continue managing. I have my pro licence and degree in business management,\" said Beard. \n\"I think people see me as a fixer who can build something but I know I'm much more than that when I look back at my time as a football manager.\n\"Roles like a technical director or sporting director are something I would maybe consider. I might also look at high performance workshops or even podcasts.\"\nBeard left Liverpool on strong terms having guided the club to back-to-back WSL titles in 2013 and 2014 during his first spell, before winning the Women's Championship in 2022 on his return.\nHe says getting sacked with a year and a half left on his contract was \"difficult\" but he only has respect for the club and the support they gave him.\n\"It was going to happen at some point in my career,\" said Beard.\n\"You have to take emotions out of the conversation. I have no qualms with the decision but I still think we would have finished in the top five this season. \n\"It's frustrating losing your job. Was I owed time? I don't know. I have nothing but pride when I look at the journey. \n\"I have a great relationship with the club and the people. I respected the decision and it's just one of those things. I'm ready to go again now.\"\nTime away has allowed Beard to reflect on the state of the game and what it was like competing financially with WSL leaders Chelsea.\nHe says other clubs must find ways to invest and grow simultaneously - but not at the expense of losing their connection with the fanbase. \n\"I think you've seen the game grow so much in such a short space of time. I'm always concerned that we run before we walk,\" added Beard.\n\"I have always been an advocate for the bond we have with the fans. That's what makes our game unique and I don't want to see that go.\n\"I also look at Chelsea and the money they have spent\u2026 who can compete with that? They spent more on two players than we did on our entire squad. It's crazy.\n\"It's everyone else's problem. Arsenal have got it right, I think.

        "article_text": "New research is showing just how much plants and crops rely on a host of darkness-dwelling creepy crawlies.\nThink pollination, and you will likely picture a butterfly or bee flitting between flowers. But while these are indeed important pollinators, both the natural world and our food supplies rely on a host of other creatures, some of them decidedly less appealing.\nMost of the world's 350,000 species of flowering plants rely on animal pollinators for reproduction. Pollinators and their importance for ecosystems are increasingly in the spotlight in recent years due to the dramatic decline in their numbers. Birds, bats, bees, bumblebees and butterflies have all been affected, with some populations shrinking by 80% or more. The causes include habitat loss, pesticides and climate change.\nAnd recent research has also shown that pollinator diversity is just as vital for ecosystems and cultivated plants as the sheer numbers of pollinators, and found that this diversity is on the decline for similar reasons.\u00a0\nScientists estimate that 3-5% of fruit, vegetable and nut production is lost globally as a result of inadequate pollination, affecting the availability of healthy food and threatening human health.\nFrom cockroaches and beetles to the tiny \"bees of the seas\", here are some of the most unexpected, and occasionally disconcerting, pollinators the world continues to rely on \u2013 even if we don't always see them.\nCockroaches are, in the words of one study, \"among Earth's most despised creatures\". But recent research suggests they play a beneficial and long overlooked role as plant pollinators \u2013 especially in the darker areas of forest often avoided by the world's more beloved bees and butterflies.\u00a0\n\"Traditionally, pollination has been associated with bees, flies, moths and butterflies,\" says Kenji Suetsugu, a professor of biology at Kobe University in Japan. \"However, emerging studies reveal that unexpected visitors such as cockroaches can play significant roles under certain conditions.\"\u00a0\nThese \"alternative pollinators\", he adds, are often particularly important in environments where conventional pollinators are scarce, such as \"in dense, shaded understories where light is limited and typical pollinators are infrequent\".\nIn fact, a growing body of research suggests that cockroaches act as pollinators in a rich and varied range of ecosystems \u2013 a role that previously went mostly unnoticed by researchers, since the creatures are nocturnal and less obvious in their interactions with plants than bees. In recent years, cockroach pollination has been reported for plant species such as Clusia blattophila, which grows on rocky outcrops in French Guiana, and the rare and endangered Vincetoxicum hainanense in China, amongst others.\nSuetsugu has studied the role of cockroaches in pollination in dense, evergreen forests on Yakushima Island, a lush, subtropical island off Japan. He was specifically interested in cockroach-assisted pollination of Balanophora tobiracola, a mushroom-shaped parasitic plant.\nSince cockroaches are elusive and nocturnal, he used several tricks to better understand their interactions with this plant. For example, he set up a waterproof digital camera in front of one flowering plant which took photos of it in 50-second intervals from dusk till dawn for around three weeks. The resulting photographs \u2013 more than 34,000 shots \u2013 showed cockroaches visiting the flower at night. Suetsugu also captured cockroaches after they'd visited the plant to identify and count the pollen grains on their bodies.\u00a0\nTo investigate how a single cockroach visit affected the plant's chance of setting fruit, he enclosed five of the plant's flowers with a fine mesh and opened it only for one visit by the Margattea satsumana cockroach (the most frequent cockroach visitor for this plant), then closed it again. He compared this with other treatments of the plant, such as covering the flowers with mesh for the entire flowering period, to exclude all pollinators.\nThe study, published in 2025, provides \"the first direct evidence of effective cockroach pollination\" in this type of plant, says Suetsugu. \"In the case of a single visit [by a cockroach], nearly 40% of flowers developed pollen tubes, a strong indicator of successful pollination.\"\u00a0\nAs soon as the first ever flowers unfurled from their buds in the\u00a0early Cretaceous period, they were visited by pollinators. But those first soft landings on their petals weren't by bees or butterflies \u2013 instead, it's thought that the pioneers of pollination may have had six scuttling legs and tough, shiny shells.\u00a0They were beetles.\u00a0\nBeetles remain important pollinators to this day, often visiting flowers with the most seemingly unpromising allure \u2013 little nectar, greenish flowers, and an overpowering, possibly putrid smell, a set of traits known as \"beetle pollination syndrome\".\nDespite millions of years of evolution, beetles remain among the most frequent pollinators of primitive flowers which emerged among the dinosaurs,\u00a0such as magnolias. And unlike the more well-known modern pollinators, many beetles\u00a0like to operate at night, flying or crawling towards the warmth and delectable scent emitted by certain beetle-specialised flowers, such as lowiaceae orchids in Borneo which smell strongly of faeces \u2013 a\u00a0favourite of dung beetles.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs they hover above wild tobacco flowers, hawkmoths unfurl their 8cm (3in)-long proboscis to drink up its nectar \u2013 among their favourite meals. As they do this, grains of pollen are also pulled \u2013 as if by magic \u2013 across air gaps of several millimetres or even centimetres.\nDo slugs and snails pollinate?\n(Credit: Kenji Suetsugu)\nSuetsugu's research on overlooked pollinators in Japan may also help solve a 100-year-old mystery in the field of pollination studies: do slugs and snails pollinate?\nThe idea that slugs and snails can pollinate plants is frequently mentioned in textbooks, but \"robust evidence is surprisingly scarce\", says Suetsugu. This type of pollination, known as malacophily, sounds plausible: as slugs and snails glide over flowers, they pick up pollen and transfer it. However, given that snails and slugs eat flowers, it is unclear whether such visits ultimately help reproduction \u2013 or whether they gobble up the flowers before there is any chance of fruiting.\nA 2019 study by Suetsugu found that a type of slug, Ambigolimax valentianus, transferred pollen via fine threads of viscous mucus after visiting flowers of the Rohdea japonica plant \u2013but that this did not lead to fruiting.\nThis happens because, incredibly, moths collect so much\u00a0static electricity whilst in flight\u00a0that pollen is pulled through the air towards them. The fact that they don't need to touch flowers in order to pollinate them makes them very good pollinators.\u00a0\nThe majority of pollination research has tended to\u00a0focus on day-flying insects, but researchers are now probing what is happening at night.\nIn 2023, researchers from the University of Sussex, UK, discovered moths may even be more efficient pollinators than bees. The team studied both daytime and nocturnal pollinator visits to bramble plants, a widespread species across Europe which is important to pollinators for its pollen and nectar. While the study found that 83% of all visits were made in the day, and just 17% made under cover of darkness (almost exclusively by moths), it also found the moths were able to pollinate the flowers more quickly than their daytime counterparts.\nThe authors say nocturnal pollination is understudied. As moths have been shown to transport pollen from wide variety of plant species, further research is needed to fully appreciate the role they and other nocturnal insects play in pollinating, they say.\u00a0\nAnother recent study from the University of Sheffield, UK, found moths account for a third of all urban pollination. However, a lack of native plant species and diversity of plant life in cities, coupled with scent-stifling air pollution, is still leaving moths struggling to find their next meal. Now, experts are warning of an \"alarming\" global decline in moth abundance and diversity. \u00a0\nThere are ways we can help, though, such as planting white flowers, leaving patches of scrub, rough grass and brambles to grow and turning off lights at night. Night-time pollinators such as moths, it turns out, need protecting just as much as bees.\nBats are another oft-overlooked furry night-time pollinator. While most bats eat mainly insects, at least 500 plant species in the tropics and subtropics are pollinated largely by nectar-feeding bats. Scientists say that bat pollination (chiropterophily) could have advantages: their large size means they can transfer a lot of pollen at once, and they fly long distances compared with many other pollinators. However, the large size of bats can also make pollination by them energetically expensive for plants.\nOne example is the endangered greater long-eared bat, native to the south-western US and Mexico. It feeds mainly on the pollen and nectar of agave (used to make mezcal and tequila) and various cacti, hovering above the plants just like a hummingbird to feed. Along with the lesser long-nosed bat, it is the main pollinator of agave.\nLike agave, the pale flowers these bats feed on are often long and bell-shaped, and many bats have evolved ways to reach the nectar at the bottom of them. An extreme example is the tube-lipped nectar bat, found in the cloud forests of Ecuador. The size of a mouse, it has a tongue more than one and a half times its body length \u2013 the longest tongue-to-body ratio of any mammal and is the sole pollinator of a plant with corolla tubes of matching length. While not in use, it stows this huge tongue down in its rib cage.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A wild 'freakosystem' has been born on Hawaii\n\u2022 Elephants hate bees \u2013 here's why that's good news for Kenyan farmers\n\u2022 How bug poo can help reverse the soil crisis\nIn fragmented tropical habitats, nectar bats play an important role in keeping certain plants populations healthy, but also in pollinating crops for farmers. However, researchers have warned that bats' status as a long-overlooked pollinator means there is a lack of knowledge of how dependent crops are on bats for harvest yield and quality.\nA 2020 study found, for example, that bats were the main pollinators of pitayas (dragon fruit), a major crop in central Mexico \u2013 and that when bats were excluded from pollinating this crop, yields decreased by 35%. Experts have also warned that decreased populations of bats could lead to a fall in agave abundance.\nBats also play an crucial ecological role worldwide for wild plants and crops as both seed dispersers and insect eaters. Pest control by bats has been found to support many crops around the world \u2013 from coffee in Costa Rica and cacao in Indonesia to rice in Thailand and cotton in the US \u2013 sometimes to the tune of billions of dollars in avoided losses.\nLike many other pollinators, bats are being impacted by environmental change around the world, with researchers warning that these changes are putting the pollination services bat species provide at risk.\nDespite their tiny, inconspicuous flowers, seagrasses are capable of reproducing with no help from animals. Turtle grass, for example, a seagrass which grows in shallow seas across the Caribbean, has miniscule, pollen-producing male flowers and female flowers which don't produce pollen. In coordinated cycles, the female flowers open, followed by male flowers, which release pollen into the tides after sunset.\nA decade ago, it was widely believed this was the only way that seagrasses pollinated, with pollinating animals only visiting flowers that bloom in the open air. But in an experiment at an aquarium in Mexico in 2016, ecologist Brigitta van Tussenbroek from the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico and her colleagues showed marine crustaceans were in fact playing a role.\u00a0\n\"At the onset of the night, many small organisms that were hiding during the day from predators started swimming around,\" she says. The majority were barely visible crustacean larvae, which approached the male flowers to feed on the energy-rich pollen embedded in \"a slimy and sticky substance\".\n\"Some of this substance and pollen attached to their body parts when they swim around, while also being tossed to-and-fro by the water movement,\" says van Tussenbroek. On the receiving end, the female flowers have \"tentacle-like stigmas which capture the small pollen-carrying organisms\", thus depositing the pollen grains.\u00a0\u00a0\nMostly, these invertebrates are at the whims of ocean currents, but when waters are calm, they are able to swim purposefully, she adds, earning these bugs the nickname \"the bees of the seas\".\n\"This was a complete surprise,\" says van Tussenbroek, and upended the belief that small free-moving fauna played no role at all in pollinating seagrass.\nBut perhaps even more surprising was the discovery in 2022 that tiny Baltic isopods help transport the pollen-like \"spermatia\" produced by red algae. Does it count as pollination if there is no pollen? The researchers call it \"animal-mediated fertilisation\" and ask what this means for our understanding of pollination, which is believed to have developed around 130 million years ago when flowering plants first appeared on land.\u00a0\nThe discovery opens the possibility that these kinds of symbiotic interactions might have developed completely separately on land and in water \u2013 and that animal-mediated fertilisation may have emerged in the sea well before plants moved ashore.\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nMcIlroy wins Masters play-off to complete career Grand Slam\nRory McIlroy's sports psychologist Bob Rotella says it was \"part of the game plan\" to not engage with playing partner Bryson DeChambeau during the final round of the Masters.\nMcIlroy, 35, achieved golf's career Grand Slam on Sunday with his first victory at Augusta.\nAmerican DeChambeau, who narrowly beat McIlroy to win last year's US Open, started the day two shots behind his partner.\nHe briefly led on Sunday after a birdie on the second coupled with McIlroy's double bogey on the first but eventually finished tied for fifth.\nDeChambeau, who plays on the PGA Tour's rival LIV Golf, was asked how McIlroy was feeling after he signed his scorecard and replied: \"No idea. Didn't talk to me once all day.\"\nPressed further on whether he had tried to initiate conversation during the round, he added: \"He wouldn't talk to me.\"\nSpeaking to Radio 4's Today, Rotella said: \"That didn't have anything to do with Bryson. That was just the game plan all week and we wanted to get lost in it.\n\"We didn't want to pay attention to what anyone else was scoring, or shooting, or swinging or how far they were hitting it \u2013 we just wanted Rory to play his game.\n\"The point is, if you believe you're going to win, just play your game and assume that if you do that anywhere near the way you're capable of, then you will end up number one.\"\nAustralian golfer Min Woo Lee, ranked 25th in the world, also played down the significance of playing partners not talking to one another during a round.\n\"When you play in two-ball pairings, you move so quick you can't talk, and plus they are in the last group. Tension. Not a big deal,\" he posted on social media.\n'McIlroy in the conversation to be Europe's greatest golfer'\n'Welcome to the club' - Woods leads tributes to McIlroy\nMcIlroy could win 'five or six more majors'\nNorthern Ireland's McIlroy beat England's Justin Rose in a sudden-death play-off, after a dramatic final round that saw him blow a four-shot lead at one stage and miss a par putt on the 18th to win in regulation.\n\"If you watched Rory, he was very locked into his own world. It's just you and the golf course and your caddie,\" said Rotella. \n\"You get lost in this world that you've made up, and play the game you love. I think he did a beautiful job of that all day. He did so many things to bounce back time after time.\"\nPart of their strategy involved McIlroy's yardage book, which he could be seen looking at many times throughout his round.\nThe book usually includes maps or diagrams of each hole on the course, but Rotella said it also included notes of their chats.\n\"We would have a chat every day before the round, and he would make some notes, and every couple of holes, he would take a look around to remind yourself. That's what he was looking at,\" he added.\nExplaining the psychology further, Rotella said that after a disappointment a player should aim to make the \"next shot your best shot\".\n\"We begin with the idea that golf, by design, is a game of mistakes, and if you love golf, you have to love the mistakes,\" he said.\n\"You have to remind them that other players are playing the same game, and they will also all make mistakes. \n\"The second part is understanding that you are a human being, you're going to make mistakes. Human beings have a free will, and that means we get to choose how we think and respond to all the crazy things that happen to us on the golf course and in life.\"\nThis video can not be played\nMcIlroy's emotional message to daughter Poppy\nAfter his triumph, McIlroy said that finally completing the career Grand Slam will \"free him up\" for more success and Rotella echoed those sentiments.\nHaving won the US Open, The Open and two US PGA Championships by the end of 2014, McIlroy has completed the full set of major championships at the 11th attempt.\nRotella said that winning the Masters would take a \"burden off his back\", adding: \"My guess is that he will go on and win quite a few more, I think he's thinking of having a multiple win season.\" \nThe next major is the US PGA at Quail Hollow in May and is followed by June's US Open, before The Open at Royal Portrush in his native Northern Ireland in July.  \nAs well as the Masters, McIlroy has won the Players Championship and Pebble Beach Pro-Am title since February.\nRotella said \"it's going to be a lot of fun to see how many more he can win\". \n\"His year is off to great start, now he's got a chance to have the greatest year he's ever had.

        "article_text": "Your reaction times can reveal a surprising amount about what's going on inside your body, from your brain health to your risk of an early death.\nOf the course of our lifetimes, our reaction times will slowly wane. It's one of the reasons why athletic performance tends to drop off from our 30s onwards.\nScientists are finding that being able to maintain an average reaction speed can be a key indicator that our brain is still in good working order, even into our latter decades. But that isn't all they can reveal. From your heart health to your overall risk of an early death, your reaction times can provide a window into the inner workings of the body.\u00a0\n\"Some people just tend to be faster than others, even before ageing effects really kick in,\" says Simon Cox, professor of brain and cognitive ageing at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. \"But a decline in reaction times probably indicates an accumulation of age-related degradation. It's a marker which tells us a lot about the combined functioning of quite a lot of biological systems.\"\nBut how can you assess your reaction time in the comfort of your home?\nOne easy assessment is a well-known experiment known as the \"ruler drop test\". You'll need the assistance of a family member or friend for this one, as well as a ruler:\n\u2022 Sit in a chair, resting your arm on a table so that your wrist is hanging off the edge, with your thumb and forefingers facing up.\n\u2022 Ask your partner to hold a ruler vertically, over your hand, with the \"zero\", where the numbers start, aligned with your thumb.\n\u2022 Without warning, your partner should drop the ruler, while you try to catch it as quickly as possible.\n\u2022 The distance the ruler falls before being caught is an assessment of your reaction time.\nBroadly speaking, an excellent performance equates to catching the ruler at a distance less than 7.5cm, above average counts as 7.5-15.9cm, average is 15.9-20.4cm, while below average is anything over 20.4cm and poor is more than 28cm.\nPopulation studies have noticed a correlation between the speed of decline in reaction times and risk of multiple age-related illnesses. In addition to a person's overall risk of death \u2013 one study found that there was a significant link between a person's reaction times and the likelihood of death from all major causes \u2013 there is also a strong relationship between this metric and the risk of death from specific conditions. This includes coronary heart disease, stroke and respiratory disease.\nA person's reaction times are also associated with their susceptibility to falls, losing the ability to live independently and the onset of dementia.\nHowever, according to Cox, a single reaction time measurement doesn't reveal all that much, as reaction speeds vary considerably from one person to another due to factors ranging from gender to genetics, physical fitness, lifestyle habits and even personality type. Cox notes that what is likely to be more important is how your reaction speed varies if you compare your performance on the same test over time \u2013 for example, at yearly intervals over the course of a decade - and whether it starts to noticeably decline.\nAs Cox points out, our ability to react relies on a network of interconnected sensory systems: how well we see, hear or even smell a given stimulus, how quickly our brain can process the information it's receiving from our eyes or ears and issue a signal in response, and finally how quickly our nerve fibres, muscles and tendons can enact what the brain is telling them to do. \"All these pieces of the jigsaw can be affected by ageing, and not necessarily to the same extent in all people,\" says Cox.\nThere are two components to a reaction to the ruler drop test \u2013 the brain's ability to make a quick assessment that it has been dropped, and the speed with which the body can act on the brain's instructions to catch it.\u00a0\nResearchers have found that the first component of this network which tends to break down, beginning in midlife, is our physical ability to act on the brain's signals. So, our brains might notice that the ruler has been let go within milliseconds \u2013 but it still takes a while for the body to catch up.\u00a0\nAt the University of Colorado Boulder, biomedical professor Alaa Ahmed\u00a0has found\u00a0that as we get older, our reaction times may depend more heavily on our overall bodily health than our brain. She says this may be because things like fast-twitch muscle fibres which enable our physical ability to respond quickly,\u00a0have waned, or because our mitochondria \u2013 the components within our cells which generate energy \u2013\u00a0are working less well, meaning that we're less efficient at moving swiftly.\n\"Making a faster movement is more costly to older adults, so they rely primarily on reacting faster,\" says Ahmed.\nAt the same time, if we stay relatively well, our brain and central nervous system can still function strongly into our latter years. According to Matthew Pain, a professor of biomechanics at Loughborough University in the UK, scientists have assessed this\u00a0by measuring\u00a0the \"startle reflex\" in the ankles of healthy elderly adults in response to a loud sound. The results showed their brain's ability to respond to the sound and send a \"move\" signal to the ankle tends to remain relatively intact.\n\"The raw nervous system hardware in healthy elderly [people] is not that [much] worse,\" says Pain. \"Purely based on the startle reflex, they could still react quickly enough to be disqualified at the Olympics for a false start. They wouldn't, however, be able to get out of the blocks very quickly.\"\u00a0\nAs well as the ruler test, reaction times can be assessed through simple computer games such as the\u00a0Human Benchmark Reaction Time Test which involves waiting for a red box to turn green and then clicking on it as quickly as possible. Sharp deteriorations in performance over time can reflect a combination of sensory systems breaking down, as well as a slowing of the brain's decision-making.\u00a0One study last year\u00a0found that loss of visual sensitivity in seeing and responding to patterns can be one of the earliest signs of dementia, beginning more than a decade before symptoms begin.\n\"With age, the nerve fibres in the brain's white matter can start to communicate signals less efficiently, resulting in slower information processing,\" says Cox. \"Once the decision has been made to react, the nerves that connect your brain to your muscles also need to be in good condition to transmit that message quickly, and these age too.\"\nBut there are things that we can all do to either slow or prevent this decline from happening. Pain recommends so-called dual task training, which involves simultaneous movement and cognitive training activities to tune both the brain and body. Examples include walking while turning your head from side to side, balancing on one leg while reciting the alphabet, or tossing a ball while verbally associating words.\nEven things like such as participating in fitness classes via a TV screen or tablet can help with your reaction times. \"This improves the ability to perceive [a stimulus] and respond with meaningful coordinated motions,\" says Pain.\nCox says that many of the activities which are often linked with healthy ageing, such as continuing to play a sport into later life, learning a musical instrument in retirement or simply keeping engaged with intellectual pursuits such as board games can have knock-on benefits for our reaction times.\n\"Sports performance drills which require fast responses could boost reaction times by enhancing both brain and body,\" says Cox. \"And there's some evidence that generally keeping more socio-intellectually engaged is related to slower cognitive ageing across aspects of complex thinking.\"\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Corner chicken & Rory Delap 2.0 - what's the future of football?\nIf the past decade of English football has one unifying theme it is tactical renewal.\nSince the mid-2010s - and since Antonio Conte, Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp - the Premier League has attracted Europe's best coaches, putting a once sleepy and unsophisticated division at the vanguard of tactical innovation.\nBut we are in a moment of flux. New ideas still flood into the league but nothing, yet, has emerged as the next great theory. As Guardiola treads water at Manchester City we are waiting to find out where the sport goes next.\nHere are some ideas - some quirkier than others - for the future of football.\nPremier League intensity or caution - how will Tuchel's England play?\nWhy Guardiola's tactics stopped working amid rise of rapid football\nEmbracing the chaos - breaking down Bournemouth's rise\nLet's start with one of the weirder ones\u2026 but also one that feeds most directly into where the game seems to be heading.\nA couple of years ago the way Roberto de Zerbi stretched the pitch from goal-kicks was all the rage.\nHe kept five players next to his goalkeeper and stuck five players on the halfway line, emptying central midfield and splitting a confused opposition in two. Brighton would then kick it long, bypassing half the team.\nThis kind of thing might come back again, and certainly long balls are boomeranging back into fashion as the natural antidote to high pressing, short goal-kicks and high defensive lines. A decade of sucking everyone into tight spaces was bound to trigger a counter-reaction of stretching things back out.\nSo, here's a thought for all those high-risk De Zerbi types.\nWhen defending a corner, instead of packing the box with bodies, why not begin a game of chicken and leave four or five on the halfway line?\nThis would create exciting five-on-two long-ball counter-attacking scenarios, or, more likely, force the attacking team to leave five or six players back.\nJust like that you've decluttered the penalty area and, at the elite level, clearing a path for the goalkeeper and creating simpler one-on-one marking could reduce the chances of conceding.\nCorners are in vogue at the moment and the set-piece coach is the new must-have accessory. But maybe we're looking too closely at 'love trains' and marking systems in a messy penalty box.\nIt's within a team's power to free up space and lean into ultra-stretched football. Just don't be chicken.\nThere isn't enough deception in football tactics.\nThere are the 'dark arts' of defending, the dummy and the no-look pass. But where are the Trojan horses, the tactical decoys?\nPlayers are getting more versatile all the time and (most) managers are too, regularly changing formation between matches and within them. In fact, a lot of managers these days would reject the idea of the formation.\nBut there are still basic differences between, say, the 4-3-3 and the 3-4-2-1, and although a lot of coaches are comfortable switching it up based on the game state - moving to a back three to see out the final few minutes of a 1-0 lead, for example - nobody changes formation early in a game.\nAnd nobody is doing it to fool the other manager.\nImagine two teams lining up in similar 4-3-3s, with touchline-hugging wingers and two number eights in front of a defensive midfielder. For the first 10 minutes they feel each other out, getting used to their opponents' patterns.\nThen all of a sudden one team swaps to a 3-4-2-1. The wingers disappear, the three-player triangle in midfield becomes a box-shape four, and the other side has to scramble to keep up.\nFive minutes later, they change back again. Or switch to a third system entirely. It would be chaotic, but the team who planned the switches in training would have a huge advantage in those frantic few minutes of adaptation.\nAnd it could have a huge impact on the game because, at the risk of getting highfalutin, it would require a new way of thinking about time.\nCurrently football people only think about time in quite a limited way: how long we have to hold on to the lead, when the first substitution should be made, when to throw the kitchen sink.\nTime is an attritional dance with the other team, something we react to, the variable that slips through our fingers.\nDecoy formations would require breaking up the game into chunks of time and planning each segment. Once we start thinking this way, the 90 minutes could feel longer and richer - something to seize and control.\nWe watched every Premier League manager - here's what we found out\nWhere do Premier League managers stand during a game?\nThere are about 30 throw-ins per match yet nobody has thought to seek innovation around the most common set-piece in the game - and one with an (inexplicable) detail ready to exploit: no offsides.\nExcept, of course, one man did innovate some 17 years ago. It's just that nobody has thought to copy him.\nA Rory Delap throw arrowing through the sky is one of the Premier League's most iconic images.\nHis throw-ins led to 25 Stoke City goals in his first four seasons at the club, terrifying defences to the extent that on one infamous occasion Hull City goalkeeper Boaz Myhill chose not to clear for touch but boot the ball straight out for a corner.\nAnd yet the technique of Delap's throw-in retired with him.\nThis video can not be played\n'So tough to defend' - Fuller scores from Delap long throw-in\nPresumably there is nothing unique about Delap's musculature that prevents it from being taught to others, so why has it never been repeated? Why hasn't Mikel Arteta - who says he takes comparisons with Tony Pulis' Stoke as \"a compliment\" - brought Delap on to his coaching staff?\nThe most likely explanation is the \"Rick Barry\" phenomenon. Barry retired from the NBA in 1980 as the all-time leader in free-throw shooting percentage, having exclusively used under-arm \"granny throws\", yet nobody has copied his technique. It is seen as childish, uncool, un... basketball.\nShaquille O'Neal, when advised by Barry to \"granny throw\" in response to his poor 52% record, summed up the problem: \"I'd shoot 0% before I'd shoot underhanded.\"\nMaybe a similar phenomenon means Delap's throws are seen as too ugly and too direct - too far outside the elegant philosophies of the elite managers - to be repeated.\nIf so, they ought to loosen up. If someone breaks down that barrier it could lead to a flurry of copycats, permanently turning the throw-in into a corner-like chance and permanently changing how football is played.\nIt would be an exaggeration to say centre-backs have gone unchanged over the past couple of decades.\nChris Wilder's overlapping centre-backs at Sheffield United have led to a pared-back version become commonplace for managers who deploy a back three. England manager Thomas Tuchel, for example, may instruct his outside centre-backs to linger towards the corner of the penalty box.\nBut by and large the position is untouched. And after years of full-backs being redeployed, culminating in Ange Postecoglou using his full-backs as number eights, maybe it's time we give the centre-back new responsibilities.\nThere's nothing new about the marauding centre-back, you might say. Franco Baresi used to break lines some 40 years ago, while in England Rio Ferdinand became renowned for this feature of his game in the 2000s.\nBut we could take this one further.\nCentre-backs, unmarked and untracked, could start to make off-the-ball runs through the lines, slipping unnoticed right up into the forward line and beyond like Destiny Udogie at Tottenham Hotspur.\nIf a full-back shuttled across to cover then there's no reason why powerful centre-backs - better on the ball than ever - can't be freed to become the spare player; the disruptive force that sneaks through the system.\nHarry Kane donned the goalkeeper gloves for Spurs in 2014 - he has the passing range for this role, but you'd want him in the other box...\nOK, wait. Hear us out.\nLiverpool are 1-0 down against League One opposition in the EFL Cup. There are five minutes left on the clock and all 11 opponents are camped in their third.\nGoalkeeper Alisson is now in a quarterback role, sat on the halfway line spraying passes left and right.\nSo, Arne Slot withdraws Alisson to bring on an extra forward and, with an ironic flourish, gives he-needs-to-get-serious-about-his-defending's Trent Alexander-Arnold the goalie gloves.\nTrent stayed behind in training the previous week for a few extra sessions to learn the basics of goalkeeping, even though he's unlikely to do any during his five minutes on the pitch.\nAnd if he is called upon then a) Alexander-Arnold in goal might encourage a wild shot from distance that's easier to gather, or b) would face a four-on-two break that goalkeepers rarely keep out anyway.\nIt sounds mad at first, but the more you think about it... why not? Liverpool lose little while gaining a better quarterback distributor and an extra forward.\nReal tactical innovation requires maverick thinking. Yes, the role of a keeper has already evolved over the past decade, but let's see what Alexander-Arnold can do in goal.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Corner chicken & Rory Delap 2.0 - what's the future of football?\nIf the past decade of English football has one unifying theme it is tactical renewal.\nSince the mid-2010s - and since Antonio Conte, Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp - the Premier League has attracted Europe's best coaches, putting a once sleepy and unsophisticated division at the vanguard of tactical innovation.\nBut we are in a moment of flux. New ideas still flood into the league but nothing, yet, has emerged as the next great theory. As Guardiola treads water at Manchester City we are waiting to find out where the sport goes next.\nHere are some ideas - some quirkier than others - for the future of football.\nPremier League intensity or caution - how will Tuchel's England play?\nWhy Guardiola's tactics stopped working amid rise of rapid football\nEmbracing the chaos - breaking down Bournemouth's rise\nLet's start with one of the weirder ones\u2026 but also one that feeds most directly into where the game seems to be heading.\nA couple of years ago the way Roberto de Zerbi stretched the pitch from goal-kicks was all the rage.\nHe kept five players next to his goalkeeper and stuck five players on the halfway line, emptying central midfield and splitting a confused opposition in two. Brighton would then kick it long, bypassing half the team.\nThis kind of thing might come back again, and certainly long balls are boomeranging back into fashion as the natural antidote to high pressing, short goal-kicks and high defensive lines. A decade of sucking everyone into tight spaces was bound to trigger a counter-reaction of stretching things back out.\nSo, here's a thought for all those high-risk De Zerbi types.\nWhen defending a corner, instead of packing the box with bodies, why not begin a game of chicken and leave four or five on the halfway line?\nThis would create exciting five-on-two long-ball counter-attacking scenarios, or, more likely, force the attacking team to leave five or six players back.\nJust like that you've decluttered the penalty area and, at the elite level, clearing a path for the goalkeeper and creating simpler one-on-one marking could reduce the chances of conceding.\nCorners are in vogue at the moment and the set-piece coach is the new must-have accessory. But maybe we're looking too closely at 'love trains' and marking systems in a messy penalty box.\nIt's within a team's power to free up space and lean into ultra-stretched football. Just don't be chicken.\nThere isn't enough deception in football tactics.\nThere are the 'dark arts' of defending, the dummy and the no-look pass. But where are the Trojan horses, the tactical decoys?\nPlayers are getting more versatile all the time and (most) managers are too, regularly changing formation between matches and within them. In fact, a lot of managers these days would reject the idea of the formation.\nBut there are still basic differences between, say, the 4-3-3 and the 3-4-2-1, and although a lot of coaches are comfortable switching it up based on the game state - moving to a back three to see out the final few minutes of a 1-0 lead, for example - nobody changes formation early in a game.\nAnd nobody is doing it to fool the other manager.\nImagine two teams lining up in similar 4-3-3s, with touchline-hugging wingers and two number eights in front of a defensive midfielder. For the first 10 minutes they feel each other out, getting used to their opponents' patterns.\nThen all of a sudden one team swaps to a 3-4-2-1. The wingers disappear, the three-player triangle in midfield becomes a box-shape four, and the other side has to scramble to keep up.\nFive minutes later, they change back again. Or switch to a third system entirely. It would be chaotic, but the team who planned the switches in training would have a huge advantage in those frantic few minutes of adaptation.\nAnd it could have a huge impact on the game because, at the risk of getting highfalutin, it would require a new way of thinking about time.\nCurrently football people only think about time in quite a limited way: how long we have to hold on to the lead, when the first substitution should be made, when to throw the kitchen sink.\nTime is an attritional dance with the other team, something we react to, the variable that slips through our fingers.\nDecoy formations would require breaking up the game into chunks of time and planning each segment. Once we start thinking this way, the 90 minutes could feel longer and richer - something to seize and control.\nWe watched every Premier League manager - here's what we found out\nWhere do Premier League managers stand during a game?\nThere are about 30 throw-ins per match yet nobody has thought to seek innovation around the most common set-piece in the game - and one with an (inexplicable) detail ready to exploit: no offsides.\nExcept, of course, one man did innovate some 17 years ago. It's just that nobody has thought to copy him.\nA Rory Delap throw arrowing through the sky is one of the Premier League's most iconic images.\nHis throw-ins led to 25 Stoke City goals in his first four seasons at the club, terrifying defences to the extent that on one infamous occasion Hull City goalkeeper Boaz Myhill chose not to clear for touch but boot the ball straight out for a corner.\nAnd yet the technique of Delap's throw-in retired with him.\nThis video can not be played\n'So tough to defend' - Fuller scores from Delap long throw-in\nPresumably there is nothing unique about Delap's musculature that prevents it from being taught to others, so why has it never been repeated? Why hasn't Mikel Arteta - who says he takes comparisons with Tony Pulis' Stoke as \"a compliment\" - brought Delap on to his coaching staff?\nThe most likely explanation is the \"Rick Barry\" phenomenon. Barry retired from the NBA in 1980 as the all-time leader in free-throw shooting percentage, having exclusively used under-arm \"granny throws\", yet nobody has copied his technique. It is seen as childish, uncool, un... basketball.\nShaquille O'Neal, when advised by Barry to \"granny throw\" in response to his poor 52% record, summed up the problem: \"I'd shoot 0% before I'd shoot underhanded.\"\nMaybe a similar phenomenon means Delap's throws are seen as too ugly and too direct - too far outside the elegant philosophies of the elite managers - to be repeated.\nIf so, they ought to loosen up. If someone breaks down that barrier it could lead to a flurry of copycats, permanently turning the throw-in into a corner-like chance and permanently changing how football is played.\nIt would be an exaggeration to say centre-backs have gone unchanged over the past couple of decades.\nChris Wilder's overlapping centre-backs at Sheffield United have led to a pared-back version become commonplace for managers who deploy a back three. England manager Thomas Tuchel, for example, may instruct his outside centre-backs to linger towards the corner of the penalty box.\nBut by and large the position is untouched. And after years of full-backs being redeployed, culminating in Ange Postecoglou using his full-backs as number eights, maybe it's time we give the centre-back new responsibilities.\nThere's nothing new about the marauding centre-back, you might say. Franco Baresi used to break lines some 40 years ago, while in England Rio Ferdinand became renowned for this feature of his game in the 2000s.\nBut we could take this one further.\nCentre-backs, unmarked and untracked, could start to make off-the-ball runs through the lines, slipping unnoticed right up into the forward line and beyond like Destiny Udogie at Tottenham Hotspur.\nIf a full-back shuttled across to cover then there's no reason why powerful centre-backs - better on the ball than ever - can't be freed to become the spare player; the disruptive force that sneaks through the system.\nHarry Kane donned the goalkeeper gloves for Spurs in 2014 - he has the passing range for this role, but you'd want him in the other box...\nOK, wait. Hear us out.\nLiverpool are 1-0 down against League One opposition in the EFL Cup. There are five minutes left on the clock and all 11 opponents are camped in their third.\nGoalkeeper Alisson is now in a quarterback role, sat on the halfway line spraying passes left and right.\nSo, Arne Slot withdraws Alisson to bring on an extra forward and, with an ironic flourish, gives he-needs-to-get-serious-about-his-defending's Trent Alexander-Arnold the goalie gloves.\nTrent stayed behind in training the previous week for a few extra sessions to learn the basics of goalkeeping, even though he's unlikely to do any during his five minutes on the pitch.\nAnd if he is called upon then a) Alexander-Arnold in goal might encourage a wild shot from distance that's easier to gather, or b) would face a four-on-two break that goalkeepers rarely keep out anyway.\nIt sounds mad at first, but the more you think about it... why not? Liverpool lose little while gaining a better quarterback distributor and an extra forward.\nReal tactical innovation requires maverick thinking. Yes, the role of a keeper has already evolved over the past decade, but let's see what Alexander-Arnold can do in goal.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Harvard University says it will not acquiesce to US President Donald Trump's demands - whether it continues to get federal funding or not.\n\"No government - regardless of which party is in power - should dictate what private universities can teach,\" Harvard's president Alan Garber said in a letter posted on the university's website.\nNot long after Harvard refused to agree to the White House's sweeping list of demands - which included directions on how to govern, hire and teach - the Trump administration froze $2.2bn (\u00a31.7bn) of federal funds to the institution. \n\"Everyone knows that Harvard has 'lost its way,'\" Donald Trump wrote on social media on Wednesday morning. \"Harvard is a JOKE, teaches Hate and Stupidity, and should no longer receive Federal Funds.\"\nMany students and alumni lauded the university's decision to stand its ground, despite the consequences. Former President Barack Obama, an alumnus himself, called Trump's move \"ham-handed\" and praised Harvard as \"an example for other higher-ed institutions\". \nIn response to Harvard's decision to refuse the government's demands, the education department accused the university of a \"troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges \u2013 that federal investment does not come with the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws\".\nWith billions in the balance, the battle for the higher ground in the case of Harvard may just be the opening salvo in a war of attrition between the federal government and higher education.   \nTrump's attacks on Harvard are not isolated - the government's antisemitism task force has identified at least 60 universities for review.\nNor did the latest move come out of the blue. Trump and his Vice-President JD Vance have long railed against higher education institutions. In 2021, Vance gave a speech that described universities as the \"enemy\". \nTrump pitched a funding crackdown on universities in his presidential campaign, painting them as hostile to conservatives. Almost a year before the present conflict in Gaza began in October 2023, he introduced a free speech policy initiative that promised to \"shatter the left-wing censorship regime\" - in part targeting campuses.\nPolling by Gallup last summer suggested that confidence in higher education had been falling over time among Americans of all political backgrounds, partly driven by a growing belief that universities push a political agenda. The decline was particularly steep among Republicans.\nAt issue now, Trump's team says, is last year's pro-Palestinian campus protests, which roiled colleges across the country. During the demonstrations and sit-ins, some Jewish students said they felt unsafe and faced harassment. Others joined the protests against Israel's military action in Gaza and US support for it.\nLast month, Columbia University agreed to many of the administration's demands in the wake of the protests - after the government cut $400m in funding.\nHarvard, too, made concessions.  It agreed to engage with the administration's task force to combat antisemitism. The school dismissed the leaders of its Center for Middle Eastern Studies and suspended its Religion, Conflict, and Peace Initiative over accusations of anti-Israel bias. \nAnd in January, Harvard settled two lawsuits brought by Jewish students alleging antisemitism. It did not admit any wrongdoing, and said the settlement showed its commitment to supporting its Jewish students and staff.\nBut the university drew the line at the White House's list of demands on Friday. \nHarvard student Sa'maia Evans, who is an activist and member of the university's African and African American Resistance Organization, said the university's decision to take a stand was a long time coming.\n\"Harvard will only do that of which it is held accountable to,\" she told the BBC. She pointed to campus protests in the past few weeks - and the widespread criticism of Columbia's agreement with the Trump administration - as helping to put pressure on university officials. \n\"They know the public - they would experience public backlash\" if they capitulated, Ms Evans said.\n\"It would be atypical (for) Harvard to do anything outside of what would be in its own interest.\"\nWith a $53.2bn endowment - a figure that is larger than the GDP of some small countries - Harvard is uniquely able to weather the storm. But experts say it is still left in a crunch.\n\"Most policymakers think of endowments as a chequing account, a debit card where you can withdraw money and use it for any purpose,\" said Steven Bloom, the spokesperson for American Council on Education. \"But it's not.\"\nWhile Harvard's endowment is eye-popping, it says 70% of the money is earmarked for specific projects - which is typical for educational endowments, according to Mr Bloom. \nHarvard has to spend the money the way the donors have directed, or it risks legal liability.\nAnd Harvard's expenses are huge - its 2024 operating budget was $6.4bn. About a third of that was funded by the endowment - with 16% coming from the federal government, often to help with things that are supposed to create good for the whole of the US, such as biomedical research. \nMr Bloom said the golden rule for endowment finance was that universities should not spend more than 5% of their total endowment each year. Making up for a $2bn loss means the school will need to boost its endowment by $40bn.\n\"You can't find 40 billion dollars under a rock,\" Mr Bloom said. \nAnd that pain will only increase if Trump is able to make good on his threat to remove Harvard's tax-exempt status. That status helps the school avoid paying taxes on its investments and properties. Harvard has campuses all over the Greater Boston area, and is estimated by Bloomberg to have saved $158m on its property tax bills in 2023.\nIn his latest comments on the university, early on Wednesday, Trump attacked the \"radical left\" Harvard leadership and said the institution could \"no longer be considered even a decent place of learning\".\nThe realities of the situation have made some students sceptical about how long it can go on.\n\"There's more the government can do if it wants to attack Harvard, and I'm not optimistic that it's going to stop after cutting $2.2 billion,\" Matthew Tobin, the academic representative on Harvard's student council.\nMr Tobin said the idea that the Trump administration was making these demands to help Harvard is \"malarkey\".\n\"Its a total bad-faith attack,\" he told the BBC. \"The funding cuts have to do with Trump attacking an institution that he views as liberal, and wanting to exercise more control over what people teach and how students learn and think.\"\nWith additional reporting from Isabella Bull in London",

        "article_text": "After decades spent in prison by Erik and Lyle Menendez - and months of contentious court fights - a judge will hear arguments on whether the brothers should be resentenced, in a murder case that still divides America. \nThe pair are serving life in prison for killing their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez, in 1989, when they were 21 and 18. Their case gained renewed attention after a popular Netflix series last year.\nThursday's resentencing hearing will determine whether the pair should be resentenced to a lesser penalty. If approved, the brothers could become eligible for parole - potentially allowing their freedom. \nProsecutors at the time argued Erik and Lyle meticulously planned the killings so they could access their parents' fortune. The current Los Angeles District Attorney says the brothers have continued to cling to lies about the case. \nBut the brothers' lawyers have long argued the killings were an act of self-defence and claimed their father abused them for years. They have also pointed to court filings detailing their rehabilitation during their years behind bars. \nHere is what to expect from the hearing - and a recap of how we got here.\nThe brothers shot and killed their parents with shotguns at their Beverly Hills mansion. There has long been a debate over their motive.\nProsecutors painted them during their trials as spoiled rich kids who wanted to access their parents' $14m (\u00a310.7m) fortune. They argued that the duo methodically bought shotguns and opened fire on their parents 13 times as the couple watched TV - before going gambling, to parties and on shopping sprees.\nThe brothers ultimately admitted to the killings - but argued they acted out of self-defence after years of emotional, physical and sexual abuse by their father Jose, a high-powered record label executive. \nThe brothers' trial in 1993 was one of the first high-profile murder cases to be shown live on television, gripping audiences in the US and globally.\nIt ended deadlocked, but in 1996, the brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in a second trial during which the judge barred many of their claims of sexual abuse. They are imprisoned near San Diego.\nA judge will look at evidence, hear from witnesses, and ultimately determine whether Erik and Lyle should be resentenced. \nIt will not be a re-trial, and guilt will not be a question. Much of the focus could instead be on what the brothers have done during their 30 years in prison. \nThe hearing - which will not be televised - will start Thursday in Los Angeles and is scheduled to also go into Friday, though it could wrap up in a single day. \nBoth sides - lawyers for the Menendez brothers and the district attorney's office - will present arguments on why the brothers should or should not be resentenced. \nThey will also be able to call people to testify. This could include a wide variety of individuals, from people involved in prosecuting the brothers in the 1990s or prison officials talking about the brothers' last 30 years behind bars. \nWe are likely to hear from members of the Menendez family, many of whom have become outspoken advocates for Erik and Lyle's release. But at least one member of the family has been a fierce critic of the effort to free them. \nMilton Anderson, who is Kitty Menendez's brother, has called the brothers \"cold-blooded\" and has argued the pair should remain behind bars for the \"heinous act\".\nThat is unclear. If they did, it would mark a significant moment in the case, and would leave them open to questions from prosecutors who oppose their release.\nThe pair have previously appeared remotely at hearings by video link. The BBC has asked whether they will appear in person, and if they will testify. \nOn a recent episode of his podcast, lawyer Mark Geragos said he had not decided whether to call them to the stand.\n\"I know right now that I'm going to put family members on the stand,\" Mr Geragos said. \"I know right now, I'll put correctional officers on the stand. I know right now I may put behavioural scientists on the stand.\"\nThe district attorney's office has similarly not said who it plans to call to testify. \nAfter the two-day hearing, Los Angeles County Judge Michael Jesic will rule on whether the brothers should be resentenced. \nBut it is not clear if that will come at the conclusion of the hearing, or later.\nEven if Judge Jesic rules in favour of the brothers being resentenced, they will not be immediately released. \nWhat happens next will depend on what type of sentence the judge offers the brothers. There is a chance they could be given a new, lesser sentence that would make them immediately eligible for parole.\nBut eligibility does not guarantee release; they would still need to convince a state parole board they are no longer a danger to society.\nOr the judge could opt for a modified sentence that reduces their punishment but does not immediately open the door to parole. In that case, the brothers could face several more years behind bars before becoming eligible.\nThe Menendez brothers filed a motion in 2023 detailing new evidence alleging childhood sexual abuse by their father, and requesting their convictions be vacated.\nThe evidence included an allegation of rape from a former member of boy band Menudo, Roy Rossell\u00f3, and a letter Erik Menendez wrote to a cousin eight months before the murders, which detailed the alleged abuse.\nThe top LA prosecutor at the time, George Gasc\u00f3n, announced that he was supporting the resentencing bid, days before an election in November 2024. He denied the announcement was political and argued it was a long time coming.\nGasc\u00f3n's announcement came shortly after a popular Netflix documentary and TV drama welcomed a new generation to the case. Many of the brothers' supporters suggest that if they were put on trial today, their allegations of abuse would be taken more seriously \u2013 potentially leading to a very different outcome.\nAfter Gasc\u00f3n lost his re-election bid, Nathan Hochman took over the his office and the Menendez case. Hochman came out forcefully against their resentencing request, and said the brothers continued to stick by a litany of \"lies\". \n\"They have not shown full insight into their crimes,\" he said. But Hochman was rebuked by a judge who allowed the resentencing request to move forward. \nThe brothers have been following three paths in an effort to win their freedom. The other two are: ",

It blamed Hamas for refusing to extend the first phase of the ceasefire, while Hamas accused Israel of reneging on its commitment to hold talks on the second stage.\nThe Board president accused Hamas of rejecting the latest ceasefire proposal, saying: \"Given that Hamas just this week rejected yet another mediation put forward via Egypt, which would have required the terrorist group to disarm, I am simply unable to agree with the viewpoint aired in the FT letter which lays blame squarely on the Israeli Government. \n\"I am confident that the vast majority of Deputies and the Jewish community as a whole agree with me.\"\nHe added that he believed the signatories of the open letter \"have a strong and completely genuine concern for the situation in Israel and Gaza\".\nMr Rosenberg also visited Israel on Thursday, where he met Israel's Minister of Foreign Affairs Gideon Saar.\nIn a post on social media, featuring a picture of the two shaking hands, Mr Rosenberg wrote: \"@BoardofDeputies is clear: Jewish leadership is standing up for peace & security in Israel & the Middle East:\n\"Getting hostages out, defeating Hamas, pursuing lasting peace & security.\n\"Unity is strength. Division serves only our enemies.\"\nIn Wednesday's open letter, signatories took aim at the Israeli government, warning \"Israel's soul is being ripped out\".\nThe letter accused Israel's government of choosing to \"break the ceasefire and return to war in Gaza\", rather than engage in diplomacy and agree the next phase of a ceasefire deal.\nIsrael blocked the entry of food, medicine and other supplies on 2 March, a day after the first phase of the ceasefire expired, saying it did so to pressure Hamas. It resumed the war two weeks later.\nIsrael launched its military campaign after Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 51,065 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Of that number, 1,691 have been killed since Israel restarted the war, it says.",

        "article_text": "After decades spent in prison by Erik and Lyle Menendez - and months of contentious court fights - a judge will hear arguments on whether the brothers should be resentenced, in a murder case that still divides America. \nThe pair are serving life in prison for killing their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez, in 1989, when they were 21 and 18. Their case gained renewed attention after a popular Netflix series last year.\nThursday's resentencing hearing will determine whether the pair should be resentenced to a lesser penalty. If approved, the brothers could become eligible for parole - potentially allowing their freedom. \nProsecutors at the time argued Erik and Lyle meticulously planned the killings so they could access their parents' fortune. The current Los Angeles District Attorney says the brothers have continued to cling to lies about the case. \nBut the brothers' lawyers have long argued the killings were an act of self-defence and claimed their father abused them for years. They have also pointed to court filings detailing their rehabilitation during their years behind bars. \nHere is what to expect from the hearing - and a recap of how we got here.\nThe brothers shot and killed their parents with shotguns at their Beverly Hills mansion. There has long been a debate over their motive.\nProsecutors painted them during their trials as spoiled rich kids who wanted to access their parents' $14m (\u00a310.7m) fortune. They argued that the duo methodically bought shotguns and opened fire on their parents 13 times as the couple watched TV - before going gambling, to parties and on shopping sprees.\nThe brothers ultimately admitted to the killings - but argued they acted out of self-defence after years of emotional, physical and sexual abuse by their father Jose, a high-powered record label executive. \nThe brothers' trial in 1993 was one of the first high-profile murder cases to be shown live on television, gripping audiences in the US and globally.\nIt ended deadlocked, but in 1996, the brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in a second trial during which the judge barred many of their claims of sexual abuse. They are imprisoned near San Diego.\nA judge will look at evidence, hear from witnesses, and ultimately determine whether Erik and Lyle should be resentenced. \nIt will not be a re-trial, and guilt will not be a question. Much of the focus could instead be on what the brothers have done during their 30 years in prison. \nThe hearing - which will not be televised - will start Thursday in Los Angeles and is scheduled to also go into Friday, though it could wrap up in a single day. \nBoth sides - lawyers for the Menendez brothers and the district attorney's office - will present arguments on why the brothers should or should not be resentenced. \nThey will also be able to call people to testify. This could include a wide variety of individuals, from people involved in prosecuting the brothers in the 1990s or prison officials talking about the brothers' last 30 years behind bars. \nWe are likely to hear from members of the Menendez family, many of whom have become outspoken advocates for Erik and Lyle's release. But at least one member of the family has been a fierce critic of the effort to free them. \nMilton Anderson, who is Kitty Menendez's brother, has called the brothers \"cold-blooded\" and has argued the pair should remain behind bars for the \"heinous act\".\nThat is unclear. If they did, it would mark a significant moment in the case, and would leave them open to questions from prosecutors who oppose their release.\nThe pair have previously appeared remotely at hearings by video link. The BBC has asked whether they will appear in person, and if they will testify. \nOn a recent episode of his podcast, lawyer Mark Geragos said he had not decided whether to call them to the stand.\n\"I know right now that I'm going to put family members on the stand,\" Mr Geragos said. \"I know right now, I'll put correctional officers on the stand. I know right now I may put behavioural scientists on the stand.\"\nThe district attorney's office has similarly not said who it plans to call to testify. \nAfter the two-day hearing, Los Angeles County Judge Michael Jesic will rule on whether the brothers should be resentenced. \nBut it is not clear if that will come at the conclusion of the hearing, or later.\nEven if Judge Jesic rules in favour of the brothers being resentenced, they will not be immediately released. \nWhat happens next will depend on what type of sentence the judge offers the brothers. There is a chance they could be given a new, lesser sentence that would make them immediately eligible for parole.\nBut eligibility does not guarantee release; they would still need to convince a state parole board they are no longer a danger to society.\nOr the judge could opt for a modified sentence that reduces their punishment but does not immediately open the door to parole. In that case, the brothers could face several more years behind bars before becoming eligible.\nThe Menendez brothers filed a motion in 2023 detailing new evidence alleging childhood sexual abuse by their father, and requesting their convictions be vacated.\nThe evidence included an allegation of rape from a former member of boy band Menudo, Roy Rossell\u00f3, and a letter Erik Menendez wrote to a cousin eight months before the murders, which detailed the alleged abuse.\nThe top LA prosecutor at the time, George Gasc\u00f3n, announced that he was supporting the resentencing bid, days before an election in November 2024. He denied the announcement was political and argued it was a long time coming.\nGasc\u00f3n's announcement came shortly after a popular Netflix documentary and TV drama welcomed a new generation to the case. Many of the brothers' supporters suggest that if they were put on trial today, their allegations of abuse would be taken more seriously \u2013 potentially leading to a very different outcome.\nAfter Gasc\u00f3n lost his re-election bid, Nathan Hochman took over the his office and the Menendez case. Hochman came out forcefully against their resentencing request, and said the brothers continued to stick by a litany of \"lies\". \n\"They have not shown full insight into their crimes,\" he said. But Hochman was rebuked by a judge who allowed the resentencing request to move forward. \nThe brothers have been following three paths in an effort to win their freedom. The other two are: ",

        "article_text": "Rhian Mannings and Andrea Evans have been the best of friends for 13 years - but the circumstances that brought them together could not be more tragic.\nNurse Andrea was the last person to hold Rhian's one-year-old son George after he died from pneumonia. \n\"Leaving a hospital without your child is the most unnatural thing as a parent you will ever have to do,\" said Rhian.\n\"But leaving George in her arms made it just that little, little bit easier because you knew that somebody really did care.\"\nAfter George's death, Rhian and her husband Paul returned home unable to make sense of their seismic loss.\nMeanwhile Andrea continued her shift, caring for other patients. \nWarning: This article contains references to suicide \nRhian and Andrea are sharing their story to shine a light on the hidden emotional toll the death of a child can have on professionals - everyone from doctors and nurses to police officers, firefighters and teachers.\nGeorge had been happily playing with his brother and sister before he fell ill very suddenly, just days after his first birthday in 2012.\nHe was rushed to Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Talbot Green, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and was cared for by a number of staff including Andrea.\nAs well as caring for George, Andrea was responsible for keeping his distraught parents informed about what was happening. \nNow, 13 years on, Andrea's memories from that evening have not faded.\n\"I remember seeing Rhian and Paul arrive and just being completely distraught,\" said Andrea from Talbot Green.\n\"To me I wasn't doing enough, I wasn't saying enough, I wasn't explaining enough. In my own head I was panicking about ways that I could make this better, even though it was never going to be a good situation,\" she said. \nThe team spent a long time working on George until eventually Andrea received a nod from the consultant.\n\"It was sort of 'get Rhi and Paul back here, we need to hold him because this is going to be his last moments',\" she said.\nAndrea stayed with Rhian and Paul during George's final moments and was with them when they spent time with him afterwards, as well as staying with George once they eventually left the hospital.\nAndrea then continued the rest of her shift.\n\"You're exhausted from those couple of hours\u2026 but the department is busy and other people keep coming and they are not aware of what's happened and they need to be cared for in exactly the same way and so you haven't got time, you haven't got time to sit and dwell,\" said Andrea. \nGeorge's death had impacted her.\n\"This particular situation was a bit too close for comfort really,\" she said.\nLike Rhian, Andrea was also a mother-of-three.\nShe had a six-month-old baby at home and two other children a similar age to Rhian's older children. \n\"It definitely hit home... you just want to get home at that point and hold your own children,\" she said. \nMeanwhile Rhian and her husband Paul were in agony, facing what felt like insurmountable grief. \nThey had returned home that evening with their other two children asleep and oblivious to what had happened.\nGeorge's birthday cards were still up.\nIn the days that followed, Rhian was aghast that the only bereavement support they had been offered was a leaflet with a list of phone numbers.\n\"You have these amazing staff in the hospital doing everything they possibly can but when you leave there's nothing there to pick you up or look after you or answer your questions,\" said Rhian, from Miskin, Rhondda Cynon Taf. \nPaul was struggling to cope and began blaming himself for George's death.\n\"He felt we should have taken him in the car rather than wait for the ambulance,\" said Rhian.\n\"He felt that as a dad he'd potentially failed our family which is really heart-breaking.\"\nThey spoke about Andrea often.\n\"Paul and I called her our angel,\" she said. \nFive days after George's death, Rhian faced the unthinkable when her husband Paul took his own life. \nHe had gone for a drive to clear his head but failed to return.\nJust as Rhian was thinking of calling the police, two officers appeared at her door to tell her he was dead.\n\"I truly believe that we were failed and that's what led to Paul's death,\" said Rhian.\n\"No-one knocked on our door and offered us any support from any kind of agency or professional body and that's really hard to live with.\"\nAndrea learnt about Paul's death after arriving at work for a night shift.\n\"It was devastating because I then went onto think that I should have done something better,\" she said.\n\"What if I'd said something different, could I have helped him more?\"\nRemarkably, while grieving her husband and child, Rhian found herself thinking about Andrea. \n\"I wanted to check she was okay,\" said Rhian.\n\"But also now I didn't have Paul anymore there was only really one other person who was there that whole evening with me, and that was her.\"\nRhian decided to leave a rose bush and a letter on Andrea's doorstep. \nAndrea responded and the pair met up for a coffee.\n\"I think it was perhaps a little bit awkward in the beginning,\" admitted Andrea.\nShe said she did not know what Rhian expected from the meeting and was concerned about saying the wrong thing.\n\"I don't know what I expected,\" admitted Rhian.\n\"But you were the last person to hold my little boy... you met Paul.\"\nAndrea was touched and surprised that Rhian was concerned for her. \nAfter that initial meeting the pair - who only live a few miles apart - began bumping into one another.\nA friendship slowly began to form.\nThey don't often speak about the night George died, but Rhian has been able to reassure Andrea that she could not have done more to support Paul.\n\"If I hadn't have told you that, you'd still potentially be living with that,\" said Rhian.\nAndrea agreed: \"Yes, I'd still be carrying that.\"\nRhian went on to establish her own charity called 2Wish, which covers Wales and the border counties of England, and offers support to anyone who has experienced the sudden and unexpected death of a child or young adult.\nProfessionals like Andrea are able to self-refer and receive a range of support including debriefing sessions, counselling and complementary therapies.\nThe Welsh government also funds a service called Canopi, which offers mental health support for social care and NHS staff in Wales.\nOver the years, Rhian has roped Andrea into many fundraising challenges for her charity.  \nNow Andrea is hoping to encourage other professionals to consider seeking support.  \nThe You Can't Pour from an Empty Cup campaign is now in its fourth year and the number of referrals has grown year on year.\n\"During my years in A&E you learn to compartmentalise and try to leave work in work - that does build over the years and your boxes start to overflow a little bit which is when it gets stressful and complicated, and if you don't deal with them soon enough I think it becomes a problem,\" said Andrea.\nShe said it was a \"very good thing\" to take time to reflect properly on the difficult situations that arise at work. \nRhian said from the trauma of their first meeting a \"really lovely, honest relationship\" had grown.\n\"Our children are friendly, we've just got back from holiday together, we've been away many times together, our husbands are happy and get on really well,\" she said. \nShe also goes to Andrea for fashion advice.\n\"We're honest friends, if I need advice on what to wear she's the one I go to because she'll tell me straight,\" she laughed. \nAndrea said it had been nice to see their children grow up together.\n\"We often say it would have been nice to have the six of them and we do talk about George a lot,\" she said.\nRhian will always be grateful to Andrea.\n\"I'll never ever be able to thank her for what she did that night,\" she said.\n\"And I know Paul would too.\" \nIf you have been affected by the issues raised in this story, BBC Action Line features a list of organisations which can provide support and advice.",

        "article_text": "Corner chicken & Rory Delap 2.0 - what's the future of football?\nIf the past decade of English football has one unifying theme it is tactical renewal.\nSince the mid-2010s - and since Antonio Conte, Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp - the Premier League has attracted Europe's best coaches, putting a once sleepy and unsophisticated division at the vanguard of tactical innovation.\nBut we are in a moment of flux. New ideas still flood into the league but nothing, yet, has emerged as the next great theory. As Guardiola treads water at Manchester City we are waiting to find out where the sport goes next.\nHere are some ideas - some quirkier than others - for the future of football.\nPremier League intensity or caution - how will Tuchel's England play?\nWhy Guardiola's tactics stopped working amid rise of rapid football\nEmbracing the chaos - breaking down Bournemouth's rise\nLet's start with one of the weirder ones\u2026 but also one that feeds most directly into where the game seems to be heading.\nA couple of years ago the way Roberto de Zerbi stretched the pitch from goal-kicks was all the rage.\nHe kept five players next to his goalkeeper and stuck five players on the halfway line, emptying central midfield and splitting a confused opposition in two. Brighton would then kick it long, bypassing half the team.\nThis kind of thing might come back again, and certainly long balls are boomeranging back into fashion as the natural antidote to high pressing, short goal-kicks and high defensive lines. A decade of sucking everyone into tight spaces was bound to trigger a counter-reaction of stretching things back out.\nSo, here's a thought for all those high-risk De Zerbi types.\nWhen defending a corner, instead of packing the box with bodies, why not begin a game of chicken and leave four or five on the halfway line?\nThis would create exciting five-on-two long-ball counter-attacking scenarios, or, more likely, force the attacking team to leave five or six players back.\nJust like that you've decluttered the penalty area and, at the elite level, clearing a path for the goalkeeper and creating simpler one-on-one marking could reduce the chances of conceding.\nCorners are in vogue at the moment and the set-piece coach is the new must-have accessory. But maybe we're looking too closely at 'love trains' and marking systems in a messy penalty box.\nIt's within a team's power to free up space and lean into ultra-stretched football. Just don't be chicken.\nThere isn't enough deception in football tactics.\nThere are the 'dark arts' of defending, the dummy and the no-look pass. But where are the Trojan horses, the tactical decoys?\nPlayers are getting more versatile all the time and (most) managers are too, regularly changing formation between matches and within them. In fact, a lot of managers these days would reject the idea of the formation.\nBut there are still basic differences between, say, the 4-3-3 and the 3-4-2-1, and although a lot of coaches are comfortable switching it up based on the game state - moving to a back three to see out the final few minutes of a 1-0 lead, for example - nobody changes formation early in a game.\nAnd nobody is doing it to fool the other manager.\nImagine two teams lining up in similar 4-3-3s, with touchline-hugging wingers and two number eights in front of a defensive midfielder. For the first 10 minutes they feel each other out, getting used to their opponents' patterns.\nThen all of a sudden one team swaps to a 3-4-2-1. The wingers disappear, the three-player triangle in midfield becomes a box-shape four, and the other side has to scramble to keep up.\nFive minutes later, they change back again. Or switch to a third system entirely. It would be chaotic, but the team who planned the switches in training would have a huge advantage in those frantic few minutes of adaptation.\nAnd it could have a huge impact on the game because, at the risk of getting highfalutin, it would require a new way of thinking about time.\nCurrently football people only think about time in quite a limited way: how long we have to hold on to the lead, when the first substitution should be made, when to throw the kitchen sink.\nTime is an attritional dance with the other team, something we react to, the variable that slips through our fingers.\nDecoy formations would require breaking up the game into chunks of time and planning each segment. Once we start thinking this way, the 90 minutes could feel longer and richer - something to seize and control.\nWe watched every Premier League manager - here's what we found out\nWhere do Premier League managers stand during a game?\nThere are about 30 throw-ins per match yet nobody has thought to seek innovation around the most common set-piece in the game - and one with an (inexplicable) detail ready to exploit: no offsides.\nExcept, of course, one man did innovate some 17 years ago. It's just that nobody has thought to copy him.\nA Rory Delap throw arrowing through the sky is one of the Premier League's most iconic images.\nHis throw-ins led to 25 Stoke City goals in his first four seasons at the club, terrifying defences to the extent that on one infamous occasion Hull City goalkeeper Boaz Myhill chose not to clear for touch but boot the ball straight out for a corner.\nAnd yet the technique of Delap's throw-in retired with him.\nThis video can not be played\n'So tough to defend' - Fuller scores from Delap long throw-in\nPresumably there is nothing unique about Delap's musculature that prevents it from being taught to others, so why has it never been repeated? Why hasn't Mikel Arteta - who says he takes comparisons with Tony Pulis' Stoke as \"a compliment\" - brought Delap on to his coaching staff?\nThe most likely explanation is the \"Rick Barry\" phenomenon. Barry retired from the NBA in 1980 as the all-time leader in free-throw shooting percentage, having exclusively used under-arm \"granny throws\", yet nobody has copied his technique. It is seen as childish, uncool, un... basketball.\nShaquille O'Neal, when advised by Barry to \"granny throw\" in response to his poor 52% record, summed up the problem: \"I'd shoot 0% before I'd shoot underhanded.\"\nMaybe a similar phenomenon means Delap's throws are seen as too ugly and too direct - too far outside the elegant philosophies of the elite managers - to be repeated.\nIf so, they ought to loosen up. If someone breaks down that barrier it could lead to a flurry of copycats, permanently turning the throw-in into a corner-like chance and permanently changing how football is played.\nIt would be an exaggeration to say centre-backs have gone unchanged over the past couple of decades.\nChris Wilder's overlapping centre-backs at Sheffield United have led to a pared-back version become commonplace for managers who deploy a back three. England manager Thomas Tuchel, for example, may instruct his outside centre-backs to linger towards the corner of the penalty box.\nBut by and large the position is untouched. And after years of full-backs being redeployed, culminating in Ange Postecoglou using his full-backs as number eights, maybe it's time we give the centre-back new responsibilities.\nThere's nothing new about the marauding centre-back, you might say. Franco Baresi used to break lines some 40 years ago, while in England Rio Ferdinand became renowned for this feature of his game in the 2000s.\nBut we could take this one further.\nCentre-backs, unmarked and untracked, could start to make off-the-ball runs through the lines, slipping unnoticed right up into the forward line and beyond like Destiny Udogie at Tottenham Hotspur.\nIf a full-back shuttled across to cover then there's no reason why powerful centre-backs - better on the ball than ever - can't be freed to become the spare player; the disruptive force that sneaks through the system.\nHarry Kane donned the goalkeeper gloves for Spurs in 2014 - he has the passing range for this role, but you'd want him in the other box...\nOK, wait. Hear us out.\nLiverpool are 1-0 down against League One opposition in the EFL Cup. There are five minutes left on the clock and all 11 opponents are camped in their third.\nGoalkeeper Alisson is now in a quarterback role, sat on the halfway line spraying passes left and right.\nSo, Arne Slot withdraws Alisson to bring on an extra forward and, with an ironic flourish, gives he-needs-to-get-serious-about-his-defending's Trent Alexander-Arnold the goalie gloves.\nTrent stayed behind in training the previous week for a few extra sessions to learn the basics of goalkeeping, even though he's unlikely to do any during his five minutes on the pitch.\nAnd if he is called upon then a) Alexander-Arnold in goal might encourage a wild shot from distance that's easier to gather, or b) would face a four-on-two break that goalkeepers rarely keep out anyway.\nIt sounds mad at first, but the more you think about it... why not? Liverpool lose little while gaining a better quarterback distributor and an extra forward.\nReal tactical innovation requires maverick thinking. Yes, the role of a keeper has already evolved over the past decade, but let's see what Alexander-Arnold can do in goal.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

It would be chaotic, but the team who planned the switches in training would have a huge advantage in those frantic few minutes of adaptation.And it could have a huge impact on the game because, at the risk of getting highfalutin, it would require a new way of thinking about time.Currently football people only think about time in quite a limited way: how long we have to hold on to the lead, when the first substitution should be made, when to throw the kitchen sink.Time is an attritional dance with the other team, something we react to, the variable that slips through our fingers.Decoy formations would require breaking up the game into chunks of time and planning each segment. It's just that nobody has thought to copy him.A Rory Delap throw arrowing through the sky is one of the Premier League's most iconic images.His throw-ins led to 25 Stoke City goals in his first four seasons at the club, terrifying defences to the extent that on one infamous occasion Hull City goalkeeper Boaz Myhill chose not to clear for touch but boot the ball straight out for a corner.And yet the technique of Delap's throw-in retired with him.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'So tough to defend' - Fuller scores from Delap long throw-inPresumably there is nothing unique about Delap's musculature that prevents it from being taught to others, so why has it never been repeated? A decade of sucking everyone into tight spaces was bound to trigger a counter-reaction of stretching things back out.So, here's a thought for all those high-risk De Zerbi types.When defending a corner, instead of packing the box with bodies, why not begin a game of chicken and leave four or five on the halfway line?This would create exciting five-on-two long-ball counter-attacking scenarios, or, more likely, force the attacking team to leave five or six players back.Just like that you've decluttered the penalty area and, at the elite level, clearing a path for the goalkeeper and creating simpler one-on-one marking could reduce the chances of conceding.Corners are in vogue at the moment and the set-piece coach is the new must-have accessory. As Guardiola treads water at Manchester City we are waiting to find out where the sport goes next.Here are some ideas - some quirkier than others - for the future of football.Premier League intensity or caution - how will Tuchel's England play?Published21 MarchWhy Guardiola's tactics stopped working amid rise of rapid footballPublished22 FebruaryEmbracing the chaos - breaking down Bournemouth's risePublished24 JanuaryCorner chickenLet's start with one of the weirder ones\u2026 but also one that feeds most directly into where the game seems to be heading.A couple of years ago the way Roberto de Zerbi stretched the pitch from goal-kicks was all the rage.He kept five players next to his goalkeeper and stuck five players on the halfway line, emptying central midfield and splitting a confused opposition in two.",

        "article_text": "Rohit Sharma won five IPL titles as captain of Mumbai Indians in an 11-year leadership stint\nRohit Sharma has been under scrutiny for his poor form in the Indian Premier League (IPL), and his struggles so far in 2025 are consistent with a downward trend in the competition over the past three years. \nThe former Mumbai Indians captain, who still leads India's white-ball teams, has scored 82 runs in six innings at an average of 13.66.\nThe opener's 26 from 16 balls against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Thursday was his highest score this season, and with three sixes he showed some glimpses of a return to form before another soft dismissal off Pat Cummins. \n\"He's finding it very hard to be consistent,\" former IPL batter Abhishek Jhunjhunwala told BBC Sport.\nRohit's run drought has also mirrored his own team's form, as Mumbai have struggled to find a consistent winning combination - they are seventh in the table with three wins from seven. \nHowever, this is unique to Rohit in the IPL specifically as he is still having plenty of success internationally with a T20 World Cup win in 2024 and the Champions Trophy title last month. \nHe is also a Mumbai legend having led them to five titles in 11 years as captain, while he is set to have a stand named after him at the iconic Wankhede stadium.\nBut with that success and status comes immense expectation. BBC Sport and CricViz data analyst Soham Sarkhel have looked at the numbers behind Rohit's decline, and what he and Mumbai could do next.\nKeep up to date with the Indian Premier League\nIPL 2025 points table and top run-scorers & wicket-takers\nRohit's average in the IPL is 29.30, but since 2022 he averages 22.89 at the top of the order. That is the second-lowest of the 21 openers to play 20-plus innings.\nHe averages 13.66 in six matches this season - and it is 12.89 if you add the final three games of 2024.\nHis form in T20 internationals hasn't declined in the same way. Since the start of 2022 he averages 29.34 in T20Is compared to 22.89 in the IPL as an opener.\nRohit's best returns in the IPL have come at five (average of 33.11) and four. (average of 32.7). That drops to 27.74 as an opener, with him only averaging more than 30 in 2016 and 2024 (min five innings).\nRohit Sharma has been dismissed in the six-over powerplay in all six of his innings in the 2025 IPL\nAgainst pace in the six-over powerplay his average has dropped from 36.47 to 24.39 since 2022.\nHe has only survived past the powerplay in 12 of his 36 IPL innings since the start of 2023 and is yet to bat outside the powerplay this year.\nThe right-hander used to be a 'balanced' player with 51% of runs in that phase scored on the leg side, but that has climbed to 59%. \nThat could contribute to a decline in his numbers against outswinging deliveries and a rise against inswingers. Before 2022 he averaged 27 against inswingers and close to 50 against outswingers but since then, those numbers are 44 and 19. \nHe used to average 63 against outswingers from right-arm pacers in the powerplay, now it is 16.\nBetween 2014 and 2021 Rohit was out seven times to left-arm seamers and averaged 28.85. Since 2022 he has been dismissed eight times and averages 22.37. It equates for 24% of the balls he has faced too, up from 13%. \nRohit is also struggling against spin. He averages 15.33 since 2022, down from 34.68. \nThere is a particular weakness against leg-spin, which he averages 7.88 against since 2022. \nThe sweep shot is also getting him into trouble. He used it just 7% of the time between 2014 and 2021 and was out eight times. That was climbed to 21% of deliveries since 2022 and he has been dismissed six times, at an average of 15.5.\nThat's a trend in all formats with Rohit's last 30 sweep shots across all formats seeing him dismissed seven times, at an average of seven. \nMumbai's most recent IPL title came in 2020, having also won the previous year, and Rohit was replaced as skipper by Hardik Pandya in 2024 - but in the all-rounder's first edition in charge, they finished bottom of the table. \nRohit's legendary status with the side is likely to earn him a longer run in order to solve his personal batting problems, but it could present the Mumbai hierarchy with a brave call to make if he cannot regain form - and if the team maintains its inconsistency, too. \n\"There is a lot of pressure on him, especially when he's playing for India,\" Jhunjhunwala added.\n\"In the IPL, they are ruthless as we've seen with so many players, and we've seen that with Mumbai Indians.\n\"There will be patience with him, especially at Mumbai, because he's done brilliantly for them over the years.\n\"He's still got it. I just feel that he's maybe lost a bit of hand-eye coordination and that can happen, but your career can really go down quite quickly. He's got to work on a lot of things, especially his fitness.\"\nFormer England bowler Tymal Mills, who played with Rohit at Mumbai in 2022, also backed him to rediscover his best form and described him as \"a nightmare for bowlers\" when in full flow. \n\"He's one of the most experienced players in the world, he has been there and done it at the highest level for a very long time,\" Mills told BBC Sport.\n\"He will stick to his processes, he will hit a lot of balls. You'll always see him going to training early and getting his extra work done before everyone else arrives. \n\"When you have played as long as Rohit has, you're going to go through bad spells. Players of his class always re-emerge.\n\"He has earned the right to get a long leash because he's had such a successful career and been a nightmare for bowlers.\"\nMills also questioned whether being the impact sub - which Rohit has been in five of his six games, including three times when batting second - was a \"hindrance\" because it could \"take you a bit longer to get into the game\". \nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

That is a dream of mine and I am sure I'll be a club owner. I hope to have not just one club, but several clubs.\"\nOther players have gone one step further by investing in football clubs before retirement.\nKylian Mbappe (SM Caen), Sadio Mane (Bourges Foot 18) Juan Mata (San Diego FC), Wilfried Zaha (AFC Croydon), Cesar Azpilicueta (Hashtag United) and Hector Bellerin (Forest Green) are just some of the names who appear to be planning for life after football.\n\"I've got no interest in being a manager. It's not a passion of mine,\" said David Beckham (co-owner of Inter Miami and Salford City).\n\"Being a coach is too much work,\" said Zlatan Ibrahimovic (investor in Hammarby and senior advisor at AC Milan).\nBoth Beckham and Ibrahimovic had public run-ins with managers during their playing careers and it could be argued they are better suited at the top of the tree, rather than managing a squad of 25 players and taking instructions from a board of directors.\nFootball finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport: \"Footballers do not necessarily want to go into a coach/management role because of the stresses it brings.

Modric wouldn't be named in a list of top 10 well-known players. \nMaguire added: \"If a player is a brand in their own right, there are financial benefits for them and their clubs. But they do it for the love of the game and it allows them to stay in the realms of football.\"\nThat is not to say pursuing football club ownership is not without risk.\nIn July 2024, Mbappe completed the takeover of Ligue 2 side Caen, investing \u00a312.6m in a majority stake.

        "article_text": "Real Madrid are the defending European champions - and despite the odds being against them some pundits are still tipping them to go through against Arsenal\n\"Remontada...[comeback] I've heard it about a million times this week, I've seen a million videos online.\"\nReal Madrid's Jude Bellingham was responding to a leading question from a Spanish journalist before Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Arsenal when he said that 'Remontada' was \"the most-used word in the dressing room in the last days\".\nIf it was a question designed to allow Bellingham to fuel the narrative and hype building in Madrid despite last week's 3-0 first leg defeat, it certainly worked. \nThe 15-time champions of Europe Real Madrid have a reputation for doing the impossible in recent Champions League campaigns.\nDeclan Rice's sensational free-kick double and Mikel Merino's curled strike mean Madrid must overcome a three-goal deficit to progress at the Bernabeu.\n\"There's not a lot you can do for Real Madrid in the Champions League that hasn't already been done,\" Bellingham, 21, added.\n\"Tomorrow is an opportunity for us to do something for the first time and that's really important to us.\n\"It's a weird environment these last few days. One of the worst results we could possibly imagine away and for some reason everyone thinks it's nailed on that we'll come back.\n\"There's a lot of trust in the talent. There's an expectation from Real Madrid that when we get into these kind of holes we can come back, even if it's a really tough one, a really difficult one.\n\"Just because the club has done it so many times, that's what's so impressive about the size of this club, and the expectations are obviously huge.\" \nReal Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti, who has won the competition five times as a manager, said he was \"focused, with a very cool head\".\n\"It's not my first night like this and I hope it will not be the last,\" he said.\nArsenal second leg 'a night made for Real Madrid'\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nOn three out of the past four occasions on which Real Madrid have trailed after the first leg in the Champions League, they have fought back to reach the next round -  against Wolfsburg in 2015-16 and in 2021-22 against both Paris St-Germain and Manchester City.\nBut Arsenal can take belief from the fact this is the joint-largest deficit Madrid have ever trailed by heading into a Champions League second leg.\nThe last time they faced such a task was against Borussia Dortmund in the 2012-13 semi-final, when Robert Lewandowski netted a hat-trick in a 4-1 win for Jurgen Klopp's side in Germany.\nReal won the return match 2-0 in Madrid, but Dortmund progressed to the final on aggregate.\nIn fact, the only time they have fought back from three goals down after a first leg came in the European Cup against Derby County in the last 16 of the 1975-76 edition, winning 6-5 on aggregate following a 4-1 defeat at the Baseball Ground. \nA deficit of three goals or more has been overturned just four times since the European Cup became the Champions League in 1992.\nLiverpool trailed 3-0 against Barcelona going into the second leg of their 2018-19 semi-final at Anfield, but stormed into the final with four unanswered goals.\nDeportivo La Coruna, against AC Milan in 2004, and Roma, in 2018 against Barcelona, are the only other teams to have come back from three goals down after a first leg in the Champions League era.\nBut one team have overturned a four goal-deficit - Barcelona in the game originally christened 'La Remontada' in 2016-17 - when they beat PSG 6-1 at the Nou Camp.\nStats company Opta gives Arsenal an 89.7% chance of progressing to the semi-finals, and Real have lost five games in the competition this season - a tally that equals a club record.\n\"Every single time Madrid did a miracle, the preview said it is not possible,\" said Guillem Balague on the EuroLeagues podcast.\n\"But on this occasion, you are talking about a team that don't defend well, there is no architecture in the midfield, there is no patterns. They depend a lot on the individuals, as always. They haven't got a capacity to react.\n\"There are so many details that suggest it is not possible for them to turn this around, including the amount of running they do - they ran 12km less than Arsenal [in the first leg].\n\"They are still not players who do the work defensively. They think they can just switch on at any minute and turn any game around, and I don't think that's possible, not with this team.\"\nFellow pundit Julien Laurens agreed, telling BBC's Football Daily podcast: \n\"To get this win, Real Madrid need to do something more special than they have ever done.\nThis Arsenal team is very good defensively, they are one of the best teams in Europe even without Gabriel.\n\"Carlo Ancelotti has never been a manager for patterns of play. He is the king of man management and he lets the players express themselves on the pitch.\n\"But this season there does feel like there is no structure. It feels as though this is a group of super talented players individually, but not as a team. There's not that togetherness or cohesion tactically. Unless they play as a team, I find it hard to believe they will overturn this.\"\nThis video can not be played\nIt's a night that's made for Real Madrid - Bellingham\nAs James Horncastle said on the EuroLeagues podcast, there are heavyweights of the European game who are still backing Madrid to progress - including Champions League winners with AC Milan Alessandro Costacurta and Zvonimir Boban, and former Madrid boss Fabio Capello. \n\"Amazing things happen in football, amazing things happen at the Bernabeu,\" said Horncastle. \"I know this Real Madrid side has injuries, it has flaws, it is not balanced.\n\"I was not surprised to see in the Italian papers and on Italian TV, that when they were asked to predict who would reach the semi-finals, three pundits - Costacurta, Boban and Capello - still refused to go against Madrid.\n\"It still says a lot about Madrid's reputation that it is not something you can take for granted that Arsenal will progress at the Bernabeu.\"\nBut the omens are good for Mikel Arteta's outfit.\nArsenal's victory was the 12th time an English side have won by three or more goals in the first leg of a Champions League knockout stage tie, and every time the English side has gone through to the next round.\nThe Gunners also have a good record when leading after the first leg of a Champions League knockout match - they have progressed from six of the eight ties they have won the opening match.\nFurthermore, they remain unbeaten against Real Madrid in European competition, with two wins and a draw, and have not conceded a single goal across their three meetings.\nThis video can not be played\nWhy Real Madrid's season is seen as a 'big failure'\nAfter the first leg at the Emirates, Real's England star Bellingham said: \"One place where crazy things happen is our house.\"\nSpeaking at Tuesday's news conference, Bellingham added: \"It's a night that's made for Real Madrid.\n\"A night that would go down in history but also something that people are familiar with around this part of this world. Hopefully we can add another special night.\"\nNo Champions League campaign epitomised that more than in 2021-22, when Real pulled off sensational fightbacks against PSG, Chelsea and then Manchester City in one of the most incredible runs in the competition's history.\nLast season they were minutes away from losing their semi-final tie with Bayern Munich before turning things around with two late goals at the Bernabeu.\nIn both of those campaigns, Ancelotti's side went on to win the competition.\n\"We know we're strong at home with our fans,\" said goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. \"If we score one or two, quickly... I think it's possible.\"\nIt is that 'never say die' attitude that has served Real so well over the years.",

Everybody is to blame\".\nTensions between Trump and Zelensky have been high ever since their heated confrontation at the White House in February.\nDuring that meeting, Trump accused Zelensky of \"gambling with World War Three\" and chided him for not starting peace talks with Russia earlier.\nBy contrast, the US president has made efforts to improve relations with Moscow.\nTrump said he had a \"great\" phone call with Putin last month, and the Russian president sent him a portrait as a gift a week later.\nIn February, Washington voted with Moscow against a UN resolution that identified Russia as the \"aggressor\" in Russia's war against Ukraine.\nAfter talks between US and Russian officials failed to produce a ceasefire in Ukraine, Trump said he was \"very angry\" with Putin, though he added he had a \"good relationship\" with the Russian leader.\nUS envoy Steve Witkoff, who met Putin in St Petersburg for close to five hours on Friday, said the talks had been \"compelling\".\nHe said the Russian leader's request had been to get \"a permanent peace... beyond a ceasefire\". The detailed discussions had included the future of five Ukrainian territories Russia is claiming to have annexed since it launched the full-scale invasion of its neighbour and \"no Nato, Article 5\" \u2013 referring to the Nato rule that says members will come to the defence of an ally that is under attack.\n\"I think we might be on the verge of something that would be very, very important for the world at large,\" Witkoff told Fox News on Monday.\n\"There is a possibility to reshape the Russian-United states relationship through some very compelling commercial opportunities that I think give real stability to the region, too. Partnerships create stability,\" Trump's envoy said. \nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was less effusive, describing the contacts as positive but with no clear outlines of an agreement.\nIn an interview recorded before Russia's deadly attack on Sumy, Zelensky had urged Trump to visit Ukraine before striking a deal with Putin to end the war.\n\"Please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead,\" Zelensky said in an interview for CBS's 60 Minutes programme.\nAt least 35 people were killed when Russian forces fired two Iskander missiles into the heart of Sumy on Sunday. \nThe blasts took place minutes apart while many civilians were heading to church for Palm Sunday, a week before Easter.\nA bus was destroyed in the attack and bodies were left strewn in the middle of a city streeet. \nMoscow claimed it had targeted a meeting of Ukrainian soldiers, killing 60 of them, but did not provide any evidence.\nTrump insisted he wanted to \"stop the killing\" and signalled there would be proposals soon, but did not elaborate.\nThe conflict in Ukraine goes back more than a decade, to 2014, when Kyiv's pro-Russian president was overthrown. Russia then annexed Crimea and backed insurgents in bloody fighting in eastern Ukraine.",

        "article_text": "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in last month. Now he is fighting to stay in the job after calling a snap general election which will see Canadians go to the polls on 28 April. \nCarney was the first non-British person to take on the top banking role in the central bank's more than 300-year history. He had previously steered his home country through the 2008 financial crash as the governor of the Bank of Canada.\nUnlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he handily won the Liberal Party contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in early March.\nNow he is touting his experience handling global economic crises, hoping Canadians will see him as the leader mostly likely to stand up to US President Donald Trump who has launched a trade war on his northern neighbour.\nAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.\nWith three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.\nThe son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. \nIn 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs. \n\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race. \n\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"\nIn 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.\nIn 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.\nAlthough central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. \nThat move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.\nHe is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.\nIn 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.\nInterest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.\nConfusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.\nUnlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.\nIn 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.\nBefore the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.\nIn the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.\nHe described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.\nThe Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.\nHis final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\". \nCarney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.\nFrom 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.\nHe was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.\nAlthough he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.\nAfter Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.\n\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said. \n\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"\nHe seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".\nThe Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 60-year-old had brushed off the idea.\n\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.\nThings changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.\nReports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.\nFreeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.\n\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\" \nStill, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. \nThe Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.\nThey have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets over conflict-of-interest concerns. \nCarney has placed his assets in a blind trust and has said he is in full compliance with existing conflict-of-interest rules, but has been pressed for more transparency. \nIn addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.\nHe is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\nOne of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.\nShortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April, though he has in the past advocated for similar policies. \n\"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.\nOn the campaign trail, he has also advocated for making Canada a \"clean and conventional\" energy superpower, and to speed up major project approvals. \nCarney has called himself a \"pragmatist\" when questioned about potential conflicts between his energy policies and his climate values.\nOn immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.\nHis biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.

A low number of blazes in 2024 also left more vegetation to fuel them.\nCoed Cadw, the Woodland Trust in Wales, said an \"irreplaceable\" area of temperate Atlantic rainforest had been affected at Allt Boeth near Aberystwyth, with damage to protected bluebells too.\nAlso known as Celtic rainforest, the habitat harbours scarce plants, lichens and fungi, and is considered more threatened than tropical rainforest.\nIn England, the National Trust said several thousand newly planted trees at Marsden Moor, in West Yorkshire, had gone up in flames.\nWhile on the Morne Mountains, in Northern Ireland, invertebrates and ground dwelling animals like reptiles were \"simply being torched alive\".\n\"That then cascades through the food web because without the invertebrates you don't get the birds who are reliant on them for food,\" Mr McCarthy said.\nHe said government funding to help farmers and land managers restore peat bogs in the uplands, to prevent fires while also soaking in planet-warming carbon and providing habitat, was essential.\nConservation charities including The Wildlife Trusts and the Initiative for Nature Conservation Cymru (INCC) also voiced fears for the future of the water vole, which is already under serious threat from habitat loss and predation by American minks.\nSmall animals like water voles and shrews, which live in burrows, can survive fast-moving fires but their habitats and the food they rely on are destroyed.\nWater voles are \"the fastest-declining mammal ever\" according to Rob Parry of the INCC.\n\"Their last foothold [in Wales] is in the uplands so when those sites are burned it is awful for that particular population, but from a UK point of view we are one step closer to the extinction of an entire species,\" he said.\nThe INCC is also monitoring five breeding pairs of barn owls in the Amman Valley in south Wales, where wildfires have destroyed huge areas of habitat. \n\"A few weeks ago they had all of this area to find food for their chicks and suddenly they don't have that any more,\" said Mr Parry.\n\"I don't know how they are going to cope. A wildfire just makes that habitat disappear overnight.\"\nOther rare birds are also affected, including hen harriers, which have been subject to  recent conservation efforts to increase their numbers in the Welsh uplands, and skylarks, which have declined in huge numbers since the 1970s.\n\"We're worried enough as it is about wildlife,\" said Mr Parry.\n\"We're one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world and wildfires every spring at the worst possible time is a burden that wildlife and the environment just can't cope with.\"\nThe INCC has called for closer oversight of controlled burns by farmers and better monitoring of the impact of wildfires on the environment.\nNatural Resources Wales (NRW) said wildfires were a \"massive issue\", particularly in south Wales, where Welsh government figures showed more than half of wildfires in Wales took place last year.\nBecky Davies, a senior officer at NRW, said: \"In the last three days we've had over 75 fires in the south Wales valleys alone.\n\"We have a lot of hillsides that are linear, the valley side has a lot of bracken, a lot of heathland, grassland and coal spoil and that is the sort of hillside that goes up in flames.\"\nThe environmental impact of wildfires can also be felt more widely.\nWhen it rains after a fire, the newly bare soil and the phosphates that were trapped inside it can wash off into streams and rivers, affecting water quality.\nNumbers of wildfires vary year-on-year depending on when spells of dry weather happen.\nBut figures obtained by the BBC show that in south Wales, grassfires have increased by 1,200% from the same time period last year. \nFrom 1 January to 10 April 2024, there were 34 wildfires in the region, whereas there were 445 over the same dates in 2025.\nIn north Wales, crews have attended 170 fires this year, and Mid Wales Fire and Rescue said it had tackled 772 blazes.\nWildfires are also up in England and Northern Ireland compared to last year, while the fire service in Scotland has issued an extreme wildfire alert covering the whole country.\nStatistics show the majority of wildfires are started deliberately, but they can also be ignited from disposable BBQs or controlled burns that get out of hand.\nIn south Wales, firefighters are going to primary schools to teach children from a young age about the devastating impact.\nAt Pontnewydd Primary School in Cwmbran, staff from South Wales Fire and Rescue  Service and Gwent Police brought along animals like snakes, hedgehogs and foxes for children to meet.\nStation manager Mark Bowditch said his crews saw the damage to wildlife from wildfires first-hand.\n\"We see the death of local wildlife, we see the destruction of their habitat,\" he said.\n\"We accept that some fires can be accidental, but deliberate fire setting is a crime and that's the message we'd like to get out.\"\nAdditional reporting by Dylan Greene.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

Players do not have to be a club member to acquire a handicap which can then be used at any course in the world.\nIn line with scores submitted, golfers are given a 'handicap index' which will provide the appropriate number of shots for the difficulty of the course they are playing. This should enable players of all abilities to play against each other.\nUnder the new system, scores from 'general play', rather than solely from rounds in formal competitions, can be submitted. The arrangement depends on the honesty of golfers to enter scores that reflect their true ability.\n\"The rules of golf and handicapping rely on the integrity of players,\" Moir added. \"And we all need to be prepared to challenge any behaviour that lacks that integrity.\n\"We want golfers to take the same view on the rules of handicapping as they would on the rules of golf.\n\"We know that it is very, very rare for people to seek to play other than in accordance with the rules of golf and we need people to view the rules of handicapping in exactly the same way.\"\nGolfers and club committees are receiving reminders on how the system should be implemented.\n\"We've got a social media and e-newsletter campaign,\" Moir said. \"We at the R&A are collaborating with England Golf, Golf Ireland, Scottish Golf and Wales Golf to address some of these concerns.\n\"The principle purpose of the campaign is to raise awareness among golfers, but also with handicapping committees as to what their own responsibilities are within the rules.\"\nOfficials insist the new system works well and point to growing participation numbers, which are expected to be further boosted by McIlroy's dramatic and inspirational play-off win in Augusta.\nLast year, 14 million handicap cards were submitted in Great Britain and Ireland - up 1.4 million on 2023 - while nine million of those came from competition play.\n\"We want people to return as many general play scores as possible,\" Moir said. \"That's when the new handicap system comes into its own and reflects current form and ability.\"",

        "article_text": "Britain in the 1960s was captivated by the daring of the Great Train Robbery, and the sheer scale of the money stolen. But when the accused men stood trial in April 1964, the judge was determined to send a message that such crimes would not be tolerated. Fourteen years later, several of the convicts talked to the BBC.\nOn 16 April 1964, Robert Welch was one of the 12 men found guilty of a notorious heist in Aylesbury Crown Court. Fourteen years later, in 1978, he was on the BBC's documentary and current affairs programme, Man Alive, and recalled seeing local dignitaries jostle for positions in the courtroom to hear the sentencing. \"This was what they had all come to watch. The climax of the play, the drama,\" Welch said. \"And the medieval setting in which we were sentenced, you know, it was a bit chilling.\"\nWelch and his fellow convicts had fallen a long way since pulling off one of the most audacious and lucrative thefts the UK had ever seen: the Great Train Robbery.\nWelch and his co-defendants were part of a band who held up a Royal Mail night train travelling from Glasgow to London. The robbers had made off with \u00a32.6m in used banknotes, a record haul at that time, and the equivalent of over \u00a350m ($65.8m) today. At the time of Welch's trial, police were still hunting for three of the people they suspected had been involved in the crime.\nTo execute this carefully orchestrated robbery, 15 members of two of London's biggest criminal gangs had worked together, each tasked with a particular role in the plot. \"They were regarded as the elite of the criminal world,\" Reginald Abbiss, who had covered the crime for the BBC as a young reporter, told the Witness History podcast in 2023. \"You had to have a certain talent and audacity, certain abilities to be able to pull a heist of this magnitude and they came together because they needed a multitude of talent.\"\u00a0\nThe daring robbery took place just after 03:00 on 8 August 1963. The first step the criminals had taken was to cut the phone lines to stop an alarm being raised. They then rigged the train signals to stay red. \"They put a glove over the green light, they wired a cheap battery up to the red light and this, of course, meant the driver had to slow up,\" said Abbiss.\nSeeing the red light, the train's driver, Jack Mills, stopped the engine, and his co-driver, David Whitby, climbed out to use the trackside phone to find out what the problem was. That's when Whitby discovered that the line had been cut, and he was set upon by masked men wearing boiler suits. In the meantime, a masked robber burst into the train's cab to restrain the driver. When Mills tried to put up a fight, another gang member hit him over the head, rendering him semi-conscious.\n\"The one glitch, if you like, was the fact that the train driver\u2026 tried to resist,\" said Abbiss. \"One of the robbers hit him on the head with a cosh. A lot of blood and down he went.\"\u00a0\nThe gang had been given inside information that the cash and high-value packages were held in the train's front two coaches. And because it was a Bank Holiday weekend, it would be carrying more money than usual.\nAlthough there weren't any police onboard, there were more than 70 Post Office employees, mostly in the rear carriages, where they were busy sorting letters. The criminals who had already familiarised themselves with the train's operation and layout quickly uncoupled the two money-laden carriages. The plan was to detach them and drive them away from the steep embankment to a predetermined rendezvous where it would be easier to unload the bags of cash.\nIt was then they hit a problem. \"They had a driver to drive the train, he couldn't get the train going, and they had to pull the original driver, Jack Mills, up from the floor and threaten him and say, 'Drive the train,'\" said Abbiss. \"He managed to get the train a mile up the line to where most of the gang were waiting, leaving the other eight or nine coaches with sorters happily sorting, totally unaware that the main part of the train had gone on ahead.\"\nMills, still bleeding profusely, was told to stop the two front carriages at Bridego Bridge. There, the rest of the gang broke into the carriages, overpowering the Post Office staff working in them, and forcing them to lie face down on the floor. They also brought in Mills and Whitby, who were handcuffed together.\n\u00a0\nThe gang had decided that they would give themselves just 15 minutes to unload the loot and then leave whatever money was left. They formed a human chain and swiftly removed 120 sacks containing two-and-a-half tonnes of money into parked Land Rovers. After a quarter of an hour, the crew called time and ordered the terrified Post Office staff to stay still and not to attempt to contact the police for 30 minutes. Then the robbers drove off into the night.\u00a0\nThe boldness of the theft and the enormous sum of money involved captured the British public's imagination. In the weeks that followed, the country was gripped by sensational headlines detailing the police's hunt for the perpetrators. But despite the meticulous nature of the robbery's planning and its skilful execution, within a year the majority of the criminal gang had been rounded up and were facing trial.\n\"Well, at first view, the job was a very well-planned job,\" ex-Det Supt Malcolm Fewtrell, who led investigations into the heist, told BBC News in 1964. \"But in the event, it has been a disaster. They obviously weren't so clever as they thought they were.\"\u00a0\nThe judge at their trial did not view the robbers' actions in the \"romantic\" way some of the public seemed to, saying that it would be \"positively evil\" if he showed the convicted men any semblance of leniency.\n\"I remember a shock wave ran through the courtroom when the judge, a man called Lord Justice Edmund Davies, handed down 307 years in the space of half an hour,\" Abbiss told BBC Witness History in 2023. At the time, the punishments they received for the robbery were some of the harshest in British criminal history, especially since nobody had been killed and no firearms had been used.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\"I was just numbed, I couldn't think of anything but 30 years. When are we going to get out? We are never going to get out,\" one of the robbers, Tommy Wisbey, told Man Alive in 1978.\u00a0\n\"I don't think it really hits you until a couple of days later and you realise what you've got,\" fellow gang member Gordon Goody said to the BBC. \"I mean it was a bit of a joke downstairs, clowning around and all that kind of thing. But deep down, I suppose you were sick.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The British politician who was caught faking his own death\n\u2022 The true story of The Great Escape\n\u2022 The bizarre siege behind Stockholm Syndrome \nThe reason the judge gave for the severity of the prison terms was the assault on Mills. \"Anybody who has seen that nerve-shattered engine driver can have no doubt of the terrifying effect on law-abiding citizens of a concerted assault by armed robbers,\" said Justice Davies at the trial. Mills never worked again and died in 1970 of leukaemia. His co-driver Whitby died of a heart attack the following year at the age of 34.\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\u00a0\nBut there was also a sense, at least among the robbers themselves, that they were being disproportionately punished because the heist had embarrassed the British establishment. One of them, Roy James, said to the BBC in 1978, \"At that moment, all the shame that was with me throughout the trial was lifted because I felt that Mr Edmund Davies then used his position as a High Court judge, used the backing of the state for vengeance. He put himself on a par with me and everything that he said I was.\"\n\"There was a feeling that Justice Davies came down particularly hard for two reasons,\" said Abbiss. \"One was the violence shown against the train driver, and the other was that the establishment, the government, the Post Office and British Rail, the way that they were sort of caught with their pants down. It showed the establishment to be people perhaps who take their eye off the ball.\"\nThe criminals' notoriety only grew following their sentencing when two of the gang made dramatic escapes from prison. Charles Wilson, who had been the treasurer of the group, broke out of jail just four months after the trial. He was recaptured in Canada after four years on the run and served another 10 years behind bars. Ronnie Biggs escaped from London's Wandsworth Prison, 15 months after his sentencing, using a makeshift rope ladder. He underwent plastic surgery and lived at times in Spain, Australia and Brazil, evading arrest for nearly 40 years. In 2001, he voluntarily returned to the UK for medical treatment and served the rest of his prison sentence.\nThe law would also eventually catch up with the three gang members who didn't stand trial that day. Bruce Reynolds, considered to be the robbery's mastermind, spent five years on the run until he was arrested on his return to England. He was sentenced to 25 years in jail, but ended up serving just 10. His son Nick, who spent his early life on the run with his father in Mexico and Canada, would later have his own link to the outlaw lifestyle when his band Alabama 3's song Woke Up This Morning became the opening theme of The Sopranos TV series.\u00a0\nRonald \"Buster\" Edwards, who was later played by Genesis singer Phil Collins in a 1988 film, Buster, fled to Mexico following the robbery. He gave himself up in 1966 and was released after serving nine years. James White, who acted as the quartermaster for the robbery, was caught in Kent and sent to prison\u00a0after three years on the run. He was released in 1975.\u00a0\nDespite the lengthy jail time handed down, all the men convicted of the Great Train Robbery would end up being released early. None served more than 13 years for the crime \u2013 although many of them would return to prison for different offences in the years that followed.\u00a0\nAs for the huge haul stolen during the robbery, despite the police in 1964 offering a 10% share for information that would lead them to it, the majority of the money was never recovered.\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Corner chicken & Rory Delap 2.0 - what's the future of football?\nIf the past decade of English football has one unifying theme it is tactical renewal.\nSince the mid-2010s - and since Antonio Conte, Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp - the Premier League has attracted Europe's best coaches, putting a once sleepy and unsophisticated division at the vanguard of tactical innovation.\nBut we are in a moment of flux. New ideas still flood into the league but nothing, yet, has emerged as the next great theory. As Guardiola treads water at Manchester City we are waiting to find out where the sport goes next.\nHere are some ideas - some quirkier than others - for the future of football.\nPremier League intensity or caution - how will Tuchel's England play?\nWhy Guardiola's tactics stopped working amid rise of rapid football\nEmbracing the chaos - breaking down Bournemouth's rise\nLet's start with one of the weirder ones\u2026 but also one that feeds most directly into where the game seems to be heading.\nA couple of years ago the way Roberto de Zerbi stretched the pitch from goal-kicks was all the rage.\nHe kept five players next to his goalkeeper and stuck five players on the halfway line, emptying central midfield and splitting a confused opposition in two. Brighton would then kick it long, bypassing half the team.\nThis kind of thing might come back again, and certainly long balls are boomeranging back into fashion as the natural antidote to high pressing, short goal-kicks and high defensive lines. A decade of sucking everyone into tight spaces was bound to trigger a counter-reaction of stretching things back out.\nSo, here's a thought for all those high-risk De Zerbi types.\nWhen defending a corner, instead of packing the box with bodies, why not begin a game of chicken and leave four or five on the halfway line?\nThis would create exciting five-on-two long-ball counter-attacking scenarios, or, more likely, force the attacking team to leave five or six players back.\nJust like that you've decluttered the penalty area and, at the elite level, clearing a path for the goalkeeper and creating simpler one-on-one marking could reduce the chances of conceding.\nCorners are in vogue at the moment and the set-piece coach is the new must-have accessory. But maybe we're looking too closely at 'love trains' and marking systems in a messy penalty box.\nIt's within a team's power to free up space and lean into ultra-stretched football. Just don't be chicken.\nThere isn't enough deception in football tactics.\nThere are the 'dark arts' of defending, the dummy and the no-look pass. But where are the Trojan horses, the tactical decoys?\nPlayers are getting more versatile all the time and (most) managers are too, regularly changing formation between matches and within them. In fact, a lot of managers these days would reject the idea of the formation.\nBut there are still basic differences between, say, the 4-3-3 and the 3-4-2-1, and although a lot of coaches are comfortable switching it up based on the game state - moving to a back three to see out the final few minutes of a 1-0 lead, for example - nobody changes formation early in a game.\nAnd nobody is doing it to fool the other manager.\nImagine two teams lining up in similar 4-3-3s, with touchline-hugging wingers and two number eights in front of a defensive midfielder. For the first 10 minutes they feel each other out, getting used to their opponents' patterns.\nThen all of a sudden one team swaps to a 3-4-2-1. The wingers disappear, the three-player triangle in midfield becomes a box-shape four, and the other side has to scramble to keep up.\nFive minutes later, they change back again. Or switch to a third system entirely. It would be chaotic, but the team who planned the switches in training would have a huge advantage in those frantic few minutes of adaptation.\nAnd it could have a huge impact on the game because, at the risk of getting highfalutin, it would require a new way of thinking about time.\nCurrently football people only think about time in quite a limited way: how long we have to hold on to the lead, when the first substitution should be made, when to throw the kitchen sink.\nTime is an attritional dance with the other team, something we react to, the variable that slips through our fingers.\nDecoy formations would require breaking up the game into chunks of time and planning each segment. Once we start thinking this way, the 90 minutes could feel longer and richer - something to seize and control.\nWe watched every Premier League manager - here's what we found out\nWhere do Premier League managers stand during a game?\nThere are about 30 throw-ins per match yet nobody has thought to seek innovation around the most common set-piece in the game - and one with an (inexplicable) detail ready to exploit: no offsides.\nExcept, of course, one man did innovate some 17 years ago. It's just that nobody has thought to copy him.\nA Rory Delap throw arrowing through the sky is one of the Premier League's most iconic images.\nHis throw-ins led to 25 Stoke City goals in his first four seasons at the club, terrifying defences to the extent that on one infamous occasion Hull City goalkeeper Boaz Myhill chose not to clear for touch but boot the ball straight out for a corner.\nAnd yet the technique of Delap's throw-in retired with him.\nThis video can not be played\n'So tough to defend' - Fuller scores from Delap long throw-in\nPresumably there is nothing unique about Delap's musculature that prevents it from being taught to others, so why has it never been repeated? Why hasn't Mikel Arteta - who says he takes comparisons with Tony Pulis' Stoke as \"a compliment\" - brought Delap on to his coaching staff?\nThe most likely explanation is the \"Rick Barry\" phenomenon. Barry retired from the NBA in 1980 as the all-time leader in free-throw shooting percentage, having exclusively used under-arm \"granny throws\", yet nobody has copied his technique. It is seen as childish, uncool, un... basketball.\nShaquille O'Neal, when advised by Barry to \"granny throw\" in response to his poor 52% record, summed up the problem: \"I'd shoot 0% before I'd shoot underhanded.\"\nMaybe a similar phenomenon means Delap's throws are seen as too ugly and too direct - too far outside the elegant philosophies of the elite managers - to be repeated.\nIf so, they ought to loosen up. If someone breaks down that barrier it could lead to a flurry of copycats, permanently turning the throw-in into a corner-like chance and permanently changing how football is played.\nIt would be an exaggeration to say centre-backs have gone unchanged over the past couple of decades.\nChris Wilder's overlapping centre-backs at Sheffield United have led to a pared-back version become commonplace for managers who deploy a back three. England manager Thomas Tuchel, for example, may instruct his outside centre-backs to linger towards the corner of the penalty box.\nBut by and large the position is untouched. And after years of full-backs being redeployed, culminating in Ange Postecoglou using his full-backs as number eights, maybe it's time we give the centre-back new responsibilities.\nThere's nothing new about the marauding centre-back, you might say. Franco Baresi used to break lines some 40 years ago, while in England Rio Ferdinand became renowned for this feature of his game in the 2000s.\nBut we could take this one further.\nCentre-backs, unmarked and untracked, could start to make off-the-ball runs through the lines, slipping unnoticed right up into the forward line and beyond like Destiny Udogie at Tottenham Hotspur.\nIf a full-back shuttled across to cover then there's no reason why powerful centre-backs - better on the ball than ever - can't be freed to become the spare player; the disruptive force that sneaks through the system.\nHarry Kane donned the goalkeeper gloves for Spurs in 2014 - he has the passing range for this role, but you'd want him in the other box...\nOK, wait. Hear us out.\nLiverpool are 1-0 down against League One opposition in the EFL Cup. There are five minutes left on the clock and all 11 opponents are camped in their third.\nGoalkeeper Alisson is now in a quarterback role, sat on the halfway line spraying passes left and right.\nSo, Arne Slot withdraws Alisson to bring on an extra forward and, with an ironic flourish, gives he-needs-to-get-serious-about-his-defending's Trent Alexander-Arnold the goalie gloves.\nTrent stayed behind in training the previous week for a few extra sessions to learn the basics of goalkeeping, even though he's unlikely to do any during his five minutes on the pitch.\nAnd if he is called upon then a) Alexander-Arnold in goal might encourage a wild shot from distance that's easier to gather, or b) would face a four-on-two break that goalkeepers rarely keep out anyway.\nIt sounds mad at first, but the more you think about it... why not? Liverpool lose little while gaining a better quarterback distributor and an extra forward.\nReal tactical innovation requires maverick thinking. Yes, the role of a keeper has already evolved over the past decade, but let's see what Alexander-Arnold can do in goal.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's spate of tariffs that have upended global trade.\nThe suit, which marks the first time a state has sued over the levies, challenges an emergency power Trump cited giving him authority to enact them.\nCalifornia is the world's fifth largest economy - outpacing every US state and most countries - and is home to the largest shares of manufacturing and agricultural production in the US.\nThe White House, which has argued the tariffs are tackling imbalances in international trade, dismissed the lawsuit and said it would continue addressing \"this national emergency that's decimating America's industries\". \n\"Instead of focusing on California's rampant crime, homelessness, and unaffordability, Gavin Newsom is spending his time trying to block President Trump's historic efforts to finally address the national emergency of our country's persistent goods trade deficits,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said. \nNewsom and the state's Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the lawsuit at a news conference at an almond farm - one of the biggest crops California produces.\nNearly 82% of the world's almonds come from the Golden State.

The Reds went top of the table in September and have remained there ever since - bar one week in October.\nThe relegation places look equally sewn up. Southampton are already down, while Leicester and Ipswich are 17 and 14 points adrift of safety respectively with six games remaining.\nThat relative lack of intrigue - contrasted with the thrill of Champions League knockout football - has got people asking if the Premier League is boring...\nHas 'micro-managed' Premier League become boring?\nJump down to the Championship, however, and it is a different picture.\nLeeds and Burnley are locked on 88 points at the top, with Sheffield United five points adrift in third.\nFourth-placed Sunderland are all but certain of a play-off spot, but the remaining two spots are up for grabs, with 11 points separating fifth-placed Bristol City and 14th-placed Wednesday.\nAt the bottom, Plymouth and Luton are level on points, with Cardiff only two points better off and Derby one point above safety.\n\"The Championship should be considered one of the best leagues in Europe,\" Derby fan writer Amelia told BBC Sport.\n\"OK, you don't tend to have \u00a3100m stars gracing the pitch every week, but you always seem to get box-office drama and entertainment.\n\"It is the underdog division, with arguably the greatest entertainment value in the world.\"\nPremier League parachute payments have often been accused of distorting competition in the Championship.\nIn the past 10 seasons half of relegated teams (15 of 30) have bounced straight back to the Premier League.\nAlthough recently relegated Leeds, Burnley and Sheffield United look well placed for an immediate return, Luton - who went down last season - are in danger of dropping into League One.\nOver the past decade 14 teams in this year's Championship have spent time in the top tier, while no team has spent more than 10 years in the division.

European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen recognises that and they have been speaking regularly ahead of the trip.\nTrump and Meloni famously enjoy a good relationship and have lavished praise on one another in the past. He has called her a \"fantastic woman\" who has \"really taken Europe by storm\".\nFor her part, Meloni \u2013 who has headed a right-wing coalition government since 2022 - is ideologically closer to Trump than to some of her European neighbours. \nIn a video message to a US conservative conference in February, she echoed some of Trump's common talking points, railing against mass migration, \"globalist elites\" and \"woke ideology\". \nShe was also the only European leader to attend the US president's inauguration in January, and has steered clear of overtly criticising the work of his administration since.\nThe harshest criticism she has dispensed was earlier this month, when she said Trump's decision to impose 20% tariffs on the EU was \"absolutely wrong\" and that it would end up damaging the EU \"as much as the US\".\n\"Meloni has always said that Europe shouldn't take any decisions that put it on a collision course with the US, and that Europe should adapt rather than resist,\" said Riccardo Alcaro of the Italian Institute for International Affairs in Rome.\n\"If the Trump administration is immovable on tariffs, she'll agree to counter-tariffs. But her first move is always to say no. Because ultimately she thinks the importance of the West in the world is thanks to the US, and that the West revolves around the US.\"\nMeloni's world view is also closer to that of many of Trump's main allies than many of her European neighbours.\n\"She knows that Italy is strategically, politically and economically subordinate to the EU \u2013 but she also has a genuine proximity to MAGA Republicans,\" Alcaro added.\nUS Vice-President JD Vance is due to travel to Rome on Friday for Easter, and will see Meloni as well as leading officials at the Vatican.\nMeloni's natural affinity to an administration many in Europe are having trouble finding common ground with has sparked concern among some Europeans that, in the privacy of the Oval Office, she may be tempted to go at it alone and argue for more favourable terms for Italy.\nLast week France's Industry Minister Marc Ferracci spoke out against \"bilateral talks\" and warned Trump's strategy was to \"divide Europeans\". \nHis comments irritated Rome and had to be toned down later by a French government spokesperson.\nThe European Commission has signalled it has confidence in Meloni, and a spokeswoman said \"any outreach to the US [was] very welcome\". \nHowever, the spokeswoman also said Meloni's trip was being \"closely coordinated\" with the institutions, and underlined that handling trade policy was a job for the EU. \nThe EU negotiates on behalf of all member states, and no single country can negotiate lower tariffs for its own benefit. \nMeloni's team appears clear on this and Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said that Meloni \"isn't going to negotiate for Italy against Europe but is going to champion a European stance\".\nUltimately the Italian leader's mission may be to emphasise to Trump that the EU is keen to reach a zero-tariff agreement and commit to buying American \u2013 especially when it comes to defence and liquified natural gas (LNG).\nAnd, in more hushed tones, she may also tell him that Europe is in no rush to make any deals with China. \n\"I don't know how public this will be but I think there will be some anti-China discourse as an incentive for the US administration,\" Riccardo Alcaro said.\nAt home, party allies were singing Meloni's praises before her plane to Washington even left the ground. \n\"This meeting shows Giorgia Meloni's courage and stature,\" said Brothers of Italy (FdI) MP Augusta Montarulli - although Senator Giovanbattista Fazzolari, somewhat less encouragingly, warned the trip would be \"full of potential pitfalls\". \nAnd centre-left opposition parties took the opportunity to berate Meloni's proximity to the Trump administration. \n\"I have a feeling that upon her return Meloni will be flying the Trump flag rather than Italy's or Europe's,\" said Peppe Provenzano of the Democratic Party (PD). \n\"I hope to be proven wrong.\"\nAt an awards ceremony in Rome on Tuesday, Meloni addressed a room packed with entrepreneurs and business leaders \u2013 the very same who stand to lose the most from Trump's tariffs.\nLooking ahead to her trip to Washington, she chuckled nervously.\n\"As you can imagine,\" she joked, \"I'm feeling no pressure at all.\"",

Then numerous television interviews, the media in the sumptuous press building.\nThen to the clubhouse, where he joined club members in the Grill Room to discuss the dramatic preceding hours that had captivated the sporting world. And then more television interviews.\nEventually he emerged into an adjacent room where we had been waiting - BBC Northern Ireland's Stephen Watson and RTE's Greg Allen - colleagues with whom I've shared so much time covering McIlroy's extraordinary career.\nAs he entered the room, the new Masters champion saw us waiting, puffed out his cheeks, leaned forward resting his elbows on the back of a sofa and gave us a look that said it all.\nWordlessly his eyes said: \"Can you believe what has happened? What is happening?\"\nThis video can not be played\nMcIlroy wins Masters play-off to complete career Grand Slam\nThe jacket was a perfect fit, a deeper green than you might imagine and in that moment came the realisation that he had actually done it. The burden had lifted, never again would we be able to ask the questions that had nagged him for more than a decade.\nNow, aged 35, he is an all-time great. Indisputably. He sits alongside Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Ben Hogan and Gene Sarazen - the only male golfers to have won all four of the tournaments that matter most.\nThe Grand Slam eluded some of golf's greatest names; Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson, Lee Trevino, Seve Ballesteros, Sir Nick Faldo and Phil Mickelson.\nNow with five majors, McIlroy moves alongside Ballesteros and trails Faldo by one.  Given that he is the first man from the continent to complete the Slam, Northern Ireland's sporting superstar might have eclipsed Faldo.\nIt could be argued that way, given McIlroy's 28 PGA Tour victories including two Players Championships. Outside his three Masters and three Open titles, Faldo won only three other events that count on the PGA Tour.\nBut it would be churlish to say either way, comparing eras is a fool's errand. What can be said is that McIlroy is in the conversation for being Europe's greatest men's golfer.\nAnd now he has shed a family of gorillas from his back he will be unburdened for future majors. The next one is at Quail Hollow, where he has enjoyed so much success in PGA Tour events.\nThen it's the US Open, a championship he has narrowly missed winning in the past two years, before The Open at Royal Portrush in his native Northern Ireland. Opportunities abound in 2025.\nWhat does McIlroy get for Masters triumph?\nHow coping with 'heartbreak' changed everything for McIlroy \nMasters & Slam success will 'free me up' - McIlroy\nMcIlroy's golfing talent is beyond question. The same could not be said of his temperament because of the weighty burden of an 11-year wait for his fifth major win.\nThe Masters was the biggest hurdle.

        "article_text": "The sweltering heat during Buddhist New Year calls for Thailand's cooling khao chae, a fragrant and refreshing bowl of rice delicately scented with flowers.\nBy the time Songkran, Thailand's new year based on the Buddhist calendar, arrives in April, the temperatures in the Southeast Asian country are soaring. The sky is typically blue and spotless, so reprieve under the shade of a passing cloud is non-existent while the humidity is as thick as a fleece blanket. One way to cool off is in the country-wide water fights that take place during the annual celebrations (this year from 13-15 April), which include water guns, buckets and coloured powder smeared onto the face like war paint. Another way to celebrate and cool off is to eat khao chae.\nKhao chae (soaked rice) is an icy, seasonal treat that marks the beginning of summer in Thailand. The history of the dish can be traced back hundreds of years to the Mon people, an ethnic group that originated throughout Myanmar and Thailand and integrated into what was then Siamese society in the 16th Century.\n[jump to recipe]\n\"The form of khao chae that we're looking at right now, especially in Bangkok, has very little resemblance to the Mon khao chae,\" says Leela Punyaratabandhu, a Thai scholar and the author of the 2017 cookbook Bangkok, which includes a recipe for khao chae. In the 16th Century, the soaked rice porridge was served in terracotta pots to keep the dish cold because ice wasn't readily available. The accompanying side dishes were also not nearly as intricate as they would eventually become.\nIt was within the kingdom of Siam's royal family, dating back to King Rama IV's rule in the 19th Century, that the dish blossomed into something far more complex \u2013 a metamorphosis of its humble origins. A lot of effort was made to ensure that khao chae looked visually beautiful, so side dishes included delicately carved vegetables shaped into flowers. In addition, ice, which was impossible for commoners to get at the time, distinguished kaho chae as an exclusively royal dish.\nThe recipe that exists now has been passed down through generations of royal cooks and aristocratic families. The dish starts by vigorously washing jasmine rice to remove all the starch. \"You have to wash the rice more than regular steamed rice so it doesn't stick together when cooked,\" explains Max Wittawat, the executive chef of New York City's Bangkok Supper Club. Wittawat grew up in Bangkok and was taught to make khao chae by culinary artist and teacher Jantararat Hemvej, who is known in Bangkok for having perfected khao chae.\nSince the rice also needs to withstand being soaked for long periods without falling apart, which would render the dish cloudy, washing it is especially important. After it's steamed, the rice is submerged in ice water that's perfumed with the scent of flowers, ranging from jasmine, ylang ylang, damask roses and bread flowers. \"It's a mark of summer when the flowers bloom,\" adds Wittawat.\nPunyaratabandhu has childhood memories of her grandfather using a spreadsheet to track the specific times that the flowers bloomed in his garden. \"All of this was very systematic,\" she says. It's important to pick the flowers at the precise time \u2013 typically the evening before preparing khao chae \u2013 in order to achieve the optimal fragrance. From there, the flowers are submerged in water for at least two hours to imbue their aroma.\u00a0\nEven the process of soaking the flowers is very intentional. If the flowers are left in the water for too long, they will bruise and go bad, leaving the water with a pungent and off-putting flavour. If they aren't steeped long enough, the bouquet will not be impactful enough to stand up to the side dishes served alongside khao chae. To enhance the dish's fragrance even further, a Thai culinary candle known as tian op may be used to smoke the flowery water.\nAnd that's just the base of the dish. Khao chae is an experience that includes many elaborate accoutrements. \"It's not only hard to make, but it's hard to eat as well,\" says Punyaratabandhu. This is because there are a lot of pungent, salty and fishy flavours that could be unfamiliar to some. \"Shrimp paste balls mixed with fish and then dipped in egg and fried? It's a far cry from pad see ew [stir-fried noodles].\"\nWhen Punyaratabandhu began writing her cookbook, she struggled with whether or not she should include a recipe for khao chae, knowing how impractical and challenging the dish can be to prepare at home. \"I knew it was going to be a tough sell, but also it's a part of Bangkok,\" she explains. \"My job was to be faithful to whatever is happening in Bangkok.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A rice dish with 'sexual power'\n\u2022 The 3,000-year-old new year's celebration\n\u2022 The Thai noodles eaten for breakfast\nEven Wittawat admits that khao chae, outside of the aristocratic society of Bangkok, was not really in Thailand's zeitgeist until the past 10 years, when many chefs began reflecting on their Thai heritage and exploring culturally significant and historical dishes. \"Before that, it was very old school and not common in restaurants,\" he says. \"But nowadays, with technology, the flowers can bloom throughout the year, and it has risen so much in popularity.\"\u00a0\nRecently, khao chae has become a social media darling due to its myriad side dishes, like shrimp paste dumplings, elaborately carved vegetables, stuffed shallots and peppers, sweetened beef and pork jerky and delicate egg nests. It's visually stunning, especially when served in traditional Thai pots or tiffins. \"Sometimes, it's too pretty to eat,\" Wittawat says.\nThere is a particular way to enjoy the dish to avoid muddying the crystal-clear flower-scented water. \"You're not supposed to put all the condiments with the rice,\" Wittawat says. Instead, you should alternate eating the rice and side dishes. Vegetables and pickles can cut through the heavier flavours of sweetened beef and salty shrimp paste. \"This is the fun thing about khao chae,\" Wittawat says, acknowledging that the various flavours work in tandem to keep the meal fresh and exciting. \"You can continue eating more and more.\"\nWittawat is happy that khao chae, once exclusive to the royal family and upper echelon of Thai society, is now more readily available and accessible to everyone \u2013 especially during Songkran, when Thailand is so hot. \"Thai people are returning to their roots,\" he says. \"They're appreciating their history and culture.\nKhao chae recipe\nby Max Wittawat\nServes 8\nThis is a general overview of how to make the rice for khao chae, along with two side dishes. Feel free to include additional sides to your liking.\nIngredients\n1 qt jasmine rice\nFlower-scented water (see Note)\nFor the shrimp paste balls:\n300g grilled catfish\n250g coconut milk\n200g coconut sugar \n100g fish sauce\n100g shrimp paste\n100g lemongrass\n100g lesser ginger or fingeroot\n100g garlic cloves\n100g shallots\n100g coriander root or stem\n50g pounded dried shrimp\n50g toasted desiccated coconut\n1 tbsp black peppercorns, ground \nsalt (to taste)\nbeaten eggs, for coating\n1 qt canola oil\nFor the stuffed green peppers:\n50g coriander root or stem\n50g garlic cloves\n10g white peppercorns\n250g pork mince\n100g minced shrimp\n1 tbsp sugar\n1 tsp salt\n8 green peppers, seeded and cored from the top (leave the peppers whole)\n2 chicken eggs\n1 duck egg\nMethod\nStep 1\nRinse the jasmine rice in water 4 to 5 times. Cook the rice in boiling water until half-cooked, then strain. Wash the rice in water again, using your hands to rub the rice; rinse and repeat until the water becomes clear. Transfer the rice to a steamer and steam until fully cooked. Let cool.\nStep 2\nTo make the shrimp balls, blend all the ingredients (except the eggs and oil) in a blender until smooth. Pour into a large nonstick frying pan and cook until thick paste forms. Let cool slightly, then roll into small balls.\nStep 3\nHeat the oil in a medium pot. Dip the shrimp balls into beaten eggs, then deep-fry until golden brown. Set aside. (Reserve the oil for the green peppers.)\nStep 4\nPound the coriander, garlic and peppercorns in a mortar with a pestle until smooth, then mix with the minced pork and shrimp. Season with sugar and salt. Stuff the mixture into the green peppers. Set the peppers into a steamer and steam for 10mins.\nStep 5\nTo make the egg net,\u00a0reheat the oil in the pot. Beat all the eggs together and strain through a sieve. Dip 5 fingers in the beaten eggs and shake into the pot of heated oil left to right, then up and down to form an egg net. When the eggs turn golden brown, transfer the egg net to a kitchen towel and place the steamed stuffed peppers on top, then roll the egg net around the peppers.\u00a0Repeat with the remaining peppers.\nStep 6\nSpoon the steamed rice into bowls and pour the cold scented over it. Enjoy the khao chae with the shrimp balls and stuffed peppers, as well as sliced cucumber, green mango, scallion and lesser ginger.\u00a0\nNote\nTo make the scented water, steep jasmine, ylang-ylang (\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e14\u0e31\u0e07\u0e07\u0e32) and chommanard (\u0e0a\u0e21\u0e19\u0e32\u0e14) flowers with drinking water and (if using) smoke with a Thai aromatic candle (\u0e40\u0e17\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e2d\u0e21) overnight.

It's also the nation's sole producer of artichokes, figs, olives, walnuts and raisins.\nNewsom argued California has been \"disproportionately affected\" by the tariffs and that's why the state, which has already filed 15 lawsuits against Trump since January, would lead the charge against the levies - which currently are 10% on most countries and 145% on China. \n\"That's our state of mind,\" the governor said. \"That's why we're asserting ourselves on behalf of 40 million Americans.\"\nThe lawsuit challenges Trump evoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to enact the tariffs, arguing the act had never been used for such levies and such powers rest with the US Congress. \nThe lawsuit cites multiple times from rulings by the US Supreme Court against the Biden administration in its quest to forgive student debt, noting the high court called Biden's manoeuvres a \"transformative expansion\" of presidential authority. \nNewsom said if the Supreme Court is \"consistent, then this lawsuit is a lock\" for the state. \nThe act has never been used to issue tariffs by any president, congressional research shows. \nWhile California is the first state to file legal action against the Trump administration over the levies, several other lawsuits filed by small businesses and a civil rights group have similarly challenged Trump's authority on the matter. \nSince Trump's inauguration in January there has been a flurry of announcements on tariffs.\nThe US president says the import taxes will encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised, and lead to huge levels of investment in the country.\nCritics argue that bringing manufacturing back to the US is complicated and could take decades and that the economy will struggle in the meantime.\nTrump has also backtracked on many of his announcements.\nJust hours after steep levies against roughly 60 of America's trading partners kicked in earlier this month, Trump announced a 90-day pause on those tariffs to all countries except China, in the face of mounting opposition from politicians and the markets.",

        "article_text": "The life, loss and legacy of Kevin Campbell\nKevin Campbell was the all-action, hard-grafting centre-forward who delighted football fans with great goals across a 19-year career at the top of the game.\nAffectionately known as Super Kev at Arsenal, Nottingham Forest and Everton, he developed a reputation as one of the hardest-to-handle forwards in the country, while his beaming smile and joyous celebrations made him one of English football's most popular characters.\n\"I think if you ask anyone who's ever been in the presence of him, they'll always remember him and speak about how good a person he was,\" says Campbell's son Tyrese, 25, who plays as a striker for Sheffield United. \"He carried the whole room - you knew when he was in there because you could probably hear him.\n\"He was a respectful, happy, positive person. You could even say almost too good for this Earth. A proper angel sent from heaven.\"\nIn 2024 Kevin Campbell's life was tragically cut short after he suffered a serious illness, and an investigation was launched into concerns over his care.\nAfter his inquest concluded on Monday, this is the story of Campbell's life, loss and legacy, told by those who knew him best.\nThe Life, Loss and Legacy of Kevin Campbell\n15/4/2025\nCampbell will eventually raise his own family in the north-west, but is born in south London in 1970, the second youngest of seven children in a family with Jamaican roots.\n\"We were brought up by a single mother so resources were extremely tight,\" Campbell's younger sister Lorna says. \"We used to play tennis against a back wall because we couldn't afford to hire a court. Kevin wanted to be in different football teams and it was a struggle for my mother to pay all the subs.\n\"We had three big brothers and he was never afraid to play football with them and their friends - he would just take them on. And this was on the mean streets of Brixton. That's when he came alive.\"\nKevin and his sister Lorna grew up playing sport together on the streets of Brixton\nCampbell begins to feel unwell. His symptoms are generic \u2013 tiredness, loss of appetite, a decrease in weight.\nDespite insisting that family and friends need not worry, in the following months he has multiple stays in hospitals in Greater Manchester. His appearance changes as he becomes visibly weaker. Doctors are unsure what is causing Campbell's symptoms.\nAccording to an eventual inquest, he is discharged in March 2024 after \"responding well to treatment\".\nWorld Football: The life, loss and legacy of Kevin Campbell\n15/4/2025\nThis video can not be played\n'He carried a whole room' - Family & friends pay tribute to Campbell\nCampbell's natural talent means he is scouted by multiple professional clubs in London, and he chooses to sign a youth deal at Arsenal.\n\"When I joined Arsenal at 16, he was a young kid, about nine,\" says Paul Davis, a midfielder with the Gunners between 1980 and 1995. \"That's when I started to hear his name \u2013 people saying 'this guy is scoring plenty of goals'.\n\"Then he came up to train with the first team. We see this big guy - six foot one, 17, wide, his legs are so thick and chunky. And everyone's thinking, 'Wow, no wonder he's scoring goals'. He was just knocking everybody over. We had people like Kenny Sansom, Viv Anderson - senior internationals - and when they saw Kevin coming over they would be like 'oh no' because they knew he would embarrass them in training.\n\"When I first came through I was the only black player at Arsenal. You've got to remember the culture of the country meant it was OK to tell off-colour jokes. So if you had somebody that was in the struggle with you, then it made it easier.\n\"Kevin would always challenge things in a way that didn't end up with a fight. He was able to do it and they thought, 'actually, should I be saying this, or should I be doing this?'\"\nCampbell was scouted by teams across London, but had supported Arsenal since his early childhood, and joined the Gunners as a teenager\nAndy Cole, the fourth top goalscorer in Premier League history, begins playing alongside Campbell when both are coming through the youth ranks at Arsenal. The pair combine in a successful FA Youth Cup campaign, and become friends.\n\"Unbelievable strength and power,\" Cole says of Campbell's style. \"He was quick as well. And to be fair Kevin didn't have to be aggressive, because the size of him meant people feared him anyway. I think everyone enjoyed playing with him due to the fact that he worked so hard for his team.\"\nAfter making his first-team debut in 1988, Campbell wins two league titles as well as the FA Cup, League Cup, and European Cup Winners' Cup in a seven-year spell with the Gunners in which his joyous goal celebrations and gregarious character make him a fan favourite.\n\"Kevin had a larger than life personality,\" Cole says. \"He could walk into a room and light it up - life and soul of the party.\n\"I remember one night Kevin took me out, we had a good laugh. Unfortunately for me I was in the next day and Kevin had the day off. We were doing stand runs at Highbury. Man, I couldn't raise a gallop.\n\"I remember [Arsenal youth-team coach] Pat Rice saw Kevin and said, 'Kevin! Did you take Coley out last night?' Kevin was like 'Pfft, nah, I don't know what you're talking about, Pat.' I was just laughing\u2026 if Pat ever knew.\"\nCampbell's condition worsens and he begins a long stay in Manchester Royal Infirmary. He has lost over half his body weight.\nFriends and family become aware that his illness is more serious than first believed.\nHis friend Jason Lavelle says: \"When I went to see him, I met his brothers beforehand and they did prep me for the fact that he had lost a lot of weight, that he wouldn't look the same as what I remember him as. And that was the case.\n\"In my mind's mind I was still thinking 'this is Kevin, Super Kevin, and he is seriously ill but he is still going to pull through this.\"\nCole explains: \"I got a phone call from someone saying 'Coles, just letting you know that Kevin's not very well'.\n\"I knew mentally I couldn't see him like that. I just\u2026 I couldn't bring myself to see Kev in that state after knowing him being fit, strong.\"\nEventually, the cause of Campbell's illness is discovered. He is suffering from infective endocarditis, an infection in the inner lining of the heart or its valves which affects one in 30,000 people in the UK.\n\"It's often very difficult to diagnose,\" says Dr Debbie Harrington, consultant aortic surgeon at Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital.\n\"Often patients will present with very non-specific symptoms that have gone on for months. They won't necessarily be seen by a specialist in cardiology who is going to think of the right diagnosis.\"\n\"When we have problems where patients sadly don't make it, often it's because they get to us too late - that is usually the reason why patients don't survive.\n\"Overall in the general medical community I would say there is probably a lack of awareness of infective endocarditis - we know that it is actually on the increase. Definitely awareness is a big, big factor.\"\nAfter leaving Arsenal to play for Nottingham Forest in 1995, striking up a lethal striker partnership with Pierre van Hooijdonk, Campbell spends a brief spell with Trabzonspor in Turkey.\nBut Campbell is racially abused by the club's president after signing, and seven months later moves back to the Premier League, joining Everton. There, he becomes the club's first black captain, scores crucial goals to keep the Toffees in the top flight, and mentors a young Wayne Rooney.\n\"He was an inspiration, really,\" Rooney says. \"Everton were struggling for a few years and he galvanised the whole club.\n\nCampbell's influence on a young Rooney had a marked impact\n\"He helped me a lot - always talking to me throughout the game. As a young player you're still learning, figuring out how to try and play the game, how to be in the right positions.\n\"You see him play, you see his strengths, but actually playing with him he was a lot cleverer than I thought he was. Back then it was big man, small man up front. Obviously he was the big man and I was running off him - I did a lot of running for him!\"\nCampbell sets up his own record label, 2 Wikid, and after playing for West Brom and Cardiff, he retires in 2007, embarking on a career in punditry and broadcasting.\nInfective endocarditis can be treated with antibiotics if diagnosed early. But the struggle for diagnosis in Campbell's case means the infection has worsened, leading to kidney issues, a stroke and eventually fatal multi-organ failure. He dies on 15 June.\n\"I was the one that got the call from the hospital to say that Kevin wasn't going to make it, that he was having difficulty breathing,\" Lorna says. \"That was at five o'clock in the morning. Then it was my job to call the rest of the family and tell everybody the news. Those early days when Kevin passed were very, very difficult.\"\nKevin coached his sons Kyle (left) and Tyrese (right), before both went on to become footballers\nTyrese says: \"Without saying it to each other, we knew it was coming. I'd say we prepared. We're our Dad's kids, so we've got his strength. We were relieved eventually when the day did come - he wasn't in pain any more and we were at peace with that. I knew he wouldn't have wanted to be that way and he could just rest.\"\nCampbell's second son Kyle plays as a striker for Bootle FC.\n\"It's hard on the mind as well when you see someone so fit, so powerful, so loving, and you're looking at him like 'that's not him',\" he says. \"We never really lied to each other, never said 'he's going to come back perfect', because sometimes in life, it doesn't go your way.\"\nNews of Campbell's death is made public, shocking fans and former team-mates.\nRooney says: \"It was a massive loss for everyone in football, but for me personally obviously playing with him and knowing him as a person, I was devastated.\"\nCampbell's popularity among team-mates was strong at every club he played for\nManchester NHS Foundation Trust announces an investigation into the quality of care Campbell received in the run-up to his death. It is a Level 5 investigation, the most serious category. At the same time, an inquest is opened at Manchester Coroner's Court.\n\"When someone passes away you just want to be able to grieve knowing that it's happened, that it's disappointing it's happened, but it ends there,\" Cole says. \"When you start hearing that there could possibly be this, possibly that, that just hurts even more.\"\nFor Campbell's sons, the investigation is rendered unimportant by the scale of their loss.\n\"It can do whatever, but it's not going to bring him back, so I don't see the point in me investing my effort and energy,\" Tyrese says. \"For me, it wasn't really going to change anything, so there's not much point.\"\nThe investigation determines that Campbell's death was \"possibly avoidable but not very likely\".\nThe inquest, overseen by the coroner and including evidence given by two doctors involved in Campbell's care, finds that he died of natural causes and adds that \"missed opportunities\" to correctly diagnose Campbell did \"not more than minimally contribute to his death on the balance of probabilities\".\nThe scrutiny over Campbell's death and the handling of his illness comes against a backdrop of wider concern about standards of care in the NHS.\n\"I think because of the significant financial trouble the NHS is in we have seen a marked decline in the quality of patient care,\" says Dr Luke Munford, senior lecturer in health economics at the University of Manchester.\n\"The NHS recommends that 90% of cardiac patients are seen within an 18-week timeframe. In Manchester at the moment that is 54%.\"\n\"Manchester receives about \u00a32.6bn per year, which sounds like a lot, but when you divide that through by the population it serves it actually isn't a great deal of money at all.\n\"England does suffer from a postcode lottery. People in the north, even if they have substantial personal wealth, are at the mercy of the local health and care system.\n\"If we look at budget cuts, austerity hit areas like Manchester much worse than areas in the south-east of England.\" Dr Munford adds that he is concerned there would be more examples of cases like Campbell's, where complex illnesses go undiagnosed.\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson tells the BBC: \"Kevin Campbell was a huge inspiration, and our deepest sympathies are with his family and friends.\n\"This government is overhauling our NHS so it works for all patients, no matter where they live and our fundamental shift from sickness to prevention will be vital in tackling health inequalities, making people healthier and reducing pressure on the NHS.\n\"Under our Plan for Change, we are also prioritising patient safety and investing an extra \u00a326 billion in the NHS to cut waiting lists and save lives.\"\nA spokesperson for Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust says: \"We once again offer our deep condolences to the family and friends of Mr Campbell for their very great loss. It is clear from the inquest that everyone did their best to care for him, and there is no evidence that Mr Campbell's death could have been avoided.\n\"We are committed to constantly improving the quality of care we provide to our patients. Whilst there are aspects of Mr Campbell's care that could have been improved, the Coroner has found that these did not more than minimally contribute to his sad death. We have already taken learning from Mr Campbell's care and made improvements across the Trust, and we are committed to ongoing learning and improvement for all our patients.\"\nCampbell undertook regular charitable work during his life, and following his death his family sets up a foundation in his name which aims to improve the lives of young people by supporting them with funding, projects and activities.\n\"The Kevin Campbell Foundation is an extension of Kevin,\" Lorna says. \"It allows us to celebrate Kevin as the footballer, and the amazing achievements he managed over 20 years as a footballer, but it also allows us to discover Kevin the man.\"\nCole and Davis are among the Foundation's ambassadors.\n\"For someone who put themselves out for me so much when I was younger, it's the least of things I could have done,\" Cole says. \"He was a selfless individual, always prepared to try and help.\nEverton and Arsenal fans paid tribute to Campbell during the Premier League game between the clubs at Goodison Park on 5 April\nThe wisdom Campbell imparted on his sons will continue to have an impact on their careers.\n\"He always told us how proud he was of us and how well we're doing,\" says Tyrese. \"When he was ill it was 'just keep going, keep doing what we're doing, and keep being you'.\"\n\"I've had players coming up to me saying 'sorry to hear about your dad', 'you're doing really well' and stuff. It's nice because he was so loved and so respected.\"\nFor Cole, the loss of Campbell has hit hard, but the memories they shared together are a great comfort.\n\"As we say, we're not here for a long time, we're here for a good time,\" Cole beams. \"And I can sit here and say - Kevin had a good time. He definitely had a good time.\"",

        "article_text": "Saudi Arabian Grand Prix\nVenue: Jeddah Dates: 18-20 April Race start: 18:00 BST on Sunday\nCoverage: Live radio commentary of practice, qualifying and race online and BBC 5 Sports Extra; live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app\nMcLaren's Oscar Piastri closed in on team-mate Lando Norris in the championship standings by winning Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix. \nFormula 1 now heads to Saudi Arabia for the last race of a triple-header, from 18-20 April.\nBefore that, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions.\nAfter two calm, controlled victories compared to Lando Norris' inconsistencies, is Oscar Piastri favourite for the drivers' championship? - Monty\nIt is, as Piastri said himself after winning in Bahrain on Sunday, way too early to make any conclusions about the way the championship will go.\nWhat can be said is that Piastri has had an assured start to the season, and at the moment appears the stronger of the two McLaren drivers.\nLando Norris won in Australia, but Piastri was right with him until his unfortunate moment on the grass in the late shower of rain.\nPiastri was then excellent in China, probably quicker than Norris in Japan but messed up his final qualifying lap, and was superb in Bahrain.\nNorris, meanwhile, admits to struggling with the McLaren car at the moment and had a scrappy weekend in Bahrain.\nWe explored the dynamic between the McLaren drivers, in the context of Norris' current struggles, in our post-race analysis piece.\nMcLaren have in the pipeline a development that they hope will solve the problem Norris is having with the car's lack of front grip in mid-corner. If it works, it could be him who moves into the lead position in McLaren, as he was last season.\nIt certainly seems as things stand as if the title fight is between the two of them. As Piastri said on Sunday, a consistent challenger to McLaren has not emerged.\nIn Australia and Japan it was Max Verstappen. In China and Bahrain, George Russell's Mercedes was next best, and of course Lewis Hamilton won the Shanghai sprint in the Ferrari.\nBut it is early days. The first round of upgrades has not emerged yet and that could make a big difference - look at how McLaren's Miami upgrade transformed their season last year.\nAnd unlike last year, one driver has not created a massive lead in the championship, so it does remain a lot more open than in 2024 at this stage of the season.\nLando Norris moved up from sixth on the grid to third on the first lap in Bahrain and was given a five-second penalty for a false start. Given the advantage he gained, is a five-second penalty enough of a deterrent? \u2013 John\nIt's true that Lando Norris did not appear to lose out too much from his penalty. \nHe managed to retain his de facto third position at the first round of pit stops and was not that much further behind George Russell's Mercedes once the race had settled down again than he had been before the penalty was served.\nBut that is just a brief snapshot that does not fully reflect the impact of the penalty.\nYou have to bear in mind that strategy played a part here, and so did the relative pace of the cars.\nNorris stopped two laps before Russell, and the undercut is always very powerful in Bahrain because of the track's extreme demands on tyres. That in itself would have gained Norris time - he'd probably have emerged ahead of Russell after the pit stops without the penalty.\nAnd once Charles Leclerc had stopped seven laps later in the Ferrari, he was in a position with a tyre advantage to pass Norris and push him down to fourth place.\nThe race then unfolded as it did with the safety car.\nBear in mind, too, that the McLaren is the fastest car in the field, which will have helped Norris make up any lost ground.\nIt would be wrong to tailor penalties to the speed of someone's car or try to second-guess race situations. The penalty should be the penalty, and whatever happens afterwards happens.\nLewis Hamilton is 42 points behind drivers' championship leader Lando Norris\nWhy do you think Lewis Hamilton is struggling so much with Ferrari? \u2013 Simon\nLet's take a step back and give this some perspective. \nIn qualifying, Hamilton is 3-2 down so far to Charles Leclerc at an average deficit of 0.166 seconds.\nGiven Leclerc is regarded as perhaps the fastest driver over one lap in the entire sport, that's not too shabby for someone who is finding his way with a new team, even if it is Lewis Hamilton. Bear in mind, too, that Hamilton struggled in qualifying against George Russell at Mercedes last year.\nIn the championship, Hamilton is seven points behind Leclerc after four grands prix and a sprint.\nThen there is the fact that Ferrari themselves have not had the start to the season they wanted.\nThey expected to continue where they left off at the end of 2024, but McLaren have made more progress and have a significant advantage. Ferrari are in the mix with Red Bull and Mercedes behind them.\nOf course, Hamilton has high standards and he expects to be the leading Ferrari driver. He may or may not ever achieve that, but this is what he said after the race in Bahrain about this adaptation to the car and team.\n\"A much more positive day,\" Hamilton said. \"The middle stint, I felt really aligned with the car. The balance finally was in a spot where my driving style seemed to be working in that moment. We learned a lot this weekend, actually. More than the other weekends.\n\"The key is to try to get back to it every weekend. The car really does require a different driving style and I am slowly adjusting to that. And also set-up - I have been a bit all over the place, a long way from Charles the past two weekends and slowly migrating towards him.\n\"It just feels so alien. We all get stuck in our ways. (I thought) I needed to keep driving the way I was driving and make the car come to me, but it's not working. \n\"So I am adjusting myself now to the car. It drives so much different with all the controls we have. You have to use them a lot different to what I had in the past.\n\"Just one example is I never used engine braking before. Here you use a lot of engine braking to turn the car. They are much different brakes to what I had in the past. In the last stint I had to use the rears to turn the car, and other times you have to put all the weight on the front.\n\"Qualifying is not good enough but if I get the car where it was in that middle stint, and start delivering qualifying, fix that, I will have better weekends.\n\"I will keep trying. I will get there eventually.\"\nWhat's the fascination with noise and the desire to return to thunderous noise volumes? I went to a GP in the 1990s and the noise was unbearably loud. Why is it held in such high esteem? It's not like the present engines are EV quiet. \u2013 Ash\nThis is a very pertinent and perceptive question in the context of the current debate about engines in F1.\nIn a nutshell, what has happened is that FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem was pushing a return to V10 naturally aspirated engines before the end of the next engine cycle - perhaps even as early as 2028.\nThat has now been kicked into the long grass because a majority of the engine manufacturers were opposed, as they were always going to be. \nThe manufacturers, FIA and F1 will continue to discuss engines, while waiting to see what the new rules look like next year. These continue with 1.6-litre turbo hybrid engines, but with the electrical component providing close to 50% of the total power output, as opposed to about 20% now.\nThere is the possibility of some form of simplified engine format being introduced, but likely not before 2029 at the absolute earliest, and more likely 2030 or 2031, which is when F1 is due for a new engine formula anyway.\nThis new engine, it is now clear, will definitely be a hybrid. But it remains to be seen what size it is, how many cylinders it will have, whether it will be turbocharged, and how big a proportion hybrid will be of the total power output.\nA V8, with or without a turbo, and hybrid in the region of 20-30% seems like a reasonable-guess possible compromise as things stand. \nA turbo would make more sense in terms of efficiency, which is an important consideration, but it would have an impact on the engine's sound.\nNoise is definitely one of the factors. A certain portion of the fanbase do romanticise the ear-piercing sound of the engines from the 1990s and early 2000s.\nBut what is not clear is whether that is the majority or not, and how important a consideration it should be. \nF1's fanbase has changed a lot in recent years. There is a new generation of fans and the number of females has significantly increased. On top of that, more and more families are attending grands prix with relatively young children.\nDo this new generation of fans want a return to engines that are so loud you need ear-defenders and cannot have a conversation while the race is going on? What about the corporate guests above the pits?\nIt feels as if certain people were making decisions based on their own prejudices from a time that they happened to find appealing, without properly researching whether it was the right thing to do.\nIt would perhaps be wise for F1 and the FIA to research this effectively before forming any firm conclusions, because it is clear it would be wrong to make assumptions.\nFor example, Fernando Alonso made some interesting comments in this context at the Japanese Grand Prix, which have given pause for thought to the powers that be. Or at least some of them.\nAlonso won one of his two titles driving a V10 and one driving a V8, and when he demonstrated his 2005 Renault at the 2020 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix he clearly had a lot of fun chucking the car around. It was great to watch. \nYou might expect Alonso, therefore, to be in favour of a return to those kinds of engines. But that's not what he said at all.\n\"I love the the sound of the V8, V10, and, you know, we all experience that, and it's probably one of the best memories I have from Formula 1 and one of the best cars that I drove,\" Alonso said.\n\"But the world, in a way, has evolved and changed, and there is a different technology now.\n\"I will be OK with whatever the sport decides, but we need to be careful not just to take only the romantic side of it and just be, you know, pragmatic, and understand that the world is different now and the future maybe is just what we have now.\"\nWhat are the main differences between qualifying set-up and race set-up and how do teams balance the two? \u2013 Glebe\nUnder F1's so-called parc ferme regulations, set-up changes after the start of qualifying are basically banned, with very few exceptions.\nIf conditions remain the same, teams can adjust front wing angles, and whatever settings are on the steering wheel - such as differential and brake balance - but nothing else.\nIf the weather changes, that all goes out of the window and more changes are allowed.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\nMarko has 'great concern' over Verstappen future\n'A fascinating contrast between team-mates and title contenders'\nBahrain Grand Prix review",

        "article_text": "The sweltering heat during Buddhist New Year calls for Thailand's cooling khao chae, a fragrant and refreshing bowl of rice delicately scented with flowers.\nBy the time Songkran, Thailand's new year based on the Buddhist calendar, arrives in April, the temperatures in the Southeast Asian country are soaring. The sky is typically blue and spotless, so reprieve under the shade of a passing cloud is non-existent while the humidity is as thick as a fleece blanket. One way to cool off is in the country-wide water fights that take place during the annual celebrations (this year from 13-15 April), which include water guns, buckets and coloured powder smeared onto the face like war paint. Another way to celebrate and cool off is to eat khao chae.\nKhao chae (soaked rice) is an icy, seasonal treat that marks the beginning of summer in Thailand. The history of the dish can be traced back hundreds of years to the Mon people, an ethnic group that originated throughout Myanmar and Thailand and integrated into what was then Siamese society in the 16th Century.\n[jump to recipe]\n\"The form of khao chae that we're looking at right now, especially in Bangkok, has very little resemblance to the Mon khao chae,\" says Leela Punyaratabandhu, a Thai scholar and the author of the 2017 cookbook Bangkok, which includes a recipe for khao chae. In the 16th Century, the soaked rice porridge was served in terracotta pots to keep the dish cold because ice wasn't readily available. The accompanying side dishes were also not nearly as intricate as they would eventually become.\nIt was within the kingdom of Siam's royal family, dating back to King Rama IV's rule in the 19th Century, that the dish blossomed into something far more complex \u2013 a metamorphosis of its humble origins. A lot of effort was made to ensure that khao chae looked visually beautiful, so side dishes included delicately carved vegetables shaped into flowers. In addition, ice, which was impossible for commoners to get at the time, distinguished kaho chae as an exclusively royal dish.\nThe recipe that exists now has been passed down through generations of royal cooks and aristocratic families. The dish starts by vigorously washing jasmine rice to remove all the starch. \"You have to wash the rice more than regular steamed rice so it doesn't stick together when cooked,\" explains Max Wittawat, the executive chef of New York City's Bangkok Supper Club. Wittawat grew up in Bangkok and was taught to make khao chae by culinary artist and teacher Jantararat Hemvej, who is known in Bangkok for having perfected khao chae.\nSince the rice also needs to withstand being soaked for long periods without falling apart, which would render the dish cloudy, washing it is especially important. After it's steamed, the rice is submerged in ice water that's perfumed with the scent of flowers, ranging from jasmine, ylang ylang, damask roses and bread flowers. \"It's a mark of summer when the flowers bloom,\" adds Wittawat.\nPunyaratabandhu has childhood memories of her grandfather using a spreadsheet to track the specific times that the flowers bloomed in his garden. \"All of this was very systematic,\" she says. It's important to pick the flowers at the precise time \u2013 typically the evening before preparing khao chae \u2013 in order to achieve the optimal fragrance. From there, the flowers are submerged in water for at least two hours to imbue their aroma.\u00a0\nEven the process of soaking the flowers is very intentional. If the flowers are left in the water for too long, they will bruise and go bad, leaving the water with a pungent and off-putting flavour. If they aren't steeped long enough, the bouquet will not be impactful enough to stand up to the side dishes served alongside khao chae. To enhance the dish's fragrance even further, a Thai culinary candle known as tian op may be used to smoke the flowery water.\nAnd that's just the base of the dish. Khao chae is an experience that includes many elaborate accoutrements. \"It's not only hard to make, but it's hard to eat as well,\" says Punyaratabandhu. This is because there are a lot of pungent, salty and fishy flavours that could be unfamiliar to some. \"Shrimp paste balls mixed with fish and then dipped in egg and fried? It's a far cry from pad see ew [stir-fried noodles].\"\nWhen Punyaratabandhu began writing her cookbook, she struggled with whether or not she should include a recipe for khao chae, knowing how impractical and challenging the dish can be to prepare at home. \"I knew it was going to be a tough sell, but also it's a part of Bangkok,\" she explains. \"My job was to be faithful to whatever is happening in Bangkok.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A rice dish with 'sexual power'\n\u2022 The 3,000-year-old new year's celebration\n\u2022 The Thai noodles eaten for breakfast\nEven Wittawat admits that khao chae, outside of the aristocratic society of Bangkok, was not really in Thailand's zeitgeist until the past 10 years, when many chefs began reflecting on their Thai heritage and exploring culturally significant and historical dishes. \"Before that, it was very old school and not common in restaurants,\" he says. \"But nowadays, with technology, the flowers can bloom throughout the year, and it has risen so much in popularity.\"\u00a0\nRecently, khao chae has become a social media darling due to its myriad side dishes, like shrimp paste dumplings, elaborately carved vegetables, stuffed shallots and peppers, sweetened beef and pork jerky and delicate egg nests. It's visually stunning, especially when served in traditional Thai pots or tiffins. \"Sometimes, it's too pretty to eat,\" Wittawat says.\nThere is a particular way to enjoy the dish to avoid muddying the crystal-clear flower-scented water. \"You're not supposed to put all the condiments with the rice,\" Wittawat says. Instead, you should alternate eating the rice and side dishes. Vegetables and pickles can cut through the heavier flavours of sweetened beef and salty shrimp paste. \"This is the fun thing about khao chae,\" Wittawat says, acknowledging that the various flavours work in tandem to keep the meal fresh and exciting. \"You can continue eating more and more.\"\nWittawat is happy that khao chae, once exclusive to the royal family and upper echelon of Thai society, is now more readily available and accessible to everyone \u2013 especially during Songkran, when Thailand is so hot. \"Thai people are returning to their roots,\" he says. \"They're appreciating their history and culture.\nKhao chae recipe\nby Max Wittawat\nServes 8\nThis is a general overview of how to make the rice for khao chae, along with two side dishes. Feel free to include additional sides to your liking.\nIngredients\n1 qt jasmine rice\nFlower-scented water (see Note)\nFor the shrimp paste balls:\n300g grilled catfish\n250g coconut milk\n200g coconut sugar \n100g fish sauce\n100g shrimp paste\n100g lemongrass\n100g lesser ginger or fingeroot\n100g garlic cloves\n100g shallots\n100g coriander root or stem\n50g pounded dried shrimp\n50g toasted desiccated coconut\n1 tbsp black peppercorns, ground \nsalt (to taste)\nbeaten eggs, for coating\n1 qt canola oil\nFor the stuffed green peppers:\n50g coriander root or stem\n50g garlic cloves\n10g white peppercorns\n250g pork mince\n100g minced shrimp\n1 tbsp sugar\n1 tsp salt\n8 green peppers, seeded and cored from the top (leave the peppers whole)\n2 chicken eggs\n1 duck egg\nMethod\nStep 1\nRinse the jasmine rice in water 4 to 5 times. Cook the rice in boiling water until half-cooked, then strain. Wash the rice in water again, using your hands to rub the rice; rinse and repeat until the water becomes clear. Transfer the rice to a steamer and steam until fully cooked. Let cool.\nStep 2\nTo make the shrimp balls, blend all the ingredients (except the eggs and oil) in a blender until smooth. Pour into a large nonstick frying pan and cook until thick paste forms. Let cool slightly, then roll into small balls.\nStep 3\nHeat the oil in a medium pot. Dip the shrimp balls into beaten eggs, then deep-fry until golden brown. Set aside. (Reserve the oil for the green peppers.)\nStep 4\nPound the coriander, garlic and peppercorns in a mortar with a pestle until smooth, then mix with the minced pork and shrimp. Season with sugar and salt. Stuff the mixture into the green peppers. Set the peppers into a steamer and steam for 10mins.\nStep 5\nTo make the egg net,\u00a0reheat the oil in the pot. Beat all the eggs together and strain through a sieve. Dip 5 fingers in the beaten eggs and shake into the pot of heated oil left to right, then up and down to form an egg net. When the eggs turn golden brown, transfer the egg net to a kitchen towel and place the steamed stuffed peppers on top, then roll the egg net around the peppers.\u00a0Repeat with the remaining peppers.\nStep 6\nSpoon the steamed rice into bowls and pour the cold scented over it. Enjoy the khao chae with the shrimp balls and stuffed peppers, as well as sliced cucumber, green mango, scallion and lesser ginger.\u00a0\nNote\nTo make the scented water, steep jasmine, ylang-ylang (\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e14\u0e31\u0e07\u0e07\u0e32) and chommanard (\u0e0a\u0e21\u0e19\u0e32\u0e14) flowers with drinking water and (if using) smoke with a Thai aromatic candle (\u0e40\u0e17\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e2d\u0e21) overnight.

[jump to recipe]\"The form of khao chae that we're looking at right now, especially in Bangkok, has very little resemblance to the Mon khao chae,\" says Leela Punyaratabandhu, a Thai scholar and the author of the 2017 cookbook Bangkok, which includes a recipe for khao chae. Thailand's cooling rice dish to beat the heat3 days agoShareSaveKat ThompsonShareSaveMax WittawatKhao chae (soaked rice) is an icy, seasonal dish served with myriad accoutrements (Credit: Max Wittawat)The sweltering heat during Buddhist New Year calls for Thailand's cooling khao chae, a fragrant and refreshing bowl of rice delicately scented with flowers.By the time Songkran, Thailand's new year based on the Buddhist calendar, arrives in April, the temperatures in the Southeast Asian country are soaring. \"More like this:\u2022 A rice dish with 'sexual power'\u2022 The 3,000-year-old new year's celebration\u2022 The Thai noodles eaten for breakfastEven Wittawat admits that khao chae, outside of the aristocratic society of Bangkok, was not really in Thailand's zeitgeist until the past 10 years, when many chefs began reflecting on their Thai heritage and exploring culturally significant and historical dishes. Wittawat grew up in Bangkok and was taught to make khao chae by culinary artist and teacher Jantararat Hemvej, who is known in Bangkok for having perfected khao chae.Since the rice also needs to withstand being soaked for long periods without falling apart, which would render the dish cloudy, washing it is especially important.",

        "article_text": "A US federal judge has given President Donald Trump's officials a one-week deadline to comply with his court order or risk being found in contempt of court - potentially setting up a historic clash between two equally powerful branches of government.\nJudge James Boasberg said the \"most obvious way\" for the officials to avoid contempt was to \"assert custody\" over a group of more than 200 people who they deported to El Salvador last month - after he told them not to do so. \nBut the Trump administration has shown no sign of a desire to adhere, criticising Wednesday's request and saying it would appeal. \nThe White House denies any wrongdoing, and has depicted the group as \"terrorists and criminal illegal migrants\" who threaten American society.\nExperts have told the BBC that a showdown between the judicial and executive branch appears all but inevitable. So, what might happen if the government does not comply with Judge Boasberg's deadline of 23 April? \nThe first step to hold any Trump officials in contempt of court would be to determine who was responsible for the non-compliance, an expert told the BBC.\nAt the moment, it remains unclear who took the specific actions against Judge's Boasberg's initial order to not deport people to El Salvador, said Robert Tsai, a Boston University constitutional law professor.\nLawyers would use a process called discovery to decide who was responsible, by seeking documents and questioning government officials under oath.\n\"You want to be able to nail someone down and pinpoint who it is that's basically saying, 'We're getting the planes up in the air, and just stonewall the judge,'\" Prof Tsai said.\nGovernment lawyers have said the planes were already en route by the time Judge Boasberg's written order was issued, and that his subsequent verbal order for the planes to return happened when they were no longer in US airspace. \nIf he felt government lawyers were not playing ball, Judge Boasberg could fine both the lawyers and other government officials until they complied, Prof Tsai said. The sanctions or penalties would apply until the government met the terms of the judge's order. \nAll of this falls under the umbrella of civil contempt. \n\nThere is also the possibility of Trump administration officials being found in criminal contempt - for which the punishment could include jail time. \n\"That's considered one of the most serious things, and usually the last resort,\" Prof Tsai said. \nIn the case of criminal contempt, Prof Tsai said the normal course of events would be to refer the issue for prosecution by the justice department, which is run by Attorney General Pam Bondi. \nJudge Boasberg also has the power to appoint a special prosecutor to pursue criminal contempt charges and to sidestep Bondi, a Trump loyalist who was appointed by the president.\n\"With this administration, it is very possible that the justice department refuses to prosecute,\" George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin explained to the BBC. \nEven if the justice department does take the case, Trump has the power to pardon a criminal offence. But the president does not have the power to issue pardons for civil liability (civil contempt).\nThe ruling from US District Judge James E Boasberg on Wednesday said the government showed \"wilful disregard\" for his order when it sent planes carrying alleged criminals to El Salvador - after he had barred the government from using a wartime law for the deportations. \nThat law, the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, gave the Trump administration power to expedite its deportation of those it said were gang members without providing any evidence.\nThe US Supreme Court later ruled that Trump was able to use the wartime law, Judge Boasberg said on Wednesday that \"does not excuse the government's violation\" of his earlier request.\nTo avoid contempt proceedings, the judge gave the administration two options - to \"purge\" itself of contempt, or to remedy its noncompliance.\n\"The most obvious way\", he said, was for the administration to \"assert custody\" of the hundreds deported to El Salvador's mega-prison, so they could \"challenge their removability\". \nJudge Boasberg said the government would not need to release any of those deported - a number of whom have not been convicted of any crimes - nor fly them back to the US.\nThe judge said the administration could also \"propose other methods of coming into compliance\". \nThe high-stakes collision between a federal judge and the Trump administration comes under a president whose stated goal was to enact the \"largest deportation programme\" in US history. \nIf any officials are found in contempt, regardless of Trump's possible involvement, it is unlikely that the president himself would ever be criminally charged, Prof Tsai said, thanks to the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling last year.\n\"I think that the presidential immunity decision that was issued is going to be the thing that protects him from any kind of criminal prosecution,\" Prof Tsai explained. \n\"All these orders are sort of policy decisions. They might be illegal, they might be unconstitutional, who knows. \n\"But even if they are, they're done within the scope of his his core powers,\" he said.\n",

        "article_text": "When wedding dress designer Catherine Deane saw her company's Instagram account get hacked, she says it was \"devastating\".\n\"It felt like the rug had been pulled from under us. Instagram is our primary social platform, and we've invested the most amount of time and business resources into it.\n\"To keep the account current we post content every day. Suddenly all this work\u2026 it was just pulled.\"\nMs Deane's UK-based business, which is named after her, sells wedding dresses online, with her biggest market being the US.\nOn Instagram it now has 59,000 followers, but a few years ago the firm lost control of the account after a member of its social media team received a message suggesting that the business had been selected to get blue-badge verification from Instagram, which is owned by Facebook's Meta.\nThis was the stamp of authenticity that Ms Deane had long sought. \"We were obviously very excited about that,\" she says.\nSo her employee opened a link to what turned out to be a fake Instagram verification form that requested log-in credentials. She filled it in, divulging the username and password, and shortly afterwards the account was taken over by hackers.\nWhat added to Ms Deane's anguish was that she says she had to fight with Meta to get her account back, which took four months.\nInitially she filled out the admin dispute form and sent it off, but heard nothing. Multiple emails followed but no action was taken.\n\"It's so incredibly frustrating when you're dealing with your account being hacked and there is no-one to talk to,\" she says. \"It's almost traumatising because there is no-one who understands and can help escalate it.\"\nEventually an email came from Meta, telling her that the case was closed, even though she was still unable to access her page.\nIn the end the matter was finally resolved for Ms Deane because someone in the firm had a contact at Facebook, and the team emailed that person daily for the four months.\n\"Finally, I think they just needed to get us off their backs and they reinstated the account,\" says Ms Deane.\nAccording to Jonas Borchgrevink, boss of US-based cyber security firm Hacked.com, Ms Deane is far from a unique case among people with business accounts on Instagram and Facebook.\n\"I would say that it is a massive problem,\" says Mr Borchgrevink. \"There are probably thousands every day that are losing their business pages.\"\nHis company helps firms recover their Instagram and Facebook accounts, and he gets \"10 to 15 clients per week\". \"But those are just the ones that know about us and are able to pay the price, because these cases can take up to six months to sort.\"\nThe BBC asked Meta to provide some numbers that would reveal the extent of the problem, and how it was tackling it, but it declined.\nHowever, it said in a statement, that \"we take the safety and security of our community seriously and encourage everyone to create a strong password, enable two factor authentication and to be suspicious of emails or messages asking for personal details.\n\"We also have a feature called Security Check-up to help people keep their Instagram and Facebook accounts secure.\"\nHackers want to take over business social media accounts for a number of reasons. These including using the pages to sell fake products or place scam adverts, harvesting personal information, spreading malware, tricking people into sending money, or blackmailing the company in question to unblock the account.\nThe final thing in that list happened last year to David Davila, who is part of the marketing team at Quantum Windows & Doors, a small, family-run business based in Washington state in the US.\nHe got locked out of the firm's social Facebook account when he responded to what turned out to be a fake message purporting to be from Meta.\nBecause his phone number was linked to the account, that also fell into the hands of the scammers and, soon after the lock-out, he got a WhatsApp message demanding $1,200 (\u00a3900) to unlock the account.\nUnable to find a helpline, he searched on Google, but the number he rang put him through to more scammers. That link has since been removed by Google.\nThankfully, Mr Davila was able to get the Facebook account unlocked a few days later.\nMr Borchgrevink believes that Meta is overwhelmed by the scale of the problem.\n\"It has implemented different security measures over the years and yet we still receive the same amount of clients, so I don't think there's been a lot of change there,\" he says.\nIn fact, with scammers now utilising AI to make their messages seem even more believable, Mr Borchgrevink  thinks the situation could get a lot worse.\nHe tells the BBC that scammers are behind many of these lock-outs and one of their preferred methods of fooling people is to masquerade as customer support agents.\n\"They pretend to be Meta Support and send the business an email saying that they have infringed some kind of copyright or broken terms and conditions in some way, and that they need to verify themselves.\n\"The messages have the Facebook logo and are very believable. But when you start to verify your business page, they ask for the password and redirect you to a fake Meta site to steal log-ins.\"\nHe said that the fraudsters often target a personal Facebook page first, because all business accounts need to be linked to one.\n\"Your personal account will also have admin rights to your business account. The scammers go into your business account and transfer the admin rights to their own or to fake profiles.\n\"Then they go back to your personal account and disable it by posting inappropriate content like terror-related or pornography-related. That disables your account and makes it really hard to recover either that or your business account.\"\nThe BBC has also learned of businesses losing access to their Facebook and Instagram accounts despite them not being hacked.\nOne small business which is part of franchise, told the BBC that they lost access to their account when another franchisee gained a blue-tick verification. As a result of that their account was flagged as a clone.\nMeanwhile, others, such as digital marketer Chetha Senadeera, say that Meta has wrongly closed business accounts.\nLast autumn he realised that a Facebook page he managed for a mobile bank had gone missing. \"It had just disappeared,\" he says.\n\"There was no notification to me or any of the team members. It was just gone. It was like it had been kidnapped, almost.\"\nThe page was a crucial gateway to customers across Europe for Lithuania bank MyTU.\nMr Senadeera says that the customer support agents he spoke to at Meta, Facebook's owner, were baffled. He says they told him that they could see the page, but that it had been restricted, and that they couldn't unblock it.\nSix months later, and the page remains locked.\nMeta tells the BBC that the page had been removed for violating its scams policies, via a link on the page that was flagged by its systems as potentially harmful.\nMr Senadeera disputes that the firm has ever posted any harmful or misleading content. He says that Meta needs to do more, and move more quickly, to help firms get their Facebook and Instagram pages back, whether they have been a victim of fraud or not.",
