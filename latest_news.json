        "article_text": "Stars from the reality television show Love On The Spectrum went on the defensive  after Robert F Kennedy Jr commented that people with autism make limited contributions to society. \nPeople with autism \"will never pay taxes, they'll never hold a job, they'll never play baseball, they'll never write a poem, they'll never go on a date\", the US Health and Human Services chief said earlier this month.\nThe remarks drew widespread anger from people with autism who reject the notion of needing to be repaired, but also responses from those pushing for a greater understanding of autism.\n\"Autistic people have the same hopes, dreams and yes, the same awkward dating moments as anyone else,\" Dani Bowman, one of the television show's star's said to US media. \nThe reality TV star on the show, which is about a group of autistic adults' experiences dating, said Kennedy's comments were \"completely false\". \nSince joining the Trump administration, Kennedy, who in the past has promoted debunked theories suggesting autism is linked to vaccines, has made autism a main focus. Autism diagnoses have increased sharply since 2000, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThat rise is, at least in part, attributable to increased autism awareness and an expanding definition of the disorder, scientists say. First recognized as a developmental disorder in 1978, autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning that symptoms vary by person. Some need little to no support in their daily lives, while others need a great amount. \nEarlier this month, Kennedy pledged \"a massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism in five months. He did not give details on the project or funding it. He also said his department would investigate potential causes.\n\"Everything is on the table - our food system, our water, our air, different ways of parenting, all the kind of changes that may have triggered this epidemic,\" Kennedy later told Fox News. \nExperts have warned that finding the causes of autism spectrum disorder will not be straightforward, and called the effort misguided and unrealistic.\nThe idea of curing autism is concerning for some.\n\"Wanting to cure autism implies that our way of being is wrong and it isn't,\" Ms Bowman told NewsNation. \"We don't need to be fixed. We need to be supported. But the answer isn't erasing autism, it's building a more inclusive world for all of us.\"\nAnother star of Love on the Spectrum, James B Jones, attacked Kennedy's autism remarks on social media, calling them \"extremely ignorant, and to be perfectly frank, downright offensive\".\nBut not everyone agrees. \nWhile advocacy groups focus on acceptance and inclusion they avoid \"uncomfortable truths about children like mine\", Emily May, who has a child with autism, wrote in a New York Times opinion piece on Friday.\n\"I have no interest in defending Mr. Kennedy, whose shaky science and conspiracy theories will do nothing to benefit those with autism and their families,\" Ms May said.  \"And yet, I think his remarks echo the reality and pain of a subset of parents of children with autism who feel left out of much of the conversation around the condition.\"\nOne of Kennedy's main false claims was that \"autism comes from vaccines\". Although he has denied many times that  he is anti-vaccination and said he and his children are vaccinated, he has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccine harm.\nThe theory came from a study by Andrew Wakefield in 1998, but it was later retracted by the Lancet medical journal. Multiple studies since have concluded there is no link between vaccines and autism.\nDespite her frustration, Ms May expressed admiration for Kennedy's \"willingness to speak frankly about the painful parts of [her] child's life\".\nAutism Speaks, an advocacy organisation, agreed in part with Ms May. \nThe organisation said it heard from parents who felt Kennedy's comments resonated \"with their lived experience\". \n\"The language we use matters,\" Autism Speaks said in a statement to the BBC. \"It should reflect current science and honor the lived experiences of autistic people, many of whom lead fulfilling lives and make invaluable contributions to their families, workplaces and communities.\"\nDr Manish Arora, founder of LinusBio who has spent more than two decades studying autism, noted that Kennedy's statements can be \"very hurtful for families and autistic individuals\". \nBut he also welcomed more research into the causes of autism and said increased attention is a \"meaningful opportunity\". \nStill, he wishes the debate was \"less polarising\". \n\"Scientists should see the opportunity here, avoid the polarised discourse and see the opportunities here,\" Dr Arora told the BBC. \nJake Tilk, and his brother, Max Tilk, who is on the autism spectrum, largely avoid that political discourse in their social media videos where they share what their day-to-day life looks. \nThey share their lives online to create awareness and acceptance of autism, because the brothers want to celebrate neurodiversity, Jake Tilk told the BBC. \n\"It's most important that discussions about autism are grounded in science, compassion and most importantly the living experiences of people with autism themselves,\" he said.

        "article_text": "Attorneys delivered opening statements on Wednesday in the New York retrial of Harvey Weinstein, with prosecutors accusing the disgraced film producer of using his immense power in Hollywood to sexually harass and abuse three women. \n\"The defendant wanted their bodies, and the more they resisted, the more forceful he got,\" Assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey told jurors on Wednesday. \nIn his third trial in five years, Weinstein is accused of sexually abusing a former television production assistant, an aspiring actress and a model. \nThe former film mogul has pleaded not guilty, and in court his lawyer sought to cast doubt on the women's claims and credibility.\nAttorney Arthur Aidala told the jury the prosecution case would \"fall flat on its face\" after they heard all the evidence.\n\"They're going to ask you to make sense of things that just don't make sense,\" he said.\nA court of appeals overturned Weinstein's previous conviction for sex crimes in New York last April, before he was indicted on new sexual assault charges in the state in September.\nLast week, 12 jurors - seven women and five men - were chosen to weigh Weinstein's fate. \nOn Wednesday, Ms Lucey spent an hour delivering an opening statement, telling jurors that three women had fallen victim to the abuse of a \"Hollywood gatekeeper\" who held \"unfettered power for over 30 years in that industry\".\nThe retrial in New York is centred on two women who brought allegations against Weinstein for his 2020 trial, actress Jessica Mann and former TV production assistant Miriam Haley. This time, the trial also includes allegations from former Polish model and actress Kaja Sokola, who has accused Weinstein of assaulting her when she was 16. \nOn Wednesday, Ms Lucey recounted the three women's stories of assault and harassment, sparing few details. The alleged encounters often involved Weinstein bringing women to his room under the guise of a business meeting, before he allegedly forced himself onto them. \nVictims \"kept their shame and their pain to themselves\" for years because of Weistein's role as a man who \"defined the field\" of acting and film, Ms Lucey said. \nDuring his hour of opening statements that followed, Weinstein's attorney took a combative approach, accusing the women of having \"mutually beneficial\" sexual relationships with Weinstein and being motivated by money. \n\"These women are addicted to that fame,\" Mr Aidala said. \"They want to be heroes.\" \nMr Aidala argued that Weinstein could not have assaulted the women because they kept in contact with him and sent him friendly messages after the encounters. \nLast April, a court of appeals said Weinstein, now 73, did not receive a fair trial in New York in 2020 because the judge overseeing his case allowed testimony from women who made allegations against him for conduct he was never charged over. \nWeinstein had been serving a 23-year sentence in a New York prison after being convicted.\nHe was also found guilty of rape in a separate trial in California in 2022 and was sentenced to 16 years in that case.\nWeinstein has several medical conditions, including cancer and diabetes. In September, he was taken to hospital for heart surgery and has been held in a secure hospital unit. \nA judge has approved a request from Weinstein's lawyers to let him stay at the Bellevue hospital in Manhattan when he is not in court. \nHis lawyers had complained that he was receiving poor medical treatment in unhygienic conditions at the infamous Rikers Island prison facility - which officials have long said they plan to close - though the move has been delayed. \nIn total, Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault and rape by more than 100 women. \nHe is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison, as he has yet to begin serving his 16-year California sentence. \nThe decision by his accusers to come forward, and his subsequent conviction in New York, galvanised the #MeToo movement against sex abuse by powerful men.\nSpeaking to jurors on Wednesday, Ms Lucey said the movement had allowed the three women to come forward in the criminal case against Weinstein after they \"suddenly realized they were not alone\".\nBefore the allegations against him emerged, Weinstein and his brother Bob were among Hollywood's ultimate power players.\nWeinstein co-founded Miramax film studio, whose hits included Shakespeare in Love, which won best picture at the Academy Awards, and Pulp Fiction.\nHis films have received more than 300 Oscar nominations and 81 wins.\nThe former film mogul has also faced a number of civil lawsuits, including from a group of women who accused him of sexual harassment and rape and reached a $19m (\u00a314.2) settlement with him in 2020.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has appeared to soften his recent comments on China and the head of the US Federal Reserve after recent clashes as he pursues his economic agenda.\nTrump said he has \"no intention of firing\" Jerome Powell after repeatedly criticising the head of the central bank, but added that he would like Powell to be \"a little more active\" on cutting interest rates.\nSpeaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump also said he was optimistic about improving trade relations with China. \nHe said the level of tariffs - or import taxes - that he had imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\". \nThe president's tariffs are an effort to encourage factories and jobs to return to the US. This is a pillar of his economic agenda - as is a cut in interest rates, aimed at reducing the cost of borrowing for Americans.\nTrump has ratcheted the rate on Chinese goods up to 145% - sparking reciprocal measures from Beijing and warnings from economists about the global impact of a trade war.\nIn his comments to reporters on Tuesday, Trump said he would be \"very nice\" in negotiations with Beijing - in the hope of securing a trade deal. \nEarlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly said he expected a de-escalation of the trade war, which he said was unsustainable. Responding to comments from China, he said the current situation was \"not a joke\".\nThe trade war has led to turbulence in financial markets around the world - to which Trump's comments on Powell have also contributed. \nThe Fed has not cut rates so far this year, after lowering them by a percentage point late last year, a stance Trump has heavily criticised.\nLast week, the president intensified his attacks on the Fed chief, calling him \"a major loser\". The comments sparked a selloff of stocks, bonds and the US dollar - though markets have since been recovering from those losses. \nNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on Friday that Trump was looking into whether it would be possible to sack Powell - who he first nominated to lead the central bank in 2017. Powell was then renewed in 2021 by Joe Biden.\nIt is unclear whether Trump has the authority to fire the Fed chair. No other US president has tried to do so.\nMost major Asian stock markets were higher on Wednesday as investors appeared to welcome the latest remarks.\nJapan's Nikkei 225 index rose about 1.9%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed by around 2.2%, while mainland China's Shanghai Composite was down less than 0.1%.\nThat came after US shares made gains on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 ending Tuesday's session up 2.5% and the Nasdaq rose 2.7%. \nUS futures were also trading higher overnight. Futures markets give an indication of how financial markets will perform when they open for trading.\nInvestors feared that pressure on Powell to lower interest rates could cause prices to rise at a time when trade tariffs are already seen boosting inflation.\nTrade tensions between the world's biggest economies, as well as US tariffs on other countries around the world, have triggered uncertainty about the global economy. Those concerns triggered turmoil in financial markets in recent weeks.\nOn Tuesday, the forecast for US economic growth for this year was given the biggest downgrade among advanced economies by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) due to uncertainty caused by tariffs.\nThe sharp increase in tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a \"significant slowdown\" in global growth, the Fund predicted.\nTrump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are now facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July.\nHis administration said last week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nChina has hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US and vowed to \"fight to the end\".\nThe Chinese government has not yet officially responded to the latest statements from the Trump administration.\nHowever, an article in the state-controlled Global Times on Wednesday quoted commentators who said the remarks showed that the US is beginning to realise the tariffs do more harm than good to America's economy.",

        "article_text": "A record-breaking tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany, which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia's links with the rest of Europe.\nRunning for 18km (11 miles), the Fehmarnbelt will be the world's longest pre-fabricated road and rail tunnel.\nIt's also a remarkable feat of engineering, that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor, and then joined together.\nThe project's main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel, on the coast of Lolland island in the south east of Denmark.\nThe facility spans more than 500 hectares (1,235 acres), and includes a harbour and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections, which are called \"elements\".\n\"It's a huge facility here,\" says Henrik Vincentsen, chief executive of Femern, the state-owned Danish company that is building the tunnel.\nTo make each 217m (712ft) long and 42m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete. \nMost underwater tunnels - including the 50km Channel Tunnel between the UK and France \u2013 burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor. Here instead, 90 individual elements will be linked up, piece by piece, like Lego bricks.\n\"We are breaking records with this project,\" says Mr Vincentsen. \"Immersed tunnels have been built before, but never on this scale.\"\nWith a price-tag around \u20ac7.4bn ($8.1bn; \u00a36.3bn) the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark, with \u20ac1.3bn from the European Commission.\nIt's among the region's largest-ever infrastructure projects, and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying.\nOnce completed, the journey between R\u00f8dbyhavn in southern Denmark and Puttgarten in northern Germany, will take just 10 minutes by car, or seven minutes by train, replacing a 45-minute ferry voyage.\nBypassing western Denmark, the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and Hamburg from five to 2.5 hours, and provide a \"greener\" shortcut for freight and passengers.\n\"It's not only linking Denmark to Germany, it's linking Scandinavia to central Europe,\" states Mr Vincentsen. \"Everybody's a winner,\" he claims. \"And by travelling 160km less, you'll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport.\"\nTowered over by cranes, the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead.\n\"So now we are in the first part of the tunnel,\" announces senior construction manager Anders Gert Wede, as we walk inside the future highway. It's one of five parallel tubes in each element.\nThere are two for railway lines, two for roads (which have two lanes in each direction), and a maintenance and emergency corridor.\nAt the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea. \"As you can hear, it's quite thick,\" he says tapping on the metal.  \"When we have a finished element  at the harbour, it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here.\"\nNot only are these elements long, they're enormously heavy, weighing over 73,000 tonnes. Yet incredibly, sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks, gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats.\nNext it's a painstakingly complex procedure, lowering the elements 40 metres down into a trench dug out on the seafloor, using underwater cameras and GPS-guided equipment, to line it up with 15mm precision.\n\"We have to be very, very careful,\" emphasises Mr Wede. \"We have a system called 'pin and catch' where you have a V-shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element, dragging it slowly into place.\"\nDenmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic, on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes.\nWith layers of clay and bedrock of chalk, the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel, said Per Goltermann, a professor in concrete and structures at the Technical University of Denmark.\nA bridge was initially considered, but strong winds might disrupt traffic, and security was another important consideration.\n\"There was the risk of ships crashing into bridges. We can build the bridge so they can withstand it,\" he adds. \"But this is rather deep water, and the biggest ships can sail there.\"\nSo, adds Mr Goltermann, it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel. \"They looked at it and said, \"Okay, what is the cheapest? The tunnel. What is the safest? The tunnel.\"\nDenmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in 2008, but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact.\nOne such environmental group, Nabu (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union), argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbour porpoises, which are sensitive to underwater noise.\nHowever in 2020 their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany, which green-lighted construction to go ahead.\n\"We have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible,\" says Mr Vincentsen, pointing to a 300-hectare wetland nature and recreational area that's planned on reclaimed land, which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock.\nWhen the tunnel opens in 2029, Femern estimates that more than 100 trains and 12,000 cars will use it each day.\nAccording to plans, revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state-backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction, and Mr Vincentsen calculates that will take around four decades.  \"Ultimately, the users are going to pay,\" he says.\nIt's also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs, business and tourism in Lolland, which is one of Denmark's poorest regions.\n\"The locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years,\" said Mr Wede, who grew up nearby. \"They're looking forward to businesses coming to the area.\"",

        "article_text": "A record-breaking tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany, which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia's links with the rest of Europe.\nRunning for 18km (11 miles), the Fehmarnbelt will be the world's longest pre-fabricated road and rail tunnel.\nIt's also a remarkable feat of engineering, that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor, and then joined together.\nThe project's main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel, on the coast of Lolland island in the south east of Denmark.\nThe facility spans more than 500 hectares (1,235 acres), and includes a harbour and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections, which are called \"elements\".\n\"It's a huge facility here,\" says Henrik Vincentsen, chief executive of Femern, the state-owned Danish company that is building the tunnel.\nTo make each 217m (712ft) long and 42m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete. \nMost underwater tunnels - including the 50km Channel Tunnel between the UK and France \u2013 burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor. Here instead, 90 individual elements will be linked up, piece by piece, like Lego bricks.\n\"We are breaking records with this project,\" says Mr Vincentsen. \"Immersed tunnels have been built before, but never on this scale.\"\nWith a price-tag around \u20ac7.4bn ($8.1bn; \u00a36.3bn) the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark, with \u20ac1.3bn from the European Commission.\nIt's among the region's largest-ever infrastructure projects, and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying.\nOnce completed, the journey between R\u00f8dbyhavn in southern Denmark and Puttgarten in northern Germany, will take just 10 minutes by car, or seven minutes by train, replacing a 45-minute ferry voyage.\nBypassing western Denmark, the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and Hamburg from five to 2.5 hours, and provide a \"greener\" shortcut for freight and passengers.\n\"It's not only linking Denmark to Germany, it's linking Scandinavia to central Europe,\" states Mr Vincentsen. \"Everybody's a winner,\" he claims. \"And by travelling 160km less, you'll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport.\"\nTowered over by cranes, the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead.\n\"So now we are in the first part of the tunnel,\" announces senior construction manager Anders Gert Wede, as we walk inside the future highway. It's one of five parallel tubes in each element.\nThere are two for railway lines, two for roads (which have two lanes in each direction), and a maintenance and emergency corridor.\nAt the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea. \"As you can hear, it's quite thick,\" he says tapping on the metal.  \"When we have a finished element  at the harbour, it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here.\"\nNot only are these elements long, they're enormously heavy, weighing over 73,000 tonnes. Yet incredibly, sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks, gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats.\nNext it's a painstakingly complex procedure, lowering the elements 40 metres down into a trench dug out on the seafloor, using underwater cameras and GPS-guided equipment, to line it up with 15mm precision.\n\"We have to be very, very careful,\" emphasises Mr Wede. \"We have a system called 'pin and catch' where you have a V-shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element, dragging it slowly into place.\"\nDenmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic, on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes.\nWith layers of clay and bedrock of chalk, the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel, said Per Goltermann, a professor in concrete and structures at the Technical University of Denmark.\nA bridge was initially considered, but strong winds might disrupt traffic, and security was another important consideration.\n\"There was the risk of ships crashing into bridges. We can build the bridge so they can withstand it,\" he adds. \"But this is rather deep water, and the biggest ships can sail there.\"\nSo, adds Mr Goltermann, it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel. \"They looked at it and said, \"Okay, what is the cheapest? The tunnel. What is the safest? The tunnel.\"\nDenmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in 2008, but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact.\nOne such environmental group, Nabu (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union), argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbour porpoises, which are sensitive to underwater noise.\nHowever in 2020 their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany, which green-lighted construction to go ahead.\n\"We have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible,\" says Mr Vincentsen, pointing to a 300-hectare wetland nature and recreational area that's planned on reclaimed land, which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock.\nWhen the tunnel opens in 2029, Femern estimates that more than 100 trains and 12,000 cars will use it each day.\nAccording to plans, revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state-backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction, and Mr Vincentsen calculates that will take around four decades.  \"Ultimately, the users are going to pay,\" he says.\nIt's also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs, business and tourism in Lolland, which is one of Denmark's poorest regions.\n\"The locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years,\" said Mr Wede, who grew up nearby. \"They're looking forward to businesses coming to the area.\"",

These range from the absurd to the serious: failing to give a month's notice before quitting your job or not walking your dog enough, to offences like illegal arms possession, murder and sexual assault.\nDelhi-based think-tank Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy calls it \"India's crisis of over-criminalisation\".\nIn a new report, The State of the System: Understanding the Scale of Crime and Punishment in India, the think-tank has produced the country's first comprehensive database of crimes, mapping the extent of criminalisation across 370 federal laws.\nThe report flags India's habit of reaching for criminal law to solve just about everything - even the mundane. It notes that many laws criminalise \"routine, everyday actions\". \nYou could, for instance, be charged for tethering your goat on a public street, fixing a leaky tap without a licence or not naming the owner of a building when asked. \nThen there are the truly obscure offences - like a parent ignoring a school attendance order, applying for a driver's licence when banned or littering in a zoo. Basically, there's a criminal penalty waiting around every corner of daily life.\nLet your pigs wander on to a field or road and you could be fined 10 rupees (12 cents). Disturb an animal or litter in a zoo? Six months in jail or a 2,000-rupee fine. And failing to exercise your dog can cost you up to 100 rupees and three months in jail.\nPromoting infant milk substitutes or feeding bottles to pregnant women or mothers can lead to up to three years in jail or a 5,000-rupee fine. (This was meant to curb aggressive marketing by formula food companies, but the law also applies to individuals, which makes it controversial.)\nJail is the go-to punishment in India - 73% of crimes carry prison terms ranging from a single day to 20 years.\nMore than 250 offences across 117 laws penalise delays in filing documents - everything from wealth and property tax returns to gift declarations, the report finds. \nSome 124 crimes across 80 laws criminalise obstructing a public officer, often without clearly defining what causes \"obstruction\". \nEven the death penalty isn't off the table - not just for murder or mutiny, but for damaging an oil or gas pipeline or a sentry caught sleeping on duty. In all, a staggering 301 offences in India can legally cost you your life.\nOut of 7,305 offences under central laws, nearly 80% come with fines - from as low as two rupees to a staggering 50m rupees. \nTo be fair, many of these provisions are rarely used - India's crime records bureau tracks around 50 laws, even though 370 carry criminal penalties.\n\"They're not heavily enforced, but they create ample opportunities for rent-seeking,\" Naveed Mehmood Ahmad, co-author of the study at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, told me.\n\"There's enough in the books to jail almost anyone for some technical non-compliance. It's less about actual use and more about the potential for misuse.\"  \nThis \"excessive use of criminal law not only disrupts the daily lives of ordinary citizens but also creates significant barriers for business operations\", the report says. \nBusinesses in India face a maze of regulations, but using criminal law as the default for non-compliance is excessive, disproportionate and often counter-productive, experts say.\nThe report also talks about some glaring inconsistencies in crime and punishment.\nRioting - the use of force or violence by an unlawful assembly - is punishable with up to two years of imprisonment. Meanwhile, falsely reporting a birth or death for official records can lead to three years of imprisonment. \nThe irony? Violence in public gets a lighter sentence than a lie on paper.\nEven more striking: crimes of vastly different severity carry the same penalty - like practicing homoeopathy without a licence, jumping a red light, or forcing someone into labour - all punishable with a one-year sentence.\nThe sheer number of crimes tied to everyday life and business shows how heavily the state leans on criminalisation to enforce compliance, the report says.\n\"This over-reliance has significant costs, not just for citizens and businesses, but also for state machinery.\"\nOver 34 million criminal cases are pending in India's courts, with 72% stuck for more than a year. Prisons are overcrowded, running at 131% capacity, while courts and police forces continue to grapple with chronic staff shortages\nEven the law-and-order machinery is stretched. As of 1 January 2023, India had just 154 police personnel per 100,000 people - well below the sanctioned 195. Nationwide, there are 581,000 vacancies against an approved strength of 2.72 million.\n\"Even then, we continue to rely on this overburdened system to combat minor infractions, including those that attract nominal fines,\" the report says.\nIt says that criminal law should be limited to acts that threaten core societal values - like public safety, national security, life, liberty, property and social harmony.\nAuthorities say they plan to scrap criminal penalties in more than 100 legal provisions - on top of the 180 already axed in 2023. It's not just legal clean-up; it's a chance to rethink how the law treats people. Less fear, more trust. Less suspect, more citizen.  ",

        "article_text": "For 16 generations, master gardeners in this one family have dedicated their lives to preserving one of the nation's most cherished \u2013 and highly sought-out \u2013 symbols.\nEach spring during sakura (cherry blossom) season, the Ninna-ji and Daikaku-ji temples in Kyoto's leafy Ukyo ward are overwhelmed by busloads of tourists who come to snap photos of the temples' blooming cherry trees. But little do they know that only a few kilometres away, there's a secret sakura garden hiding in plain sight.\nThis 1.5-hectare public plot, known as the Sano family garden, is an oasis of calm; found just off an unassuming street near traditional wooden machiya townhouses. But this isn't just any ordinary cherry blossom tree grove; it's also the domain of 97-year-old T\u014demon Sano: Japan's most renowned sakuramori (cherry blossom guardian).\nFor more than a millennium, Japanese people have admired the delicate sakura petals as a symbol of transience and beauty. Today, this national pastime has blossomed into an international obsession, with millions of tourists from across the world descending on Japan to sip seasonal sakura-themed Starbucks drinks and participate in hanami (cherry blossom viewing) picnics and festivals from March to May. But while the world waits with bated breath for the cotton candy-coloured blossoms to burst each spring, one of the most important and least understood roles in the trees' maintenance lies with their behind-the-scenes caretakers.\nAccording to Naoko Abe, cherry blossom expert and author of The Sakura Obsession, skilled sakura arborists have existed in Japan since time immemorial. But thanks to the popularity of the 1970s novel Sakuramori about a sakura-infatuated tree expert, communities began bestowing this title to deserving specialists in the years that followed. Typically a professional gardener or tree surgeon, a sakuramori is a combination of Lorax, botanist and spiritual guide dedicated to studying sakura and promoting their preservation.\nAs Asada Nobuyuki, the secretary general of the Japan Sakura Association, explained, there are roughly 100 sakuramori in Japan today, but one stands out. \"It can be said that T\u014demon Sano is most deserving of the title sakuramori,\" said Nobuyuki, crediting the breadth of Sano's long, productive career and his family's generational wisdom.\nOn a Friday morning earlier this month, I crunched through gravel at this historic sanctuary to meet Sano himself. He is the 16th generation in a distinguished line of farmers who began cultivating the nearby land (known for its late-blooming dwarf cherry trees) in the mid-1600s. When his father died in 1981, he assumed the first name T\u014demon, per family tradition, and took the reins of Uet\u014d Z\u014den, the landscaping firm his family started in 1832 that is headquartered in the garden.\nFor more than 80 years,Sano has utilised his specialised knowledge to steward the survival of sakura trees in gardens throughout Japan and the world \u2013 including at the Isamu Noguchi-designed Japanese garden at the Unesco headquarters in Paris. Sakura Taikan, his most famous book, is the definitive tome on the trees and the culmination of research begun by his grandfather during the\u00a0Taish\u014d period (1912\u20131926).\nBut just before our visit, the nonagenarian became ill and was rushed to hospital. Still, he arranged for me to meet his son, Shinichi Sano, who oversees operations at Uet\u014d Z\u014den and who will one day succeed his father and carry on the family legacy as the next T\u014demon and sakuramori.\nAs we strolled through the garden, Shinichi paused at an umbrella-like shidarezakura (weeping cherry), its swooping branches covered in geisha-blush blossoms. Shinichi said this 40-year-old tree was grown from the seeds of the most iconic sakura in Kyoto: the dramatic weeping cherry tree in Maruyama Park, which was originally grown in the Sano family garden and replanted in its current public spot by T\u014demon's father, the 15th T\u014demon Sano.\nThough sakura have attracted hanami lovers for generations, Shinichi said a major threat now looms over them: climate change. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, cherry blossoms have started to bloom 1.2 days earlier per decade since 1953. A recent study found that the peak bloom of Kyoto's cherry blossoms in 2020, 2021 and 2023 were the earliest in more than 1,200 years.\n\"If global warming continues at this rate, I believe there will eventually be regions in Japan where cherry trees no longer bloom,\" Shinichi said, noting that winters with elevated temperatures could nip blooms in the bud entirely, as trees require a sustained chill to initiate the blossoming process. If this happens, a major part of Japan's springtime tourism appeal would be jeopardised \u2013 as well as an integral part of the nation's cultural identity.\n\"The reason Japanese people are fond of cherry blossoms is because, after enduring a harsh winter, the vivid flowers bloom in the monochrome landscape as if to herald the long-awaited arrival of spring. This quiet presence is what draws people in and resonates deeply in our hearts,\" T\u014demon later told me over email after being released from hospital. \"Out of 365 days a year, the cherry blossoms endure wind and snow for 360 days, only to bloom gloriously for five days before gracefully scattering. I believe this fleeting yet dignified cycle reflects the Japanese perspective on life. There may be a sense of personification in the way we view the cherry blossom, as if it embodies a spiritual or moral belief that, through patience and perseverance, one will eventually bloom.\"\u00a0\nCherry blossoms are integral to the Japanese psyche and soul. In ancient Japan, kami (deities) were said to reside in the trees. Beginning in the 800s, Emperor Saga (whose former residence is up the road from the Sano family garden at Daikaku-ji) ushered in the practice of hanami with official cherry blossom viewing parties. For samurai during the Kamakura period (1185-1333), sakura became a unifying military symbol for the warriors to fall with dignity and grace \u2013 a message echoed during World War Two for kamikaze pilots. In light of this national importance, protecting sakura and ensuring their sustainability is something Japan takes seriously.\nToday, according to Abe, many of the most famous places travellers go to see sakura in Japan, such as Mount Yoshino in Nara and Matsumae Park in Hokkaido, each have a dedicated sakuramori. Interestingly, T\u014demon and his family's unbroken line of Japanese gardeners may not have risen to the level of sakuramori were it not for a British botanist.\nIn 1902, English naturalist Collingwood \"Cherry\" Ingram became fascinated by Japanese cherry trees during his first visit to the nation, but he lamented how industrialisation and cloning had led to a decline in their diversity. In an effort to protect them, he sent 50 endangered varieties back to England and planted them in his garden. When he eventually tried to propagate the varieties back in Japan come the 1930s, including the rare Taihaku cherry that had ceased to be cultivated in Japan, the trees didn't survive long.\nGiven the Sano family's generational expertise, Ingram sought out T\u014demon's grandfather, who developed a way to transport the trees successfully so they wouldn't sprout before arriving in Japan. From that little shipment of Taihaku trees, it is thought that tens of thousands of Tahihaku now flourish across Japan and were saved from national extinction.\nWhere to see T\u014demon Sano's sakura in Kyoto:\nIn addition to admiring T\u014demon's carefully cultivated sakura at Maruyama Park, the Ruriko-in estate, the Katsura and Shugauin imperial villas and the Ninna-ji Temple, visitors can also explore the Sano family garden year-round from 09:00 to 16:00 (best to call ahead at +81 75-871-4202).\nT\u014demon's grandfather became something of a Johnny Appleseed for sakura \u2013 taking grafts and growing saplings, venturing to far-flung places like the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin before he died in 1934. T\u014demon's father then took up the mantle while training his son to continue the family legacy.\nToday, travellers enjoying the mesmerising weeping cherry in Maruyama Park have T\u014demon to thank, as the city asks him to care for the tree throughout the year. Visitors can also admire T\u014demon's work at the Ruriko-in estate, where sakura stand in stunning harmony on the property close to the Golden Pavilion of Kinkakuji; the Katsura Imperial Villa; the Shukaguin Imperial Villa; Ninna-ji Temple garden; and, of course, at the nearby Sano family property.\nEven at 97,\u00a0T\u014demon still collects information on different types of sakura and makes detailed drawings of the blossoms' anatomy from the stamen and pistils to the bracts and peduncles \u2013 all to better understand how to help sakura flourish.\n\"My feelings toward cherry blossoms are something that has been ingrained in my daily life,\" T\u014demon said. \"My daily life follows the old Japanese way of life seik\u014d-udoku, 'working in the fields when it's sunny and reading when it rains'\u2026 If I am asked to preserve rare cherry blossoms, I respond by grafting or sowing seeds.\"\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The 96-year-old painter who saved a village\u00a0\n\u2022 The 89-year-old woman who is still travelling the world solo\n\u2022 Japan's unusual way to view the world\nTo that end, he has successfully propagated cherry trees in the atomic bomb-ravaged soil of Hiroshima and saved a 150-year-old Oshima cherry tree in Yokohama that was destined to be cut down. In that instance, when the local community enlisted him to relocate the storied sakura 100m away to preserve an iconic view of Mt Fuji, he took careful stock of the three layers of soil surrounding the tree. Before digging, T\u014demon ceremonially placed sake and rice crackers in the dirt as an apology for the disruption, added charcoal and provided an octopus offering. Also known to hug trees, T\u014demon embraced the trunk tightly upon its successful replanting.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs I toured the Sano family garden, falling\u00a0cherry petals fluttered to the ground like snowflakes, a phenomenon called sakura fubuki. In addition to kami, the souls of ancestors are also said to reside in the flowering cherry blossoms, connecting\u00a0the Sano family to their forebearers and representing the fleeting nature of each generation.\u00a0Amid this transient beauty, the Japanese concept of\u00a0\"mono no aware\" (the wistful recognition of life's ephemerality and the beauty in that impermanence) feels especially present.\u00a0\n\"Cherry blossoms reflect the way of life of the samurai in the old days: beautiful in the way they fall with grace and dignity,\" Shinichi said. Shinichi's 38-year-old son, Tomoaki, who has started to take over day-to-day responsibilities in the family business, has one child \u2013 a daughter. It would then be possible to have the first female sakuramori in this line.\n\"It will depend on her decision,\" Shinichi said.\nFor now, though, the family is allowing the 16th T\u014demon Sano to focus his attentions on what he does best.\n\"While my father is healthy, he will be the one to take care of the sakura,\" Shinichi said. I then asked if he felt he would one day be ready to assume the role of T\u014demon Sano and sakuramori.\u00a0\n\"I won't really know until I actually become the 17th generation,\" Shinichi said. \"I think I will truly feel the responsibility for the first time when I actually inherit the name\u2026 I'll do what I'm asked to.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "summary": "But this isn't just any ordinary cherry blossom tree grove; it's also the domain of 97-year-old T\u014demon Sano: Japan's most renowned sakuramori (cherry blossom guardian).For more than a millennium, Japanese people have admired the delicate sakura petals as a symbol of transience and beauty. Shinichi said this 40-year-old tree was grown from the seeds of the most iconic sakura in Kyoto: the dramatic weeping cherry tree in Maruyama Park, which was originally grown in the Sano family garden and replanted in its current public spot by T\u014demon's father, the 15th T\u014demon Sano.Though sakura have attracted hanami lovers for generations, Shinichi said a major threat now looms over them: climate change. Visitors can also admire T\u014demon's work at the Ruriko-in estate, where sakura stand in stunning harmony on the property close to the Golden Pavilion of Kinkakuji; the Katsura Imperial Villa; the Shukaguin Imperial Villa; Ninna-ji Temple garden; and, of course, at the nearby Sano family property.Even at 97,\u00a0T\u014demon still collects information on different types of sakura and makes detailed drawings of the blossoms' anatomy from the stamen and pistils to the bracts and peduncles \u2013 all to better understand how to help sakura flourish.T\u014demon SanoT\u014demon is still studying sakura trees at the age of 97 (Credit: T\u014demon Sano)\"My feelings toward cherry blossoms are something that has been ingrained in my daily life,\" T\u014demon said. Japan's 97-year-old cherry blossom guardian17 hours agoShareSaveRoss Kenneth UrkenShareSaveT\u014demon Sano(Credit: T\u014demon Sano)For 16 generations, master gardeners in this one family have dedicated their lives to preserving one of the nation's most cherished \u2013 and highly sought-out \u2013 symbols.Each spring during sakura (cherry blossom) season, the Ninna-ji and Daikaku-ji temples in Kyoto's leafy Ukyo ward are overwhelmed by busloads of tourists who come to snap photos of the temples' blooming cherry trees. From that little shipment of Taihaku trees, it is thought that tens of thousands of Tahihaku now flourish across Japan and were saved from national extinction.Where to see T\u014demon Sano's sakura in Kyoto:In addition to admiring T\u014demon's carefully cultivated sakura at Maruyama Park, the Ruriko-in estate, the Katsura and Shugauin imperial villas and the Ninna-ji Temple, visitors can also explore the Sano family garden year-round from 09:00 to 16:00 (best to call ahead at +81 75-871-4202).T\u014demon's grandfather became something of a Johnny Appleseed for sakura \u2013 taking grafts and growing saplings, venturing to far-flung places like the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin before he died in 1934.",

While all retailers use the exemption, those who sell fast-fashion and cheap goods have seen their sales soar.\nIt has fuelled the rise of Chinese retailers, such as online giants Shein and Temu, which ship low-value packages to the UK and other countries to reach millions of customers.\nSpeaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Paphitis said retailers had been lobbying government \"for a very, very long time\", arguing the rule had had devastating impact \"on our retail landscape and our high streets\".\nHe joined the bosses of Sainsbury's, Currys and the British Retail Consortium in welcoming the government's consultation on the rule.\nUK businesses bringing in larger shipments have to pay taxes, and they also argue that cheaper goods might fail to meet the same environmental and ethical standards that they keep to.\nAside from concerns over unfair competition with domestic retailers, it has also been raised that governments could be missing out on potential tax income.\nThe so called \"de mimimis\" rule has received renewed interest after US president Donald Trump scrapped a similar measure in America amid his escalating trade war with China. \nGoods worth less than $800 into the US will soon be subject to charges, where they were previously exempt. The move has already prompted Chinese retailers to raise their prices.\nIn the UK, there are further concerns that China will dump goods here to avoid the tariffs which Trump has imposed on Chinese goods.\nEarlier this month, the boss of Currys told the Financial Times that the \"single biggest area where lots of stock is likely to land in the UK... is from the likes of Shein, Temu, Alibaba, TikTok shop and, most of all, Amazon marketplace\".\nOn Thursday, Alex Baldock told the BBC he was pleased the government was \"reviewing the low-value shipment loophole, and that they're committed to levelling the playing field between British and overseas retailers\".\nBut the Federation of Small Businesses urged the government to proceed with caution in its de minimis consultation, suggesting that scrapping it might \"ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers\".\n\"With 16% of goods moved by small firms sitting below the \u00a3135 threshold, a decision to scrap it impacts on trading and inflation,\" said Tina McKenzie, chair of the FSB.\n\"It's right to be concerned about potential future dumping of goods, as escalating tariffs applied by bigger global blocs against each other may mean a surge in goods arriving in markets like our own,\" she added.\n\nMr Paphitis told the BBC it was \"absolute nonsense\" that the measure kept inflation and prices down, arguing it led to a loss of jobs and tax revenue for the UK, due to businesses being unable to compete with cheaper foreign rivals.\nHelen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, the trade body for retailers, said the review was \"more critical now\" due to a \"rise in the number of potentially non-compliant products entering the UK market\".\nThe British Independent Retailers Association said small packages having no tax or charges was a key concern. It called on ministers to act to \"deter import surges\" in order to \"protect independent retailers\".\nWhen Sainsbury's announced their latest financial results earlier this month, boss Simon Roberts called on the government to act as soon as possible.\n\"Everyone should pay their tax... so if there's a loophole here which means that's not happening then that needs to be closed so it's a level playing field for everybody,\" he said.",

On-the-day \"Promming\" tickets are \u00a38 including booking fees, and seated tickets start from \u00a310 plus booking fees.\nThe all-nighter, on 8 August, is being planned by organist Anna Lapwood, who said the idea had been several years in the making.\n\"I spend a lot of time at the Albert Hall in the middle of the night, practicing, and I find it fascinating that the building is still just running overnight,\" she says. \n\"There are always people there - cleaners and security guards - a bit like A Night At The Museum. \n\"So we talked about how fun it would be to be able to invite people into that space, both physically, but also the abstract space of being in an iconic building in the middle of the night.\"\nHer programme will include YouTube pianist Hayato Sumino, Russian cellist Anastasia Kobekina and Norwegian ensemble Barroksolistene, whose \"Alehouse sessions\" aim to recreate the atmosphere of a 17th Century English tavern.\nLapwood says the artists are all connected by an enthusiasm for \"messing around\" with music, citing Sumino's viral video of the \"seven degrees of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star\". \n\"There are various moments where we're hoping to do some collaborations,\" she reveals. \"But the logistics of this are all very, very complicated, not least trying to figure out everyone's sleep schedules!\"\nThis summer's season is the first since the departure of Proms director David Pickard. He has been replaced by Hannah Donat who, as director of artistic planning, had shaped the festival alongside the controller of BBC Radio 3, Sam Jackson. \n\"I think of the Proms as the classical music equivalent of Wimbledon,\" she says. \n\"Everyone likes to go to Wimbledon, even if they don't watch tennis for the rest of the year; and everyone likes to go to a Prom, even if they're not going to concerts for the rest of the season.\"\n\"It gives the concerts a warmth and an informal atmosphere. \n\"People don't worry too much about knowing the repertoire inside out - there's just something spectacular about the Albert Hall and seeing the orchestra onstage.\"\n\nAmong the concerts to watch out for are:\n19 July: The Great American Songbook and Beyond with Samara Joy. Fresh from winning best jazz album at this year's Grammys, US singer Samara Joy teams up with the BBC Concert Orchestra for a night of standards by Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holliday.\n20 July: Ravel's Piano Concerto for the Left Hand. The world's only professional one-handed concert pianist, Nicholas McCarthy, makes his Proms debut, playing a concerto originally written for Paul Wittgenstein, after he lost his right arm during World War One.\n26 July: The Traitors. \"I've asked for a cloak and an owl,\" says Claudia Winkelman, ahead of this one-off concert, featuring classical pieces \"with betrayal at their heart\" alongside the gothic re-workings of pop songs heard in the TV reality show.\n2 August: Mahler's Resurrection Symphony. Canadian mezzo-soprano Emily D'Angelo, whose voice has been called \"a thing of wonder\", makes her Proms debut with Norwegian soprano Mari Eriksmoen and the Hall\u00e9 orchestra.\n8 August: 100 Years of the Shipping Forecast. The subtle magic of the Shipping Forecast is celebrated in a special concert, in Belfast's Ulster Hall, featuring Radio 4's continuity announcers and a new work by poet laureate Simon Armitage. \n9 August: The Planets and Star Wars. The National Youth Orchestra play two of the world's most recognisable pieces of orchestral music, with an intergalactic theme.\n10 August: Edward Gardner Conducts the LPO. Taking a journey through icy waters and cascading waterfalls, the London Philharmonic present a quartet of pieces, including Debussy's La Mer and Sibelius's Oceanides - with an aquatic theme. Electrifying mezzo-soprano Aigul Akhmetshina joins in, for her Proms debut.\n14 August: Joe Hisaishi and Steve Reich. Legendary Studio Ghibli composer Joe Hisaishi makes his Proms debut conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in two large-scale works exploring themes of destruction and loss - including his piece The End of the World, reflecting the \"anxiety and chaos\" after the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York.\n23 August: M\u00e4kel\u00e4 conducts Mahler's Fifth. Finnish conductor Klaus M\u00e4kel\u00e4 isn't yet 30, but his electrifying performances have already made headlines around the world. He comes to the Proms with the Dutch Concertgebouw Orchestra, to play Mahler's leonine fifth symphony.\n7 September: Angelique Kidjo - African Symphony. \"I want to show the world the richness and beauty of African culture,\" says the Beninese-French music icon Angelique Kidjo of her return to the Proms. Part of Bradford's City of Culture programme, her concert will highlight iconic tracks from legends including Miriam Makeba, Fela Kuti and Youssou N'Dour.\nThe season concludes with the traditional \"Last Night\" on 13 September, conducted by Elim Chan.\nSoprano Louise Alder and trumpeter Alison Balsom will make star turns, alongside the traditional medley of sea shanties, Pomp and Circumstance and Auld Lang Syne.\nThe concert will also include Donat's favourite \"Easter egg\" for her first year in charge.\n\"There's a piece of music that I'd wanted to get into the Proms for some time,\" she says, referring to Arthur Benjamin's Storm Cloud Contata.\nThe music was originally written for Alfred Hitchcock's spy thriller The Man Who Knew Too Much in 1934; and re-arranged by Bernard Herrmann for Hitchcock's Hollywood remake in 1956.\n\"The final scene takes place in the Albert Hall,\" explains Donat, \"and while Jimmy Stewart's chasing this assassin around the building, Bernard Herrmann is conducting the orchestra on stage - and that's the piece we're including in the Last Night of the Proms. \n\"It's one of those little winks to the audience that I like to include during the season.\"\nFor those who cannot attend, all of the concerts will be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 and BBC Sounds, and 25 of the nights will be televised.",

        "article_text": "Arsenal are the only English team to have won the Women's Champions League - doing so in 2007 when the competition was known as the Uefa Women's Cup\nUefa Women's Champions League: Lyon v Arsenal\nVenue: Groupama Stadium Date: Sunday, 27 April Kick-off: 17:00 BST\nCoverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app\nArsenal are down, but they're definitely not out of their Women's Champions League semi-final against eight-time winners Lyon.\nThe Gunners had more shots, more possession and more touches inside their opponent's box in the first leg, but ultimately it was Lyon who left Emirates Stadium with a 2-1 lead.\nNow, Renee Slegers' side must overturn a deficit in France on Sunday if they are to reach their first Champions League final since 2007, the season in which they won the title.\nThey face a stiff task though, with Lyon unbeaten in the Champions League this season, having conceded just three goals in nine games. They have only been knocked out twice in 15 years after winning the first leg in the knockout stage and on those occasions it was to the now redundant away goals rule.\nWhile Chelsea's hopes of a first European trophy have been left hanging by a thread after their 4-1 first-leg defeat in Barcelona, there is belief Arsenal can still turn things around to ensure there is at least one English team in the final.\n\"This isn't 4-1. It's a completely different narrative, Arsenal are still in it. It's a completely different conversation,\" former Gunners defender Jen Beattie said.\nBut how exactly can Arsenal turn it around against a team that have reached the final of the Champions League 11 times in 15 years?\nBompastor set for 'biggest challenge' of career\nWomen\u2019s Champions League: Can Chelsea and Arsenal fight back?\nThis video can not be played\nWhy Arsenal must 'go for it' against Lyon\nIt wasn't so long ago that Arsenal put five goals past Lyon on French soil.\nPlaying under Jonas Eidevall - before Slegers had joined as his assistant manager - the Gunners outclassed the reigning champions in the group stage in 2022.\nCaitlin Foord, Frida Maanum and Beth Mead, who all started for Slegers on Saturday, were on the scoresheet.\nBut Arsenal lacked that ruthlessness against Lyon last Saturday, with Mead, Maanum, Foord and Alessia Russo missing multiple chances.\n\"Arsenal showed enough in this first leg to take confidence,\" ex-England defender Anita Asante told the Football News Show.\n\"They really dominated the ball, they had control in the final third, created a number of chances and they just missed some of that cutting edge.\"\nKadidiatou Diani beat Arsenal's offside trap to get behind their defence and she made no mistake with a crisp finish for a 17th-minute opener.\nAnd just as the hosts had pulled level through Mariona Caldentey's spot-kick, Lyon split their backline open with Ada Hegerberg pulling Leah Williamson out of position to open up space for Melchie Dumornay, who darted into the box and lifted the ball over Manuela Zinsberger.\n\"Lyon under Joe Montemurro are not afraid to not have the ball.

When contacted by the BBC,  The Atlantic had no comment. \nThe interview comes a month after Mr Goldberg published a story about being added to a secret group chat on the encrypted texting app Signal. In the text chain, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and other top US officials discussed the details of an upcoming attack against the Houthis. \nThe scandal rocked the White House. Then, in April, the New York Times and others reported that Hegseth had shared information about the same military action in a second private Signal group chat, which included his wife, brother and personal lawyer.\nTrump has continued to stand by his defence secretary and others involved in the incident, telling reporters earlier this week: \"Pete's doing a great job ... Everybody's happy with him.\" \nHegseth's wife, Jennifer Rauchet, is a former Fox News producer and holds no official position within the Pentagon. \nHis brother, Phil, and personal lawyer Tim Parlatore, both hold positions at the Department of Defense. But it is not clear why any of the three would require advanced warnings about sensitive US strike plans.\nThe White House repeatedly has played down the scandals, claiming no \"classified\" information was shared with the Atlantic editor in the first chat. That thread included information about the exact timings of the air strikes as well as the weaponry being used, before the attack had taken place. ",

It will be open for 24 hours.\nThe children's images were shared by parents who are part of the Parents' Network.

This is a massive issue globally.\n\"There was nothing that gave us any indication that there was a problem.\" \nMark Kenevan, whose son Isaac died aged 13 in 2022, said: \"All we're asking is... please help us protect our children.\"\nA coroner ruled that Isaac died as a result of misadventure, but the Kenevans say social media platforms were also to blame.\nLisa Kenevan, Isaac's mother, said the families banding together had given them strength.\n\"Our voices are getting stronger, and we're not going to go away,\" she said.\nThe Kenevans filed a wrongful death lawsuit against TikTok in the US earlier this year alongside three other British families.\nThe lawsuit accuses the platform of pushing dangerous prank and challenge videos to children to boost engagement time.\nMeta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has said it shares the goal of keeping teens safe online. The firm said it had recently introduced \"teen accounts\" with enhanced protections.\n\"We believe teens deserve consistent protections across all the different apps they use - not just our platforms,\" Meta said in a statement.\nIn the UK on Thursday, the media regulator Ofcom published measures intended to improve protections for children online, including requiring tougher age checks and more robust action to prevent children accessing harmful content.\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

Guardiola was not among them. He shook his head, ranted at his coaches on the bench, then launched a tirade towards the nearby fourth official.\nGuardiola was booked for his emotive reaction but he felt wronged. He was still shaking his head forcefully, his face set like stone, as the replay was shown on the big screen at the exact moment he returned to his seat after half-time.\nThen there was a demand for more noise, gesturing to all parts of the ground for City's fans to turn up the volume, and a familiar sink to the knees as James McAtee's delicate lob dropped just the wrong side of the post.\nFinally there was the tension release of Matheus Nunes' injury-time winner. Guardiola reacted as though he had scored himself, acknowledging the noise from the fans he wanted more from earlier.\nThere was a storming of the pitch as the whistle blew, a hug - tight - for Nunes, a laugh and a joke with Kevin de Bruyne, who at the weekend revealed his manager had not even made an offer for him to stay at the end of the season.\nMake no mistake, this win was big.\n\"You don't have to be a scientist to realise that we were playing against Aston Villa, one of the best teams, as you saw against Newcastle and PSG,\" said Guardiola.\n\"They are an extraordinary team but we performed as we did in the past with the commitment.\n\"Qualification for the Champions League is important, of course, but sometimes we have to be calm. We must focus on the semi-final and after we have days to prepare for the four 'finals'.

Against Villa it would be Nunes, signed from Wolves for \u00a353m in September 2023 when a plan to bring in Lucas Paqueta from West Ham had to be aborted, who turned into a right-back rather than his central midfield scheming role.\n\"If you told me at the beginning of the season that at the end of it we would be fighting for the FA Cup final or to qualify for the Champions League with Nico and Matheus at full-back, I'd say: 'What are you talking about?'\" said Guardiola.\n\"Matheus is a person that is incredibly loved. When you talk with the journalists he's always so serious but in the locker room he's always laughing.\n\"He has physicality for when he has to run and sustain the wingers. Step by step he has been so important.\"\nIt's another puzzle solved for Guardiola. Another solution found.\nIt will be fascinating now to see if City can keep alive their hopes of domestic silverware alive.\nThey have failed to win at least one trophy only three times since they won the FA Cup in 2011 to end their long wait for success.\nSince Guardiola's first season in 2016-17, City have always won at least one of the three domestic competitions on offer.\nIn theory, the supporters have never had it so good.\nBut many are not happy. Protests against ticket prices took place again before kick-off.\nThose running the club argue the finance generated allows Guardiola to have the squad he demands. The fans do not agree - and Guardiola agrees with them.\n\"I am on the side of the people,\" he said. \"I'm a supporter for Manchester City as well.\n\"I don't have to pay [for] the tickets but I understand the feeling.\n\"When I go to the theatre or to a concert and I pay for the ticket, I want to see something I like.\n\"We want them here and we want a full stadium every time.\"\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\nGet Manchester City news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "A medieval cemetery unearthed near Cardiff Airport is continuing to confound archaeologists, as the mysteries surrounding it are multiplying.  \nThe discovery of the site, dating to the 6th or 7th Century, was announced last year, with dozens of skeletons found lying in unusual positions with unexpected artefacts.\nNow researchers have learned nearly all of those buried in the cemetery are women, and while their bones show signs of wear and tear - indicating they carried out heavy manual work - there are also surprising signs of wealth and luxury.\nAnother unexpected find has been a woman tossed in a ditch, in stark contrast to all  the other people who were buried with great care.\n\"Every time we think we understand something, something else crops up and the picture gets more intriguing,\" said Andy Seaman from Cardiff University, who is leading the project.\nAbout half the site, which lies in an unremarkable field in the grounds of Fonmon Castle, has now been excavated.\nSo far researchers have found 39 adult skeletons lying in graves carved out of the thick limestone bedrock. A full analysis is still ongoing, but it's thought that all apart from one are female.\n\"I'm not entirely sure what it means just yet,\" said Dr Seaman.\n\"It could be that it's something particular about this community, or it could be that this is perhaps just one cemetery within a broader kind of landscape or it might be that there's more men in another part of the cemetery.\" \nThe skeletons of two children have also been found - a surprisingly small number given the high infant mortality of the time. Their burials also have some intriguing features.\n\"The earth that's been used to backfill the grave looks slightly different to that in the adults' graves,\" explained Dr Marion Shiner, an archaeologist from Cardiff University.\n\"It's darker and seems more organic, so potentially some time had elapsed between the burial of the adults and the burial of these two children - it's more mystery.\"\nArtefacts at the site are also adding to the puzzle of who these people were.\nShards of pottery and fine, etched glass unearthed in the graves were most likely brought to the cemetery by people feasting while they visited the dead.\n\"Glass is rare, and where it is found these are sites of quite significant status,\" said Dr Seaman.\n\"It was probably made in the Levant - the Egypt area - and then was manufactured into vessels, we think, in southern France, and probably arrived here alongside wine in barrels.\"\nThe presence of these items suggest this was no ordinary community. And each person here has been buried with painstaking care, some laid flat, others crouching, all facing from east to west.\nThe team don't yet know why the woman flung into the ditch was treated so differently, but believe she could have been an outcast or a criminal.\nThey have taken her bones to the lab at Cardiff University to try to find out more about her.\nOsteologist Dr Katie Faillace says she thinks the woman was in her late 30s or early 40s. \nHer skeleton shows a healed fracture to her arm, while her tooth was infected and had an abscess, which exposed the roots and must have been painful.\n\nTen of the skeletons are also now undergoing more detailed analysis.\nThe results show the people buried in the cemetery aren't all from the immediate area - they come from all over Wales and possibly from the south-west of England too.\nFurther DNA analysis will also reveal whether any of them were related.\nThe team are particularly interested in the skeletons' teeth.\nBecause of the way teeth grow, they provide a unique record of everything someone has eaten from the time they are weaned right through to their death.\n\"They've been eating a very consistent diet based on lots of carbs - but not a lot of meat,\" said Dr Faillace. \"And that's true from their childhood into their adulthood, and that's something we're seeing across the population.\n\"But there was no fish whatsoever. As soon as the Romans leave, we see an absence of fish signals in the diet. It's one of the big mysteries.\"\nThe dig is continuing this summer and the archaeologists will start to unearth the other half of the cemetery.\nAndy Seaman is hoping to be able to answer the questions the site has thrown up.\n\"We're hoping to tell the story of the individuals within the cemetery, but also the broader community,\" he said.\n\"We know a lot about the lives of kings and queens, but much less about everyday people. And never before really have we been able to explore a single community in so much detail and all the interesting inter-relationships.\"\nBut for the moment there are still many contradictions that remain unsolved.\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

It's a real family affair, with Benn's sisters and cousin also joining him in camp.\nHaving spent 12 years of his childhood in Mallorca, Benn speaks fluent Spanish to the locals in the gym.\nWhen the training session begins, however, the laughter stops. There is noticeable shift in mindset \u2013 a sign of just how serious Benn is approaching this fight.\nHe says he is \"leaving no stone unturned\" as he fights for the family name \u2013 and to prove his own worth - in this bloodline rivalry.\n\"I've got a chip on my shoulder about [people] saying I'm the nepo kid, that I had it easy,\" he adds.\nBut this is no longer about fathers. Benn's reputation amongst boxing fans has been stained.\nAlthough he has been cleared to fight by an anti-doping panel, they feel he should be more transparent about the reasons behind the failed test.\nBenn says he has been \"cleared three times\" and is reluctant to dwell on the past. \nNigel, meanwhile, speaks more openly about the impact it had on them both, saying \u00a31m was spent on the legal battles.\nThe former super-middleweight champion says he is not a drinker but would consume \"half a bottle of red wine every night\" during the period as his mental health issues worsened, while his son turned to therapy to get through the dark times.\n\"I was watching my son really crying in my arms, heartbroken. I just knew [he was innocent],\" Nigel adds.\n\"Because [if he was] I would let the public know, I'd say, 'Mate, yeah, sorry mate, he's done this'. But I know he hasn't and I will stand with my son.\"\nNigel Benn was a two-weight world champion during his boxing career\nBenn taps into modern-day training methods by sporting an oxygen mask during cardio to simulate high-altitude training.\nHe expertly talks about nutrition, saying in the past he was \"eating curries and pop-tarts\" after weigh-ins.\nThere is something quite comical about the way he unintentionally reels his past takeaway order in the style of Smithy from sitcom Gavin and Stacey.\n\"I'd have prawn puri for starters, lamb rogan josh, Bombay potatoes with some saag aloo, peshwari naan, all the poppadoms, pilau rice, saag paneer,\" Benn says.\nThere is no doubt he is now living the life of an elite athlete.\nBut so much has happened outside of the ring that we have forgotten, or perhaps never had the opportunity to truly find out, how good a boxer Benn actually is. \nBefore his ban, he was on a roll with early stoppage victories over past-their-prime Chris Algieri and Chris van Heerden.\nHis two fights in America since the cancelled Eubank bout \u2013 points wins over Rodolfo Orozco and Peter Dobson - have been rather unspectacular.\nBenn is a vastly improved fighter from the novice dropped by French journeyman Cedrick Peynaud in 2017.\nHowever, with around 20 amateur bouts in Australia before he turned pro, how costly has the time out of the ring \u2013 not to mention the mental scars inflicted by the doping scandal \u2013 been on Benn's boxing apprenticeship?\nBenn has been sparring the likes of IBF super-middleweight champion William Scull and undefeated middleweight Bruno Surace.\nNigel raves enthusiastically about a particularly \"mind-blowing\" sparring session against an unnamed top-level fighter which left him too excited to sleep.\n\"I'm 99% sure he will [beat Eubank] within four rounds,\" Nigel predicts.\nIs this a case of rose-tinted dad glasses or an unbiased analysis from one of the best British fighters ever?\nWorld-title challenger Eubank has fought at a significantly higher level. Although a stipulation prevents Eubank from gaining more than 10lb on fight night, he is still the more natural at the weight. \n\"Yes, I am jumping up two weight divisions. Yes, that brings its challenges,\" Benn says.\n\"And yes his CV's better, but the difference between me and him is he's lost every time he stepped up. I haven't.\"\nBenn believes that \"people see this as a 50/50\" contest, even though Eubank is the bookmakers' favourite.\n\"I must be delusional or people just don't know what they're dealing with,\" he says.\n\"Because I see it being a one-sided beatdown. I see it being so ferocious, so dangerous that people are wincing as I'm landing my shots.\n\"I can't see it any other way.\"\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said Russia and Ukraine \"are very close to a deal\", hours after his envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks in Moscow.\nTrump said it had been a \"good day\" of negotiations, while the Kremlin described the talks - which Ukraine was not present at - as \"constructive\".\nEarlier, Trump said on social media that \"most of the major points are agreed to,\" and urged Russia and Ukraine to meet \"at very high levels\" and \"to finish it [the deal] off\".\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his video address late on Friday that \"real pressure on Russia is needed\" to accept an unconditional ceasefire.\nEarlier in the day, Zelensky told the BBC that territorial issues between Kyiv and Moscow could be discussed if a \"full and unconditional ceasefire\" was agreed upon.\nReports suggest Ukraine would be expected to give up large portions of land annexed by Russia under a US peace proposal. \nTrump - who spoke to reporters as he arrived in Rome for Saturday's funeral of Pope Francis - has said he would support Russia keeping the Crimean peninsula, which was illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014. Zelensky rejects this idea.\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Moscow currently controls almost 20% of Ukrainian territory.\nOn Friday, traffic was halted in Moscow as a convoy of cars carrying Witkoff arrived ahead of the high-level talks, the fourth such visit he has made to Russia since the start of the year.\nThe three-hour talks were described as \"very useful\" by Putin aide Yuri Ushakov.\nIt had brought the \"Russian and US positions closer together, not just on Ukraine but also on a range of other international issues\", he said.\n\"Specifically on the Ukrainian crisis, the possibility of resuming direct talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives was in particular discussed,\" he added.\nEarlier this week, Putin signalled for the first time since the early stages of the war that he was open to talks with Zelensky.\nHis remarks were believed to be in response to a proposal by the Ukrainian president for a 30-hour Easter truce to be extended for 30 days. No truce has yet been agreed on.\nKyiv has been on the receiving end of growing pressure from Trump to accept territorial concessions as part of an agreement with Moscow to end the war.\nCrimea has become a particular flashpoint.\nZelensky has repeatedly rejected the idea of recognising the peninsula as part of Russia, telling reporters in Kyiv on Friday: \"Our position is unchanged - only the Ukrainian people have the right to decide which territories are Ukrainian.\"\nHowever, in later remarks he suggested to the BBC that \"a full and unconditional ceasefire opens up the possibility to discuss everything\".\nHe also referenced comments made by Trump in an interview with Time magazine, in which the US president said \"Crimea will stay with Russia\".\n\"What President Trump says is true, and I agree with him in that today we do not have enough weapons to return control over the Crimean peninsula,\" Zelensky said.\nWashington's peace plan has not been publicly released, but reports suggest it proposes Russia keeps the land it has gained - a condition that is in Moscow's favour.\nOn Friday, Reuters news agency reported it had seen US proposals handed to European officials last week, as well as subsequent counter-proposals from Europe and Ukraine.\nIt said there are significant disparities between them.\nThe US deal offers American legal acceptance of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and de facto recognition of Russian control of other occupied areas, including all of the Luhansk region.\nBy contrast, the Europeans and Ukrainians will only discuss what happens to occupied Ukrainian territory after a ceasefire has come into effect.\nThe US plan also rules out Ukraine's membership in the Nato military alliance, according to Reuters.\nAs the meeting between Witkoff and Putin was taking place, Trump claimed talks were going in the right direction.\n\"They're meeting with Putin right now, as we speak, and we have a lot of things going on, and I think in the end we're going to end up with a lot of good deals, including tariff deals and trade deals,\" he told reporters in the US.\nHe said his aim was to bring about an end to fighting in Ukraine which he said was claiming the lives of 5,000 Ukrainian and Russians a week, adding he believed \"we're pretty close\" to a peace deal.\nTrump also said Zelensky had not signed the \"final papers on the very important Rare Earths Deal with the United States\". \n\"It is at least three weeks late,\" he said, adding that he hoped it would be signed \"immediately\".\nThe long-talked of minerals deal, which would give the US a stake in Ukraine's abundant natural resource deposits, was meant to be signed in February but was derailed after an acrimonious meeting between Trump and Zelensky in Washington.\nRussia and Ukraine's positions in securing a peace deal still seem miles apart, with no representative from Ukraine invited to take part in the talks in Moscow.\nWriting on social media on Friday, Zelensky criticised Russia for failing to agree to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the US on 11 March and urged allies to apply more pressure to it.\n\"It's been 45 days since Ukraine agreed to President Trump's proposal for quiet in the sky, sea and the frontline,\" he said. \"Russia rejects all this. Without pressure this cannot be resolved. Pressure on Russia is necessary.\"\nHe said Russia was being allowed to import missiles from countries such as North Korea, which he said it then used in a deadly missile strike on Kyiv on Thursday, which killed 12 people and injured dozens.\n\"Insufficient pressure on North Korea and its allies allows them to make such ballistic missiles. The missile that killed the Kyiv residents contained at least 116 parts imported from other countries, and most of them, unfortunately, were made by US companies,\" Zelensky alleged.\nFollowing the attack on Kyiv, Trump said he was \"putting a lot of pressure\" on both sides to end the war, and directly addressed Putin in a post on social media, saying: \"Vladimir STOP!\"\nSince then, however, Trump has blamed Kyiv for starting the war, telling Time magazine: \"I think what caused the war to start was when they [Ukraine] started talking about joining Nato.\"\nAhead of the talks between Witkoff and Putin, a senior Russian general was killed in a car bomb attack in the Russian capital.

        "summary": "Russia and Ukraine 'very close to a deal', says Trump12 hours agoShareSaveAlys DaviesBBC NewsShareSaveReutersTrump told reporters a deal was close as he arrived in Italy for Pope Francis's funeralUS President Donald Trump has said Russia and Ukraine \"are very close to a deal\", hours after his envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks in Moscow.Trump said it had been a \"good day\" of negotiations, while the Kremlin described the talks - which Ukraine was not present at - as \"constructive\".Earlier, Trump said on social media that \"most of the major points are agreed to,\" and urged Russia and Ukraine to meet \"at very high levels\" and \"to finish it [the deal] off\".Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his video address late on Friday that \"real pressure on Russia is needed\" to accept an unconditional ceasefire.Earlier in the day, Zelensky told the BBC that territorial issues between Kyiv and Moscow could be discussed if a \"full and unconditional ceasefire\" was agreed upon.Reports suggest Ukraine would be expected to give up large portions of land annexed by Russia under a US peace proposal. Zelensky rejects this idea.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Moscow currently controls almost 20% of Ukrainian territory.Why Zelensky can't and won't give up CrimeaOn Friday, traffic was halted in Moscow as a convoy of cars carrying Witkoff arrived ahead of the high-level talks, the fourth such visit he has made to Russia since the start of the year.The three-hour talks were described as \"very useful\" by Putin aide Yuri Ushakov.It had brought the \"Russian and US positions closer together, not just on Ukraine but also on a range of other international issues\", he said. \"It is at least three weeks late,\" he said, adding that he hoped it would be signed \"immediately\".The long-talked of minerals deal, which would give the US a stake in Ukraine's abundant natural resource deposits, was meant to be signed in February but was derailed after an acrimonious meeting between Trump and Zelensky in Washington.Russia and Ukraine's positions in securing a peace deal still seem miles apart, with no representative from Ukraine invited to take part in the talks in Moscow.Writing on social media on Friday, Zelensky criticised Russia for failing to agree to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the US on 11 March and urged allies to apply more pressure to it. \"What President Trump says is true, and I agree with him in that today we do not have enough weapons to return control over the Crimean peninsula,\" Zelensky said.Washington's peace plan has not been publicly released, but reports suggest it proposes Russia keeps the land it has gained - a condition that is in Moscow's favour.On Friday, Reuters news agency reported it had seen US proposals handed to European officials last week, as well as subsequent counter-proposals from Europe and Ukraine.It said there are significant disparities between them.The US deal offers American legal acceptance of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and de facto recognition of Russian control of other occupied areas, including all of the Luhansk region.By contrast, the Europeans and Ukrainians will only discuss what happens to occupied Ukrainian territory after a ceasefire has come into effect.The US plan also rules out Ukraine's membership in the Nato military alliance, according to Reuters.What would it mean for Ukraine to temporarily give up land?As the meeting between Witkoff and Putin was taking place, Trump claimed talks were going in the right direction. The missile that killed the Kyiv residents contained at least 116 parts imported from other countries, and most of them, unfortunately, were made by US companies,\" Zelensky alleged.Following the attack on Kyiv, Trump said he was \"putting a lot of pressure\" on both sides to end the war, and directly addressed Putin in a post on social media, saying: \"Vladimir STOP!",

        "article_text": "He had tea with the Queen, was blessed by the Pope and spread Hawaiian culture across the globe. More than a century later, a festival dubbed the \"Olympics of hula\" honours his legacy.\nSilence engulfed the audience at Edith Kanaka'ole Stadium in Hilo, Hawai'i, as a group of hula dancers appeared on stage. They moved gracefully in unison, rhythmically depicting a scene of an ancient Hawaiian myth as they bellowed mele (chants). The hula performance, which was part of the annual Merrie Monarch Festival, wasn't a mere spectacle; it was a powerful celebration of Hawaiian culture \u2013 and for years, it was banned.\nThe week-long\u00a0Merrie Monarch Festival (which takes place 20-26 April 2025 and is celebrating its 62nd anniversary) has been called the \"Olympics of hula\"\u00a0and perpetuates the sacred, centuries-old practice of dancing and chanting that preserves and portrays our native Hawaiian language, history, religion and culture. Every year, thousands of Hawaiians descend on the Big Island to attend the event, while thousands more watch live broadcasts of Hawai'i's 23 best h\u0101lau (hula groups) compete on TV. Yet, the festival is more than just a hula contest; its dance performances, arts and craft exhibitions, and a royal parade through downtown Hilo is considered the biggest display of Hawaiian culture in the world.\n\"It's the one week out of the year where we celebrate being Hawaiian,\" said K\u016b Kahakalau, a Hawaiian language and culture expert. \"And it's all thanks to the undertakings of King Kal\u0101kaua.\"\nFondly dubbed \"The Merrie Monarch\", King David La'amea Kal\u0101kaua was the last king of Hawai'i. He ruled the Kingdom of Hawai'i from 1874 until his death in 1891, but his ascension to the throne was nothing short of contentious. Shortly after the death of King Kamehameha IV, whose family had ruled the kingdom since 1795, Hawai'i's legislature\u00a0decided to elect a native\u00a0ali'i\u00a0(noble chief) instead of the king's widow. The decision incited a full-blown riot. As the queen's supporters stormed the Honolulu courthouse, British and American sailors stationed at Honolulu harbour were called in to quell the fighting and Kal\u0101kaua took the oath of office the following day.\nBy the time of Kal\u0101kaua's reign, Native Hawaiian heritage was at great risk. Christian missionaries had begun arriving on the islands in 1820, introducing diseases that killed Native Hawaiians, converting islanders away from our traditional polytheistic religion and infiltrating the political system to suppress local culture and beliefs. One of the most significant ways they did this was by banning public performances of the hula, a dance missionaries deemed \"vile heathen chants\".\nKal\u0101kaua sought to restore a unified sense of national pride among Hawaiians, and his reign marked a period of cultural renaissance across the islands. He lived by the motto Ho'oulu L\u0101hui\u00a0(Increase the Nation) and sought to remake Hawai'i for Hawaiians \u2013 all of which resulted in the revival of traditional customs such as language, music, arts and traditional medicines that had long been suppressed during the missionary-influenced era of his predecessors. One of his crowning achievements was preserving the hula. As Kal\u0101kaua famously proclaimed: \"Hula is the language of the heart, and therefore the heartbeat of the Hawaiian people.\"\u00a0\nTo many people around the world, \"hula\" may conjure images of tiki bars, plastic dancers shaking their hips on car dashboards or something that only happens at beachside resorts. But long before hula was commodified and appropriated, it was a sacred dance among Native Hawaiians \u2013 an ancient practice that served as an archive of our stories, beliefs and way of life. Prior to the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, there was no written language in Hawai'i. Instead, ancient Hawaiians used oral tradition and hula to pass on their identity and culture from one generation to the next. Even when practice was prohibited, Hawaiians took hula underground, continuing to teach the forbidden dance in secret in caves and far-flung areas.\nAs part of Kal\u0101kaua's Ho'oulu L\u0101hui\u00a0policy, hula experienced a resurgence. In fact, the king's lavish two-week coronation ceremony was essentially a celebration of Native Hawaiian culture, featuring traditional music, hula and l\u016b'au \u2013\u00a0all of which had previously been banned. To commemorate his 50th birthday three years later,\u00a0ho'opa'a\u00a0(chanters) and\u00a0'\u014dlapa\u00a0(dancers) performed in public for the first time in years, while a parade wound its way through downtown Honolulu. Today, the Merrie Monarch Festival pays tribute to the proud sense of Hawaiian identity Kal\u0101kaua revived.\n[Kal\u0101kaua] was deeply committed, proud and knowledgeable about his Hawaiian heritage,\" said Kahakalau, noting that the king was also the first person to have the Kumulipo (a creation chant that also includes the genealogy of Hawaiian royalty) written down.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nYet, Kal\u0101kaua wasn't just content to revive Hawaiian customs in Hawai'i; he wanted to share the Kingdom's culture around the world. So, in 1881, the \"Merrie Monarch\" continued the proud Hawaiian tradition of long-distance seafaring by\u00a0spending 281 days circumnavigating the globe, becoming the first head of state to travel around the world.\nDuring Kal\u0101kaua's international diplomacy tour, he was greeted by the Emperor of Japan to the sounds of\u00a0Hawai'i Pono'\u012b\u00a0(the Kingdom's national anthem, which Kal\u0101kaua had written); he proposed immigration policies with Chinese politicians; he toured the Great Sphinx with the Khedive of Egypt; he was blessed by Pope Leo XIII in Rome; he had tea with Queen Victoria of England, and he boarded a train that was struck by a bull in Spain. In New York, Kal\u0101kaua met with Thomas Edison to discuss the possibility of getting electricity to Honolulu. In 1886, the king's wish came true.\u00a0'Iolani Palace\u00a0(which is now a museum and the only royal residence in the United States), became illuminated with electric lights \u2013 five years before the White House did.\n\"He was able to build important relationships, create liaisons, and sign treaties with multiple countries [that benefitted our people],\" said Kenneth \"Aloha\" Victor, a kumu hula (master hula teacher) and designer of Kaulua'e, a made-in-Hawai'i clothing and lifestyle brand. In addition to sending envoys to Europe and Asia, Kal\u0101kaua maintained consulates and legations in more than 130 cities across the globe. The Kingdom had 13 consulates in Great Britain alone.\nBack at home, during an era of increased literacy, Kal\u0101kaua met with traditional na kahuna (priests) and na kapuna (elders) to compile many of the ancient Hawaiian myths and chants that are portrayed through hula and mele and write them in Hawaiian. In 1888, he took things one step further and translated these stories into English for the first time in the book, Legends and Myths of Hawai'i, which he often presented as gifts to foreign dignitaries so they'd get a better understanding of Hawai'i, its culture and its people.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The word embodying the spirit of Hawai'i\n\u2022 A lei maker's guide to the real Honolulu\n\u2022 Hawaii's ancient land management system\nKal\u0101kaua's mission to integrate Hawai'i with the rest of the world also resulted in the creation of the Hawaiian Youths Abroad Program, in which the king selected young Hawaiians whom he felt could become future leaders of the Kingdom and sent them abroad to study things like medicine, law, engineering, foreign languages and art.\u00a0More than 100 years later, the programme's legacy still echoes across the islands: Princess Abigail Kaw\u0101nanakoa, the granddaughter of one of the students the king sent abroad, played an instrumental role in restoring 'Iolani Palace and was a staunch supporter of native Hawaiian rights until her death in 2022.\nA multi-hyphenate in every sense of the word, Kal\u0101kaua embraced modernity just as much as he valued Hawaiian culture. He was a voracious inventor, designing blueprints for tornado-proof ships, fish-shaped torpedoes, sealed bottle caps and rangefinder scopes. He even had a telephone installed that connected 'Iolani Palace where he lived and worked to his private boathouse less than a mile away, where he'd often be found hosting royal l\u016b'aus\u00a0for foreign dignitaries and heads of state.\nFor Hawaiians today, Kal\u0101kaua is much more than just a Renaissance man. \"When Kal\u0101kaua travelled [abroad], he promoted and shared our culture with the world,\" said Ana Kon, a Hawaiian cultural specialist based in Hilo. \"It's why, more than a century later, we continue to honour his legacy today at the Merrie Monarch Festival.\"\nFor those unable to snag tickets to the Merrie Monarch Festival's highly coveted hula competitions, there are still plenty of opportunities to participate in the festivities. Hilo's Afook-Chinen Civic Auditorium and Butler Buildings host a vibrant arts and crafts fair featuring the creations of more than 150 local artisans and brands from across Hawai'i. \"Our 'aloha wear' is a celebration of hula,\" said Victor, of his clothing, which he said honours the people, places and movements in Hawaiian culture.\nOf course, Kal\u0101kaua's legacy lives on beyond the festival. In many ways, every hula step, l\u016b'au gathering and Hawaiian-language phrase is a nod back to our last king's efforts to revive our customs at home and introduce them around the world. Visitors can experience this first hand at O'ahu's Polynesian Cultural Center, which hosts a traditional Hawaiian l\u016b'au paying homage to Queen Lili'uokalani (Kal\u0101kaua's sister, who succeeded him until white businessmen\u00a0overthrew the Kingdom in 1893), while the Queen Emma Summer Palace\u00a0in Honolulu offers contemporary hula lessons for adults.\nOn Maui, immersive experiences at the\u00a0Grand Wailea\u00a0include an E Ala E\u00a0oli\u00a0(chant) in the mornings on the beach, while interactive language lessons teach guests how to pronounce words in\u00a0\u02bb\u014clelo Hawai'i\u00a0(Hawaiian). Beachside resorts like\u00a0Outrigger Reef in Waikiki Beach are adopting a regenerative tourism approach at its A'o Cultural Center by allowing guests to meet traditional Hawaiian navigators and canoe builders, teaching them how to use traditional Hawaiian tools and \u2013 yes \u2013 participate in hula lessons.\n\"It all spawns back to [King Kal\u0101kaua's] creed,\" said Victor. \"That hula is the heartbeat of our Hawaiian people.\"\nCORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this story stated that\u00a0US sugar planters overthrew the Kingdom of Hawai'i.

        "article_text": "Andrew Flintoff has given his first account of the car crash he was in while filming Top Gear, saying he thought he \"was dead\" in the immediate aftermath.\nThe England cricketer-turned-TV presenter sustained serious facial and rib injuries when the three-wheeler car he was driving for the BBC motoring programme rolled over in 2022.\nSpeaking in a new Disney+ documentary, 'Freddie' Flintoff said that despite the trauma, he \"remembers everything about it\".\n\"I thought I was dead, because I was conscious but I couldn't see anything,\" he recalled.\n\"I was thinking, is that it? Is that it? You know what I mean? Just black for the rest of my days?\n\"My hat came over my eyes - so I pulled my hat up and I thought, no I'm not [dead], I'm on the Top Gear track, this is not heaven.\"\nFlintoff then looked down to see blood, and said his \"biggest fear\" was that he no longer had a face left.\n\"I thought my face had come off. I was frightened to death.\"\nHe recalled being in \"agony\" for between half an hour and 40 minutes until an air ambulance arrived and he was taken to hospital.\nThe incident took place on 13 December 2022 at Top Gear's test track at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome in Surrey.\nHe was driving an open-topped Morgan Super 3 when it flipped and slid, dragging him along the track during filming.\nSpeaking in the documentary, he described how time seemed to slow down as the car rolled over, and how his quick reactions as a cricketer allowed him to move his head in an attempt to avoid even worse injuries.\n\"As it started going over, I looked at the ground and I knew, if I get hit here on the side [of the head] then I'll break my neck, or if I get hit on the temple I'm dead. The best chance is to go face down.\n\"And then I remember hitting [the ground] and my head got hit,\" he added. \"But then I got dragged out, and the car went over, and I went over the back of the car, and then [I got] pulled face down on the runway about 50m underneath the car. And then I hit the grass and then [it] flipped back.\"\nSurgeon Jahrad Haq, who treated Flintoff, told the documentary the injuries were \"very complex\" - a mixture of hard and soft tissue injuries, broken teeth, lost teeth and elements of the upper jaw bone that were also fractured and displaced.\nHe \"lost a really significant portion of his upper lip - the skin and some of the underlying muscle - and also his lower lip,\" he said.\nMr Haq said the injuries were in the \"top five\" in terms of severity of those he had seen during his career.\nReflecting on the recovery, Flintoff said he \"didn't think I had it in me to get through\" the ordeal.\n\"This sounds awful. Part of me wishes I'd been killed. Part of me thinks I wish I'd died,\" he added.\n\"I didn't want to kill myself. I don't want to mistake the two things. I was not wishing, but thinking, this would have been so much easier...\n\"Now I try to take the attitude, you know what, the sun will come up tomorrow, and then my kids will still give me a hug, and I'm probably in a better place now.\"\nOne of England's most successful cricketers, Flintoff previously said he is \"loving\" his return to the sport coaching England Lions - the development squad underneath England Men's cricket team.\nFlintoff's wife Rachael told the documentary his return to the sport was crucial on the road to recovery. \n\"When Andrew needed it most, cricket was there for him,\" she said. \"It sounds a bit weird saying it, a bit over the top to say, but I do think cricket saved him. It gave him a reason for being, again.\"\nThe 47-year-old also returned to television last year with a second series of his BBC programme Freddie Flintoff's Field of Dreams, which saw him take a team of young cricketers from his hometown of Preston on a tour of India, a year after his crash.\nThe acclaimed series is up for a Bafta Television Award in the factual series category next month.\nHe also hosted a reboot of darts game show Bullseye over Christmas, which will return for a full series later this year.\nIn 2023, the BBC \"rested\" Top Gear for the foreseeable future. A financial settlement was also reached with Flintoff.\nThe documentary, titled Flintoff, is on Disney+ from Friday, 25 April.",

        "article_text": "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) - set up to cut US government spending - claims to have saved, on average, more than $10bn a week since President Trump entered office.\n\"We're talking about almost $200bn and rising fast,\" Trump told the BBC when talking about Mr Musk's cost-cutting drive on 23 April.\nDoge's website says it is focusing on cancelling contracts, grants and leases put in place by previous administrations, as well as tackling fraud and reducing the government workforce.\nBBC Verify has looked at the agency's biggest claimed savings, examining the figures and speaking to experts.\nOur analysis found that behind some of the large numbers, there is a lack of evidence to back them up.\nIn October, Mr Musk pledged to cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the federal government budget. He subsequently halved this target and on 10 April talked about making savings of $150bn from \"cutting fraud and waste\" by the end of the next financial year in 2026. \nThe US federal budget for the last financial year was $6.75tn.\nDoge publishes a running total of its estimated savings on its website - which stood at $160bn the last time the site was updated on 20 April.\nHowever, less than 40% of this figure is broken down into individual savings.\nWe downloaded the data from the Doge website on 23 April and added up the total claimed savings from contracts, grants and leases. \nOur analysis found only about half of these itemised savings had a link to a document or other form of evidence. \nUS media has also highlighted some accounting errors, including Doge mistakenly claiming to have saved $8bn from cancelling an immigration contract which in fact had a total value of $8m.\nDoge says it is working to upload all receipts in a \"digestible and transparent manner\" and that, as of 20 April, it has posted receipts \"representing around 30% of all total savings\". It also lists some receipts as being \"unavailable for legal reasons\".\nBBC Verify examined the four largest savings listed on the Doge website which had receipts attached.\nThe department claims these add up to $8.3bn, but after examining the evidence provided and speaking to people familiar with federal contracts, this figure appears to be overstated.\nFor three of the savings, Doge links to documents on the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). This is a database which records contracts given out by the US government.\nThe documents show a contract's start and end date, the maximum amount the government has agreed to spend, and how much of that has been spent.\nDavid Drabkin, a federal contracts expert who helped develop the FPDS database, said the maximum figure listed should be treated with caution. \n\"FPDS does not reflect the actual paid price until some period of time after the contract has been completed and the contract actions have been recorded,\" he says.\n\"For example, when buying research and development into a vaccine no one really knows how much that's going to cost - so when a price is set, it's not a definite price but rather an upper limit.\"\nSo if Doge counts the maximum figure, that can represent projected spending over a number of years, rather than a direct saving from the country's yearly spending.\nDoge's largest listed individual saving is $2.9bn. \nIt comes from cancelling a contract - which started in 2023 under President Biden - for a facility in Texas to house up to 3,000 unaccompanied migrant children.\nDoge appears to have taken the \"total contract value\" until 2028 - the end date listed - and subtracted the amount spent so far to get the $2.9bn figure. \nBut the contract was reviewed annually, meaning renewing it until 2028 was not guaranteed.\nA source familiar with this contract - who spoke on condition of anonymity - told BBC Verify that Doge's figure is \"based on speculative, never-used figures\" and that the actual spending depended on how many children were placed at the facility and the services they required.\n\"In truth, the government never incurred those costs and could never reach that ceiling amount. The real, documentable savings from early termination were approximately $153 million\", they estimated.\nThey say this figure comes from tallying up the $18m per month fixed running costs (for things like staffing and security at the facility) from February - when Doge announced the cut - to November - when the contract was subject to annual review.\nThey also told us that the site - which closed on the same day as the Doge announcement  - never reached its maximum capacity of 3,000 children, and about 2,000 stayed at the Texas facility at its peak, before numbers fell significantly as border crossings decreased.\nWe contacted the Administration for Children and Families and the Department for Health and Human Services which awarded the contract but are yet to hear back.\nThe second largest saving listed by Doge comes from cancelling a contract between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and an IT company called Centennial Technologies which it claims was worth $1.9bn.\nThe document which Doge links to has a total contract value of $1.9bn and all of the other cost fields, including the amount already spent, are for $0.\nHowever, Mr Drabkin told us this does not necessarily mean that nothing had been spent on the contract.\nHe said several government departments have poor recording keeping, meaning the amount spent during some contracts might not always be updated in a timely fashion.\nThe contract start date is listed as August 2024 and was estimated to run until 2031.\nHowever, Centennial Technologies' CEO told the New York Times that the agreement had actually been cancelled last autumn during the Biden administration. \nThe company did not respond to our requests for further comment.\nAnother IT contract, this time with the Department of Defense, is the third largest claimed saving.\nDoge says $1.76bn was saved by cancelling a contract with an IT services company called A1FEDIMPACT. \nOn the contract document, the total value is listed as $2.4bn. An online database of government contracts called Higher Gov says this amount was the ceiling value.\nAgain, there is $0 recorded for the amount that had been spent at the time the contract was terminated.\nIt is unclear where Doge's figure of $1.76bn comes from - we have asked the Pentagon and the supplier about it.\nThe fourth largest claimed saving of $1.75bn comes from cancelling a USAID grant to Gavi, a global health organisation, which campaigns to improve access to vaccines.\nDoge links to a page on USASpending.gov. It shows a grant was paid to Gavi in three instalments, during the Biden administration, totalling $880m.\nGavi confirmed that $880m had been paid out by USAID but said it had not been told the grant had been terminated.\n\"Gavi has not received a termination notice related to this grant,\" a spokesperson told us.\nWe have not found any evidence for the $1.75bn saving claimed by Doge, and a source familiar with the contract said it was unclear where it comes from.\nWe asked the USAID Office of Inspector General about the grant but it did not respond to us.\nWhile Doge may have cut a significant amount of government spending, the lack of evidence provided for its biggest claimed savings makes it impossible to independently confirm exactly how much.\nDoge does not have a press office but BBC Verify has contacted the White House to ask for more evidence of these claimed savings. \nAdditional reporting by Ned Davies and Alison Benjamin.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

All that went through my head. I told [sports psychiatrist] Steve Peters that and he said 'I'm coming - I will get you through the first match'.\n\"I was quite a bit scared coming and playing.

I just couldn't correct it and every time you make a change you think 'this is terrible'.\n\"I've changed my alignment, changed certain things. I had lost all connection with the cue, the timing had gone, the touch had gone, feeling had gone.

It was a nice feeling and I did enjoy being out there.\n\"I didn't feel too nervous because my expectation levels were maybe just to get a few frames and see where we go. I didn't feel pressure and normally when I come here with a half-decent game I feel pressure more as it is a chance to go deep [into the draw], but on this occasion I wasn't expecting to do much.\n\"I'm going to give myself two years. No more exhibitions, no more distractions off the table. It might take one month, six months, a year and give it a good go. I owe it to snooker and to myself. I just have to put everything into this tournament.\"\nCarter felt O'Sullivan would claim an eighth world title if he could maintain the form he showed on Wednesday.\n\"No question, no-one can live with that,\" said the world number 18. \"He could've had 10 years off and still come here. He is a freak natural, that's why you love to watch him - he played fabulously well.\n\"When the opponent is potting all the balls every mistake is highlighted and you just have to sit and watch and hope. He looks like he is in a good place and he is the man to beat.\"\nJohn Parrott, the 1991 world champion, speaking on BBC Two, added: \"There should be a sign in the foyer which should say 'Quiet please, genius at work'.\n\"We use the word 'genius' in sport with people like Lionel Messi and players like Tiger Woods in his pomp.

        "article_text": "Nearly 50,000 people queued in less than 24 hours to pay their respects to Pope Francis, whose body is being displayed in an open coffin at St Peter's Basilica, the Vatican says. \nEntry to the church in Vatican City was due to stop at midnight local time (22:00 GMT) on Wednesday, but opening hours were extended to accommodate large crowds gathered outside. \nPublic viewing continued on Thursday.\nThe Argentine pontiff died on Monday at the age of 88 after suffering a stroke. He had spent five weeks in hospital earlier this year receiving treatment for double pneumonia.\nPope Francis was the first Latin American leader of the Catholic Church and held the role for 12 years.\nRed-robed cardinals and white-clad priests escorted the Pope's coffin from his residence to the basilica on Wednesday. \nBells tolled during the 40-minute procession, while the crowd broke into applause - a traditional Italian sign of respect.\nSwiss Guards, who are responsible for the Pope's safety, escorted his coffin to the church's altar.\nPublic viewing began at 11:00 local time on Wednesday. \nSoon after, the queue was already eight hours long, according to Italian media. By mid-afternoon, tens of thousands of people were lining the square.\nAt midnight, when the church was supposed to close for the night, there was still a very long queue of people wanting to pay their respects.\nPolice in the Vatican had told the BBC that St Peter's Basilica would stay open all night so that a large crowd gathered on the square could file past the coffin.\nViewing continued until 05:30 on Thursday, then closed for an hour and a half, before reopening at 07:00. \nThe Pope's body will lie in state in the church until Friday evening, when his coffin will be sealed during a liturgical rite at 20:00, the Vatican said.\nThe ceremony will be overseen by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who is the Pope's \"camerlengo\" or chamberlain and runs the Vatican until a new Pope is chosen. \nLuis and Macarena, from Mexico, had come to Rome for their honeymoon and hoped to see the Pope, who gives a special blessing to newlyweds. Luis told the BBC seeing the Pope's final resting place would allow them to feel a connection.\n\"Pope Francis is a saint and he will bless us from heaven,\" Luis said.\nMary Ellen, an American who lives in Italy, said she had come to the Vatican on an overnight train to \"say goodbye\".\n\"I love Papa Francesco,\" she said. \"Because he's humble, kind, he loves immigrants. I know he's put up with a lot of difficult things in the Vatican. He's fought against power and the power of the Vatican to be a true Christian, true Catholic.\"\nShe said when she passes the coffin, she will be praying and will ask Pope Francis for help with her own work with immigrants.\nInside St Peter's, under the watchful marble eye of popes and saints, a steady stream of people made their way to the Pope's casket to pay their respects.\nSome kneeled while others prayed and crossed themselves, before slowly moving on.\nMany lingered to admire the staggering beauty of the basilica. The atmosphere was quiet and solemn despite the thousands of people present.\nTwo women who waited for five hours to see the Pope said they had arrived at the basilica's queue at 09:00.\nOne told the BBC it was important to her to say goodbye to the pontiff.\n\"All these years I followed all he did and it's as if I travelled all over the world with him, even if I was just at home. He liked going everywhere and prioritises the poor,\" she said.\nAsked what was it like to see him in his coffin, she replied: \"It's just like the man we used to see on TV.\"\nFredrik, who is from Ghana but travelled from Poland, said the Pope had \"done his best\" and \"it is left to us to continue the good works\".\nEva Asensio, a Mexican on holiday in Italy, said she felt an affinity for the Argentine pope. \n\"We saw him as a good Pope \u2013 someone who supported everyone, no matter your sexual orientation, no matter where you came from. He united us,\" she said with tears in her eyes.\nMargaux, who is French and lives in Rome, said it was \"powerful to live this.\" \nTo her, Pope Francis meant \"hope\", and his more progressive social views were \"very important\", she said.\n\"I hope the next Pope will follow his path,\" she said.\nDignitaries from all over the world, including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Prince William, will attend the funeral on Saturday.\nPope Francis left clear instructions that he wanted a smaller ceremony in keeping with his simpler tastes as pontiff. He had arranged for a benefactor to pay for it all.\nUnlike the vast majority of his predecessors, he will not be buried in St Peter's, but in a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary in central Rome, beneath a tombstone inscribed only with his name.\nBefore being moved to St Peter's, Pope Francis had been lying in an open coffin in the chapel of his home, flanked by Swiss Guards and cardinals in prayer.\nHis last public appearance was on Easter Sunday, during which he delivered brief remarks to the masses gathered in St Peter's Square from a wheelchair. \nHe then greeted worshippers and blessed babies as he was driven in a car through the crowds.\nHis Papal apartments have been sealed, marking the start of the period known as the Sede Vacante - or empty seat \u2013  which continues until a new head of the church is elected.\n\nAdditional reporting by Jorge Perez",

        "article_text": "A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing. \nChinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened. \nChinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would \"fight to the end\".\nHere's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs.\nChina is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries.  \nWith more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs.  \nBeijing is still fumbling with the keys because Chinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to \"silver trains\" for travelling retirees, that could change. \nAnd Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential.\nThe leadership may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month.\nChina also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders.\nStill, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.\nThe economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.\nThe Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to \"weather storms together\".\nPresident Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: \"The sky will not fall.\"\nChina has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.   \nUnder Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance. \nIt has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI. \nExamples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which was celebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.\nRecently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI.\nUS companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.   \nChinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate.   \nThat unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term.\nEver since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order. \nIt has pumped billions into a contentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.\nThe expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.\nAmerican farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier. \n\"The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once\u2011captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,\" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute. \nThe US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024.\nThat doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner.\nFollowing reports that the White House will use bilateral trade negotiations to isolate China, Beijing has warned countries against \"reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests\".\nThat would be an impossible choice for much of the world\n\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC last week.\nTrump held firm as stocks plummeted following his sweeping tariffs announcement in early April, likening his staggering levies to \"medicine\".\nBut he made a U-turn, pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days after a sharp sell-off in US government bonds. Also known as Treasuries, these have long been seen as a safe investment. But the trade war has shaken confidence in the assets.\nTrump has since hinted at a de-escalation in trade tensions with China, saying that the tariffs on Chinese goods will \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".\nSo, experts point out, Beijing now knows that the bond market can rattle Trump.\nChina also holds $700bn in US government bonds. Japan, a staunch American ally, is the only non-US holder to own more than that.\nSome argue that this gives Beijing leverage: Chinese media has regularly floated the idea of selling or withholding purchases of US bonds as a \"weapon\".\nBut experts warn that China will not emerge unscathed from such a situation.\nRather, it will lead to huge losses for Beijing's investments in the bond market and destabilise the Chinese yuan.\nChina will only be able to exert pressure with US government bonds \"only up to a point\", Dr Zhang says. \"China holds a bargaining chip, not a financial weapon.\"\nWhat China can weaponise, however, is its near monopoly in extracting and refining rare earths, a range of elements important to advanced tech manufacturing.\nChina has huge deposits of these, such as dysprosium, which is used in magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines, and Yttrium, which provides heat-resistant coating for jet engines.\nBeijing has already responded to Trump's latest tariffs by restricting exports of seven rare earths, including some that are essential for making AI chips.\nChina accounts for about 61% of rare earths production and 92% of their refining, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nWhile Australia, Japan and Vietnam have begun mining for rare earths, it will take years before China can be cut out of the supply chain.\nIn 2024, China banned the export of another critical mineral, antimony, that is crucial to various manufacturing processes. Its price more than doubled amid a wave of panic buying and a search for alternative suppliers.\nThe fear is that the same can happen to the rare earths market, which would severely disrupt various industries from electric vehicles to defence.\n\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" Thomas Kruemmer, director of Ginger International Trade and Investment, told the BBC previously. \n\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial.\"",

Now, scientists are racing to save their work before it's lost.\nSome of them are in the US. Others are scattered around the world. There are hundreds, many even thousands of people involved across multiple networks. And they keep a damn close eye on their phones.\nNo one knows when the next alert or request to save a chunk of US government-held climate data will come in. Such data, long available online, keeps getting taken down by US President Donald Trump's administration. For the last six months or so, Cathy Richards has been entrenched in the response. She works for one of several organisations bent on downloading and archiving public data before it disappears.\n\"You get a message at 11 o'clock at night saying, 'This is going down tomorrow',\" she says. \"You try to enjoy your day and then everything goes wrong. You just spend the night downloading data.\"\nRichards is a data and inclusion specialist, and civic science fellow at the Open Environmental Data Project (OEDP), a non-profit based in Hudson, New York. Her organisation is a founding member of the Public Environmental Data Project (PEDP), which emerged in 2024 to safeguard data under the Trump administration.\nSome of the messages are \"heart-breaking\", says Richards. Scientists sometimes get in touch, desperate to know that data they have spent their professional lives collecting will be rescued. \"You hear the urgency,\" she says. \"You understand that this is someone's X amount of years of research and this is their baby. That's probably why we snap into action.\"\nIn recent weeks, Richards and her colleagues have archived datasets packed with information on US flood hazards, greenhouse gas emissions, energy production and environmental justice, among other subjects. Other researchers have recreated a tool that forecasts the risk of future climate hazards around the US.\nThis rush to safeguard vital environmental data is part of a broader movement to rescue all kinds of scientific data published online by the US government. Biomedical and health researchers working with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for example, have been frantically searching for ways to back up important data following executive orders issued by Trump about what information on gender and diversity may be published by federal bodies.\nScientists have expressed fears about a wide range of resources that might go next \u2013 from historical weather records to data gathered by Nasa satellites. On 16 April, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) announced that a list of datasets regarding ocean monitoring were now scheduled to be removed in early May.\nMultiple organisations including the Internet Archive, a non-profit, Safeguarding Research and Culture,\u00a0and the Data Rescue Project, are now engaged in activities alongside the OEDP to rescue this data from oblivion. Many of the individuals involved in these efforts have pitched in voluntarily. \"It's our library,\" says Richards. \"You gotta save the books, you have to keep it for the future.\"\nShortly after President Trump's inauguration on 25 January 2025, his administration announced sweeping changes to federal departments and agencies, in a bid to reduce what it called \"waste\" and \"inefficiencies\". But many of the programmes and resources currently disappearing are critically important, scientists say. Climate researchers who spoke to the BBC pointed out that some deleted datasets have supported important research on climate change and life-threatening weather extremes, for example.\nWhile government officials also removed information during Trump's first term, meaning scientists had expected similar deletions during his second term, the scale and scope of recent deletions has taken researchers by surprise. One scientist rushed to their university with a plea: \"I said, 'I need disk space, I need it fast, I can't really go through the normal processes [of getting] a grant',\" they recall. Their university quietly made 20 terabytes of storage available, the researcher told the BBC.\nThe scramble to rescue at-risk data before it's too late continues apace. Richards says her organisation has received messages from around 400 would-be volunteers and they are currently \"on-boarding\" around 100 of them. Their work could help preserve data on everything from air quality to coral reefs.\nAmong the tools that the PEDP has replicated on its website is EJScreen, an environmental justice mapping service that reveals communities in the US that may be at heightened risk from environmental hazards such as air pollution. It was removed from the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) website in early February.\nClimate data is often particularly challenging to work with given the huge size of certain datasets \u2013 vast stores of information about our planet that underpin climate models, or weather forecasting systems, for example. But this doesn't deter Richards. \"This is taxpayer-funded research that was already paid for,\" she says. The BBC contacted the White House for a comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.\nWatching all of this unfold \u2013 in many cases in disbelief \u2013 are the scientists who worked to collect this data in the first place.\n\"I have never seen anything like this in nearly 40 years of doing science,\" says Paul Bierman, a geomorphologist at the University of Vermont. \"I think it's an unmitigated disaster.\" Bierman studies landscape change and human interaction with landscapes. He has researched the history of the Greenland ice sheet, showing, for example, that during the Pleistocene epoch 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago, Greenland was covered in tundra and vegetation, rather than a thick ice sheet. It suggests that the ice in Greenland is more vulnerable to a changing climate than we previously understood.\nBierman explains that all of the data that he and his colleagues have collected on National Science Foundation-funded studies gets submitted to data repositories supported by that same US government agency. \"Now I'm wondering, 'Is that the safest place for my data?',\" he says.\nScientists are also worried that efforts to gather new climate data will fall by the wayside. A government report in March suggested that the Trump administration was considering cancelling the lease of the support office for a major carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring research station in Hawaii. The Mauna Loa observatory has been tracking atmospheric CO2 concentrations since 1958 and just last year recorded the largest jump in such levels since records began.\n\"Climate science is only possible because of long-term datasets,\" says Lilian Dove, a US Noaa climate and global change research fellow at Brown University. \"Without continuing to collect that data, preserve that data, our field is in really big trouble.\"\nBoth Bierman and Dove say they have made multiple copies of their scientific data, including in offline stores, as a precaution \u2013 to ensure its survival.\nEric Nost, a geographer at the University of Guelph in Canada, says that the data deletions have far exceeded the many revisions of US government-published information that occurred during Trump's first term, from early 2017 to early 2021. \"We saw the removal of many [web] pages,\" he says. \"We didn't really see datasets removed.\"\nRachel Santarsiero, director of the Climate Change Transparency Project at the National Security Archive, a non-governmental and non-profit organisation, agrees. She adds that, during that first term, mentions of \"climate change\" were often deleted from government websites but scientific data generally remained intact and accessible.\nSantarsiero also notes, however, that \u2013 in principle \u2013 the removal of environmental data resources from public-facing government websites is neither new nor exclusive to the Trump administration. The EPA announced plans to remove its online archive in 2022 while President Joe Biden was in power, for instance. \"Their rationale was it was too costly to keep the archive,\" says Santarsiero.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 'Biological reality': What genetics has taught us about race\n\u2022 How America fell in love with China's memes\n\u2022 Can the Internet Archive save our digital history?\nAnother organisation that is currently working to gather and archive US government data, including climate data, is Safegaur.de. It is run largely by researchers outside the US. William Waites, a computer scientist at the University of Southampton in the UK, is among them. The pace of data deletions in recent months and weeks has been frantic, he says, with some \"scares\" over datasets that were rumoured to be earmarked for removal.\nIn March, word went round that information published by Noaa would disappear within days. Waites and his colleagues swung into action and started downloading multiple terabytes of data. But the rumoured deadline for the deletion came and went. Waites describes the episode as \"a good exercise for getting used to doing this\" and adds: \"It's getting a little bit easier, though, as we become more established and known for doing this \u2013 and have contacts in various organisations\".\nA raft of Noaa programmes are currently at risk as the Trump administration is reportedly considering cutting the agency's funding by 25%. This would remove all funding for research on the impact of climate change on weather, for example.\nThe Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, which captures screenshots of web pages to record what they looked like in the past, is also working to cache government data. This is part of the End of Term Archive project, which records the state of US government websites at the end of presidential administrations. Mark Graham, director of the Wayback Machine, highlights a live public spreadsheet that his colleagues are using to log such captures. The content ranges from information about LGBTQ+ equality matters to geopolitics. Plus, references to vaccines and sexually transmitted diseases were also removed from federal websites shortly after Trump's inauguration.\nMany of the preserved web pages feature climate or environmental information. \"We've seen, by scope and scale, an increase in the material removed from US government websites that is without precedent,\" says Graham.\nDownloading and archiving data in private or non-governmental repositories is something of a double-edged sword, however. On the one hand, it allows archivists to make multiple copies of that data. \"That limits its potential for being destroyed,\" says Lourdes Vera, a sociologist at the University at Buffalo. But Vera, who was arrested in 2020 for stealing and vandalising Trump campaign signs, points out that saving such data on platforms owned by US-based tech companies could be risky, if those companies are later compelled by the government to delete the data.\nMultiple people involved in archiving initiatives expressed a motivation to store the most important information outside of the US. Though many were hesitant to discuss details. When asked whether this is something the Internet Archive is doing, for example, Graham only says: \"The Internet Archive is always looking for responsible ways to help ensure the integrity of data\".\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nThere's another problem, though. When data goes missing from centralised \u2013 and well-known \u2013 government web pages, it's not always obvious to casual internet users that there are organisations out there working to republish it.\n\"You kind of have to know what you're looking for now whereas, in the past, you would have been able to more easily come by [that data] by navigating centralised data systems,\" says Nost.\nIt means an increasing burden not just in terms of safeguarding climate data \u2013 but also in ensuring that the public knows it is still there. And that it matters.\nGiven the relatively small window that humans have to act on climate change, in order to prevent its worst effects, Bierman finds the present situation incomprehensible.\n\"It's stunning to me that, at a time when we're seeing more intense hurricanes, greater rainfall extremities, more drought, more wildfires \u2013 why at that point would we ever imagine cutting the science that is key to addressing those issues, and keeping people safe?\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

I don't think you could ask for better parents.\"\nKnowles is speaking to BBC News ahead of the publication of her new memoir, Matriarch.\nIt covers her childhood in Texas, her daughters' rise to fame and her later years, as a grandmother.\nKnowles now has four grandchildren, including Julez Smith, the son of her younger daughter, singer-songwriter Solange. She also considers herself a grandmother to former Destiny's Child singer Kelly Rowland's children.\nShe says that she sees all her grandchildren regularly, describing them as \"one of the biggest joys in my life\".\n\"[Blue Ivy and I] have a very close bond,\" she says of her eldest granddaughter.\n\"I'm so happy that she feels like she can talk to me,\" she says, adding that Blue Ivy is always giving her advice about taking care of herself.\n\"She's my beauty guru. She's my manager,\" she says.\nI'm intrigued by this, and ask why she calls the 13-year-old her manager.\n\"Well, I don't call her my manager. Everybody else calls her my manager, because she's bossy. She's a little Capricorn like me. So we have that bond.\"\nKnowles grew up in 50s and 60s Galveston, the youngest of seven.\nIn her book, she talks about the harassment her family faced, including from the police.\n\"There was a lot of racial tension,\" she tells me. \"And I think some things have changed, but I still think that black people are more susceptible to police brutality [and] being stopped.\"\nShe met her now ex-husband, Mathew Knowles, in Houston and the pair went on to have two daughters, Beyonc\u00e9 in 1981 and Solange five years later.\nBeyonc\u00e9, she writes, was \"not an easy baby\". Nursery rhymes did not cut it (\"she cried louder\" to drown out Mary Had A Little Lamb), but jazz music would soothe her.\nAs a child, Solange was a \u201csocial butterfly\u201d but Beyonc\u00e9 was shy. \"She walked into every classroom trying to be invisible,\" Knowles writes.\nShe says at the time, her daughters - and all little black girls - were being \"bombarded\" by messages from mainstream culture that they were \"less than\".\nBut Beyonc\u00e9 was always singing, and Solange's talent emerged early on too.\n\"I knew Beyonc\u00e9 had a very beautiful voice, but I didn't know how talented she was until she was seven,\" Knowles tells me.\n\"And Solange probably four, because she just grew up around nothing but music and performances. So she was a lot earlier.\"\nKnowles is adamant that she didn't push her daughters into the music industry.\n\"Absolutely not. This was not my first choice for my girls. They just lived and breathed music,\" she says.\n\"It is their decision. They were born to be entertainers.\"\nNone of them - including Kelly Rowland, who moved in with the family - were very rebellious, she says. All they wanted to do was sing, dance and perform.\n\"I wanted them to have that experience of teenage life and going out to parties and having fun, but I had to force them to do that,\" she says.\nIn the 1990s, the girl group Destiny's Child was formed. It originally comprised Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett, but the final line-up was a trio - Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, and Michelle Williams.\nThe band achieved worldwide fame with mega hits such as Bills, Bills, Bills, Say My Name and Jumpin', Jumpin'.\nKnowles, who ran a hair salon Headliners and had learned dressmaking, made costumes for the group, while Mathew Knowles quit his job to manage them.\nTheir daughters have gone on to forge hugely successful solo careers.\nSolange won a Grammy Award for Cranes in the Sky, while Beyonc\u00e9 has had countless hits including Single Ladies, Crazy in Love, Halo and Irreplaceable.\nShe finally won best album at this year's Grammy Awards - correcting what was widely seen as an historic wrong.\nThe star was recognised for her eighth album, Cowboy Carter, which celebrates and contextualises the black roots of country music.\nIn an Instagram post ahead of her album launch, Beyonc\u00e9 said Cowboy Carter was \"born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcome\" that prompted her to take \"a deeper dive into the history of country\".\nMany interpreted that as a reference to her treatment at the 2016 Country Music Awards, where her performance of Daddy Lessons with The Chicks led to a barrage of criticism - and racism - online.\nKnowles says Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s childhood, growing up in Texas and spending time in Louisiana, influenced her music.\n\"She was very influenced by [Zydeco, a music genre from Louisiana], and that culture and cowboy culture,\" she says.\nShe added it was \"interesting\" to hear some saying Beyonc\u00e9 is \"not country Western\" and shouldn't be making that kind of music.\n\"It is in her. It\u2019s in her right to make whatever music she feels like making.\"\nAs her daughters rose to international fame, they have had to deal with media pressure and trolling - including, Knowles writes, the speculation that Beyonc\u00e9 was faking her pregnancy with Blue Ivy.\nThere was also an infamous argument between Solange and her brother-in-law Jay-Z in an elevator in 2014, which was leaked by celebrity site TMZ.\nKnowles refuses to be drawn on the lift incident.\nBut when asked how she protects her daughters from comments and trolling online, she says it's actually them who protect her.\n\u201cThey are very astute at blocking out the bull and the lies. And do they hurt them? Sure, but they don't even focus on that,\" she says.\n\"While the world is creating lies and mess, my girls are somewhere in the studio or with their kids minding their business and living their best life.\"\nShe refuses to take credit for keeping her daughters grounded.\n\"I didn't keep them on the straight and narrow. They are just very sensible people with balance in their life,\" she says.\nKnowles also opens up in her book about being diagnosed with Stage 1 breast cancer in her left breast, after doctors discovered two tumours.\nShe is now cancer free.\n\"My daughters and my faith carried me through,\" she writes.\nSo what's next for this family of superstars?\nKnowles is optimistic, saying \"the sky's the limit\" when it comes to what her daughters might do next.\nAs for her grandchildren, she says they are being nurtured in \"anything that they want for themselves... but definitely not pushed in the show business\".\nAt just 13, Blue Ivy has already made strides in her career. Last year, she voiced the character of Kiara in The Lion King prequel Mufasa: The Lion King, and she also performed alongside her mother on her Renaissance tour.\nBut Knowles says that's something Blue Ivy had to \"work for\".\n\"Because her mum was like, no, you got time. You got to make sure that, you know, a lot comes with that.\n\"And so if anything, they're being nurtured to be the best human beings they can be. That's first priority.\"\nAs for whether we can expect Matriarch to be adapted into a reality series, Knowles is reticent.\n\"Oh, not a reality series, but you know, I have been talking to people about the movie rights to it and I would love to see a film made,\" she says.\n\"One of my favourite films is the Jacksons' story. Me and my kids watched it so many times and I just think that it'd be great to see that on film.\"\nMatriarch: A Memoir by Tina Knowles is out now.",

Poll workers reported long lines, with two million people casting their ballots last Friday alone. \nWith less than one week to go before election day on 28 April, federal leaders are now in the final stretch of campaigning. \nVoters will consider which party should govern the country amid an ongoing trade war with the US and President Donald Trump's repeated comments about making Canada the 51st US state.\nElections Canada, the organisation which runs federal elections, said 7.3 million Canadians - about a quarter of eligible voters - had cast their ballots, marking a 25% increase from early votes in the previous 2021 election.\nMail-in voting is up as well, with over 754,000 returning their special ballots to the  federal agency. That is more than the 660,000 that did so in 2021. \nLatest polling suggests Liberals have  a 5-point lead over the main opposition Conservative party, as campaigning enters its last stretch. \nLiberal leader Mark Carney held events in Prince Edward Island and Quebec, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre had a rally in Vaughan, a suburb of Toronto, on Tuesday evening.\nCarney, the former central banker of Canada and the UK, has touted his party as the best option to deal with Trump and his tariffs.\n\"Pierre Poilievre has no plan to stand up to President Trump,\" Carney told supporters on Tuesday.\nThe US president has implemented blanket 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, with an exemption on products covered by the USMCA - a North American free trade deal.\nCanada is also hit with global US tariffs on steel and aluminium, and cars.\nThe northern country does a majority of its trade with the US, and the tariffs have already resulted in thousands of temporary layoffs in Canada's auto sector.\nA win for the Liberals would mark a dramatic reversal of fortune for the party, which had been polling at just 20% when former Liberal leader and prime minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation in late January.\nTheir main rivals, the Conservatives, have focused their campaigning on Canadians' desire for change following nine years of leadership under Trudeau.\nAt rallies and events across the country, Poilievre has honed in on issues like housing, crime and the high cost of living, while criticising the Liberals for government overspending.\n\"It's time for the government to start pinching pennies,\" Poilievre said on Tuesday as he unveiled his party's platform, before adding: \"We can choose change.

        "article_text": "Who will be the next pope? The decision could have a profound impact on the Catholic Church and the world's 1.4 billion baptised Roman Catholics.\nIt also promises to be a highly unpredictable and open process for a host of reasons.\nThe College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails.\nWith 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, they are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective.\nFor the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European. \nAnd although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively \"progressive\" or \"traditionalist\".\nFor those reasons, it is harder than ever to predict who will be elected the next pope.\nCould the cardinals elect an African or an Asian pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration?\nHere are some of the names being mentioned as Francis's potential successor.\nNationality: Italian\nAge: 70\nSoftly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis \u2013 making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.\nHaving acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.\nHe is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength.\nBut he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favour in the Republic of Ireland \"a defeat for humanity\".\nThe bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: \"He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\"\nSome 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.\nNationality: Filipino\nAge: 67\nCould the next pope come from Asia?\nCardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience \u2013 meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.\nThe Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals \u2013 which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.\nHe is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.\nHe has opposed abortion rights, calling them \"a form of murder\" \u2013 a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.\nBut in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.\nThe cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.\nAsked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke! It's funny.\"\nNationality: Congolese\nAge: 65\nIt's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\nHe has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.\nHe is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".\nThough Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.\nBut in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\"\nSuch comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.\nNationality: Ghanaian\nAge: 76\nIf chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.\nLike Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.\nAsked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".\nHe was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.\nLike Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.\nA guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.\nLike many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.\nIn a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.\nIn 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised.\nNationality: Hungarian\nAge: 72\nA cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016.\nHe is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church.\nThe archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate.\nErdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis's two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict.\nHis conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the \"illiberal democracy\" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking.\nNationality: Italian\nAge: 83\nOnly cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected.\nThe former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal.\nHis name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said \"death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something\".\nFrancis's words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope.\nNationality: German\nAge: 71\nGermany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too.\nThe Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013.

And although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively \"progressive\" or \"traditionalist\".For those reasons, it is harder than ever to predict who will be elected the next pope.Could the cardinals elect an African or an Asian pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration?Here are some of the names being mentioned as Francis's potential successor.LIVE UPDATES: Follow the latest after the Pope's deathIN PICTURES: Symbolism on show as Pope lies in open coffinEXPLAINER: Key candidates in an unpredictable contest to be the next PopePROFILE: Acting head of the Vatican Cardinal Kevin FarrellPietro ParolinGetty ImagesNationality: ItalianAge: 70Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis \u2013 making him the pope's chief adviser. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. That resignation was rejected by Francis.Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.Marc OuelletReutersNationality: CanadianAge: 80Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that \"Christ is male, the Church is feminine\".Robert PrevostGetty ImagesNationality: AmericanAge: 69Could the papacy go to an American for the first time?Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. He has also spoken against euthanasia.But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke!",

        "article_text": "BBC film critics Caryn James and Nicholas Barber pick their cinema highlights of the year so far, from a brutal war epic to an ambitious period vampire drama.\nThe sharpest American indie film of the year so far, Companion stars Jack Quaid and Sophie Thatcher as a devoted young couple who go to stay with some friends in a Russian tycoon's remote forest getaway. (Rupert Friend has a hilarious cameo as the mulleted oligarch.) As a drunken evening of confessions, suspicions and disagreements unfolds, it seems at first if the film might be a romantic comedy, or maybe a noirish thriller about a robbery gone wrong. In fact, Companion is a science-fiction comedy thriller \u2013 but beyond that, the less you know about the film in advance, the more enjoyable its many ingenious twists and turns will be. Suffice it to say that the big-screen debut of writer-director Drew Hancock is a sparklingly entertaining satire on modern technology and the never-more-relevant topic of how entitled and misogynistic certain insecure young men can be. And it packs all of its ideas into 97 minutes. (NB)\nAs stunning as Ryan Coogler's Black Panther was, he has outdone himself with Sinners. Michael B Jordan is slyly convincing as twins named Smoke and Stack, who return from Chicago to their home town in Mississippi, in the Jim Crow South in 1932, to open a juke joint. With huge ambition and imagination, Coogler swirls familiar genres and tropes into a wholly original film that blurs the real and the supernatural. Sinners is a period piece as well as a vampire film. It is a drama about racism, family, superstition and spirituality, and it comes with passionate sex and exhilarating blues music. Coogler directs with brio, at times creating a phantasmagoria in which robed African musicians appear next to rappers. The first hour is so full of texture it could stand alone as a period film, but the supernatural eventually intrudes, leading to a finale of action, blood and vengeance. Jordan is surrounded by a superb supporting cast, including Delroy Lindo, Wunmi Musaku and Hailee Steinfeld.\u00a0 Sex, blues and vampires at the door? What more can anyone want from a film? (CJ)\nMiranda Yousef's riveting documentary tells the stranger-than-fiction story of Thomas Kinkade, one of the biggest-selling artists in history. Critics dismissed his work as nauseatingly sickly, but in the 1990s and 2000s, there were shops all around the US devoted to Kinkade's sentimental pictures of cosy country cottages. Art for Everybody asks fascinating questions about who gets to decide what counts as legitimate art, and whether some paintings can be more moral than others \u2013 questions that resonate today, in light of the continuing culture wars in the US . But Yousef's delicately balanced and sensitive film is just as fascinating on personal issues as it is on sociopolitical ones. A key part of Kinkade's marketing was his carefully constructed public image as a devoutly Christian, all-American family man, and yet the so-called \"Painter of Light\" had a dark side, too. Did the pressures of being a squeaky-clean Dr Jekyll push him into becoming a self-destructive Mr Hyde? (NB)\nAlex Garland, the writer and director of Civil War, and Ray Mendoza, a veteran who was that film's military advisor, have created a harrowing, visceral, real-time drama that recreates an actual battle between Navy Seals and al-Qaeda jihadists. Garland's virtuoso technique and Mendoza's first-hand experience of war blend in a film of uncompromising focus, which plunges us into the intensity of combat without explanation or backstory. Yet the faces of Joseph Quinn, Will Poulter, Cosmo Jarvis and D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai are enough to capture the fear and determination of being under siege. Creating characters far from the bravado of typical Hollywood war films, the actors depict courage in battle as a terror-filled endurance test. The film immerses us in that feeling. It is loud and intense, relentless in its barrage of grenades and gunfire, and when the cries of pain from the injured men start, they never stop. Warfare is a dazzling technical achievement but much more. Focusing on the personal cost of combat and violence itself rather than the politics of the Iraq conflict, it reinvents the war film with bracing freshness and immediacy. (CJ)\nBarry Keoghan, Christopher Abbott and Colm Meaney star in this dark and bloody western-style thriller about a feud between sheep farmers in remote rural Ireland. Meaney and Abbott (who speak their dialogue in Irish) play a laconic father and son who lose their two prize rams, only to discover that they have been stolen by their neighbour's shiftless son (Keoghan). Accusations are made, simmering resentments reach boiling point, and violence ensues \u2013 but then Christopher Andrews, the film's debut writer-director, rewinds his story and replays it from a revelatory new perspective. Suddenly, a hard-boiled story of crime and retribution becomes an aching tragedy about desperate economic hardship, youthful stupidity, male pride, and the traumas passed down from taciturn fathers to taciturn sons. Bring Them Down is tough to watch but it's beautifully shot, cleverly plotted and stunningly powerful. (NB)\nAlain Guiraudie's (Stranger by the Lake) engaging film is full of surprises. It starts as a drama about Jeremie, a young man returning to his small village in the lush French countryside for a funeral, then becomes a quietly comic take on desire along with a thriller about covering up a murder. The film deftly carries the audience with it through all these turns. Jeremie is an opportunist but also an enigma. He may have had a passion for his former boss and mentor, the village baker, who died. The baker's widow definitely seems interested in Jeremie, who grew up as the best friend of her son, Vincent; he now angrily suspects Jeremie of wanting to sleep with his mother. Jeremie does not want that but he does find himself in a reluctant affair with the local priest. The joke is that so many people lust after the unremarkable Jeremie, and the suspense comes from the small-town eyes and local police wondering what happened when Vincent mysteriously disappears. Misericordia (Latin for mercy) was nominated for eight Cesar awards, the French equivalent of the Oscars, including film and director, but its human comedy lands easily with audiences everywhere. (CJ)\nDeep in the leafy French countryside, a scruffy teenage layabout Totone (Cl\u00e9ment Faveau) has to look after his younger sister Claire (Luna Garret) after the sudden death of their father. His answer to their dire financial problems? Making award-winning luxury cheese. Louise Courvoisier's debut film is a heart-tugging coming-of-age drama, rooted in the soil of the Jura region where she grew up. She offers an earthy insider's view of how strenuous life can be for agricultural workers, and how wrenching it is when carefree youth turns to relentless, responsible adulthood. But she also fashions a warm, romantic, gorgeously scenic and ultimately hopeful tale of underdogs working together in the sunshine to improve their lives. Blessed are the cheesemakers, as Monty Python once put it. (NB)\nA giant, sloppy Great Dane tugs Naomi Watts around the streets of Manhattan, but by the end of this lovely film about affection and grief the physical comedy with the dog seems the least of it. Watts smoothly play Iris, a creative writing teacher whose best friend, Walter, a famous womanising author, kills himself. He leaves her his dog, Apollo, even though she lives in a one-room apartment in a pet-free building. Dealing with Apollo becomes a way for Iris to grapple with her feelings of love and loss for Walter, played by Bill Murray in flashback scenes filled with such wit and tenderness that they have a great impact in spite of his minimal screen time. Based on Sigrid Nunez's eloquent, acclaimed 2018 novel, the film was directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, whose films include the underrated Montana Story (2021) with Haley Lu Richardson and Owen Teague. Avoiding mawkish clich\u00e9s, they have created a gem of a film that is funny and touching whether you are a pet lover or not. Come for the rambunctious Great Dane, stay for the beautifully rendered emotions. (CJ)\nAardman's two greatest heroes are back \u2013 and so is their sneakiest ever adversary, a diabolical penguin named Feathers McGraw. Directed by Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham, the Oscar-nominated Vengeance Most Fowl is chock-full of the qualities that make Wallace & Gromit's farcical adventures so cherished: the painstaking stop-motion claymation, the Heath Robinson-style gadgetry, the winking homages to classic cinema, the gleefully silly British humour, and the deep affection for the characters and their world. Above all, it a treat to see Feathers McGraw, more than 30 years after he was introduced in The Wrong Trousers. But there is more to the Bristol-based studio's new film than the nostalgic whimsy you would expect. When Wallace invents a robotic garden gnome that does all of Gromit's favourite gardening jobs (and that's even before it turns evil), the story takes a canalboat trip into Mission: Impossible territory by addressing fears about artificial intelligence. (NB)\nThe immensely talented director Rungano Nyoni, whose I Am Not a Witch (2017) won a Bafta for outstanding British debut, makes artful, accessible films of great visual panache. Her latest is a clear-eyed drama about cultural and generational conflict. The heroine, Shula, is a cosmopolitan woman recently returned from the city to her village in Zambia. Nyoni conveys this dissonance at once, as Shula drives home from a costume party dressed in a glittery silver helmet and dark glasses (an homage to a Missy Elliott video) and finds her Uncle Fred dead on a dirt road. As the story takes us into the family's traditional funeral rituals, it slowly reveals that Shula and two cousins had been abused by Fred as children, a reality their mothers put aside as they mourn their brother. Nyoni's style is realistic even as she drops in surreal images. The narrative about secrecy and the trauma of sexual assault builds in power right to the end, when Shula recalls a children's television programme and the title of this stunning film finally makes sense.

        "article_text": "Ben and Tatiana Woollaston have forged separate careers in snooker\nBen Woollaston shot into the snooker spotlight with his surprising first-round win against Mark Selby at the World Championship.\nIt was a match between friends and practice partners from Leicester, and one that Selby said before the draw he hoped to avoid.\nWhile Selby coughed up what he described as a \"pathetic\" performance to lose 10-8, Woollaston celebrated arguably the best result of his career in what became a post-midnight finish.\nA first win at the famous Crucible theatre has been a long time coming for Woollaston, who is now 37.\nHe has suffered with chronic fatigue in recent years and said he was so sickly he was \"green\" before the final session against Selby.\nBut if the surname rings a bell, then that might not be entirely down to Ben's snooker achievements alone.\nWife Tatiana is one of the sport's leading referees.\nShe is not allowed to take charge of Ben's matches to avoid any possible accusations of a conflict of interest, but has officiated on many of the sport's big occasions and first appeared at the World Championship in 2020.\nTatiana Woollaston is regarded as one of snooker's top referees\nBen Woollaston turned professional at the age of 17, and, as might be expected, found it tough initially to get the wins to stay on tour.\nHe flitted between professional and amateur ranks, but since 2009 has been a fixture on the main tour.\nIt was while in Germany for the Paul Hunter Classic in 2010 that Tatiana, making her way in the game as a European Billiards and Snooker Association referee, first encountered Ben.\nThey married in 2011.\nTatiana later told BBC Sport: \"I had never heard of him. When we met he was 70 or 80 in the world.\n\"I think it improved him a lot and has given him motivation. Maybe it inspired him.\"\nWoollaston is 44th for now with 2024-25 season earnings of \u00a3139,900... and counting. He has been as high as 25th.\nWorld Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coverage\nQuiz: What happened in round one at the Crucible?\nBen Woollaston won a first minor ranking title in a Players Tour Championship event in Sheffield in 2011, and was one of a number of players with serious promise to emerge at about that time, others including Judd Trump, Jack Lisowski and Anthony McGill.\nHe qualified for the World Championship in 2013, and despite losing in round one to Ali Carter might well have expected to become a Crucible regular.\nHe also reached the 2015 Welsh Open final, where he was beaten by John Higgins.\nLosing in qualifying for the Worlds became a frustrating and difficult habit to break, and returning to the sport's most famous stage this year could be considered overdue.\nThe Woollastons have two sons, and their eldest, 12-year-old Edward, joined Tatiana in the Crucible crowd to see Ben crawl over the line at the end of two gruelling sessions against Selby.\n\"It's amazing for Edward. I don't know how he did it - to watch five hours one night and five hours the next night,\" said Ben Woollaston.\n\"He didn't miss one shot [and] stayed in there during the interval. It's amazing that he did it.\"\nBen's win might have cost Edward some bonus pocket money, however, as he had drawn Selby in a World Championship sweepstake at their snooker club with a \u00a3100 prize up for grabs.\n\"He thought he had a good chance,\" Woollaston said.\nTatiana also works at the head office of clothes retailer Next, with snooker a part-time occupation, but is one of the most respected refs around.\nShe refereed the UK Championship final between Judd Trump and Barry Hawkins at the York Barbican in December.

He has been as high as 25th.World Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coveragePublished1 day agoQuiz: What happened in round one at the Crucible?Published23 hours agoCrucible success a long time in comingBen Woollaston won a first minor ranking title in a Players Tour Championship event in Sheffield in 2011, and was one of a number of players with serious promise to emerge at about that time, others including Judd Trump, Jack Lisowski and Anthony McGill.He qualified for the World Championship in 2013, and despite losing in round one to Ali Carter might well have expected to become a Crucible regular.He also reached the 2015 Welsh Open final, where he was beaten by John Higgins.Losing in qualifying for the Worlds became a frustrating and difficult habit to break, and returning to the sport's most famous stage this year could be considered overdue.The Woollastons have two sons, and their eldest, 12-year-old Edward, joined Tatiana in the Crucible crowd to see Ben crawl over the line at the end of two gruelling sessions against Selby. \"It's amazing for Edward. \"Ben's win might have cost Edward some bonus pocket money, however, as he had drawn Selby in a World Championship sweepstake at their snooker club with a \u00a3100 prize up for grabs.

All that went through my head. I told [sports psychiatrist] Steve Peters that and he said 'I'm coming - I will get you through the first match'.\n\"I was quite a bit scared coming and playing. It's a daunting venue to play at anyway but it's about getting on the bike again and playing and I'm really proud that I've done that.\n\"Even if I had lost, it didn't really matter.

I just couldn't correct it and every time you make a change you think 'this is terrible'.\n\"I've changed my alignment, changed certain things. I had lost all connection with the cue, the timing had gone, the touch had gone, feeling had gone. Years and years of that mounted up and it got to the point where I couldn't play and it got too much.\n\"It got to the point where I couldn't pull the cue forwards and backwards, which was quite scary.\"\nO'Sullivan beat Carter in the Crucible finals in 2008 and 2012\nFour seeded players, including world champions Kyren Wilson and Neil Robertson and last year's runner-up Jak Jones have been eliminated from O'Sullivan's half of the draw.\nChinese qualifier Pang Junxu is his opponent in the second round, although O'Sullivan said he enjoyed his Crucible return because he had not placed any expectations on himself. \n\"This game can humble you so many times,\" said O'Sullivan. \"To play one good session. It was a nice feeling and I did enjoy being out there.\n\"I didn't feel too nervous because my expectation levels were maybe just to get a few frames and see where we go. I didn't feel pressure and normally when I come here with a half-decent game I feel pressure more as it is a chance to go deep [into the draw], but on this occasion I wasn't expecting to do much.\n\"I'm going to give myself two years. No more exhibitions, no more distractions off the table. It might take one month, six months, a year and give it a good go. I owe it to snooker and to myself. I just have to put everything into this tournament.\"\nCarter felt O'Sullivan would claim an eighth world title if he could maintain the form he showed on Wednesday.\n\"No question, no-one can live with that,\" said the world number 18. \"He could've had 10 years off and still come here. He is a freak natural, that's why you love to watch him - he played fabulously well.\n\"When the opponent is potting all the balls every mistake is highlighted and you just have to sit and watch and hope. He looks like he is in a good place and he is the man to beat.\"\nJohn Parrott, the 1991 world champion, speaking on BBC Two, added: \"There should be a sign in the foyer which should say 'Quiet please, genius at work'.\n\"We use the word 'genius' in sport with people like Lionel Messi and players like Tiger Woods in his pomp. This boy is in that [bracket]. It's been over an extended period as well, and when he plays the cue ball sings.\n\"O'Sullivan seems in a very good place.

Guardiola was not among them. He shook his head, ranted at his coaches on the bench, then launched a tirade towards the nearby fourth official.\nGuardiola was booked for his emotive reaction but he felt wronged. He was still shaking his head forcefully, his face set like stone, as the replay was shown on the big screen at the exact moment he returned to his seat after half-time.\nThen there was a demand for more noise, gesturing to all parts of the ground for City's fans to turn up the volume, and a familiar sink to the knees as James McAtee's delicate lob dropped just the wrong side of the post.\nFinally there was the tension release of Matheus Nunes' injury-time winner. Guardiola reacted as though he had scored himself, acknowledging the noise from the fans he wanted more from earlier.\nThere was a storming of the pitch as the whistle blew, a hug - tight - for Nunes, a laugh and a joke with Kevin de Bruyne, who at the weekend revealed his manager had not even made an offer for him to stay at the end of the season.\nMake no mistake, this win was big.\n\"You don't have to be a scientist to realise that we were playing against Aston Villa, one of the best teams, as you saw against Newcastle and PSG,\" said Guardiola.\n\"They are an extraordinary team but we performed as we did in the past with the commitment.\n\"Qualification for the Champions League is important, of course, but sometimes we have to be calm.

Against Villa it would be Nunes, signed from Wolves for \u00a353m in September 2023 when a plan to bring in Lucas Paqueta from West Ham had to be aborted, who turned into a right-back rather than his central midfield scheming role.\n\"If you told me at the beginning of the season that at the end of it we would be fighting for the FA Cup final or to qualify for the Champions League with Nico and Matheus at full-back, I'd say: 'What are you talking about?'\" said Guardiola.\n\"Matheus is a person that is incredibly loved.

        "article_text": "A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing. \nChinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened. \nChinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would \"fight to the end\".\nHere's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs.\nChina is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries.  \nWith more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs.  \nBeijing is still fumbling with the keys because Chinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to \"silver trains\" for travelling retirees, that could change. \nAnd Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential.\nThe leadership may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month.\nChina also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders.\nStill, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.\nThe economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.\nThe Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to \"weather storms together\".\nPresident Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: \"The sky will not fall.\"\nChina has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.   \nUnder Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance. \nIt has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI. \nExamples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which was celebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.\nRecently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI.\nUS companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.   \nChinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate.   \nThat unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term.\nEver since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order. \nIt has pumped billions into a contentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.\nThe expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.\nAmerican farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier. \n\"The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once\u2011captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,\" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute. \nThe US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024.\nThat doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner.\nFollowing reports that the White House will use bilateral trade negotiations to isolate China, Beijing has warned countries against \"reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests\".\nThat would be an impossible choice for much of the world\n\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC last week.\nTrump held firm as stocks plummeted following his sweeping tariffs announcement in early April, likening his staggering levies to \"medicine\".\nBut he made a U-turn, pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days after a sharp sell-off in US government bonds. Also known as Treasuries, these have long been seen as a safe investment. But the trade war has shaken confidence in the assets.\nTrump has since hinted at a de-escalation in trade tensions with China, saying that the tariffs on Chinese goods will \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".\nSo, experts point out, Beijing now knows that the bond market can rattle Trump.\nChina also holds $700bn in US government bonds. Japan, a staunch American ally, is the only non-US holder to own more than that.\nSome argue that this gives Beijing leverage: Chinese media has regularly floated the idea of selling or withholding purchases of US bonds as a \"weapon\".\nBut experts warn that China will not emerge unscathed from such a situation.\nRather, it will lead to huge losses for Beijing's investments in the bond market and destabilise the Chinese yuan.\nChina will only be able to exert pressure with US government bonds \"only up to a point\", Dr Zhang says. \"China holds a bargaining chip, not a financial weapon.\"\nWhat China can weaponise, however, is its near monopoly in extracting and refining rare earths, a range of elements important to advanced tech manufacturing.\nChina has huge deposits of these, such as dysprosium, which is used in magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines, and Yttrium, which provides heat-resistant coating for jet engines.\nBeijing has already responded to Trump's latest tariffs by restricting exports of seven rare earths, including some that are essential for making AI chips.\nChina accounts for about 61% of rare earths production and 92% of their refining, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nWhile Australia, Japan and Vietnam have begun mining for rare earths, it will take years before China can be cut out of the supply chain.\nIn 2024, China banned the export of another critical mineral, antimony, that is crucial to various manufacturing processes. Its price more than doubled amid a wave of panic buying and a search for alternative suppliers.\nThe fear is that the same can happen to the rare earths market, which would severely disrupt various industries from electric vehicles to defence.\n\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" Thomas Kruemmer, director of Ginger International Trade and Investment, told the BBC previously. \n\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial.\"",

        "article_text": "Andrew Flintoff has given his first account of the car crash he was in while filming Top Gear, saying he thought he \"was dead\" in the immediate aftermath.\nThe England cricketer-turned-TV presenter sustained serious facial and rib injuries when the three-wheeler car he was driving for the BBC motoring programme rolled over in 2022.\nSpeaking in a new Disney+ documentary, 'Freddie' Flintoff said that despite the trauma, he \"remembers everything about it\".\n\"I thought I was dead, because I was conscious but I couldn't see anything,\" he recalled.\n\"I was thinking, is that it? Is that it? You know what I mean? Just black for the rest of my days?\n\"My hat came over my eyes - so I pulled my hat up and I thought, no I'm not [dead], I'm on the Top Gear track, this is not heaven.\"\nFlintoff then looked down to see blood, and said his \"biggest fear\" was that he no longer had a face left.\n\"I thought my face had come off. I was frightened to death.\"\nHe recalled being in \"agony\" for between half an hour and 40 minutes until an air ambulance arrived and he was taken to hospital.\nThe incident took place on 13 December 2022 at Top Gear's test track at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome in Surrey.\nHe was driving an open-topped Morgan Super 3 when it flipped and slid, dragging him along the track during filming.\nSpeaking in the documentary, he described how time seemed to slow down as the car rolled over, and how his quick reactions as a cricketer allowed him to move his head in an attempt to avoid even worse injuries.\n\"As it started going over, I looked at the ground and I knew, if I get hit here on the side [of the head] then I'll break my neck, or if I get hit on the temple I'm dead. The best chance is to go face down.\n\"And then I remember hitting [the ground] and my head got hit,\" he added. \"But then I got dragged out, and the car went over, and I went over the back of the car, and then [I got] pulled face down on the runway about 50m underneath the car. And then I hit the grass and then [it] flipped back.\"\nSurgeon Jahrad Haq, who treated Flintoff, told the documentary the injuries were \"very complex\" - a mixture of hard and soft tissue injuries, broken teeth, lost teeth and elements of the upper jaw bone that were also fractured and displaced.\nHe \"lost a really significant portion of his upper lip - the skin and some of the underlying muscle - and also his lower lip,\" he said.\nMr Haq said the injuries were in the \"top five\" in terms of severity of those he had seen during his career.\nReflecting on the recovery, Flintoff said he \"didn't think I had it in me to get through\" the ordeal.\n\"This sounds awful. Part of me wishes I'd been killed. Part of me thinks I wish I'd died,\" he added.\n\"I didn't want to kill myself. I don't want to mistake the two things. I was not wishing, but thinking, this would have been so much easier...\n\"Now I try to take the attitude, you know what, the sun will come up tomorrow, and then my kids will still give me a hug, and I'm probably in a better place now.\"\nOne of England's most successful cricketers, Flintoff previously said he is \"loving\" his return to the sport coaching England Lions - the development squad underneath England Men's cricket team.\nFlintoff's wife Rachael told the documentary his return to the sport was crucial on the road to recovery. \n\"When Andrew needed it most, cricket was there for him,\" she said. \"It sounds a bit weird saying it, a bit over the top to say, but I do think cricket saved him. It gave him a reason for being, again.\"\nThe 47-year-old also returned to television last year with a second series of his BBC programme Freddie Flintoff's Field of Dreams, which saw him take a team of young cricketers from his hometown of Preston on a tour of India, a year after his crash.\nThe acclaimed series is up for a Bafta Television Award in the factual series category next month.\nHe also hosted a reboot of darts game show Bullseye over Christmas, which will return for a full series later this year.\nIn 2023, the BBC \"rested\" Top Gear for the foreseeable future. A financial settlement was also reached with Flintoff.\nThe documentary, titled Flintoff, is on Disney+ from Friday, 25 April.",

The vast majority of YouTube's estimated 14.8 billion videos have almost never been seen. Until now.\nOn 23 April 2005, YouTube posted its first video; 19 awkward seconds of the platform's co-founder describing elephants at the zoo. But 20 years later, YouTube has moved from its amateur roots to such a behemoth that the company says it's the new Hollywood. YouTube is the world's number one TV streaming service, where users clock billions of hours of watching every day. Leading YouTubers regularly outperform big-name studios. For comparison, an estimated 823 million cinema tickets were sold across all of the US and Canada in 2024. Meanwhile, MrBeast's most successful video alone racked up 762 million views, about one watch for every 10 people on earth. \u00a0\nThat's the vision of YouTube the company promotes \u2013 slick, professional, entertaining and loud \u2013 but from one perspective, it's all a fa\u00e7ade.\nThrough another lens, the essence of YouTube is more like this video from 2020. Before I watched, it had only been seen twice. A man points the camera out of his bedroom window as a flurry breaks out in the dead of winter. \"Here it is,\" he says. \"The falling snow.\" The sound of a TV plays in the background. A bird lands on a nearby fence. 19 minutes go by. Nothing happens.\n\"The conversations we're having about YouTube are based on an impoverished view of what the platform really is,\" says Ryan McGrady, senior researcher at the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, US. \"When we just focus on what's popular, we miss how the vast majority of people actually use YouTube as uploaders, and overlooking the role it plays in our society.\"\nI spent the last month dipping into one of the first truly random samples of YouTube ever collected outside the company. I saw a side of the internet that sometimes feels lost, one full of pure, unvarnished self-expression. It's an entire world that YouTube's all-seeing algorithm won't show you.\n\"YouTube isn't just a vehicle for professionals,\" McGrady says. \"We rely on it as the default video arm of the internet. YouTube is infrastructure. It's a critical tool that regular people use to communicate.\"\nYouTube turns 20\nFor more on the world's biggest video platform, read our stories on:\n\u2022 YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know\n\u2022 The YouTube videos that changed the way we think about ourselves\n\u2022 How a tiny village became India's YouTube capital\nTo unveil this side of YouTube, McGrady and his colleagues built a tool that dials videos at random. The scraper tried more than 18 trillion potential URLs before it collected a big enough sample for real scientific analysis. Among the findings, the researchers estimate that the median video has been watched just 41 times. Posts with more than 130 views are actually in the top third of the service's most popular content. In other words, the vast majority of YouTube is practically invisible.\nMost of these videos aren't meant for us to see. They exist because people need a digital attic to store their memories. It's an internet unshaped by the pressures of clicks and algorithms \u2013 a glimpse into a place where content doesn't have to perform, where it can simply exist.\n12 years ago, a woman from the US named Emily posted a YouTube video called \"sw33t tats\". I learned it's even older than that, recorded around 2008. In the video, Emily, who asked to withhold her full name, sits in her college dorm room. She pries her mouth open as her younger sister brings a marker to the inside of Emily's lower lip.\n\"Stop moving!\", her sister yells as she starts to write, the girls barely able to control their laughter. Emily holds her lip open to the camera, and her sister does the same, revealing a sweet tat of her own. But the footage is blurry; whatever these fake tattoos said is lost to time.\nEmily, now 34 and living in New York City, forgot this video existed until I asked her about it. \"I don't even remember why I uploaded this,\" she says. \"I think wanted to send it to my sister, but I also I had to free up space on my hard drive. I just needed a place to put it. I don't know, it's funny and weird. I'm glad it's still here.\"\n\"We tend to assume the reason to use social media is to try to be an influencer, either you're Joe Rogan or you're a failure. But that's the wrong way to think about it,\" says Ethan Zuckerman, who leads the YouTube research as the director of the University of Massachusetts' Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure.\nYouTube tells the BBC it's incorrect to suggest the platform doesn't let you see videos with low views or content from small channels. The algorithm's job is to help people find the videos they want to watch and that will give them value, YouTube says, and sometimes that does include videos with a small number of views.\n\"The magic of YouTube is that whether a video has 60 views or six million, people are able to find community, learn a new skill, be entertained, or share their voice with the world,\" says Boot Bullwinkle, a YouTube spokesperson. \"Every channel starts from the same blank slate, from which they can build an audience and grow a business.\"\nZuckerman and his colleagues weren't the first to go looking for YouTube's underbelly. Between 2009 and 2012, for instance, iPhones included a feature that let users post videos straight to YouTube with a few taps. YouTube reported that mobile uploads jumped 400% a day. Unless people added a custom title, the name for all these videos followed a standard format, which makes them easily searchable over a decade later. A few online tinkerers have explored these videos, which apparently number in the millions. One even built a custom player that cycles through them.\nWithout the algorithm's recommendations, you'll find that YouTube is a study of the everyday, Zuckerman says, people documenting small moments in their lives and using the available tools to exchange ideas.\nIn South Asia, for example, Zuckerman says YouTube and similar networks seem to function as a video messaging tool for people with low or no literacy. Most of YouTube comes from outside of the US, in fact. Zuckerman's lab has estimated that over 70% of YouTube videos are in languages other than English. You find fisherman in South America waving from a boat, or two construction workers speaking in Hindi about how much they miss home. Videos like these fall under what he calls \"friends and family\" content, where comments and interactions all come from people who seem to know the user personally.\n\"If any of these videos went viral, it would mean something went terribly wrong. That's not what most of YouTube for,\" Zuckerman says.\nMost unwatched YouTube is less entertaining than sw33t tats, which, with respect to Emily, sets a low bar. This stuff is bland enough to melt your brain. A bride gets ready for a photo shoot. A grouchy Korean man rants about politics. Six seconds of a martial arts instructor, devoid of context. Dash camera footage from a car struggling to escape a parking lot. A woman advertises a horse for sale in 2018. Endless, mundane screen recordings of video games \u2013 the University of Massachusetts Amhurst study found people playing video games seems to make up almost 20% of YouTube. \u00a0\nOccasionally, you stumble on something fun, or more often, just plain weird. Three men performatively slapping each other's rear ends to a James Brown song. A woman reviews a brand of pre-sliced bologna (it's \"not too bad\"). Or take the channel \"Space Stuff and Other Stuff\", where a kid raps about the planet Neptune and shares his condolences after Queen Elizabeth's passing. The latter falls in the \"other stuff\" category, apparently.\nSome videos are heartrending. I listened to an elderly man describe how he's living in a car on a farm, trading manual labour for a place to stay. There was a moving tribute to a departed cat from her owner, Tyler. \"Kiko didn't make it,\" he says, holding back tears. \"It's so darn quiet without her here.\" A few dozen videos I paused to watch a young ballerina float delicately across a stage, wafting back and forth in front of a hushed crowd.\n\"As researchers, we spend a lot of time with this stuff. It can be a lot like looking at people's personal snapshots,\" Zuckerman says. \"Most of it's boring, but sometimes it's poignant, even haunting. And every so often, you get something that feels incredibly revealing about how human beings communicate.\"\nBut my favourite videos by far came from Bill \"The WoofDriver\" Hellman. He's a 58-year-old working in real estate just outside of Baltimore, US. But that's not his passion. What Hellman really cares about is his dogs, and the unique way he cares for them. \"You've never seen anything like this before,\" he says in one video. I guarantee that he's right.\nHellman has built over 50 custom-made vehicles that he uses to take his four huskies out for what he calls \"urban mushing\". He uses social media to document their adventures on the trails of the eastern US. It all looks a bit like the dog sled races of the Iditarod. Except here, the dogs are usually strapped to the side of his various slow-moving contraptions, recumbent bicycles and electric dog-walking carts. By the looks of it Hellman's dogs are thrilled to participate.\nHe's posted more than 2,400 YouTube videos in the last 14 years, many of which include original rock songs. (Hellman says he's written more than 100 WoofDriver songs, in fact.) He puts in a lot of work, heading out with drones and groups of friends to document his journeys. Hellman's even paid for celebrity endorsements through the platform Cameo to promote his videos. But for all the effort, his channel often gets little traction. Many videos have views in the low double digits.\n\"I don't get a big audience a lot of the time, but that doesn't bother me. I was just so in love with how happy it made the dogs that at some point I thought 'I gotta share this',\" Hellman says. \"Maybe it'll inspire someone to take better care of their dogs, but really, I use YouTube like the cloud, so I have a place to document my adventures.\"\nYouTube doesn't pay the bills, and the WoofDriver isn't selling anything \u2013 though he's happy to give you the dimensions if you want to build your own urban dog sled. \"I just do it because of the joy it brings me,\" Hellman says.\nRandom YouTube usually doesn't look like the highly produced videos of the WoofDriver, but he's a good representation in one sense. Like Hellman's content, the majority of these unseen YouTube videos range from neutral to overwhelmingly positive.\nThe same can't be said for what rises to the top. Research suggests YouTube's algorithm amplifies negativity, reinforces stereotypes and gives users little control over the content they don't want to see. Over the years, YouTube has faced increasing criticism over concerns about hate speech, political extremism and misinformation. Along with other social media platforms, YouTube has been utilised by drug cartels and harnessed by terrorists as a tool for promotion and recruitment.\nYouTube says that the company has employed a set of community guidelines since its earliest days to establish what's allowed on the platform. The company says it has redoubled efforts to address its responsibilities. One way YouTube measures its success is through its \"violative view rate\". In 2017, for every 10,000 views on YouTube, 63-72 views came from content that violated YouTube policies, but today that number has fallen to eight to nine views, according to the company.\nYouTube says it gives users several ways to manage YouTube recommendations and search results, such as deleting your Watch History.\nWhen the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure set out to study YouTube, part of the impetus was to document how common hate speech and misinformation is on the platform. \"If you go looking for it, you'll find it,\" McGrady says, but compared to the total body of videos on YouTube it's exceedingly unusual. Still, it doesn't matter how rare a damaging video is if it gets a ton of views, McGrady says, and harmful content remains a serious issue on YouTube.\nIn recent years, Google has faced a wave of scrutiny from policy makers, with new laws and a mountain of proposed regulations \u2013 not to mention a series of antitrust cases. But when the regulatory conversation turns to the videos on YouTube themselves, the focus is almost always on content that goes viral, McGrady says.\nThis ignores the obligations YouTube should have because, according to McGrady, the company is running a piece of essential infrastructure.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The ghosts of India's TikTok\n\u2022 Google just updated its algorithm. The internet will never be the same\n\u2022 The riddles humans can solve but computers can't\n\"The internet is deeply troubled, and we can't ignore the way tech companies are exacerbating those problems,\" McGrady says. \"What makes me hopeful is that when you find a way to look at how people are really using the web, a lot of it still feels like the early internet. It's expression, communication, connection. Fundamentally, it's a place where regular people share themselves and do wonderful things.\"\nThe YouTube we talk about \u2013 the one full of celebrities, scandals and manufactured virality \u2013 only tells part of the story. The majority exists in quiet moments, in shaky camera work and voices meant for no one in particular. \u00a0I watched hundreds of these videos. Everything one of them is public, but it's also clear that most people didn't upload this content for strangers. It was like being let in on a secret, a sprawling, uncurated documentary of human life. But watching it also felt like work compared to the doomscroll-inducing entertainment you get from the algorithm. Eventually, I closed my tabs and headed back to the YouTube homepage, back to the polished world of the corporate internet.\n* Thomas Germain is a senior technology journalist for the BBC.

It's a real family affair, with Benn's sisters and cousin also joining him in camp.\nHaving spent 12 years of his childhood in Mallorca, Benn speaks fluent Spanish to the locals in the gym.\nWhen the training session begins, however, the laughter stops. There is noticeable shift in mindset \u2013 a sign of just how serious Benn is approaching this fight.\nHe says he is \"leaving no stone unturned\" as he fights for the family name \u2013 and to prove his own worth - in this bloodline rivalry.\n\"I've got a chip on my shoulder about [people] saying I'm the nepo kid, that I had it easy,\" he adds.\nBut this is no longer about fathers. Benn's reputation amongst boxing fans has been stained.\nAlthough he has been cleared to fight by an anti-doping panel, they feel he should be more transparent about the reasons behind the failed test.\nBenn says he has been \"cleared three times\" and is reluctant to dwell on the past. \nNigel, meanwhile, speaks more openly about the impact it had on them both, saying \u00a31m was spent on the legal battles.\nThe former super-middleweight champion says he is not a drinker but would consume \"half a bottle of red wine every night\" during the period as his mental health issues worsened, while his son turned to therapy to get through the dark times.\n\"I was watching my son really crying in my arms, heartbroken.

Although a stipulation prevents Eubank from gaining more than 10lb on fight night, he is still the more natural at the weight. \n\"Yes, I am jumping up two weight divisions.

        "article_text": "For 16 generations, master gardeners in this one family have dedicated their lives to preserving one of the nation's most cherished \u2013 and highly sought-out \u2013 symbols.\nEach spring during sakura (cherry blossom) season, the Ninna-ji and Daikaku-ji temples in Kyoto's leafy Ukyo ward are overwhelmed by busloads of tourists who come to snap photos of the temples' blooming cherry trees. But little do they know that only a few kilometres away, there's a secret sakura garden hiding in plain sight.\nThis 1.5-hectare public plot, known as the Sano family garden, is an oasis of calm; found just off an unassuming street near traditional wooden machiya townhouses. But this isn't just any ordinary cherry blossom tree grove; it's also the domain of 97-year-old T\u014demon Sano: Japan's most renowned sakuramori (cherry blossom guardian).\nFor more than a millennium, Japanese people have admired the delicate sakura petals as a symbol of transience and beauty. Today, this national pastime has blossomed into an international obsession, with millions of tourists from across the world descending on Japan to sip seasonal sakura-themed Starbucks drinks and participate in hanami (cherry blossom viewing) picnics and festivals from March to May. But while the world waits with bated breath for the cotton candy-coloured blossoms to burst each spring, one of the most important and least understood roles in the trees' maintenance lies with their behind-the-scenes caretakers.\nAccording to Naoko Abe, cherry blossom expert and author of The Sakura Obsession, skilled sakura arborists have existed in Japan since time immemorial. But thanks to the popularity of the 1970s novel Sakuramori about a sakura-infatuated tree expert, communities began bestowing this title to deserving specialists in the years that followed. Typically a professional gardener or tree surgeon, a sakuramori is a combination of Lorax, botanist and spiritual guide dedicated to studying sakura and promoting their preservation.\nAs Asada Nobuyuki, the secretary general of the Japan Sakura Association, explained, there are roughly 100 sakuramori in Japan today, but one stands out. \"It can be said that T\u014demon Sano is most deserving of the title sakuramori,\" said Nobuyuki, crediting the breadth of Sano's long, productive career and his family's generational wisdom.\nOn a Friday morning earlier this month, I crunched through gravel at this historic sanctuary to meet Sano himself. He is the 16th generation in a distinguished line of farmers who began cultivating the nearby land (known for its late-blooming dwarf cherry trees) in the mid-1600s. When his father died in 1981, he assumed the first name T\u014demon, per family tradition, and took the reins of Uet\u014d Z\u014den, the landscaping firm his family started in 1832 that is headquartered in the garden.\nFor more than 80 years,Sano has utilised his specialised knowledge to steward the survival of sakura trees in gardens throughout Japan and the world \u2013 including at the Isamu Noguchi-designed Japanese garden at the Unesco headquarters in Paris. Sakura Taikan, his most famous book, is the definitive tome on the trees and the culmination of research begun by his grandfather during the\u00a0Taish\u014d period (1912\u20131926).\nBut just before our visit, the nonagenarian became ill and was rushed to hospital. Still, he arranged for me to meet his son, Shinichi Sano, who oversees operations at Uet\u014d Z\u014den and who will one day succeed his father and carry on the family legacy as the next T\u014demon and sakuramori.\nAs we strolled through the garden, Shinichi paused at an umbrella-like shidarezakura (weeping cherry), its swooping branches covered in geisha-blush blossoms. Shinichi said this 40-year-old tree was grown from the seeds of the most iconic sakura in Kyoto: the dramatic weeping cherry tree in Maruyama Park, which was originally grown in the Sano family garden and replanted in its current public spot by T\u014demon's father, the 15th T\u014demon Sano.\nThough sakura have attracted hanami lovers for generations, Shinichi said a major threat now looms over them: climate change. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, cherry blossoms have started to bloom 1.2 days earlier per decade since 1953. A recent study found that the peak bloom of Kyoto's cherry blossoms in 2020, 2021 and 2023 were the earliest in more than 1,200 years.\n\"If global warming continues at this rate, I believe there will eventually be regions in Japan where cherry trees no longer bloom,\" Shinichi said, noting that winters with elevated temperatures could nip blooms in the bud entirely, as trees require a sustained chill to initiate the blossoming process. If this happens, a major part of Japan's springtime tourism appeal would be jeopardised \u2013 as well as an integral part of the nation's cultural identity.\n\"The reason Japanese people are fond of cherry blossoms is because, after enduring a harsh winter, the vivid flowers bloom in the monochrome landscape as if to herald the long-awaited arrival of spring. This quiet presence is what draws people in and resonates deeply in our hearts,\" T\u014demon later told me over email after being released from hospital. \"Out of 365 days a year, the cherry blossoms endure wind and snow for 360 days, only to bloom gloriously for five days before gracefully scattering. I believe this fleeting yet dignified cycle reflects the Japanese perspective on life. There may be a sense of personification in the way we view the cherry blossom, as if it embodies a spiritual or moral belief that, through patience and perseverance, one will eventually bloom.\"\u00a0\nCherry blossoms are integral to the Japanese psyche and soul. In ancient Japan, kami (deities) were said to reside in the trees. Beginning in the 800s, Emperor Saga (whose former residence is up the road from the Sano family garden at Daikaku-ji) ushered in the practice of hanami with official cherry blossom viewing parties. For samurai during the Kamakura period (1185-1333), sakura became a unifying military symbol for the warriors to fall with dignity and grace \u2013 a message echoed during World War Two for kamikaze pilots. In light of this national importance, protecting sakura and ensuring their sustainability is something Japan takes seriously.\nToday, according to Abe, many of the most famous places travellers go to see sakura in Japan, such as Mount Yoshino in Nara and Matsumae Park in Hokkaido, each have a dedicated sakuramori. Interestingly, T\u014demon and his family's unbroken line of Japanese gardeners may not have risen to the level of sakuramori were it not for a British botanist.\nIn 1902, English naturalist Collingwood \"Cherry\" Ingram became fascinated by Japanese cherry trees during his first visit to the nation, but he lamented how industrialisation and cloning had led to a decline in their diversity. In an effort to protect them, he sent 50 endangered varieties back to England and planted them in his garden. When he eventually tried to propagate the varieties back in Japan come the 1930s, including the rare Taihaku cherry that had ceased to be cultivated in Japan, the trees didn't survive long.\nGiven the Sano family's generational expertise, Ingram sought out T\u014demon's grandfather, who developed a way to transport the trees successfully so they wouldn't sprout before arriving in Japan. From that little shipment of Taihaku trees, it is thought that tens of thousands of Tahihaku now flourish across Japan and were saved from national extinction.\nWhere to see T\u014demon Sano's sakura in Kyoto:\nIn addition to admiring T\u014demon's carefully cultivated sakura at Maruyama Park, the Ruriko-in estate, the Katsura and Shugauin imperial villas and the Ninna-ji Temple, visitors can also explore the Sano family garden year-round from 09:00 to 16:00 (best to call ahead at +81 75-871-4202).\nT\u014demon's grandfather became something of a Johnny Appleseed for sakura \u2013 taking grafts and growing saplings, venturing to far-flung places like the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin before he died in 1934. T\u014demon's father then took up the mantle while training his son to continue the family legacy.\nToday, travellers enjoying the mesmerising weeping cherry in Maruyama Park have T\u014demon to thank, as the city asks him to care for the tree throughout the year. Visitors can also admire T\u014demon's work at the Ruriko-in estate, where sakura stand in stunning harmony on the property close to the Golden Pavilion of Kinkakuji; the Katsura Imperial Villa; the Shukaguin Imperial Villa; Ninna-ji Temple garden; and, of course, at the nearby Sano family property.\nEven at 97,\u00a0T\u014demon still collects information on different types of sakura and makes detailed drawings of the blossoms' anatomy from the stamen and pistils to the bracts and peduncles \u2013 all to better understand how to help sakura flourish.\n\"My feelings toward cherry blossoms are something that has been ingrained in my daily life,\" T\u014demon said. \"My daily life follows the old Japanese way of life seik\u014d-udoku, 'working in the fields when it's sunny and reading when it rains'\u2026 If I am asked to preserve rare cherry blossoms, I respond by grafting or sowing seeds.\"\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The 96-year-old painter who saved a village\u00a0\n\u2022 The 89-year-old woman who is still travelling the world solo\n\u2022 Japan's unusual way to view the world\nTo that end, he has successfully propagated cherry trees in the atomic bomb-ravaged soil of Hiroshima and saved a 150-year-old Oshima cherry tree in Yokohama that was destined to be cut down. In that instance, when the local community enlisted him to relocate the storied sakura 100m away to preserve an iconic view of Mt Fuji, he took careful stock of the three layers of soil surrounding the tree. Before digging, T\u014demon ceremonially placed sake and rice crackers in the dirt as an apology for the disruption, added charcoal and provided an octopus offering. Also known to hug trees, T\u014demon embraced the trunk tightly upon its successful replanting.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs I toured the Sano family garden, falling\u00a0cherry petals fluttered to the ground like snowflakes, a phenomenon called sakura fubuki. In addition to kami, the souls of ancestors are also said to reside in the flowering cherry blossoms, connecting\u00a0the Sano family to their forebearers and representing the fleeting nature of each generation.\u00a0Amid this transient beauty, the Japanese concept of\u00a0\"mono no aware\" (the wistful recognition of life's ephemerality and the beauty in that impermanence) feels especially present.\u00a0\n\"Cherry blossoms reflect the way of life of the samurai in the old days: beautiful in the way they fall with grace and dignity,\" Shinichi said. Shinichi's 38-year-old son, Tomoaki, who has started to take over day-to-day responsibilities in the family business, has one child \u2013 a daughter. It would then be possible to have the first female sakuramori in this line.\n\"It will depend on her decision,\" Shinichi said.\nFor now, though, the family is allowing the 16th T\u014demon Sano to focus his attentions on what he does best.\n\"While my father is healthy, he will be the one to take care of the sakura,\" Shinichi said. I then asked if he felt he would one day be ready to assume the role of T\u014demon Sano and sakuramori.\u00a0\n\"I won't really know until I actually become the 17th generation,\" Shinichi said. \"I think I will truly feel the responsibility for the first time when I actually inherit the name\u2026 I'll do what I'm asked to.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Katarina Zimmer put vinegar to the test as a cleaning product and discovered a wide range of benefits, for people and the planet.\nA few months ago in my new Berlin apartment, my toilet and I were at war. No amount of scrubbing or toilet cleaner would evict the limescale coating inside. Frustrated, I turned to Google and stumbled across a page recommending vinegar \u2013 something that the previous inhabitant had left behind in abundance. After dropping two tablespoons full of \"Essigessenz\" \u2013 essentially concentrated vinegar \u2013 into the toilet and waiting for half an hour, I scrubbed and the limescale came off in a moment.\u00a0\nSince then, I've enthusiastically used vinegar to rid my world of limescale. I've found it even more effective than my regular kitchen spray cleaner for getting my sink sparkling. That includes the faucet, which I wrapped in a vinegar-soaked kitchen tissue \u2013 whereas my regular cleaning spray dribbled off. And rather than having to buy special tablets to clean my limescale-smothered glass kettle, I simply poured two tablespoons of concentrated vinegar inside and boiled it. As the limescale crackled off, it made a satisfying sizzling sound.\nI wondered if vinegar had other advantages. Did it also kill off bacteria and other germs? And, importantly, was this simple, natural product better for the environment and for my health than regular cleaning products?\u00a0\nThe internet is full of sustainability influencers and green cleaning blogs that advertise vinegar as a jack-of-all-trades and a safer and \"greener\" alternative to \"toxic\" cleaning products. These claims make sense on the surface; vinegar is after all just fermented alcohol and has long been used as a food preservative, in salad dressings, as well as a household cleaner \u2013 but I wanted evidence. After interviewing three experts, I learned that while some of these claims are true, the benefits of vinegar depend a lot on how it's used and the kind of grime you're trying to get rid of.\nReassuringly, Eric Beckman, a chemical engineer and emeritus professor at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, told me that the best cleaning use for acetic acid \u2013 the main component of vinegar \u2013 is exactly what I had been using it for: as a descaler. Limescale \u2013 and rust, for that matter \u2013 consists of certain ions that dissolve more easily in acidic fluids like vinegar, he says. Beckman uses vinegar himself to get limescale off mirrors, while the microbiologist Dirk Bockm\u00fchl of Germany's Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences prefers using lemon juice, which contains citric acid, which he says is a more effective descaler and smells better. (Read more about why vinegar is such an effective cleaner.)\nThat said, vinegar doesn't work on everything. Beckman says that soap does a better job at removing oily films on dishes, while baking soda is effective against processed oils that have stuck onto surfaces while cooking. (Read more about whether baking soda is environmentally friendly).\nHowever, Beckman expresses exasperation about a popular remedy of mixing vinegar together with baking soda. The mixture is chemically quite useless, he says, as the acid of vinegar and the base of baking soda effectively cancel each other out. \"I use both, but not together,\" says Beckman. \"Together, they give you nothing.\"\u00a0 \u00a0\nAnd while vinegar is often touted as a powerful antimicrobial, Bockm\u00fchl says, the truth is more nuanced. In a 2020 study, Bockm\u00fchl and his colleagues put vinegar to the test against a selection of disease-causing bacteria, viruses and fungi. While many internet recommendations suggest adding a dash of vinegar into a bucket of water for cleaning, Bockm\u00fchl found that its anti-microbial effects only kick in at an acetic acid concentration of 5% \u2013 its concentration in pure vinegar. And it was only fully effective at distilled concentrations of 10% \u00a0\u2013 to which the researchers added a dash of citric acid \u2013 in killing off five common bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as a mould, a yeast and a weakened strain of the vaccinia virus. Other studies have found that similar concentrations also work against Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut even these concentrations didn't work against the MRSA bacterium, an especially stubborn strain of Staphylococcus aureus that's resistant to certain antibiotics, while countless bacteria remain untested. Many bacteria \u2013 including the ones that ferment alcohol into vinegar \u2013 thrive in acids, Beckman adds: \"Then they'll be like, 'ooh, yay, vinegar.'\" Some moulds, too, are resistant to acetic acid while some viruses \u2013 like norovirus \u2013 might be, too, Bockm\u00fchl suspects. Beckman says that soaps are more effective against bacteria, while standard disinfectants work better against viruses and moulds. Harsh treatments like bleach will definitely kill everything, Beckman says \u2013 although bleach can be unsafe if used incorrectly.\nBockm\u00fchl stresses that, even for the germs that vinegar does kill, a relatively high concentration is needed. The concentration won't be adequate \"if you just put a teaspoon of vinegar into your cleaning solution\", Bockm\u00fchl says.\u00a0\nHowever, the higher the dose of acetic acid, the more irritating it can be on the skin, he adds. It is harmful if it gets into your eyes. Surfaces can suffer, too: vinegar corrodes natural stone and metals like copper, bronze and brass, according to the Italian chemist Dario Bressanini's book The Science of Cleaning. And in dishwashers or washing machines, it can harm the rubber gaskets used to seal them, while it could also damage coffee machines and strip away the coating on tiles and grout, Bressanini writes. But Bockm\u00fchl assures me that it's fine to use vinegar on glass and ceramic surfaces \u2013 like my toilet \u2013 and stainless steel sinks.\nThe trouble that Bockm\u00fchl sees with using homemade cleaning products is that they don't come with instructions or safety recommendations. \"They might be safe if you know what you're doing,\" he says, \"but there are a lot of really stupid and absurd recommendations on the internet\".\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Are you cleaning your water bottle enough?\n\u2022 Why you might want to change your bedclothes more often\n\u2022 Seven proven ways to help the planet in 2025 \nTo learn more about how the health risks of vinegar compare with those of conventional cleaners, I called up Nicola Carslaw, professor of indoor air chemistry at the University of York in the UK. Her concern is how cleaners disrupt the air in our homes and buildings. It's known that professional domestic cleaners tend to have higher rates of asthma than other occupational groups, although it's proven difficult to pin that on any single product or ingredient.\nIn a recent study, Carslaw and her colleagues tested 23 different cleaning products including dishwasher fluid, washing up liquid and spray products, and found that many of them released volatile chemical compounds (VOCs). Some of these compounds, like terpenes, are often added to give pleasant aromas, such as lavender or pine oil, but they're highly reactive in the atmosphere. Terpenes for instance, easily react with ozone in the air, creating miniscule particles. In general, inhaling particles of this size has been linked to lung and heart disease.\n\"Your nose is a really good filter for the big particles, but the smaller ones can get all the way into your lungs [and] into the bloodstream,\" Carslaw says. Interestingly, in her study she found that cleaning products marketed as \"natural\" or \"green\" didn't seem any healthier in this regard. \"The natural/green ones had as many, if not more VOCs as the standard cleaners, and in many cases they were more reactive,\" she says.\nBut vinegar, by contrast, only consists of water and acetic acid (and a few other substances that make the difference between red and wine vinegar, for instance). As such, \"it's just not going to be chemically reactive in the same way\", Carslaw says. Another advantage of vinegar is that it's usually applied on a cloth to wipe surfaces rather than used as a spray, Carslaw adds. Research shows that cleaning products applied in spray form have more\u00a0harmful effects on the respiratory system\u00a0than liquids and wipes. (Read more about the health risks associated with cleaning products in Jessica Bradley's story).\u00a0\n\"When you spray something, you're turning the chemical into a form that's much easier to breathe [in] than if you have the liquid,\" Carslaw says. That said, she always advises gloves when there's risk of skin contact, good ventilation and avoiding excessive cleaning, whatever product is used. (Read more about whether we're cleaning too much for our own good).\nThis all left me with one remaining question: is using vinegar more environmentally friendly than conventional cleaners?\u00a0\nThat's a hard question to answer, says Beckman. Ideally, there would be life cycle analyses for cleaning products which track impacts from cradle to grave, tracing each ingredient back to its source, how it's produced, transported, packaged and eventually disposed of. But very few companies do that thoroughly, even if they do brand their products as \"green\", Beckman says.\u00a0\n\"But I will say this about vinegar. [Its] strength is its simplicity,\" Beckman says. Conventional cleaners can consist of more than a dozen different ingredients, many of them industrially manufactured in energy-consuming processes, he says. Acetic acid is born through the natural, yeast-driven fermentation of alcohol, which itself comes from the natural fermentation of sugar. The biggest environmental impact of vinegar-making is where the sugar came from \u2013 whether it's grapes, apples, grains, potatoes, or rice \u2013 which are largely renewable resources. Bockm\u00fchl cautions that this only applies to naturally fermented vinegars, the ones typically sold as food products; there are also synthetic vinegars which are derived from fossil fuels, meaning they come with all the environmentally harmful impacts of oil and gas extraction.\u00a0\u00a0\nEven at the very end of its life, vinegar has little impact. While many ingredients in soaps are tough molecules and don't easily biodegrade, sometimes continuing to kill organisms once they're in the environment, vinegar quickly breaks down, Beckman says. \"Vinegar passes muster on any sustainability scale because it's simple and it's degradable,\" he says.\u00a0\nAfter discovering all of this, I felt even better about using vinegar. I probably won't rely on it for ridding my surfaces of germs, but I'll keep using it to remove limescale and look forward to trying it out on the next rusty item I find. I'm happy to put up with the smell, knowing that I'm using a sustainable product that's likely better for my health.\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.",

Beckman says that soaps are more effective against bacteria, while standard disinfectants work better against viruses and moulds.

        "article_text": "The west Belfast rap group Kneecap have hit back at a call for their US visas to be revoked after their performance at Coachella where they ended their set with pro-Palestinian messages.\nWriting on social media, TV personality and music manager Sharon Osbourne said the hip-hop trio \"took their performance to a different level by incorporating aggressive political statements\".\nWhen asked by BBC News NI for a response, the band replied: \"Statements aren't aggressive, murdering 20,000 children is though.\"\nThe festival's organisers have also been approached for comment.\nKneecap have been vocal supporters of the Palestinian people, often raising the conflict in their live performances.\nHamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking 251 back to Gaza as hostages.\nIsrael launched a massive military offensive in response, which has killed 51,240 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to figures released by Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.\nThe number of children who have been killed in Gaza is disputed. International journalists including the BBC are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently so are unable to independently verify figures.\nSpeaking to Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 , Kneecap's manager said: \"If somebody is hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by, but it's really important to speak truth.\"\nDaniel Lambert added: \"Thankfully the lads are not afraid to do that.\"\nHe also said the band had received death threats following their performance at Coachella and described the threats as \"too severe to get into\".\nIn a statement to BBC News NI, the US State Department said when considering revocations, they look at information that \"may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under US immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted\".\nThe band are set to play a number of shows in the US and Canada in coming months.\nOn Tuesday, Osbourne claimed on social media the band's actions included \"projections of anti-Israel messages and hate speech\".\n\"This band openly support terrorist organizations,\" she added.\nMs Osbourne was also critical of the organisers of the festival, Goldenvoice, a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG).\n\"Reports indicate that Goldenvoice was unaware of Kneecap's political intentions when they were booked,\" Osbourne said.\n\"However, after witnessing their performance during the first weekend, allowing them to perform again the following weekend suggests support of their rhetoric and a lack of due diligence,\" she continued.\n\"This behaviour raises concerns about the appropriateness of their participation in such a festival and further shows they are booked to play in the USA,\" Osbourne said.\n\"I know for a fact that certain people in the industry had written to Goldenvoice, airing their concerns around the booking of Kneecap,\" she said.\nOsbourne is the wife of Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne, and a former judge of TV talent shows The X-Factor and America's Got Talent.\nShe also managed her husband's solo career.\nOsbourne finished her post by saying: \"As someone of both Irish Catholic on my mother's side and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage on her father's side and extensive experience in the music industry, I understand the complexities involved.\n\"I urge you to join me in advocating for the revocation of Kneecap's work visa.\" \nThe festival organisers have been approached for comment.\nWarning: This article features language that some readers may find offensive\nAt the end of their set at the second weekend of Coachella, which was not streamed on the festival's official YouTube page, Kneecap projected three screens of text.\nThe first message said: \"Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,\" followed by: \"It is being enabled by the US government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes,\" and a final screen added: \"[Expletive] Israel.

It notes such tariffs must be approved by the US Congress. \nTwelve states joined the lawsuit, which was filed with the United States Court of International Trade. \nThe White House accused New York Attorney General Letitia James of \"prioritizing a witch hunt against President Trump over protecting the safety and wellbeing of their constituents\".\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai added that the \"administration remains committed to using its full legal authority to confront the distinct national emergencies our country is currently facing\u2014both the scourge of illegal migration and fentanyl flows across our border and the exploding annual U.S. goods trade deficit.\"\nThe lawsuit states that tariffs must be approved by Congress and questioned Trump invoking a 1970s law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to enact the levies.  \n\"By claiming the authority to impose immense and ever-changing tariffs on whatever goods entering the United States he chooses, for whatever reason he finds convenient to declare an emergency, the President has upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy,\" the lawsuit states.\nTrump invoked the IEEPA as the basis for several of his tariffs against China, Mexico, Canada, and other countries. \nA president can use the law \"to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States,\" if he has first declared a national emergency.\nThe lawsuit argues that the law does not actually grant Trump the power he claims to derive from it. The act has never been used to issue tariffs by any president, congressional research shows.\nLast week, the state of California filed its own lawsuit against the Trump administration over tariffs. That lawsuit also argues that Trump lacks the power under the IEEPA to impose these tariffs. Several other lawsuits have similarly challenged Trump's authority using that law for the levies. \nTrump has implemented tariffs on global trading partners in a stated effort to correct what he believes is a trade deficit between the US and other nations. \nOn 2 April, in an event billed as \"Liberation Day,\" Trump shook the global economy by announcing \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nations across the world. A few days later amid a market backlash, he announced a 90-day pause on the tariffs and lowered the rate to 10% for most countries. \nThat pause didn't extend to China, which Trump said had a \"lack of respect\" and was retaliating. Instead, the US issued a 145% on goods imported from China, which has led to a trade standoff and rattled global markets. \nOn Wednesday, Trump said he hoped to come to a deal with China soon and noted the 145% tariff was \"very high\". \nThe White House has also imposed 25% tariffs on certain goods from it's neighbours, Mexico and Canada.

 \nIt is less than two years since Carlisle had the greatest day in their recent history when they won promotion to League One by beating Stockport County in the League Two play-off final at Wembley.\nIt was unlikely, and unexpected, and further cemented manager Paul Simpson's status as a local hero, back for his second spell in charge and adding a third promotion to the honours list.\nSadly, the jump proved too big for Carlisle, who were competing in the third tier with a budget befitting the bottom half of League Two.\nUnable to compete on or off the pitch, the Blues were relegated with a club-record low of 30 points after winning only seven games in the worst season in the club's history.\nHowever, during that campaign, the Piataks had come in guaranteeing investment and with big future plans, as they got used to the workings of English football.\nSimpson had survived relegation and was given the close season to rebuild, overseeing 12 new arrivals as the owners anticipated an immediate return to League One.\nInside wisdom suggested the man who guided England Under-20s to success in the World Cup in 2017 would be given 10 games to show he could mount a promotion challenge.\nHe managed four. \nThree losses out of those games - including heavy defeats on the road at Gillingham and pertinently at MK Dons - saw him leave his job on 31 August, the day after the transfer window had closed.\nUnder caretaker boss Mark Birch, two more games were lost, but owner Tom Piatak said promotion was still achievable, shortly before announcing Mike Williamson as the new head coach with the club languishing in 22nd.\nThe hierarchy were keen on the team developing a possession-based style and had been impressed by Williamson's MK Dons side in that 3-0 defeat in August.    \nCarlisle won once at Brunton Park between 17 August and 22 March\nThe former Newcastle United defender won his first game in charge at Swindon Town, but it proved to be a false dawn.\nHe failed to win over the Brunton Park crowd, who were not impressed by his switch to three at the back and the team's slow, cat-and-mouse style.\nIn fact, the fans made up their mind during the Boxing Day home loss to bottom club Morecambe and chanted for Williamson's removal.\nInstead, the change was a drastic one to the playing squad, as Williamson, together with newly appointed sporting director Rob Clarkson, brought in 11 players during the January transfer window, confident they would improve the style and the results.\nThe idea was that these players would fit a newly created \"Carlisle way\" that would run through the club and not be dependent on the individual picking the team.\nDuring that busy period in early January, Tom Piatak doubled down on his backing for Williamson.\nBut just over three weeks later, on 3 February, deadline day itself, Williamson was sacked following a shambolic 5-1 home defeat by Swindon, with nine of the 15 players involved January signings.\nHe won just four of 22 league games, while crucially the team failed to score in half of those. \nLooking for a second new boss of the season, Carlisle stunned most when they brought in Wales and Manchester United legend Mark Hughes.\nHe had been out of work for 16 months since leaving Bradford City, but it was a surprise to see him arriving in Cumbria to try to save the bottom club in the EFL from relegation.\nPerformances improved under the 61-year-old, but not at the rate required to pull Carlisle out of trouble.\nHughes criticised the squad's fitness after losing at Harrogate Town in early March, stating he had to make substitutions based on players' ability to last 90 minutes rather than for tactical reasons.\nEven at such a late stage of the campaign, Hughes had to organise bounce games in training in midweek to get people up to match fitness and to assess the huge squad at his disposal.\nVictory over Bromley on 22 March, only a second on their own turf since August, was delivered with only two of the 11 January arrivals starting the game. \nNow Carlisle go into the game at Cheltenham in their best form for two years with 10 points out of a possible 12, as Hughes has found a successful formula, but the feeling is that they have given themselves too much to do. If Tranmere win either of their last two games, whatever the Blues do will be irrelevant.   \nCentre-back and captain Sam Lavelle is joint top scorer with just four goals\nIf the worst happens, Carlisle would have to prepare for their first season in the National League since 2005.\nThat was a brief stay as they climbed back into the EFL at the first time of asking, but this relegation would be a colossal failure.\nA bloated squad will have to be trimmed, regardless of what division the team is in,  and a decision will have to be made on who is in charge.\nWould Hughes want to stay on? Or would the club opt for a manager with National League experience?\nIn recent seasons, Stockport County and Wrexham have shown what can happen in terms of momentum generated from coming up from the National League.\nBut both were marooned in non-league for over a decade before sorting themselves out - that is not a fate Carlisle fans want to contemplate after two seasons of utter misery.     \nPaul Newton, BBC Radio Cumbria sports editor\nOn Saturday 26 April 1975, Carlisle United were saying goodbye to their one and only season in the top flight of English football with a 0-0 draw at champions Derby County.\nFast forward exactly 50 years to Saturday, 26 April 2025 and the Cumbrians are facing the possibility of another relegation \u2013 however, this one would see them saying goodbye to their EFL status. \nThe last and, so far, only time that fate was to befall Carlisle, their opponents were Cheltenham Town in 2004. Carlisle's opponents this Saturday? You guessed it, Cheltenham.\nCarlisle fans don't need history to frame what has been another disastrous campaign. The prospect of back-to-back relegations under the club's American owners, the Piataks, is all too real, and serious questions will be asked about just what has gone so badly wrong.\nFans will point to some highly questionable decision-making \u2013 from the timing of Paul Simpson and Mike Williamson's sackings to four successive disastrous transfer windows despite substantial investment in the playing squad. \nEven if Carlisle do somehow pull off an escape arguably more miraculous than the famous Jimmy Glass one in these remaining two games, Carlisle, on the field, are in a mess.\nWhen the Piataks took over the club in October 2023, their promise was for Carlisle to \"Own The North\". Right now, that reality couldn't feel any further away.\nThis video can not be played\nS2 E44: Optimism Or Realism?",

        "article_text": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he will step back from his role with the Trump administration's cost-cutting team known as Doge. \nThose at the White House, including the president, have said it has long been the plan that Musk would soon step away, but the news came as the billionaire's car business saw earnings plunge. \nMusk's announcement left many unanswered questions, including when he will  actually leave the administration and what will happen to Doge, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency.\nWhen asked by the BBC on Wednesday, President Donald Trump reinforced the message that the administration was preparing for Musk's departure. \n\"We have to, at some point, let him go and do that. We expected to be doing it about this time. I'll talk to Elon about it,\" Trump said at the White House.\nThe president also said Tesla will \"be taken care of\" once Musk returns and alleged that Musk was being \"treated very unfairly, I guess, by some of the public\".\n\"He's a great patriot, and [that] should have never happened to him,\" Trump added.\nHowever, under government rules, spending fewer days at Doge could actually prolong Musk's stint in government.\nMusk has been designated a \"special government employee\" (SGE) \u2013 a label that allows him to work at a paid or unpaid government job for 130 days each year.\nAccording to a 2007 Department of Justice memo, cited in an October 2024 guidance document from the Office of Government Ethics, any day on which an SGE performs any work for the government counts as a full day towards that limit.\nMeasured from Trump's inauguration on 20 January, the 130-day limit - assuming Musk, who brags about working weekends, clocks roughly five days a week at Doge - would run out toward the end of May.\nBut scaling back would extend that timeframe. Additionally, the 130-day limit would reset in January 2026.\nMusk has not given details on his intended schedule. He made the announcement on Tuesday, after Tesla reported financial troubles including a 71% drop in profits. \nThe drop came after repeated \"Tesla takedown\" protests across the globe and calls for boycotts against the car manufacturer amid Musk's government role. While organisers have said most protests have been peaceful, some have been destructive with fires set at Tesla showrooms or at charging stations. \nThe company warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying \"changing political sentiment\" could meaningfully hurt demand for the vehicles. \nMusk told investors on an earnings call that the time he allocates to Doge \"will drop significantly\" and that he would be \"allocating far more of my time to Tesla\". \nAfter the comments, Tesla's languishing stock price rose.\nIt's also unclear how many days Musk has already worked for the government, whether the government is keeping a tally, and how the limit would be enforced. \nThere has been criticism that the Trump administration may have flouted government rules in creating Musk's unprecedented role, and concerns that he may not follow the time limit.\nUnder rules for SGEs, Musk would have to undergo ethics training, provide a confidential financial disclosure statement, and avoid conflicts of interest. \nHis corporate empire includes large companies that do business with the US government and foreign governments, including SpaceX, which has $22 billion in US government contracts, according to the company's chief executive.\nThe rules also prohibit special government employees from partisan activities, including wearing clothing with political slogans, while in government offices or carrying out official duties. Musk has been pictured wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat in the Oval Office.\nStill, in February, an anonymous White House official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that Musk would file a confidential financial disclosure at some point, and had been given an ethics briefing.\nThe following month, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the BBC: \"Elon Musk is selflessly serving President Trump's administration as a special government employee, and he has abided by all applicable federal laws.\"\nFor now, Musk appears to serve at Trump's behest, with no clear oversight other than the president himself.\nIn a report released last week, progressive think-tank Public Citizen criticised the Trump administration and said the White House was \"wildly abusing\" the SGE rules.\n\"Right now, the public has no way to know whether SGEs like Musk who don't file public financial disclosure reports or are permitted to oversee themselves are putting the people's interests ahead of their own,\" said report author Jon Golinger.\nThe BBC has contacted Musk and the Office of Personnel Management - the agency overseeing special government employees, and one where Doge employees have reportedly taken over several functions - for comment.\nOn Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that around 100 Doge employees would remain in various government departments after Musk departs this year. \nMusk and Trump set a deadline for Doge to finish its work, which corresponds to the 250th anniversary of the signing of the US Declaration of Independence.\nThe executive order setting up Doge, signed by Trump on Inauguration Day in January, mentioned 4 July 2026 as the ending date.\nEarlier, in December, Musk responded to a tweet that also said Doge would finish entirely on that date.\n\"The final step of DOGE is to delete itself,\" he wrote.",

And we want to build on the relationship that we have,\" she added later speaking at a Semafor event.\nSome US officials have been positive about the prospects of a deal. Last week US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK.\nSpeaking to the BBC at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) event on Wednesday, Reeves said the UK was \"not going to rush into a deal\".\nBut she said the government was \"confident that working with our partners in the US we can get a better trading relationship and build on the substantial trade that already exists between our two great countries\".\n\"We want to get the right deal for Britain, to better support our industry, our jobs and consumers,\" she added.\nReeves said that the UK had been \"really clear\" in discussions with US negotiators \"that we're not going to be reducing agricultural standards in the UK\".\n\"The US administration respect and understand that we have high standards to support British farming, and to support British consumers, and we're not going to be relaxing those standards,\" she said.\nMany American farmers use growth hormones as a standard part of their beef production, something that was banned in the UK and the European Union in the 1980s.\nThe US has previously pushed for a relaxation of rules for its agricultural products, including beef from cattle that have been given growth hormones.\nFarmers in the UK warned ministers last week not to dilute British food standards, saying the use of hormones in rearing livestock cannot be accepted.\nShadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Conservatives would \"expect\" Reeves to stick to agricultural standards \"but let's see the detail as and when there is a deal\".\nHe said it is \"hugely important\" to \"get these 25% tariffs on cars and steel down\" but he said the government should be moving faster on negotiations.\n\"It's taken them a long time, in fact, to even have got in the room with the US administration to start discussing these issues, let alone getting a deal now,\" he said.\nTrump has brought in a large number of tariffs on imports to the US, arguing they will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs.\nThese include, as part of an ongoing trade war, levies of up to 145% on Chinese goods. China has hit back with a 125% tax on US products.\nThe move has rattled the world economy, sparking turmoil on global financial markets.\nPrices are expected to rise for consumers in the US as a result of the tariffs, due to the companies importing goods passing on higher costs.\nThe IMF has cut its global growth forecast because of the uncertainty caused by tariffs, and says it expects US growth to be hit the hardest.\nOn Wednesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the UK must take the risk of trade wars hitting global economic growth \"very seriously\".\nHowever, Reeves said: \"I do understand the concerns the US has about countries around the world that run large and persistent trade surpluses with the US.\"\nShe said the UK \"is not one of those countries\" so \"there is a deal there to be done between the UK and the US\".\nShe added that she understood \"the need to rebalance the global economy\".\nThis, in part, is why the UK announced on Wednesday a review of low-value imports coming into the UK which are \"undercutting the British High Street and British retailers\" she said.\nThis mirrors a US action, with the White House set to clamp down on deliveries under $800 - specifically those sent from China and Hong Kong - on 2 May.\nIt is set to close a loophole allowing low-value packages to enter the US without incurring any duties.\nThe removal of the so-called \"de minimis\" rule will hit companies including fast-fashion firm Shein and Temu, the low-cost retail giant.\nShein and Temu have both warned that they will increase prices \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\".\nThe UK government said that the UK Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) would be putting more resources into helping firms report unfair trade practices as part of its review.",

While all retailers use the exemption, those who sell fast-fashion and cheap goods have seen sales soar.\nIt has fuelled the rise of Chinese retailers, such as online giants Shein and Temu, which ship low-value packages to the UK and other countries to reach millions of customers.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Paphitis said retailers had been lobbying government \"for a very, very long time\", arguing the rule had a devastating impact \"on our retail landscape and our high streets\".\nHe joined the bosses of Sainsbury's, Currys and the British Retail Consortium in welcoming the government's consultation on the rule.\nUK businesses bringing in larger shipments have to pay taxes, and they also argue that cheaper goods might fail to meet the same environmental and ethical standards that they have to keep to.\nAside from concerns over unfair competition with domestic retailers, it has also been raised that governments could be missing out on potential tax income.\nThe so-called \"de minimis\" rule has received renewed interest after US President Donald Trump scrapped a similar measure amid his escalating trade war with China. \nGoods worth less than $800 moving into the US will soon be subject to charges, when they were previously exempt. The move has already prompted Chinese retailers to raise their prices.\nIn the UK, there are further concerns that China will dump goods here to avoid the tariffs which Trump has imposed on its exports.\nEarlier this month, the boss of Currys told the Financial Times that the \"single biggest area where lots of stock is likely to land in the UK... is from the likes of Shein, Temu, Alibaba, TikTok shop and, most of all, Amazon marketplace\".\nOn Thursday, Alex Baldock told the BBC that he was pleased the government was \"reviewing the low-value shipment loophole, and that they're committed to levelling the playing field between British and overseas retailers\".\nBut the Federation of Small Businesses urged the government to proceed with caution in its de minimis consultation, suggesting that scrapping it might \"ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers\".\n\"With 16% of goods moved by small firms sitting below the \u00a3135 threshold, a decision to scrap it impacts on trading and inflation,\" said Tina McKenzie, chair of the FSB.\n\"It's right to be concerned about potential future dumping of goods, as escalating tariffs applied by bigger global blocs against each other may mean a surge in goods arriving in markets like our own,\" she added.\nMr Paphitis told the BBC it was \"absolute nonsense\" that the measure kept inflation and prices down, arguing it led to a loss of jobs and tax revenue for the UK, due to businesses being unable to compete with cheaper foreign rivals.\nHelen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, the trade body for retailers, said the review was \"more critical now\" due to a \"rise in the number of potentially non-compliant products entering the UK market\".\nThe British Independent Retailers Association said small packages having no tax or charges was a key concern. It called on ministers to act to \"deter import surges\" in order to \"protect independent retailers\".\nWhen Sainsbury's announced their latest financial results earlier this month, boss Simon Roberts called on the government to act as soon as possible.\n\"Everyone should pay their tax... So if there's a loophole here which means that's not happening, then that needs to be closed so it's a level playing field for everybody,\" he said.",

        "article_text": "Alex Yee is making his London Marathon debut 10 years after completing the Mini London Marathon for a fifth time\nWhen Alex Yee sits down for post-race dim sum with his family on Sunday, it will represent a poignant full-circle moment.\nThat was the reward Yee, who has Chinese heritage on his father's side, recalls provided the main motivation to run - and twice place third in - the Mini London Marathon as a child.\nIt was not long before the spectacle of the London Marathon captured his imagination and he nagged his parents to help him peer over the barriers for a closer look at the elites.\nBut on Sunday it is Yee, the reigning Olympic and world triathlon champion, whom hundreds of thousands of spectators will hope to catch a glimpse of as he embraces the unknown on the streets of his home city.\n\"As time went on I realised the excitement of the London Marathon, the impact it had and how momentous a day it was,\" Yee tells BBC Sport before his debut over 26.2 miles.\n\"I'm not thinking past the experience but afterwards I'd definitely like to get some dim sum with my family and have that deja vu moment,\" he adds, 10 years on from his last mini marathon.\nThere are certainly less demanding challenges the 27-year-old could have undertaken to provide the mental refresh he sought after a career-defining year. \nBut after capturing triathlon's two biggest prizes fewer than 12 weeks apart, ending his world title wait in October after his spectacular recovery on the banks of the River Seine clinched Olympic gold in Paris in the summer, Yee knew where he wanted to set his sights next.\nNot that he expected his coach to agree to his left-field suggestion.\n\"Definitely not. It's been something I've asked every single year, but it never really made sense,\" says Yee, the most decorated Olympic triathlete in history.\n\"This time we were trying to think what would get me to LA [2028 Olympics] in the best place mentally and physically. It was important to freshen things up.\n\"It's been really exciting to work on my running after five years of trying to make my swim and bike an appropriate level to be competitive in triathlon. It's something I've wanted to do and I'm excited to scratch that itch.\" \nLondon Marathon 2025 - everything you need to know\n'Our daughters will be with us', say dads of Southport victims running London Marathon\nAlex Yee overturned a 15-second deficit to rival Hayden Wilde in the final 2.5km to win a dramatic Olympic men's triathlon gold at Paris 2024\nIt should be no surprise that Yee, an athlete obsessed with the process of improvement as much as the success it brings, has relished this new challenge. \nHe speaks about his first marathon training block with a beaming smile and is not ruling out another in future - although a return to triathlon is scheduled for early 2026 at the latest.\n\"To have something which has given me that purpose to get out of bed, to go out and keep searching for those fine margins, I think that's really rare to find in the first year after an Olympics when you hear of athletes soul searching and not knowing what to do,\" says Yee.\n\"To be an expert on something, you have to be once a fool. That's the way I'm seeing it. I wanted to go in with an open mind and come out the other side as a better runner - but also better holistically.\n\"It's been really interesting to learn from so many people and feel like a novice again.\"\nYee is part of a stellar elite men's field featuring 10 athletes who have run the marathon in under two hours and five minutes, including one of his sporting idols in four-time winner Eliud Kipchoge.\nThere is also Olympic champion Tamirat Tola, defending champion Alexander Mutiso Munyao, and debutant Jacob Kiplimo - who in February became the first person to run a half marathon in under 57 minutes. \nYee's target? Enjoy the experience - and go through halfway in 64 minutes and 30 seconds. \nThat would give him the chance to become only the 10th British man to run under 2:09, while only 22 have broken 2:10.\nRunning is Yee's strongest discipline and he has competed for Great Britain on the track and in cross-country, while his 5km best of 13:26 is the third-fastest ever by a British man.\n\"It would be a massive honour to, hopefully, be in that ballpark of people who have achieved amazing things,\" says Yee.\n\"I think it's going to be an amazing day for the Brits but also a historic day at the front. Hopefully I can say I was part of a sub-two hour marathon race.\"\nAlex Yee will meet Eliud Kipchoge, whose most recent London Marathon victory came in 2019, after Sunday's race\nTo Yee's astonishment, Kipchoge was among those to offer him advice and said in January that he would like to meet and help mentor the Briton when they are in London.\nSo the former mini marathon runner and Kenya's two-time Olympic champion have arranged to meet after the race.\nIn the meantime, Kipchoge, widely regarded as the greatest distance runner of all time, has offered wisdom via WhatsApp - something Yee describes as \"surreal\".\n\"His big piece of advice was to get to the start line. It sounded silly at the time, but after unfortunately seeing people forced to pull out, it's probably the strongest piece of advice of all,\" says Yee.\nThey are likely to have much to discuss. \nBoth are passionate about using the power of sport to inspire, with Yee now keen to utilise his platform as Olympic champion.\nHe intends to provide opportunities to school children through the launch of his own foundation, initially in the south London area he grew up in.\nYee also hopes documenting his marathon journey on YouTube can demonstrate that elite athletes are not \"superhuman\", before he stars on the other side of the barriers he used to watch behind. \n\"The more we share our story I feel like people realise that we're just like anyone else, and there's no reason why they can't dream to achieve what I have - or even so much more,\" says Yee.\n\"You start to feel this urgency with the fortunate position I'm in, being an Olympic champion, that I can and I want to make a difference. \n\"I'm not expecting to leave this big legacy behind. If I can change one person's life, that's good enough for me.\"",

        "article_text": "Liverpool are on the verge of being crowned Premier League champions in England, but how do the other title races across Europe stand? \nEngland internationals Harry Kane, Eric Dier and Jordan Henderson are closing in on their first titles with their respective clubs, while Scotland's Scott McTominay and Billy Gilmour are locked in a race for the Scudetto.\nBBC Sport takes a look at how things stand across the German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch and French leagues. \nUnlike the Premier League, there are some thrilling title races inbound.\nBayern Munich will be crowned German champions if they win their game against Mainz and if last season's champions, Bayer Leverkusen, lose to Augsburg on Saturday.\nKane and Dier are aiming for their first domestic title win since joining the 31-time Bundesliga champions. Ex-Burnley manager Vincent Kompany is also looking to deliver his first piece of silverware with Bayern Munich.\nXabi Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen are currently eight points adrift of Bayern Munich with four games to play, and Kompany's side have a huge goal difference advantage over Leverkusen of +29.\nBoth Bayern and Leverkusen are already guaranteed a Champions League spot next season.\nIn Serie A it is a little more complicated.\nAs it stands, last year's champions Inter Milan are in the driving seat as their goal difference separates them from Napoli, who are level on points.\nBut Serie A reintroduced a rule in 2022 stating that if two teams competing for the title, or fighting relegation, finish level on points they are required to meet in a play-off.\nGoal difference would still play a role though, with the team holding the better record earning the opportunity to host the one-off tie.\nWith five games to go in the regular season, could Scottish duo McTominay and Gilmour become heroes in Naples, or will it be Simone Inzaghi's Inter again?\nIn Spain, Barcelona are aiming to win their 28th title and sit four points clear of Real Madrid in second, and 13 ahead of third-placed Atletico Madrid.\nBarca and Real Madrid have five games to play in La Liga and will meet each other in El Classico at the Estadi Lluis Companys on 11 May. \nThey would clinch the title in that game with a victory if they also beat Valladolid on 3 May and Real lose to Celta Vigo on 4 May.\nReal Madrid, who won La Liga and the Champions League last season, could finish the campaign with one trophy, after they beat Mexican side Pachuca in the Fifa Intercontinental Cup in December 2024.\nAs well as the domestic table, Barcelona's players dominate the goals and assists chart.\nRobert Lewandowski, aged 36, has scored 25 goals this season, three more than Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe, while 17-year-old Lamine Yamal is continuing to prove that age is just a number as he has the most assists in La Liga this season  with 12.\nManchester United manager Ruben Amorim's old club, Sporting, are currently in the top spot in Portugal, level on points with Benfica.\nOn goal difference, only four goals separate the two sides as Sporting look to regain the Primeira Liga title after Amorim guided them to success last season.\nUnlike Serie A's play-off style, the Portuguese title would be decided by the head-to-head record if both teams are level on points after the final game of the season.\nSporting beat Benfica 1-0 in December, and they face each other again in the penultimate game of the season.\nIf both teams are level on head-to-head results, then it goes down to goal difference.\nJordan Henderson is on track to win his first Dutch title as Ajax sit nine points clear in the Eredivisie.\nAjax have not won the Dutch top flight since Erik ten Hag was in charge in 2021.\nLast season's champions PSV Eindhoven are in pursuit of Ajax - PSV have five games left to play, with Henderson's Ajax only four.\nIn the Netherlands, goal difference does hold a little more importance. If Ajax and PSV finish with the same number of points, goal difference is then used to determine the final standings.\nAs it stands, PSV boast a much healthier goal difference compared with Ajax. \nFinally, there is Ligue 1.\nParis St-Germain have already been crowned French champions for the fourth consecutive season.\nDone and dusted? Not quite.

        "summary": "They would clinch the title in that game with a victory if they also beat Valladolid on 3 May and Real lose to Celta Vigo on 4 May.Real Madrid, who won La Liga and the Champions League last season, could finish the campaign with one trophy, after they beat Mexican side Pachuca in the Fifa Intercontinental Cup in December 2024.As well as the domestic table, Barcelona's players dominate the goals and assists chart.Robert Lewandowski, aged 36, has scored 25 goals this season, three more than Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe, while 17-year-old Lamine Yamal is continuing to prove that age is just a number as he has the most assists in La Liga this season  with 12.Image source, Getty ImagesPortugal - Primeira LigaManchester United manager Ruben Amorim's old club, Sporting, are currently in the top spot in Portugal, level on points with Benfica.On goal difference, only four goals separate the two sides as Sporting look to regain the Primeira Liga title after Amorim guided them to success last season.Unlike Serie A's play-off style, the Portuguese title would be decided by the head-to-head record if both teams are level on points after the final game of the season.Sporting beat Benfica 1-0 in December, and they face each other again in the penultimate game of the season.If both teams are level on head-to-head results, then it goes down to goal difference.Netherlands - EredivisieJordan Henderson is on track to win his first Dutch title as Ajax sit nine points clear in the Eredivisie.Ajax have not won the Dutch top flight since Erik ten Hag was in charge in 2021.Last season's champions PSV Eindhoven are in pursuit of Ajax - PSV have five games left to play, with Henderson's Ajax only four.In the Netherlands, goal difference does hold a little more importance. Ex-Burnley manager Vincent Kompany is also looking to deliver his first piece of silverware with Bayern Munich.Xabi Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen are currently eight points adrift of Bayern Munich with four games to play, and Kompany's side have a huge goal difference advantage over Leverkusen of +29.Both Bayern and Leverkusen are already guaranteed a Champions League spot next season.Italy - Serie AIn Serie A it is a little more complicated.As it stands, last year's champions Inter Milan are in the driving seat as their goal difference separates them from Napoli, who are level on points.But Serie A reintroduced a rule in 2022 stating that if two teams competing for the title, or fighting relegation, finish level on points they are required to meet in a play-off.Goal difference would still play a role though, with the team holding the better record earning the opportunity to host the one-off tie.With five games to go in the regular season, could Scottish duo McTominay and Gilmour become heroes in Naples, or will it be Simone Inzaghi's Inter again?Image source, Getty ImagesSpain - La LigaIn Spain, Barcelona are aiming to win their 28th title and sit four points clear of Real Madrid in second, and 13 ahead of third-placed Atletico Madrid.Barca and Real Madrid have five games to play in La Liga and will meet each other in El Classico at the Estadi Lluis Companys on 11 May. Unlike the Premier League, there are some thrilling title races inbound.Bundesliga - Germany Bayern Munich will be crowned German champions if they win their game against Mainz and if last season's champions, Bayer Leverkusen, lose to Augsburg on Saturday.Kane and Dier are aiming for their first domestic title win since joining the 31-time Bundesliga champions.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nFighting Benn is 10 times bigger now - Eubank\nParading in luxury designer finery, rubbing shoulders with A-list celebrities and playing poker with filthy-rich footballers \u2013 Chris Eubank Jr has never really marketed himself as a man of the people.\nBut, deep down, everybody wants to be liked, and the 35-year-old is no different.\n\"People say that 'he's been happy to play the bad guy'. I wasn't happy about it,\" Eubank says.\n\"I didn't like getting booed into arenas for all these years. I don't like waking up and going on my Instagram and seeing people saying 'you're going to get knocked out' and 'you're not as good as your old man'.\"\nThe Brighton boxer says he has learned to accept, even \"relish\", the villain tag. In the build-up to Saturday's fight with Conor Benn, however, the lines between the 'good' and 'bad' guys have blurred.\nEubank will face his fellow Briton at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in boxing's latest grudge match \u2013 two and a half years after their cancelled bout because of Benn's failed drugs tests.\nBenn has since been cleared to fight and denies intentionally doping, but the scandal has tarnished his reputation. Consequently, it's morphed Eubank into British boxing's unlikely antihero.\n\"I don't know what to expect. This could be the first fight in history where both guys in a mega fight get booed into an arena,\" Eubank says.\n\"[But] however much of a bad guy I am, I didn't cheat. I walked the hard path being that bad guy.\"\nWhile his public image may be improving, Eubank's fractured relationship with his father, Chris Eubank Sr, has threatened to overshadow the fight.\n\"I've told him I want him there [on Saturday]. I've told him what it means to me, the public, to the fight fans,\" Eubank says. \"He doesn't seem to care or he doesn't seem to understand.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Sport, an emotional Eubank opens up on their public fall-out and what happens if he loses to Benn on Saturday.\nEubank misses weight and fined \u00a3375,000\n'My father thinks I'm a disgrace' - Eubank reveals pain\nEubank v Benn to be broadcast on BBC Radio 5 Live\nThis video can not be played\n'My father thinks I'm a disgrace' - Eubank reveals pain\nAs each day passes in fight week, it is becoming increasingly unlikely that Eubank Sr will attend Saturday's fight. \nHe had been an ever-present at the start of his son's career, but their relationship has become strained.\n\"It got to a stage where I realised for the public to be able to see who I was as a man and as a fighter, I had to step away from that huge figure,\" Eubank says.\nBarry Hearn said Eubank Sr, who he promoted for a number of years, was a \"very strict disciplinarian as a father\".\n\"He said to me once 'Bazza, how do you let your boy talk to you like that?\" Hearn said.\n\"I said to him 'your son has to be your friend as well, Chris'. I don't think he ever bought into that.\"\nEubank acknowledges the public interest in his life and is open to discussing issues far more important than boxing. \nWhile he has forged a reputation of being a composed fighter, outside of the ring he has shown his emotions and vulnerability to the public, with his personal life tinged with tragedy over the past four years.\nIn 2021, his 29-year-old brother Sebastian died of a heart attack in Dubai. Eubank has become a father figure to his nephew, who was just a month old at the time.\nEubank Sr has labelled the Benn bout a \"circus\" because of the weight disparity; Benn is going up two divisions and Eubank is prohibited from rehydrating more than 10lb after the weigh-in.\n\"I think this fight once it's over, there's a possibility that things may be able to reconcile or there's a possibility it will make our relationship even harder to rebuild,\" Eubank Jr says.\n\"What I do know is once I am out of boxing, then it will definitely be easier for us to rebuild what's been lost.\"\nHow 'nepo kid' Benn has prepared for Eubank fight\n5 Live Boxing with Bunce: Eddie & Barry Hearn\nAs Eubank has stepped out of his father's shadow, more of him as a man and fighter has emerged.\nEubank is quite the maverick, a boxer who never pinned himself down to one promoter or trainer for a significant length of time.\nRecent outbursts have even landed him in legal bother and subsequent retractions.\n\"So many boxers and fighters get caught up in the treachery of the people that are in the industry,\" he says, describing the sport as \"shady\".\nWhile he may have burnt bridges with influential boxing people down to a crisp, Eubank is perfectly capable of single-handedly promoting a fight.\nJust like Chris Eubank Sr did with Nigel Benn during their rivalry in the 1990s, Jr \u2013 minus his father's monocle and jodhpurs - seems to know which buttons will inflame an opponent.\nHe says that targeting Benn's emotions is not a deliberate ploy, though.\n\"I've never thought I need to think of something that's really going to get to Conor. I don't care about Conor. I only care about me,\" Eubank says.\nReferencing the now-infamous incident when he slapped Benn across the face with an egg \u2013 which resulted in a \u00a3100,000 fine \u2013 Eubank feels he kept his composure.\n\"I had Nigel Benn's hand wrapped around my neck at one point, but if you see my face, it's like I'm walking down the street,\" he says.\n\"I'm not angry, I'm not scared, I'm not worried. I'm just looking at him. I'm not wasting energy on these guys.\"\nEubank said he wanted to humiliate Benn by slapping him with an egg at a news conference last month\nEubank has proven his quality with wins over former world champions Arthur Abraham, James DeGale and Liam Smith. He has a lot to be proud of.\nHe is fully aware, however, that a defeat to Benn could end up defining his 14-year career.\n\"There's so much at stake \u2013 respect, family, pride, money and my career. I said it, if I lose I retire. That is a horrible thing to say and to know but it's the truth,\" he says.\nEvaluating Eubank's boxing career depends on how you measure success.\nIn 37 fights, he is yet to capture a world title. He lost his only challenge for world honours to George Groves in 2018.\nIf he never becomes a world champion, is it a case of unfulfilled potential? Eubank has certainly shown he is capable enough.\nAs a commodity, though, Eubank remains one of British boxing's biggest draws. He has sold out arenas and earned seven-figure paydays.\nAnd he is not ready to give it all up just yet.\n\"I love being a fighter. I love training. I love competing. I love testing myself mentally and physically,\" he says.\n\"This is my life. On April 27th, I don't want to wake up and say it's done. I really don't.\"\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "As Radiohead and the RSC launch an innovative reinterpretation of Hamlet, a visit to the play's setting in Denmark brings a new dimension to the tragedy.\nThere's a cold wind blowing from the \u00d8resund Sound as I stand on a platform in front of Kronborg Castle in Helsing\u00f8r, Denmark, looking out to Sweden. At one end of the platform, a pillar-box red guard post stands beside a row of impressive cannons facing the strait. I'm not here for the view though: I'm looking for ghosts.\u00a0\nThis windy spot is the exact location for the opening scene of Hamlet, Shakespeare's best-known tragedy. Here, two guards, Francisco and Bernardo, switch posts in the middle of the night and speak of the ghost of Hamlet's father. The castle behind me, a grand Renaissance pile built in 1574 complete with fairytale turrets, a moat and a grand banqueting hall, is where the rest of the lurid drama unfolds.\nThis year, the Royal Shakespeare Company is presenting no fewer than three variations on the story: a radical adaptation using Radiohead's album Hail to the Thief as its score (from 27 April); Fat Ham, a comic tragedy that transplants Hamlet's story into the Deep South (from 15 August); and a traditional take in Rupert Goold's production starring Luke Thallon (from 8 February). For context, the last time the RSC staged Hamlet was back in 2006.\u00a0\n\"There's something in the air right now saying that the play has resonance,\" says Tamara Harvey, co-artistic director at the RSC, noting that all three producers had approached the RSC to stage their productions in the same year.\u00a0\nAs a play that deals with themes of generational differences and changing world orders, not to mention the sense that \"there's something rotten in the state of Denmark\" \u2013 the idea that society's foundations no longer feel secure \u2013 it's hard to miss its appeal.\nToday, nothing looks rotten in Helsing\u00f8r \u2013 the modern-day name for Shakespeare's town of Elsinore. The sky is blue and the sun is glinting off a gold flag flying at the top of one of the turrets. I'm on a tour with castle host Louise Older Steffensen to uncover Kronborg's Hamlet connections. Our feet echo as we walk around the stone corridors and into the grand ballroom with its chequerboard floor and soaring wooden ceiling, as she tells me there is no evidence that Shakespeare ever visited Kronborg \u2013\u00a0but he certainly knew it well.\n\"We have contracts that tell us that Shakespeare's colleagues visited the castle,\" she says. \"We know that the actors Thomas Pope, George Bryan and William Kempe were here for a season, performing plays for the Danish king. When they returned to England, they set up the Lord Chamberlain's Men, Shakespeare's company.\"\nThey may have brought back tales of what happened within its walls. A distinctive celebration is mentioned in the play: a toast followed by the bang of a kettle drum, a trumpet, and a cannon \u2013 and it comes from a tradition followed in the castle at that time.\nIn a dimly lit room next to the ballroom, the tapestries from that era are on display, their gilded threads depicting mythologised kings. Long curtains hang around the queen's bedchamber and around the castle, softening the sandstone walls, dampening sound and making it a fraction warmer \u2013 as well as providing opportunities for dramatic intrigue.\u00a0\nVisiting the castle feels like being immersed in the play, walking down the large gallery where the silk dresses of the ladies-in-waiting would have rustled into its beautifully preserved church. It's as if the play itself has come to life, and the castle plays up to that theatricality. In the summer, special tours invite guests to participate in Hamlet-inspired murder mystery-style tours, and in the autumn, Hallowe'en tours take place in the creepy basements. Nobody, to date, has seen the ghost of Hamlet's father \u2013 but there have been other ghostly sightings, according to Steffensen and assorted castle guides.\nMore clues about the importance of this castle to Shakespeare emerge as Steffensen gives me a history lesson. James I married Denmark's teenage princess, Anne, in 1589. When Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603 and King James ascended to the throne, England had a Danish queen.\n\"The first quarto \u2013 written very early in 1603 \u2013 is set in Denmark,\" said Steffensen, \"but there are no specific locations in it. After Anne becomes Queen of England, we get references to the castle itself.\"\nKing James became the patron of Shakespeare's company and their name changed from \"The Lord Chamberlain's Men\" to \"The King's Men\" in 1603. Queen Anne's castle in Denmark became an important location for the royal family and thus gained a starring role in the play.\nWe climb to the top of the cannon tower, a large flat space in a corner of the castle. Views reach across the moat to the yellow barracks buildings around it and to the town beyond. It's in one of these barracks buildings, the former infirmary that is now the headquarters of the town's Shakespeare Festival, where I find out more about the legacy of Hamlet in Helsing\u00f8r.\nLars Romann Engel, CEO and artistic director of HamletScenen, the castle's professional theatre body, welcomes me into a hallway-cum-gallery of Hamlet actors through the decades. In a who's who of Hamlets, black and white headshots of Jude Law, Kenneth Branagh, Sir John Gielgud, Derek Jacobi, David Tennant, Richard Burton and Christopher Plummer cover the walls and stairwell.\nHamlet played a part in reinventing this town into a cultural hub after its shipbuilding industry collapsed in the 1980s, as the municipality devised a way to create a producing theatre at the Unesco-listed castle. Engel set up the town's Shakespeare festival, which takes place at the castle every August, showing adaptations of Hamlet in many guises; previous shows have included Spaghetti Western versions, dark German variants by experimental theatre Schaub\u00fcne and a sell-out staging starring Jude Law.\nAs well as Hamlet, the festival typically also produces a lighter Shakespeare work, often with music and other events. Both plays are performed in the open air with the castle as a backdrop; tickets book out a long way in advance and the audience typically shows up with a picnic.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Nordhavn: The Danish 'city' that's been designed for an easy life\n\u2022 Denmark's surf town where old-school fishermen and surfers live in harmony\n\u2022 Copenhagen's 'CopenPay' scheme rewards tourists \u2013 but does it actually work?\nA trained theatre director himself, Engel directed a very successful adaptation of Hamlet in 2008, set in the castle's courtyard with tumbledown walls and crumbling masonry \u2013 starring a young Claes Bang as Rosenkrantz \u2013 and, after a mutual decision with the local municipality, set up the festival following its success. He has been running and directing the event for the past 17 years.\u00a0\n\"When you see Hamlet here, you know that you enter the myth,\" said Engel. \"Now you are at the epicentre of it all. It's a special thing: it was actually here that it was written for.\"\nEngel takes me on a tour of some of the other barracks buildings, ending in the Lapidarium, the sculpture storage room of the castle, where a full-size sculpture of Shakespeare sits beside a sleeping Viking warrior, Holger Danske. Danske is another significant figure for the castle: according to legend, when Denmark needs him, he'll wake up and come to its aid. A reproduction of this original model lurks in the gloom of the castle cellars.\u00a0\nEngel is in the throes of arranging this year's festival, which will take place 6-24 August and feature both Twelfth Night and Hamlet, performed by The Lord Chamberlain's Men, who take a classical Elizabethan approach to the works and perform with an all-male cast.\u00a0\n\"This year we've taken a more classical approach,\" said Engel, \"because right now the world is edgy. When we are a little afraid, we don't like it to be upside down and we want it to be more as we know it.\"\nIn testament to the endless ways the play can be reinvented, however, Engel also plans to put on Eddie Izzard's one-person Hamlet at the stage this year. It's often said that every minute of every day, Hamlet is being performed somewhere in the world. Shakespeare's most popular play in his lifetime has an afterlife, 425 years later, that surpasses all expectations.\n\"It's one of the greatest pieces of writing in the English language, dealing with the very nature of human existence,\" says Harvey. \"A play wrangling with this fundamental issue with such complexity is always going to mean different things to different people.\"\nVisiting Kronborg Castle, experiencing the \"set\" of the play in real life, certainly brings it to life. As I exit the castle, crossing the bridge over the moat, past the guardhouse to the grass fortifications around the castle, the sounds of marching feet echo through the sound system. I'm back in the world of the play, at the end of Hamlet, joining the march where the prince's body is taken away.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "I recently saw a statistic that surprised me: in February of 2025, Americans used their television sets to watch YouTube more than anything else. More than Disney. More than HBO. Even more than Netflix.\nI often think of YouTube as a service for young people \u2013 specifically, young people using their phones. But that's all changing. A recent report by research firm Moffett Nathanson projects that by the end of this year, YouTube's revenue will eclipse that of the entire Walt Disney Company (movies, theme parks and all). That report put it bluntly, dubbing YouTube the \"king of all media\".\nBut what does it mean for the rest of the entertainment industry when YouTube is more popular than anything else and YouTube stars seem just as likely to receive big Hollywood deals as A-list actors?\nI spoke about all of this with Lucas Shaw, a reporter and editor for Bloomberg and the author of the Screentime newsletter. It was a fun conversation \u2013 you can watch or read more of it here:\nBelow are excerpts from our conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity:\nKatty Kay: Lucas, people who became famous on YouTube \u2013 Mr. Beast, Cocomelon, etc \u2013 are now getting their own shows on streaming platforms. Is that the direction that we're going to see this going, where increasingly YouTube becomes the incubator for shows that then go onto streaming?\nLucas Shaw: Hollywood studios and TV networks have tried to make programming with social media talent \u2013 especially YouTube stars \u2013 for at least a decade now. Lilly Singh was a big YouTuber who got a late-night talk show; it didn't quite work. Grace Helbig was a big YouTuber who got a talk show. There were some movies that cast talent. We're now seeing a second or third attempt at it.\nI think part of the reason is that these stars have gotten so big that there is now greater confidence that they can deliver. And part of it is that Hollywood companies have learned that they can't force some of this talent into their formats. They have to sort of empower them to continue doing what they're doing. So, the Mr. Beast show for Amazon is just like a maximal version of what he does on his YouTube channel. And with Cocomelon, they're basically licensing YouTube videos and then paying them to make slightly longer and more expensive versions of it. We'll continue to see more of that.\u00a0\nKK: So, there's a difference in what it takes to be successful on YouTube compared to what it takes to be successful on traditional television and streaming platforms?\nLS: Yeah, I think so. I think what people want on YouTube is different from what they want from Netflix, at least for now. People come to like a creator for doing a specific thing.\nThere was a point in time at which this Swedish gaming creator PewDiePie was the biggest YouTube star in the world and YouTube funded an original program with him as part of this original programming initiative that they had. And it didn't resonate in the same way that his channel did, because it wasn't what people came to watch. People liked watching him speak off the cuff while playing games. There was an intimacy to that, but there was also a rawness and it felt sort of less sanitised and manicured. And so, then seeing him being a star of a more traditional TV show, even though it's already on YouTube, I just don't think it appealed to those people in the same way.\nKK: Lucas, you just came back from a trip around Asia. Is there no global competitor \u2013 or even an American competitor \u2013 who looks like it's going to knock YouTube off its perch of such huge dominance?\u00a0\nLS: There was definitely a moment where TikTok appeared to be that \u2013 and YouTube was intimidated because a lot of emerging and independent creators were posting to TikTok first. One of YouTube's great strengths historically was that it lowered the barrier to entry for anyone who wanted to make a video. And that barrier started to feel higher to some, because YouTube had gotten so big and there were established players. So, going from zero to 100 got much harder and they saw creators going to TikTok instead. TikTok is still a big competitor, but there just isn't anything that operates in as many different categories as YouTube. Spotify is competing with YouTube in music and in podcasting and in some video.\nNetflix obviously competes with YouTube globally; I'd say it's one of the biggest competitors in terms of entertainment. But YouTube and Netflix just play different roles, because YouTube is free. For instance, YouTube has hundreds of millions of users in India. Netflix has about 15 million. It's just much easier for YouTube to penetrate some of these poorer markets. Now, there's not as much money there, but from a just \"reach as many people as possible\" standpoint, there really isn't a direct comparison. Maybe Instagram.\nKK: I had a conversation recently with Jonathan Haidt and we were talking about kids and screen time and it occurred to me that so many of the social media companies \u2013 TikTok, Instagram, and others \u2013 have been hauled up before Congress to justify what they're doing. And YouTube seems to have escaped some of that scrutiny. How has it done that and do you think it'll carry on doing that?\nLS: I think it comes back to this idea that people don't know how to categorise YouTube. It is in some ways a social network, right? And I think some people initially saw it that way because it came from Silicon Valley, because there were comments, because people were uploading their own videos. But it is also an entertainment platform. But also, at its core \u2013 because it's part of Google \u2013 it's a search engine. That's in a lot of ways how Google views it. It's a video search engine. And so, I think the difficulty of categorising it has just made it so that people aren't quite sure how to approach it.\u00a0\nBut you're right that they haven't received the same scrutiny from a regulatory perspective, certainly not as much as Meta or TikTok, and it's a little bit baffling. You know, speaking from an American perspective, it is so funny to me that the government would not allow one company to own two domestic broadcast television networks, but it's fine that Meta owns both Facebook and Instagram, both of which reach way more people than any broadcast network. Or it's fine that Alphabet owns both Google and YouTube, both of which reach way more people than any broadcast TV network. So, I think part of this is also that our regulatory behavior is pretty antiquated.\nEditorial Note:\nThis conversation took place before the Federal Trade Commission and Mark Zuckerberg's\u00a0antitrust hearing\u00a0regarding Meta, Facebook and Instagram's parent company.\nKK:\u00a0What are the big changes that you see coming to the platform in the next year or two?\u00a0\nLS:\u00a0I'd say, in aggregate, the big change is that as more advertising dollars flow to YouTube creators and channels will have more money to invest in their programming. There's a pretty widely held belief that you'll continue to see the caliber and cost of some of the top YouTube shows go up and more closely resemble television. You may see some more expensive unscripted shows. Mr. Beast is one example, right? The average cost of one of his videos is $3m three or four million dollars, which is comparable to what you'd see on television, but not comparable to almost anything else you'd see on YouTube.\nAnother big area that I'm actually in the middle of writing a story about now is the growth of scripted programming. It's still pretty small on YouTube, partially because it is more complicated and more expensive. I think another part of it is that YouTube as a platform is just more hospitable to unscripted programming. But as it becomes possible to make more money on YouTube and as it becomes clearer to top writers and actors that there's a much bigger audience on YouTube than some of these other places, I think you'll see more and more people try scripted.\nKK:\u00a0Is YouTube the straw that broke the camel's back of monoculture? I grew up in an era where there were still just a few channels on television. Everybody watched the same thing. But now, it seems that it is really broken. And I wonder whether people will start hankering for that again, for a common experience in this very fragmented, polarised, divided world that we live in.\nLS:\u00a0I don't know the answer to that. I think we like the idea of there being a monoculture, right? It's fun when you have a moment like when\u00a0Barbie\u00a0came out and it seemed like everyone was talking about the movie or the\u00a0Taylor Swift tour\u00a0happens and everyone is talking about this tour. We are social creatures, and so we enjoy these moments where everyone is bonded by the same idea or interested in the same topic. But it certainly doesn't feel like we're on the precipice of returning to that in any way.\nIf you think about how Netflix and YouTube work, which are the two dominant entertainment platforms right now, they are tailored to your individual tastes. People don't watch shows and videos at the same time. There are things that go viral, but that virality is fairly short-lived.\u00a0\nI guess\u00a0Adolescence\u00a0in some ways feels like a monoculture moment, right? Everyone is watching and talking about this show. But unlike in the past, when that might last for the 10 or 20 or 30 weeks that it's on, it lasts for a week or two. And then, we're on to the next one. That pattern feels like it will only continue and accelerate. I don't see us reverting to some world in which we are all watching the same thing, unless there's a fundamental shift in the distribution mechanism.\u00a0\nKK:\u00a0Yeah, it's been described to me as a moment where we're living in a \"me culture\" with short attention spans.\nLS:\u00a0Yeah, because it's all about YouTube, Instagram, Netflix. Everything feels like they are serving you specifically, as opposed to serving all of us collectively.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "summary": "\"Prior to the win over Scotland, England struggled in the first half against Ireland, leading only 7-5 at half-time, with the hosts also producing vital turnovers to nullify the Red Roses.France number eight Teani Feleu is joint-second for turnovers in this year's Six Nations with four, while lock Manae Feleu is also handy over the ball and has made three steals at the breakdown.Les Bleues are likely to take note from Gallagher, who tops the overall stats with eight turnovers, and target England's breakdown to prevent quick ball reaching their clinical outside backs.Captain Zoe Aldcroft is top for attacking ruck arrivals (101) in the competition, and will need more support from the rest of her pack in order to retain the ball.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Women's Six Nations highlights: England 59-7 ScotlandStop France's pack power & fix maulEngland's pack have been dominant up front in all four of their wins during this year's Six Nations.Scrum dominance over Ireland resulted in the second-half sin-binning of prop Niamh O'Dowd, which helped England score two tries and swing the game.Scotland scored their first try against England since 2023 from a powerful maul drive on Saturday, with Mitchell also unhappy about his side's set-piece. And what threat do the French pose?Guinness Women's Six Nations: England v FranceSaturday, 26 April at 16:45 BSTAllianz Stadium, TwickenhamWatch on iPlayerWatch live on BBC Two, BBC iPlayer and online, listen on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, live text and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and appWin the kicking battleFrance almost stunned England when they last travelled to Twickenham in 2023, when they scored 33 points in an incredible second-half fightback.The game finished 38-33 as France cut loose in attack in the second period, scoring tries from all over the pitch, showing what can happen if you kick inaccurately to their dangerous backs.Having scored 141 points in this year's championship and 21 points in last year's defeat by Mitchell's side in Bordeaux, Les Bleues remain dangerous in attack through their old-school French flair, meaning accuracy from the boot is needed to win the territorial battle and shut down opportunities.Scrum-half Pauline Bourdon Sansus remains a class act - proven in her standout display in a dominant second-half performance against Scotland - and has the ability to produce a magic moment from anywhere and at any time.Fly-half Carla Arbez is joint-second for kicks in play (52) this championship, a tactic France have avoided using in their previous two encounters with Mitchell's side. It doesn't matter where England play in the Women's Six Nations, comfortable bonus-point wins follow.The 59-7 hammering of Scotland last weekend means the Red Roses have secured the maximum possible 20 points from their four matches to set up a Grand Slam decider against France at Allianz Stadium, Twickenham on Saturday.John Mitchell's side have breezed past the competition so far but he has challenged his side to produce the \"complete performance\" to secure a seventh successive title.Les Bleues are also undefeated this campaign and were the last team to beat the Red Roses in the Six Nations - back in 2018. \"A big, long kicking game where you can pressure France is going to be huge,\" former England fly-half Katy Daley-Mclean told BBC's Rugby Union Weekly. \"France are one of the few packs in the Six Nations that I think can rival what England do,\" Daley-Mclean added.With 10 offloads between lock pairing of Fall and Feleu, Mitchell's side will need to target wrapping up the ball as well as the tackler.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Women's Six Nations highlights: Italy 21-34 FranceLine-upsEngland: Sing; Dow, Jones, Heard, MacDonald; Harrison, Hunt; Botterman, Atkin-Davies, Muir, Talling, Ward, Aldcroft (capt), Feaunati, Matthews.Replacements: Cokayne, Clifford, Bern, Galligan, Burton, L Packer, Aitchison, Rowland.France: Bourgeois; Grisez, M Menager, Vernier, Arbwy; Arbez, Bourdon; Brosseau, Bigot, Khalfaoui, M Feleu (capt), Fall-Raclot, Escudero, Champon, T Feleu.Replacements: Riffonneau, Mwayembe, Bernadou, Zago, Berthoumieu, Maka, Chambon, Queyroi.Referee: Maggie Cogger-Orr (NZ)TMO: Quinton Immelman (SA)Related topicsRugby Union",

These boys have no fear and really want it.\n\"If a Chinese player became a world champion there's no doubt that player would become a national hero.\"\nTrailblazer Ding has come the closest to snooker's ultimate glory, losing 18-14 to Mark Selby in the 2016 final.\nOf the six Chinese players left in, four have won ranking tournaments, with two of those coming this season - Xiao at the Wuhan Open in October and Lei in the Scottish Open in December.\n\"There's been a big improvement in Chinese players,\" said Ding. \"In the past two or three seasons, they've improved so quickly.\n\"They're showing people how good they are and they've won tournaments, which says they've got the talent, skills and form to play anybody.\n\"It tells people they're ready to play the biggest tournament and hopefully one of them can win it. I would love to see a Chinese player win a World Championship - it would be great for Chinese snooker and also for the young ones to look at and start playing from a young age.\"\nDing Junhui won the first of his 15 ranking titles just after his 18th birthday at the China Open in 2005\nSince the turn of the century, there has been a British winner at the Crucible in every year apart from when Australian Neil Robertson triumphed in 2010 and Belgium's Luca Brecel took the 2023 title.\nBut a long-term aim from snooker bosses has been to grow the game globally.\n\"Most people thought this sport was very English and would remain this way, but we could see a real burning will to grow in these countries,\" said Ferguson.\nA pivotal moment in snooker's development came when it was added into the World Games in Akita, Japan in August 2001.\n\"That really changed the face of snooker,\" added Ferguson. \"I remember walking into the arena with my friends from Asia and we were carrying a banner in a stadium in front of 60,000 people which said 'Billiards Sports'.\n\"My friend said to me: 'Jason, remember this day, this day is when snooker becomes a sport.'\n\"We had taken this game which was doing well and very popular in England and had turned it into a sport.\"\nSnooker's popularity in China grew at a rapid rate, accelerating when a shy Ding, two days after his 18th birthday, defeated seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry to win the 2005 China Open, watched by a reported television audience of 110 million people in the country.\n\"Because of Ding, snooker now has a big market,\" said world number 12 Zhang Anda. \"Ding being world champion would be good for every player because China is a very big market. I hope he can win the first one.\"\n\"It's not just about major events in China, we've built Chinese snooker from the bottom up,\" said Ferguson.\n\"China embraced this sport and gave it a lot of love and care. The one thing China has got right is access to snooker facilities in schools and mainstream education. That's something we need here.\n\"The players are coming together in academies - there are three in Sheffield - and you find players playing against each other day in, day out and the standard of snooker is absolutely amazing.\"\nChinese snooker, and the sport in general, received a huge setback in June 2023 when 10 players from China received bans for their involvement in match-fixing.\nFormer Masters champion Yan Bingtao was among those banned, while Liang Wenbo and Li Hang were handed lifetime bans.\nZhao, a former UK Championship winner, served an 18-month ban and has been the only player to return after he had not directly thrown a match but accepted charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on matches himself.\n\"It was a shame some players fell foul of the rules, it was a really sad time and difficult to deal with,\" said Ferguson.\n\"We kept close to our partners in China and the authorities in snooker. We worked together to educate players better and to ensure the players have opportunities. The sport has recovered and it has not stopped the talent coming through.\"\nHalo World Snooker Championship\n19 April to 5 May\nCrucible Theatre, Sheffield\nWatch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport website and app; live text coverage of selected matches; updates on BBC Radio 5 Live\nPang Junxu beat compatriot Zhang Anda in the first round this year and will play Ronnie O'Sullivan in the last 16\nRobertson knows what it is like to break through the British dominance of snooker and felt the unity the Chinese players were showing this year was a massive boost.\nThe Australian added: \"Xiao Guodong said it's like 'Team China' and they are really happy for each other and I like that mindset. He said they're trying to take the burden off Ding and support him and they're in it together.\n\"The game is getting stronger and stronger in China and it makes first rounds in all tournaments harder as we're only going to get more Chinese players qualifying.\n\"They don't seem fazed by the Crucible and all seem to play well, even on debuts, so it's exciting for snooker. We're seeing a lot of international flags, which is great for the game.\"\nSo what happens to snooker if a Chinese player lifts the famous trophy on Monday, 5 May?\n\"It's something the authorities we've been working in China with have dreamed of, that one day they would have the world champion,\" said Ferguson.\n\"If a Chinese player wins it would be magical, a historical moment, a real shift in the sport, and I can't tell you the media frenzy it would cause for snooker around the world.\"",

        "article_text": "Israel's destructive military campaign in Gaza has released a silent killer: asbestos.\nThe mineral, once widely-used in building materials, releases toxic fibres into the air when disturbed that can cling to the lungs and - over decades - cause cancer.\nNowadays, its use is banned across much of the world, but it is still present in many older buildings. \nIn Gaza, it is found primarily in asbestos roofing used across the territory's eight urban refugee camps - which were set up for Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes during the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli war - according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).\nIn October 2024, UNEP estimated that up to 2.3 million tons of rubble across Gaza could be contaminated with asbestos. \n\"The Gaza rubble is a very, very toxic environment,\" says Professor Bill Cookson, director of the National Centre for Mesothelioma Research in London. \"People are going to suffer acutely, but also in the longer term as well, things that children may carry throughout their lives.\"\n\"The lives lost now are not going to end here. The legacy is going to continue,\" says Liz Darlison, CEO of Mesothelioma UK.  \nWhen asbestos is disturbed by something like an air strike, its fibres - too small to see with the human eye - can be breathed in by those nearby and can then work their way through to the lining of the lungs.\nOver many years - usually decades - they can cause scarring which leads to a serious lung condition known as asbestosis, or, in some cases, an aggressive form of lung-cancer named mesothelioma.\n\"Mesothelioma is a terrible, intractable illness,\" says Prof Cookson.\n\"The really worrying thing,\" he adds, \"is that it's not dose related. So even small inhalations of asbestos fibre can cause subsequent mesothelioma.\n\"It grows within the pleural cavity. It's extremely painful. It's always diagnosed late. And it's pretty well resistant to all treatments.\"\nTypically, those who contract mesothelioma do so 20 to 60 years after exposure - meaning it will take decades before the possible impact across the territory is felt. A higher level, or longer period, of exposure is believed to accelerate the progression of the disease.\nDr Ryan Hoy, whose research into dust inhalation was cited by the UNEP, says it is extremely difficult to avoid breathing in asbestos fibres because they are \"really tiny particles that float in the air that can get very, very deep into the lungs.\"\nThey are even harder to avoid, he says, because Gaza is so \"densely populated\". The territory houses approximately 2.1 million people and is 365 sq km (141 sq miles) - about one quarter of the size of London.\nExperts on the ground there say people are unable to manage the risks posed by asbestos or dust inhalation due to the more immediate dangers of Israel's military offensive. \n\"At this point in time, [dust inhalation] is not something that is perceived as a worrying thing by the population. They even don't have things to eat, and they're more afraid to be killed by the bombs,\" says Chiara Lodi, medical co-ordinator in Gaza for the NGO M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. \n\"The lack of awareness about the risks of asbestos, combined with the ongoing challenges [people in Gaza] face in trying to rebuild their lives, means they are unable to take the necessary measures to protect themselves,\" a Gaza-based spokesperson for the NGO SOS Children's Villages said. \nMany are \"not fully aware of the harmful effects of the dust and debris\", they added. \nAfter a previous conflict in Gaza in 2009, a UN survey of the territory found asbestos in debris from older buildings, sheds, temporary building extensions, roofs and the walls of livestock enclosures.\nThere are several types of asbestos ranging from so-called \"white asbestos\", which is the least dangerous, to \"blue\", or crocidolite, which is the most. Highly-carcinogenic crocidolite asbestos was previously found in Gaza by the UN.\nGlobally, around 68 countries have banned the use of asbestos, though some maintain exemptions for special use. It was banned in the UK in 1999, and Israel banned its use in buildings in 2011.\nAs well as mesothelioma, asbestos can cause other forms of lung cancer, larynx and ovarian cancer. \nA further, lesser known risk is that of silicosis, a lung disease caused by breathing in silica dust, usually over many years. Concrete generally contains 20-60% silica.\nDr Hoy says the sheer amount of dust in Gaza could lead to an \"increased risk of respiratory tract infections, upper and lower airway infections, pneumonia, exacerbations of pre-existing lung disease like asthma,\" as well as, \"emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which can be worsened by acute exposure to dust\".\nFor years, the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York have been used as a case-study by health experts to examine the effects of a large toxic dust-cloud on a civilian population.\n\"The Twin Towers were not in the middle of a war zone,\" says Ms Darlison, \"so it was something we were able to measure and quantify easier\".\nAs of December 2023, 5,249 of those who were registered with the US government's World Trade Center Health Programme have died as a result of aerodigestive illness or cancer - a far higher figure than the 2,296 people who were killed in the attack itself. A total of 34,113 people were diagnosed with cancer over the same period. \nThe US and a group of Arab States have proposed competing plans for the reconstruction of Gaza. The UN has warned that the process will have to be managed carefully to avoid disturbing the vast amounts of asbestos-contaminated rubble.\n\"Unfortunately,\" says Ms Darlison, \"the very properties that made us use so much of it are the properties that make it difficult to get rid of.\" \nA UNEP spokesperson told the BBC that the debris removals process will \"increase the likelihood of asbestos disturbance and the release of hazardous fibres into the air\". \nA UNEP assessment indicated that clearing all debris could take 21 years and cost up to $1.2 billion (\u00a3929m).\nThe Israeli military launched its offensive on Gaza in response to Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023 that killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 people taken hostage. \nIsrael's offensive has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. \nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.

Hamas must retreat. \"\nSpeaking out is dangerous. Hamas has never tolerated dissent. Al-Natour seems undaunted, writing a furious column for the Washington Post at the end of March.\n\"To support Hamas is to be for Palestinian death,\" he wrote, \"not Palestinian freedom\".\nWasn't it dangerous to speak out in this way, I asked him.\n\"We need to take a risk and speak out,\" he replied without hesitation.\n\"I'm 30 years old. When Hamas took over, I was 11. What have I done with my life? My life has been wasted between war and escalating violence for nothing.\"\nSince Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 by violently ousting political rivals, a year after winning national elections, there have been three major wars with Israel and two smaller conflicts.\n\"Humanity demands that we raise our voices,\" al-Natour said, \"despite suppression by Hamas\".\nHamas may be busy fighting Israel, but it's not afraid to punish its critics.\nAt the end of March, 22-year old Oday al-Rubai was abducted by armed gunmen from a refugee shelter in Gaza City.\nHours later, his body was found covered in horrific wounds.\nThe Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights said Oday had been tortured, calling his death \"a grave violation of the right to life and an extrajudicial killing\".\nAl-Rubai had participated in recent anti-Hamas protests. His family blamed Hamas for his death and demanded justice.\nDays earlier, a frightened al-Rubai posted a dark, grainy video on social media in which he expressed his fear that Hamas militants were coming for him.\n\"Gaza has become a city of ghosts,\" he said, glancing over his shoulder.\n\"I'm stranded in the street, not knowing where to go. I don't know why they're after me. They destroyed us and brought ruin to us.\"\nAt his funeral, a small crowd demanded revenge and repeated demands for Hamas to get out of Gaza.\nLast summer, Amin Abed almost suffered the same fate, following his decision to speak out against Hamas.\nMasked militants beat him senseless, broke bones all over his body and damaged his kidneys. Abed survived but had to seek medical treatment abroad.\nNow living in Dubai, he's still involved in the protest movement, and believes that Hamas' authority is diminished.\n\"Hamas' power has begun to fade,\" he told me.\n\"It targets activists and civilians, beats and kills them to scare people. But it's not how it was before.\"\nBefore the ceasefire collapsed last month, Hamas fighters seemed intent on highly visible displays of power.\nBut now, with Israel once again attacking relentlessly, the same gunmen have retreated underground and Gaza's civilians have been plunged back into the misery of war.\nSome of the more recent protests suggest that civilians, driven to the edge of madness by a year and a half of Israeli bombardment, are losing their fear of Hamas.\nBeit Lahiya, at the northern end of the Gaza Strip, has seen some of the most vociferous opposition.\nIn a series of voice notes, an eyewitness \u2013 who asked not to be named \u2013 described several recent incidents in which local residents prevented Hamas fighters from carrying out military actions from inside their community.\nOn 13 April, he said, Hamas gunmen tried to force their way into the house of an elderly man, Jamal al-Maznan.\n\"They wanted to launch rockets and pipes [a derogatory term used for some of Hamas' home-made projectiles] from inside his house,\" the eyewitness told us.\n\"But he refused.\"\nThe incident soon escalated, with relatives and neighbours all coming to al-Maznan's defence.

We don't want you in this place. We don't want your weapons that have brought us destruction, devastation and death.\"\nElsewhere in Gaza, protesters have told militants to stay away from hospitals and schools, to avoid situations in which civilians are caught up in Israeli air strikes.\nBut such defiance is still risky. In Gaza City, Hamas shot one such protester dead.\nWith little to lose and hopes of an end to the war dashed once more, some Gazans direct their fury equally at Israel and Hamas.\nAsked which side he blamed most for Gaza's catastrophe, Amin Abed said it was \"a choice between cholera and the plague\".\nThe protest movement of recent weeks is not yet a rebellion, but after almost 20 years of rule Hamas' iron grip on Gaza is slowly slipping.",

the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service,\" it said in a statement.\nThe fines are relatively small given the tech companies' huge worldwide revenues - and are a fraction of Google's \u20ac2.4bn fine from last September.\nBut they are significant in the context of the current global economic situation.\nIn February, Donald Trump's White House issued a memorandum complaining about EU and UK regulation of American tech firms. \n\"Today's decisions are important in that they confirm that the European Commission will not back down,\" Anne Witt, professor of law at the EDHEC Business School in France, told the BBC.\nProf Witt said the disagreement was \"not so much about substantive antitrust principles,\" given the US government is itself taking a number of big tech companies to court over alleged monopoly power.\nThey are more \"about the fact that European institutions are telling US companies how to behave, even if these decisions are limited to have these companies behave on European soil,\" she added.\nOne company pleased with the ruling against Apple is Epic Games, the makers of Fortnite. \nThey had a long-running dispute over the distribution of their apps on Apple devices.\nEpic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said the ruling was \"great news for app developers worldwide\" in a thread on X.\nHe urged the US to pass similar legislation which would allow developers to distribute their apps without using Apple's App Store, which charges fees for using its platform.\nA US-based think tank, which is partly funded by big tech firms including Apple and Meta, came out against the decision.\nThe Information Technology and Innovation Foundation said the European Commission \"has made clear that the DMA will be used to extract revenues from U.S. firms even as they continue striving to comply with its strictures.\"\n\"The Commission's actions today will not be well received by the Trump administration,\" it said.\nThe UK is also investigating big tech companies over alleged monopoly power, after a digital competition law was brought in last year focusing on companies with large market shares. \n\"Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems and Google's general search and search advertising services are currently being investigated for potentially having this status, and it is likely that other US tech giants and platforms will face similar investigations in the near future,\" said Andrew Maxwell, partner at law firm Freeths.",

Those from Australia, Canada or New Zealand can extend by a further year.\nThese visas are subject to annual quotas, ranging from 100 visas for Andorra to 42,000 for Australia, with ballots held where they are oversubscribed.\nApplicants from these countries need at least \u00a32,530 in savings, cannot apply for most benefits, and have to pay an annual NHS surcharge of \u00a3776 for students and \u00a31,035 for workers.\nThe European Commission first suggested an EU-wide youth deal in April last year, claiming Rishi Sunak's government had approached European capitals to discuss individual visa deals, risking \"differential treatment\" of EU citizens.\nUnder its original proposal, people aged between 18 and 30 would be able to apply for visas lasting up to four years to work, study, train or volunteer, with no overall cap on the number of visas issued.\nIt also said EU applicants should not have to pay the NHS surcharge, and should be able to pay the same university tuition fees as British students, rather than the higher fees they have had to pay since Brexit. \nThere have been suggestions that the Home Office, tasked with delivering government plans to lower overall migration, is pushing for any eventual agreement to be more limited than that suggested by the European Commission.\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper is reportedly arguing for visas to be limited to one year so that EU citizens taking part do not show up in official immigration figures, with applications also subject to an overall cap.\nAsked about the reports, Mr Berger declined to comment, saying that \"we have to leave that to the negotiations\". \nThe EU has been keen to stress that a visa deal would not replicate the bloc's rules on freedom of movement, under which EU citizens were automatically entitled to live and work in the UK without applying for a visa.\nDocuments circulated between EU states also suggest a deal could be rebranded as a \"youth experience\" scheme, in an apparent bid to downplay any link to migration.\nBut any deal that is negotiated is likely to lead to a political row, with the Conservatives and Reform UK critical of a proposed agreement.\nDuring a local election campaign visit earlier, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said a deal risked \"another avenue which people might use to game the system,\" adding that Labour \"doesn't know how to negotiate\".\nShe added: \"Where are all these people they want to bring in going to work?\"\nReform leader Nigel Farage said a deal could lead to a \"huge number of people\" coming to the UK, adding it would be \"completely against what the Brexit vote demanded\".\nAn agreement has however been strongly supported by the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, which have long been calling on the Labour government to reach an agreement with the EU. \nIn his comments on Thursday, Mr Berger insisted a deal would have \"nothing to do with migration\" as those taking part in the scheme would \"go home\" once their visa has ended.

        "article_text": "California's economy has overtaken that of the country of Japan, making the US state the fourth largest global economic force.\nGovernor Gavin Newsom touted new data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the US Bureau of Economic Analysis showing California's growth. \nThe data shows California's gross domestic product (GDP) hit $4.10 trillion (\u00a33.08 trillion) in 2024, surpassing Japan, which was marked at $4.01 trillion. The state now only trails Germany, China and the US as a whole.\n\"California isn't just keeping pace with the world - we're setting the pace,\" Newsom said.\nThe new figures come as Newsom has spoken out against President Donald Trump's tariffs and voiced concern about the future of the state's economy. \nCalifornia has the largest share of manufacturing and agricultural production in the US. It is also home to leading technological innovation, the centre of the world's entertainment industry and the country's two largest seaports. \nNewsom, a prominent Democrat and possible presidential candidate in 2028, filed a lawsuit challenging Trump's authority to impose the levies, which have caused disruption to global markets and trade. \nTrump has enacted 10% levies on almost all countries importing to the US, after announcing a 90-day pause on higher tariffs. \nAnother 25% tariff was imposed on Mexico and Canada. The levies on China, however, have led to an all-out trade war with the world's second largest economy. \nTrump imposed import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods coming into the US and China hit back with a 125% tax on American products.\nHis administration said last week that when the new tariffs were added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nNewsom noted his worries about the future of the state's economy. \n\"While we celebrate this success, we recognise that our progress is threatened by the reckless tariff policies of the current federal administration,\" he said. \"California's economy powers the nation, and it must be protected.\"\nTrump has argued his trade war is only levelling the playing field after years of the US being taken advantage of. \nThe tariffs are an effort to encourage factories and jobs to return to the US. It is one major pillar of his economic agenda, as is a cut in interest rates, aimed at reducing the cost of borrowing for Americans.\nThe new data shows California's GDP behind the US at $29.18 trillion, China at $18.74 trillion and Germany at $4.65 trillion. It also shows California was the fastest growing among those countries.\nJapan's economy is under pressure because of its decreasing and ageing population, which means its workforce is shrinking and social care costs are ballooning. \nThis week, the IMF cut its economic growth forecast for Japan and projected that  the central bank would raise interest rates more slowly than previously expected because of the impact of higher tariffs.\n\"The effect of tariffs announced on April 2 and associated uncertainty offset the expected strengthening of private consumption with above-inflation wage growth boosting household disposable income,\" its World Economic Outlook report said.",

        "article_text": "Alex Yee is making his London Marathon debut 10 years after completing the Mini London Marathon for a fifth time\nWhen Alex Yee sits down for post-race dim sum with his family on Sunday, it will represent a poignant full-circle moment.\nThat was the reward Yee, who has Chinese heritage on his father's side, recalls provided the main motivation to run - and twice place third in - the Mini London Marathon as a child.\nIt was not long before the spectacle of the London Marathon captured his imagination and he nagged his parents to help him peer over the barriers for a closer look at the elites.\nBut on Sunday it is Yee, the reigning Olympic and world triathlon champion, whom hundreds of thousands of spectators will hope to catch a glimpse of as he embraces the unknown on the streets of his home city.\n\"As time went on I realised the excitement of the London Marathon, the impact it had and how momentous a day it was,\" Yee tells BBC Sport before his debut over 26.2 miles.\n\"I'm not thinking past the experience but afterwards I'd definitely like to get some dim sum with my family and have that deja vu moment,\" he adds, 10 years on from his last mini marathon.\nThere are certainly less demanding challenges the 27-year-old could have undertaken to provide the mental refresh he sought after a career-defining year. \nBut after capturing triathlon's two biggest prizes fewer than 12 weeks apart, ending his world title wait in October after his spectacular recovery on the banks of the River Seine clinched Olympic gold in Paris in the summer, Yee knew where he wanted to set his sights next.\nNot that he expected his coach to agree to his left-field suggestion.\n\"Definitely not. It's been something I've asked every single year, but it never really made sense,\" says Yee, the most decorated Olympic triathlete in history.\n\"This time we were trying to think what would get me to LA [2028 Olympics] in the best place mentally and physically. It was important to freshen things up.\n\"It's been really exciting to work on my running after five years of trying to make my swim and bike an appropriate level to be competitive in triathlon. It's something I've wanted to do and I'm excited to scratch that itch.\" \nLondon Marathon 2025 - everything you need to know\n'Our daughters will be with us', say dads of Southport victims running London Marathon\nAlex Yee overturned a 15-second deficit to rival Hayden Wilde in the final 2.5km to win a dramatic Olympic men's triathlon gold at Paris 2024\nIt should be no surprise that Yee, an athlete obsessed with the process of improvement as much as the success it brings, has relished this new challenge. \nHe speaks about his first marathon training block with a beaming smile and is not ruling out another in future - although a return to triathlon is scheduled for early 2026 at the latest.\n\"To have something which has given me that purpose to get out of bed, to go out and keep searching for those fine margins, I think that's really rare to find in the first year after an Olympics when you hear of athletes soul searching and not knowing what to do,\" says Yee.\n\"To be an expert on something, you have to be once a fool. That's the way I'm seeing it. I wanted to go in with an open mind and come out the other side as a better runner - but also better holistically.\n\"It's been really interesting to learn from so many people and feel like a novice again.\"\nYee is part of a stellar elite men's field featuring 10 athletes who have run the marathon in under two hours and five minutes, including one of his sporting idols in four-time winner Eliud Kipchoge.\nThere is also Olympic champion Tamirat Tola, defending champion Alexander Mutiso Munyao, and debutant Jacob Kiplimo - who in February became the first person to run a half marathon in under 57 minutes. \nYee's target? Enjoy the experience - and go through halfway in 64 minutes and 30 seconds. \nThat would give him the chance to become only the 10th British man to run under 2:09, while only 22 have broken 2:10.\nRunning is Yee's strongest discipline and he has competed for Great Britain on the track and in cross-country, while his 5km best of 13:26 is the third-fastest ever by a British man.\n\"It would be a massive honour to, hopefully, be in that ballpark of people who have achieved amazing things,\" says Yee.\n\"I think it's going to be an amazing day for the Brits but also a historic day at the front. Hopefully I can say I was part of a sub-two hour marathon race.\"\nAlex Yee will meet Eliud Kipchoge, whose most recent London Marathon victory came in 2019, after Sunday's race\nTo Yee's astonishment, Kipchoge was among those to offer him advice and said in January that he would like to meet and help mentor the Briton when they are in London.\nSo the former mini marathon runner and Kenya's two-time Olympic champion have arranged to meet after the race.\nIn the meantime, Kipchoge, widely regarded as the greatest distance runner of all time, has offered wisdom via WhatsApp - something Yee describes as \"surreal\".\n\"His big piece of advice was to get to the start line. It sounded silly at the time, but after unfortunately seeing people forced to pull out, it's probably the strongest piece of advice of all,\" says Yee.\nThey are likely to have much to discuss. \nBoth are passionate about using the power of sport to inspire, with Yee now keen to utilise his platform as Olympic champion.\nHe intends to provide opportunities to school children through the launch of his own foundation, initially in the south London area he grew up in.\nYee also hopes documenting his marathon journey on YouTube can demonstrate that elite athletes are not \"superhuman\", before he stars on the other side of the barriers he used to watch behind. \n\"The more we share our story I feel like people realise that we're just like anyone else, and there's no reason why they can't dream to achieve what I have - or even so much more,\" says Yee.\n\"You start to feel this urgency with the fortunate position I'm in, being an Olympic champion, that I can and I want to make a difference. \n\"I'm not expecting to leave this big legacy behind. If I can change one person's life, that's good enough for me.\"",

        "article_text": "The scion of a prominent Maryland family who was top of his class at an elite private school before graduating from an Ivy League university, Luigi Mangione seemed to have everything going for him, according to friends.\nThey were left stunned by the 26-year-old's arrest for the murder of UnitedHealthcare's chief executive Brian Thompson, who was fatally shot outside of a hotel in New York City on 4 December. Mr Mangione denies that he murdered the father of two.\nAccording to a law enforcement, Mr Mangione was allegedly motivated by resentment at what he called \"parasitic\" health insurance companies.\nHe had spent time in a surfing community in Hawaii, but left owing to debilitating back pain, say those who remember him. It is unclear, however, to what extent his own health troubles shaped his views of the medical industry.\nMr Mangione is currently being held without bail at a notorious jail in Brooklyn, also holding rapper Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. He is facing federal charges, as well as state charges in New York and Pennsylvania. \nFederal prosecutors are pursuing the death penalty after charging him with multiple crimes, including murder and stalking.\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi said the death penalty was necessary because he committed a \"cold-blooded assassination that shocked America\".\n\"After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again,\" she continued.\nLawyers for Mr Mangione have called the move a \"political stunt\".\n\"Luigi is caught in a high stakes game of tug-of-war between state and federal prosecutors, except the trophy is a young man's life,\" said his lawyers, Karen Agnifilo and Avi Moskowitz.\nIn New York, Mr Mangione has been charged with 11 crimes, including murder and terrorism.\nHe also was charged in Pennsylvania with forgery, carrying firearms without a licence, tampering with records or identification, possessing instruments of crime and providing a false identification to police.\nHe was arrested five days after the attack, at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and was allegedly in possession of a gun, bullets, multiple fake IDs and cash.\nMr Mangione also had a handwritten document that expressed \"ill will\" towards corporate America and included passages such as \"frankly, these parasites had it coming\", according to police.\nInvestigators say the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Mr Thompson's murder. \nLaw enforcement sources say this may be a reference to the \"three Ds of insurance\" - tactics used by companies to reject payment claims by patients.\nMr Mangione comes from a prominent family in the Baltimore area who are known for businesses including country clubs, nursing homes and a radio station according to local media. \nThe suspect's paternal grandparents, Nicholas and Mary Mangione, were real estate developers who purchased the Turf Valley Country Club in 1978 and Hayfields Country Club in Hunt Valley in 1986.\nShortly after Mr Mangione was charged, his cousin, Republican state lawmaker Nino Mangione, released a statement saying the family was \"shocked and devastated\".\n\"We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved\", the statement read.\nThomas Maronick, a defence attorney who knows members of the family, told the BBC of his shock at the charges.\n\"You wouldn't think someone of privilege or means from a family that's known for doing so much for the community would do something like this,\" he said. \nMr Mangione attended the private, all-boys Gilman School in Baltimore. He was valedictorian, an accolade usually bestowed on the student with the highest academic achievements. \nSpeaking to the BBC's US partner, CBS News, one of his classmates said Mr Mangione \"didn't have any enemies\" and was a \"valedictorian for a reason\".\nMr Mangione went on to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a bachelor's and master's degree in computer science, according to the school, and founded a video game development club. \nA friend who attended the Ivy League college at the same time as Mr Mangione described him as a \"super normal\" and \"smart person\".\nMr Mangione was employed as a data engineer for TrueCar, a digital retailing website for new and used cars, according to his social media profiles. A company spokesman told the BBC he had not worked there since 2023. \nHe also spent time in a co-living surfing community in Hawaii called Surfbreak. Sarah Nehemiah, who knew him then, told CBS he left due to his back injury, which had worsened from surfing and hiking.\nFriends have told US media he had surgery on his back. The background image on an X account believed to belong to Mr Mangione shows an x-ray of a spine with hardware in it. \nOn a Reddit account that appears to have belonged to him, Mr Mangione reportedly posted about his struggles with chronic back pain and brain fog. \nA former roommate, RJ Martin, told the BBC that while Mr Mangione \"never complained\", his back pain at times \"prohibited him\" from doing \"many normal things\", such as surfing or playing volleyball. \nMr Martin - who eventually lost contact with Mr Mangione - said that he believed his former friend \"would have never conceived of hurting someone else\". \n\"There's no making sense of it,\" he added. \nA person matching his name and photo had an account on Goodreads, a user-generated book review site, where he read two books about back pain in 2022, one of them called Crooked: Outwitting the Back Pain Industry.\nHe also gave four stars to a text called Industrial Society and Its Future by Theodore Kaczynski \u2013 also known as the Unabomber manifesto. \nStarting in 1978, Kaczynski carried out a bombing campaign that killed three people and injured dozens of others, until he was arrested in 1996.\nIn his review, Mr Mangione acknowledged Kaczynski was a violent individual, but also described him as a political revolutionary.\nMr Mangione's mother reported him missing in November to San Francisco authorities, telling them she had not heard from her son since July. \nAfter police began searching for the shooting suspect in Thompson's murder, the missing person report Mr Mangione's mother filed was flagged to authorities, New York Police Department Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters on Tuesday. \nPolice contacted Mr Mangione's mother, who did not identify her son as the suspect but said \"it might be something that she could see him doing\".

Speaking to the BBC's US partner, CBS News, one of his classmates said Mr Mangione \"didn't have any enemies\" and was a \"valedictorian for a reason\".PA Department of CorrectionsPolice released this mugshot of Mr Mangione after he was charged with murderMr Mangione went on to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a bachelor's and master's degree in computer science, according to the school, and founded a video game development club. \"Luigi is caught in a high stakes game of tug-of-war between state and federal prosecutors, except the trophy is a young man's life,\" said his lawyers, Karen Agnifilo and Avi Moskowitz.In New York, Mr Mangione has been charged with 11 crimes, including murder and terrorism.He also was charged in Pennsylvania with forgery, carrying firearms without a licence, tampering with records or identification, possessing instruments of crime and providing a false identification to police.He was arrested five days after the attack, at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and was allegedly in possession of a gun, bullets, multiple fake IDs and cash.Mr Mangione also had a handwritten document that expressed \"ill will\" towards corporate America and included passages such as \"frankly, these parasites had it coming\", according to police.Investigators say the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Mr Thompson's murder. A former roommate, RJ Martin, told the BBC that while Mr Mangione \"never complained\", his back pain at times \"prohibited him\" from doing \"many normal things\", such as surfing or playing volleyball. After police began searching for the shooting suspect in Thompson's murder, the missing person report Mr Mangione's mother filed was flagged to authorities, New York Police Department Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters on Tuesday.",

Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.\nThat indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.\nAnd it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster. \nThe crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.\nResolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be.\n\"These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,\" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.\n\"But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,\" he argued.\nGraphics by Erwan Rivault",

        "article_text": "A record-breaking tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany, which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia's links with the rest of Europe.\nRunning for 18km (11 miles), the Fehmarnbelt will be the world's longest pre-fabricated road and rail tunnel.\nIt's also a remarkable feat of engineering, that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor, and then joined together.\nThe project's main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel, on the coast of Lolland island in the south east of Denmark.\nThe facility spans more than 500 hectares (1,235 acres), and includes a harbour and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections, which are called \"elements\".\n\"It's a huge facility here,\" says Henrik Vincentsen, chief executive of Femern, the state-owned Danish company that is building the tunnel.\nTo make each 217m (712ft) long and 42m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete. \nMost underwater tunnels - including the 50km Channel Tunnel between the UK and France \u2013 burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor. Here instead, 90 individual elements will be linked up, piece by piece, like Lego bricks.\n\"We are breaking records with this project,\" says Mr Vincentsen. \"Immersed tunnels have been built before, but never on this scale.\"\nWith a price-tag around \u20ac7.4bn ($8.1bn; \u00a36.3bn) the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark, with \u20ac1.3bn from the European Commission.\nIt's among the region's largest-ever infrastructure projects, and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying.\nOnce completed, the journey between R\u00f8dbyhavn in southern Denmark and Puttgarten in northern Germany, will take just 10 minutes by car, or seven minutes by train, replacing a 45-minute ferry voyage.\nBypassing western Denmark, the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and Hamburg from five to 2.5 hours, and provide a \"greener\" shortcut for freight and passengers.\n\"It's not only linking Denmark to Germany, it's linking Scandinavia to central Europe,\" states Mr Vincentsen. \"Everybody's a winner,\" he claims. \"And by travelling 160km less, you'll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport.\"\nTowered over by cranes, the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead.\n\"So now we are in the first part of the tunnel,\" announces senior construction manager Anders Gert Wede, as we walk inside the future highway. It's one of five parallel tubes in each element.\nThere are two for railway lines, two for roads (which have two lanes in each direction), and a maintenance and emergency corridor.\nAt the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea. \"As you can hear, it's quite thick,\" he says tapping on the metal.  \"When we have a finished element  at the harbour, it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here.\"\nNot only are these elements long, they're enormously heavy, weighing over 73,000 tonnes. Yet incredibly, sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks, gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats.\nNext it's a painstakingly complex procedure, lowering the elements 40 metres down into a trench dug out on the seafloor, using underwater cameras and GPS-guided equipment, to line it up with 15mm precision.\n\"We have to be very, very careful,\" emphasises Mr Wede. \"We have a system called 'pin and catch' where you have a V-shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element, dragging it slowly into place.\"\nDenmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic, on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes.\nWith layers of clay and bedrock of chalk, the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel, said Per Goltermann, a professor in concrete and structures at the Technical University of Denmark.\nA bridge was initially considered, but strong winds might disrupt traffic, and security was another important consideration.\n\"There was the risk of ships crashing into bridges. We can build the bridge so they can withstand it,\" he adds. \"But this is rather deep water, and the biggest ships can sail there.\"\nSo, adds Mr Goltermann, it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel. \"They looked at it and said, \"Okay, what is the cheapest? The tunnel. What is the safest? The tunnel.\"\nDenmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in 2008, but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact.\nOne such environmental group, Nabu (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union), argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbour porpoises, which are sensitive to underwater noise.\nHowever in 2020 their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany, which green-lighted construction to go ahead.\n\"We have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible,\" says Mr Vincentsen, pointing to a 300-hectare wetland nature and recreational area that's planned on reclaimed land, which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock.\nWhen the tunnel opens in 2029, Femern estimates that more than 100 trains and 12,000 cars will use it each day.\nAccording to plans, revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state-backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction, and Mr Vincentsen calculates that will take around four decades.  \"Ultimately, the users are going to pay,\" he says.\nIt's also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs, business and tourism in Lolland, which is one of Denmark's poorest regions.\n\"The locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years,\" said Mr Wede, who grew up nearby. \"They're looking forward to businesses coming to the area.\"",

Yungblud is leaving his hotel in Amsterdam when he's approached by a fan in floods of tears.\n\"You saved my life,\" she sobs.\n\"No, you saved your own life,\" he replies, quietly. \"Maybe the music was the soundtrack, but you saved your own life, OK?\"\nLeaning in for a hug, he adds, \"Don't be sad, be happy. I love ya.\"\nIt's a remarkably touching moment, full of compassion and devoid of rock star ego.\nTwo weeks later, after a video of the encounter goes viral, Yungblud is still moved by the memory.\n\"I didn't think people would see that, except me and her,\" he says, \"but it was such a moment for me.\"\nThe interaction crystallised something he'd felt for a while.\n\"I always said that Bowie and My Chemical Romance saved my life, but ultimately you have to find yourself,\" he says.\n\"Like this morning, I put my headphones on and I listened to [The Verve's] Lucky Man, and it made me go, 'Oh, I'm ready to face the day'.\n\"But Richard Ashcroft didn't tell me I was ready to face the day. I said that to myself. \n\"That's what I was trying to tell that girl in Amsterdam.\"\n\nSelf-assurance is a lesson he learned the hard way.\nOn the surface, Yungblud, aka 27-year-old Dominic Harrison, had it all. Two number one albums, an international fanbase, a Louis Theroux documentary and enough clout to run his own festival.\nBut if you looked more closely, there were chinks in the armour. Those number one albums both fell out of the Top 30 after one week, a sign of a strong core fanbase, with limited crossover appeal.\nAnd the first year of his Bludfest in Milton Keynes was criticised after long queues and a lack of water caused fans to pass out and miss the concert.\nHarrison was keenly aware of it all. As he released his self-titled third album in 2022, he hit a low.\n\"Yungblud was number one in seven countries, and I wasn't happy because it wasn't the album I wanted to make,\" he says.\n\"It was a good album, but it wasn't exceptional.\"\nThe problem, he says, was a record label who'd pushed him in a more commercial direction. But in polishing his sound, he lost the angry unpredictability that characterised his best work.\n\"It's funny, my-self titled album was actually the one where I was most lost,\" he observes.\n\"I felt like I compromised but, because of that, I was never taking no for an answer again.\"\nNowhere is that clearer than on his comeback single, Hello Heaven, Hello.\nOver nine minutes and six seconds it achieves Caligulan levels of excess, full of scorching guitar solos, throat-shredding vocal runs, and even an orchestral coda.\n\"Do you still remember, or have you forgotten where you're from?\" Harrison asks himself, as he re-ignites his ambition.\nThe song's purposefully unsuited to radio \u2013 unlike the follow-up single, Lovesick Lullaby. Released today, it's a free-associating rampage through a messy night out, that ends with epiphany in a drug dealer's apartment.\nCombining Liam Gallagher's sneer with Beach Boys' harmonies, it's uniquely Yungblud. But the singer reveals it was originally written for his last album.  \n\n\"We were actually discouraged from doing it,\" he says.\n\"My advisor at the time, a guy called Nick Groff [vice president of A&R at Interscope, responsible for signing Billie Eilish], was like, 'I don't get it'.\"\nWarming to the theme, he continues: \"The music industry is crap because it's all about money but, as an artist, I need to make sure that anything I put out is exciting and unlimited. \n\"It can't be like a 50% version of me.\"\nTo achieve that, he shunned expensive recording studios and made his new album in a converted Tetley brewery in Leeds. \nProfessional songwriters were banished, too, in favour of a close group of collaborators, including guitarist Adam Warrington, and Matt Schwartz, the Israeli-British producer who helmed his 2018 debut.\n\"When you make an album in LA or London, everything is great, even if it's mediocre, because people want a hit out of it,\" he argues.\n\"When you make an album with family, all they want is the truth.\"\nOne of the most honest tracks on the record is Zombie, a lighters-aloft ballad (think Coldplay, sung by Bruce Springsteen) about \"feeling you're ugly, and learning to battle that\".\n\"I always was insecure about my body, and that got highlighted as I got famous,\" says the singer, who last year revealed he'd developed an eating disorder due to body dysmorphia.\n\"But I realised, the biggest power you can give someone over you is in how you react. So I decided, I'm going to get sober, I'm going to get fit, and I discovered boxing.\"\nHe ended up working with the South African boxer Chris Heerden - who was recently in the news after Russia jailed his ballerina girlfriend, Ksenia Karelina.\n\"I met him before all that,\" says Harrison, \"but he's been extremely inspirational. Boxing's become like therapy for me.\n\"If someone says something bad about me, I go to the gym, hit the punch bag for an hour and talk it out.\"\nFans have noticed the change\u2026 drooling over photos of his newly chiseled torso, and declaring 2025 his \"shirt-off era\".\n\"Maybe the shirt-off era is a comeback to all the comments I've had,\" he laughs.\n\"I'm claiming a freedom and a sexiness and a liberation.\"\nHe's clearly found a degree of serenity, without surrendering the restless energy that propelled him to fame.\nPart of that is down to control. In January, he created a new company that brings together his core business of recorded music with touring operations, his fashion brand and his music festival, Bludfest.\nThe event kicked off in Milton Keynes last summer but suffered teething troubles, when fans were stuck in long queues. \n\"I will fully take responsibility for that,\" says the star, who claims he was \"backstage screaming\" at police and promoters to get the lines moving.\n\"The problem was, there were six gates open when there should have been 12,\" he says, suggesting people underestimated his fans' dedication.\n\"When Chase and Status had played [there] a day before, there were 5,000 people when the doors opened, and another 30,000 trickled in during the day.\n\"With my fans, there were 20,000 kids at the gate at 10am. So we've learned a lot for this year. There'll be pallets of water outside. It'll be very different.\"\n\nDedication to his fans is what makes Yungblud Yungblud. \nHe built the community directly from his phone and, whether intended or not, that connection has sustained his career - insulating him from the tyrannies of radio playlists and streaming placement.\nMaintaining a personal relationship becomes harder as his fanbase grows but, ever astute, he hired a fan to oversee his social accounts.\n\"She's called Jules Budd. She used to come to my gigs in Austin and she'd sell confetti to pay for gas money to the next city.\n\"She built an account called Yungblud Army, and she's amazing at letting me understand what are people feeling.\n\"If people are outside and security aren't treating them right, I know about it because she's in contact with them. So I brought her in to make the community safer as it gets bigger.\"\nWith his new album, he wants to make that community even bigger. Harking back to the sounds of Queen and David Bowie, he says it'll \"reclaim the good chords\" (Asus4 and Em7, in case you're wondering).\n\"The shackles are off,\" he grins.\n\"We made an album to showcase our ambition and the way we want to play. \n\"Can you imagine seeing Yungblud in a stadium? 100% yes. Let's do it.\"",

        "article_text": "Tesla boss Elon Musk has pledged to \"significantly\" cut back his role in Doge, the body tasked with reducing US government spending and cutting jobs.\nThe Department of Government Efficiency has faced legal challenges over the scope of its work, and Musk and his team have been been criticised for a lack of transparency. \nHowever, polling suggests its cost-cutting agenda has widespread support. \nDespite its full name, Doge is not an official government department, which can only be established by an act of Congress.\nInstead the advisory body was created by an executive order signed by US President Donald Trump. \nPart of Doge's mission, according to the order, relates to IT upgrades aimed at boosting efficiency. It must finish its work by July 2026.\nMany Doge staff appear to be young people with tech backgrounds and limited or no government experience. \nYes. Musk initially said he would perform his role as an outside volunteer but the White House later confirmed he would operate as an unpaid special government employee.\nThat designation covers those working for the government for no more than 130 days in a year.\nSupporters argued that the body's outsider status - and somewhat vague mandate - would increase its effectiveness.\n\"They're a little more untethered to the bureaucracy itself and to the systems that slow processes down around here,\" Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told the BBC. \n\"I think the lack of parameters is part of what will make them effective.\"\nIn an unexpected appearance at the White House in February, Musk denied leading a \"hostile takeover\" of the US government, and defended his approach. \n\"The people voted for major government reform and that's what the people are going to get,\" he said. \"That's what democracy is all about.\"\nHe also made a number of exaggerated and unsupported claims during the event. \nMusk said his \"time allocation to Doge\" would \"drop significantly\" from May to one to two days per week, after accusations he had taken his focus off Tesla.\nHis political involvement has sparked global protests and boycotts against the company's cars. \nIn April, the firm said sales had fallen to their lowest level in three years and warned investors that \"changing political sentiment\" could continue to hurt demand.\nMusk was already due to reach his 130-day limit on government work in late May, but it is not clear whether he will step down completely.\nHe pledged to stay on \"as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it's useful\".\nMusk said Doge's mission was to end the \"tyranny of the bureaucracy\", save taxpayers' money and reduce US national debt, which stands at $36tn (\u00a328.9tn). \nInitially he said he hoped to save as much as $2tn a year, but later tempered this estimate.\nIt is not clear how much money Doge has managed to save so far, although its X account gives regular, celebratory updates about its activities.\nThese have included shuttering government agencies, defunding programmes and mass layoffs:\nPolling in February by the BBC's US partner CBS News suggested that Doge had popular appeal. It indicated that a majority of Americans - especially Republican voters - backed its work.\nDavid Ditch, a senior analyst at the Economic Policy Innovation Center, a conservative think tank, insists Doge's work is necessary:\n\"They're shining a very bright spotlight on various parts of the federal government and they're asking -  whether it's the American public, whether it's moderate members of the Republican caucus - is this how you want America's tax dollars to be used?\"\nBut even some of those who support Doge's work appear to dislike Musk himself.\nIn February, Pew Research found that 54% of Americans had an unfavourable view of him, including 37% who said their view was \"very unfavourable\".\nPolitical opponents and government watchdogs have criticised Doge for acting without transparency and spreading misinformation about government spending - and accuse Musk of overstepping his authority as an unelected official.\nThey highlight potential conflicts of interest, given Musk's businesses hold contracts with the US government worth billions. Trump and Musk deny that any conflicts have arisen.\nDemocrats accuse them of tampering with funding approved by Congress that is outside the president's scope. The White House denies that the work has broken any laws.\nMultiple groups including unions and state attorneys general have sued Doge and the wider Trump administration over their plans. \nOn several occasions the courts have stepped in to halt the cost-cutting moves, at least once blocking Doge directly when a judge stopping the agency from accessing personal data held within US Treasury records. \nMany analysts remain sceptical about whether Doge can deliver on its bold pledges.\nElaine Kamark from the Brookings Institution said government spending could be streamlined, highlighting her own work for President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.\nBut she described Musk's goal to slash a third of government spending as \"ridiculous\", since so much of the budget was mandatory, including popular programmes like Social Security and Medicare.",

Who are clever and know when to be inside and when to be outside.\n\"There's so much more to him than his game, but his game is perfect for how we work and how we play.\"\nGreg Taylor's heat map in the 5-1 win against Kilmarnock on 12 April\nTaylor's pass map in the 5-1 win against Kilmarnock\nSince returning to Celtic Rodgers has been clear he wants to take them up a level in European competition.\nThis season was a step forward as they went close to taking Bayern Munich to extra-time in the play-off round, after racking up 12 points in the league phase.\nTo continue that trend and their dominance of Scottish football, Rodgers knows they need even greater depth and a variety of options in a long season.\nThat is also why keeping Taylor is important to him. While Tierney, he says, could play further infield, his strengths are more using his pace and dribbling ability to get behind defences and put crosses into the box.\nThose different strengths are why the Celtic manager sees them \"dovetailing perfectly\".\nBut it's not just about ability, but personality as well. When the Celtic boss was asked about Taylor's future he was effusive in his praise for his player's attitude.\nOne of the points he made was Taylor is always up for every game  - \"And I mean every game\" - the Celtic boss emphasised.\nThe inference was not enough of his team were sufficiently motivated for the first half of their 1-0 loss at McDiarmid Park, something that is understandable given their huge lead in the Premiership, but unacceptable at Celtic.\nThe nature of the club and Scottish football means a native core is important, as they intuitively understand winning every domestic game is demanded at Glasgow's big two.\nWhile Tierney will clearly bring that leadership, for Rodgers having as many characters like that as possible, as long as they are also effective, is key.\n\"He's very instrumental off the field, he's got a big personality in the changing room,\" the Celtic boss said of Taylor.\n\"His character fits this club. He's in tune with what being a Celtic player is about. You look at James [Forrest], Callum [McGregor], they live with the expectation, the feeling and what the demands are of this club and Greg lives that feeling as well.\"\nAll that said, no player is perfect. Taylor's lack of height and pace does leave him vulnerable when stepping up to Champions League level.\nComparing his defensive output to that of Celtic's right-back Alistair Johnston in European games this season suggests this.\nThe Canadian's duel success rate is 54% compared to Taylor's 46%, while the difference in tackle success is 14% in Johnston's favour, while naturally he was more effective at winning aerial duels too given his height advantage.\nWith less time and space, Taylor's impact in the middle of the pitch is also reduced.\nMichael Olise's goal for Bayern at Celtic Park was an example of Taylor being undone by a ball in behind due to a lack of pace and poor judgment, and he was dropped for Crystal Palace loanee Jeffrey Schlupp for the return leg.\nAnd while any player is capable of being undone at Champions League level and Taylor still played his part in the successes in Europe, one of the big appeals of bringing Tierney back are his physical attributes - when fit - and dogged one-on-one defending.\nRodgers has often mentioned a lack of running power and athleticism as reasons why Celtic struggled in the Champions League for so long, something a fit Tierney will help solve.\nThe question for Celtic, though, is not whether they should keep Taylor but, at what point does it become too expensive to?\nA player of Tierney's pedigree will not come cheaply in wages, and so paying two essentially 'first choice' left-backs would be a big call, and not something Celtic would usually do.\nThe other option is to bring in a younger, cheaper understudy to play the minutes Tierney will miss, with the hope they develop and grow in ability and value.\nThose are the solutions Celtic will be considering. And the decision they take could be instructive of how Rodgers wants his team to grow.\n\"Greg knows how we all feel about him here,\" the Celtic boss said.\n\"It's a big decision at 27, if you commit you're committing for four or five years so you're saying this is your big contract here.\n\"I think he knows what he gets from a football perspective, he has every right to take his time and try and get his value met.\"",

Taylor's lack of height and pace does leave him vulnerable when stepping up to Champions League level.Comparing his defensive output to that of Celtic's right-back Alistair Johnston in European games this season suggests this.The Canadian's duel success rate is 54% compared to Taylor's 46%, while the difference in tackle success is 14% in Johnston's favour, while naturally he was more effective at winning aerial duels too given his height advantage.With less time and space, Taylor's impact in the middle of the pitch is also reduced.Michael Olise's goal for Bayern at Celtic Park was an example of Taylor being undone by a ball in behind due to a lack of pace and poor judgment, and he was dropped for Crystal Palace loanee Jeffrey Schlupp for the return leg.Image source, BBC SportAnd while any player is capable of being undone at Champions League level and Taylor still played his part in the successes in Europe, one of the big appeals of bringing Tierney back are his physical attributes - when fit - and dogged one-on-one defending.Rodgers has often mentioned a lack of running power and athleticism as reasons why Celtic struggled in the Champions League for so long, something a fit Tierney will help solve.The question for Celtic, though, is not whether they should keep Taylor but, at what point does it become too expensive to?A player of Tierney's pedigree will not come cheaply in wages, and so paying two essentially 'first choice' left-backs would be a big call, and not something Celtic would usually do.The other option is to bring in a younger, cheaper understudy to play the minutes Tierney will miss, with the hope they develop and grow in ability and value.Those are the solutions Celtic will be considering. \"So what might Celtic do?All that said, no player is perfect.",

        "article_text": "He had tea with the Queen, was blessed by the Pope and spread Hawaiian culture across the globe. More than a century later, a festival dubbed the \"Olympics of hula\" honours his legacy.\nSilence engulfed the audience at Edith Kanaka'ole Stadium in Hilo, Hawai'i, as a group of hula dancers appeared on stage. They moved gracefully in unison, rhythmically depicting a scene of an ancient Hawaiian myth as they bellowed mele (chants). The hula performance, which was part of the annual Merrie Monarch Festival, wasn't a mere spectacle; it was a powerful celebration of Hawaiian culture \u2013 and for years, it was banned.\nThe week-long\u00a0Merrie Monarch Festival (which takes place 20-26 April 2025 and is celebrating its 62nd anniversary) has been called the \"Olympics of hula\"\u00a0and perpetuates the sacred, centuries-old practice of dancing and chanting that preserves and portrays our native Hawaiian language, history, religion and culture. Every year, thousands of Hawaiians descend on the Big Island to attend the event, while thousands more watch live broadcasts of Hawai'i's 23 best h\u0101lau (hula groups) compete on TV. Yet, the festival is more than just a hula contest; its dance performances, arts and craft exhibitions, and a royal parade through downtown Hilo is considered the biggest display of Hawaiian culture in the world.\n\"It's the one week out of the year where we celebrate being Hawaiian,\" said K\u016b Kahakalau, a Hawaiian language and culture expert. \"And it's all thanks to the undertakings of King Kal\u0101kaua.\"\nFondly dubbed \"The Merrie Monarch\", King David La'amea Kal\u0101kaua was the last king of Hawai'i. He ruled the Kingdom of Hawai'i from 1874 until his death in 1891, but his ascension to the throne was nothing short of contentious. Shortly after the death of King Kamehameha IV, whose family had ruled the kingdom since 1795, Hawai'i's legislature\u00a0decided to elect a native\u00a0ali'i\u00a0(noble chief) instead of the king's widow. The decision incited a full-blown riot. As the queen's supporters stormed the Honolulu courthouse, British and American sailors stationed at Honolulu harbour were called in to quell the fighting and Kal\u0101kaua took the oath of office the following day.\nBy the time of Kal\u0101kaua's reign, Native Hawaiian heritage was at great risk. Christian missionaries had begun arriving on the islands in 1820, introducing diseases that killed Native Hawaiians, converting islanders away from our traditional polytheistic religion and infiltrating the political system to suppress local culture and beliefs. One of the most significant ways they did this was by banning public performances of the hula, a dance missionaries deemed \"vile heathen chants\".\nKal\u0101kaua sought to restore a unified sense of national pride among Hawaiians, and his reign marked a period of cultural renaissance across the islands. He lived by the motto Ho'oulu L\u0101hui\u00a0(Increase the Nation) and sought to remake Hawai'i for Hawaiians \u2013 all of which resulted in the revival of traditional customs such as language, music, arts and traditional medicines that had long been suppressed during the missionary-influenced era of his predecessors. One of his crowning achievements was preserving the hula. As Kal\u0101kaua famously proclaimed: \"Hula is the language of the heart, and therefore the heartbeat of the Hawaiian people.\"\u00a0\nTo many people around the world, \"hula\" may conjure images of tiki bars, plastic dancers shaking their hips on car dashboards or something that only happens at beachside resorts. But long before hula was commodified and appropriated, it was a sacred dance among Native Hawaiians \u2013 an ancient practice that served as an archive of our stories, beliefs and way of life. Prior to the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, there was no written language in Hawai'i. Instead, ancient Hawaiians used oral tradition and hula to pass on their identity and culture from one generation to the next. Even when practice was prohibited, Hawaiians took hula underground, continuing to teach the forbidden dance in secret in caves and far-flung areas.\nAs part of Kal\u0101kaua's Ho'oulu L\u0101hui\u00a0policy, hula experienced a resurgence. In fact, the king's lavish two-week coronation ceremony was essentially a celebration of Native Hawaiian culture, featuring traditional music, hula and l\u016b'au \u2013\u00a0all of which had previously been banned. To commemorate his 50th birthday three years later,\u00a0ho'opa'a\u00a0(chanters) and\u00a0'\u014dlapa\u00a0(dancers) performed in public for the first time in years, while a parade wound its way through downtown Honolulu. Today, the Merrie Monarch Festival pays tribute to the proud sense of Hawaiian identity Kal\u0101kaua revived.\n[Kal\u0101kaua] was deeply committed, proud and knowledgeable about his Hawaiian heritage,\" said Kahakalau, noting that the king was also the first person to have the Kumulipo (a creation chant that also includes the genealogy of Hawaiian royalty) written down.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nYet, Kal\u0101kaua wasn't just content to revive Hawaiian customs in Hawai'i; he wanted to share the Kingdom's culture around the world. So, in 1881, the \"Merrie Monarch\" continued the proud Hawaiian tradition of long-distance seafaring by\u00a0spending 281 days circumnavigating the globe, becoming the first head of state to travel around the world.\nDuring Kal\u0101kaua's international diplomacy tour, he was greeted by the Emperor of Japan to the sounds of\u00a0Hawai'i Pono'\u012b\u00a0(the Kingdom's national anthem, which Kal\u0101kaua had written); he proposed immigration policies with Chinese politicians; he toured the Great Sphinx with the Khedive of Egypt; he was blessed by Pope Leo XIII in Rome; he had tea with Queen Victoria of England, and he boarded a train that was struck by a bull in Spain. In New York, Kal\u0101kaua met with Thomas Edison to discuss the possibility of getting electricity to Honolulu. In 1886, the king's wish came true.\u00a0'Iolani Palace\u00a0(which is now a museum and the only royal residence in the United States), became illuminated with electric lights \u2013 five years before the White House did.\n\"He was able to build important relationships, create liaisons, and sign treaties with multiple countries [that benefitted our people],\" said Kenneth \"Aloha\" Victor, a kumu hula (master hula teacher) and designer of Kaulua'e, a made-in-Hawai'i clothing and lifestyle brand. In addition to sending envoys to Europe and Asia, Kal\u0101kaua maintained consulates and legations in more than 130 cities across the globe. The Kingdom had 13 consulates in Great Britain alone.\nBack at home, during an era of increased literacy, Kal\u0101kaua met with traditional na kahuna (priests) and na kapuna (elders) to compile many of the ancient Hawaiian myths and chants that are portrayed through hula and mele and write them in Hawaiian. In 1888, he took things one step further and translated these stories into English for the first time in the book, Legends and Myths of Hawai'i, which he often presented as gifts to foreign dignitaries so they'd get a better understanding of Hawai'i, its culture and its people.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The word embodying the spirit of Hawai'i\n\u2022 A lei maker's guide to the real Honolulu\n\u2022 Hawaii's ancient land management system\nKal\u0101kaua's mission to integrate Hawai'i with the rest of the world also resulted in the creation of the Hawaiian Youths Abroad Program, in which the king selected young Hawaiians whom he felt could become future leaders of the Kingdom and sent them abroad to study things like medicine, law, engineering, foreign languages and art.\u00a0More than 100 years later, the programme's legacy still echoes across the islands: Princess Abigail Kaw\u0101nanakoa, the granddaughter of one of the students the king sent abroad, played an instrumental role in restoring 'Iolani Palace and was a staunch supporter of native Hawaiian rights until her death in 2022.\nA multi-hyphenate in every sense of the word, Kal\u0101kaua embraced modernity just as much as he valued Hawaiian culture. He was a voracious inventor, designing blueprints for tornado-proof ships, fish-shaped torpedoes, sealed bottle caps and rangefinder scopes. He even had a telephone installed that connected 'Iolani Palace where he lived and worked to his private boathouse less than a mile away, where he'd often be found hosting royal l\u016b'aus\u00a0for foreign dignitaries and heads of state.\nFor Hawaiians today, Kal\u0101kaua is much more than just a Renaissance man. \"When Kal\u0101kaua travelled [abroad], he promoted and shared our culture with the world,\" said Ana Kon, a Hawaiian cultural specialist based in Hilo. \"It's why, more than a century later, we continue to honour his legacy today at the Merrie Monarch Festival.\"\nFor those unable to snag tickets to the Merrie Monarch Festival's highly coveted hula competitions, there are still plenty of opportunities to participate in the festivities. Hilo's Afook-Chinen Civic Auditorium and Butler Buildings host a vibrant arts and crafts fair featuring the creations of more than 150 local artisans and brands from across Hawai'i. \"Our 'aloha wear' is a celebration of hula,\" said Victor, of his clothing, which he said honours the people, places and movements in Hawaiian culture.\nOf course, Kal\u0101kaua's legacy lives on beyond the festival. In many ways, every hula step, l\u016b'au gathering and Hawaiian-language phrase is a nod back to our last king's efforts to revive our customs at home and introduce them around the world. Visitors can experience this first hand at O'ahu's Polynesian Cultural Center, which hosts a traditional Hawaiian l\u016b'au paying homage to Queen Lili'uokalani (Kal\u0101kaua's sister, who succeeded him until white businessmen\u00a0overthrew the Kingdom in 1893), while the Queen Emma Summer Palace\u00a0in Honolulu offers contemporary hula lessons for adults.\nOn Maui, immersive experiences at the\u00a0Grand Wailea\u00a0include an E Ala E\u00a0oli\u00a0(chant) in the mornings on the beach, while interactive language lessons teach guests how to pronounce words in\u00a0\u02bb\u014clelo Hawai'i\u00a0(Hawaiian). Beachside resorts like\u00a0Outrigger Reef in Waikiki Beach are adopting a regenerative tourism approach at its A'o Cultural Center by allowing guests to meet traditional Hawaiian navigators and canoe builders, teaching them how to use traditional Hawaiian tools and \u2013 yes \u2013 participate in hula lessons.\n\"It all spawns back to [King Kal\u0101kaua's] creed,\" said Victor. \"That hula is the heartbeat of our Hawaiian people.\"\nCORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this story stated that\u00a0US sugar planters overthrew the Kingdom of Hawai'i.

And we want to build on the relationship that we have,\" she added later speaking at a Semafor event.\nSome US officials have been positive about the prospects of a deal. Last week US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK.\nSpeaking to the BBC at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) event on Wednesday, Reeves said the UK was \"not going to rush into a deal\".\nBut she said the government was \"confident that working with our partners in the US we can get a better trading relationship and build on the substantial trade that already exists between our two great countries\".\n\"We want to get the right deal for Britain, to better support our industry, our jobs and consumers,\" she added.\nReeves said that the UK had been \"really clear\" in discussions with US negotiators \"that we're not going to be reducing agricultural standards in the UK\".\n\"The US administration respect and understand that we have high standards to support British farming, and to support British consumers, and we're not going to be relaxing those standards,\" she said.\nMany American farmers use growth hormones as a standard part of their beef production, something that was banned in the UK and the European Union in the 1980s.\nThe US has previously pushed for a relaxation of rules for its agricultural products, including beef from cattle that have been given growth hormones.\nFarmers in the UK warned ministers last week not to dilute British food standards, saying the use of hormones in rearing livestock cannot be accepted.\nShadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Conservatives would \"expect\" Reeves to stick to agricultural standards \"but let's see the detail as and when there is a deal\".\nHe said it is \"hugely important\" to \"get these 25% tariffs on cars and steel down\" but he said the government should be moving faster on negotiations.\n\"It's taken them a long time, in fact, to even have got in the room with the US administration to start discussing these issues, let alone getting a deal now,\" he said.\nTrump has brought in a large number of tariffs on imports to the US, arguing they will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs.\nThese include, as part of an ongoing trade war, levies of up to 145% on Chinese goods. China has hit back with a 125% tax on US products.\nThe move has rattled the world economy, sparking turmoil on global financial markets.\nPrices are expected to rise for consumers in the US as a result of the tariffs, due to the companies importing goods passing on higher costs.\nThe IMF has cut its global growth forecast because of the uncertainty caused by tariffs, and says it expects US growth to be hit the hardest.\nOn Wednesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the UK must take the risk of trade wars hitting global economic growth \"very seriously\".\nHowever, Reeves said: \"I do understand the concerns the US has about countries around the world that run large and persistent trade surpluses with the US.\"\nShe said the UK \"is not one of those countries\" so \"there is a deal there to be done between the UK and the US\".\nShe added that she understood \"the need to rebalance the global economy\".\nThis, in part, is why the UK announced on Wednesday a review of low-value imports coming into the UK which are \"undercutting the British High Street and British retailers\" she said.\nThis mirrors a US action, with the White House set to clamp down on deliveries under $800 - specifically those sent from China and Hong Kong - on 2 May.\nIt is set to close a loophole allowing low-value packages to enter the US without incurring any duties.\nThe removal of the so-called \"de minimis\" rule will hit companies including fast-fashion firm Shein and Temu, the low-cost retail giant.\nShein and Temu have both warned that they will increase prices \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\".\nThe UK government said that the UK Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) would be putting more resources into helping firms report unfair trade practices as part of its review.",

        "article_text": "Andrew Flintoff has given his first account of the car crash he was in while filming Top Gear, saying he thought he \"was dead\" in the immediate aftermath.\nThe England cricketer-turned-TV presenter sustained serious facial and rib injuries when the three-wheeler car he was driving for the BBC motoring programme rolled over in 2022.\nSpeaking in a new Disney+ documentary, 'Freddie' Flintoff said that despite the trauma, he \"remembers everything about it\".\n\"I thought I was dead, because I was conscious but I couldn't see anything,\" he recalled.\n\"I was thinking, is that it? Is that it? You know what I mean? Just black for the rest of my days?\n\"My hat came over my eyes - so I pulled my hat up and I thought, no I'm not [dead], I'm on the Top Gear track, this is not heaven.\"\nFlintoff then looked down to see blood, and said his \"biggest fear\" was that he no longer had a face left.\n\"I thought my face had come off. I was frightened to death.\"\nHe recalled being in \"agony\" for between half an hour and 40 minutes until an air ambulance arrived and he was taken to hospital.\nThe incident took place on 13 December 2022 at Top Gear's test track at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome in Surrey.\nHe was driving an open-topped Morgan Super 3 when it flipped and slid, dragging him along the track during filming.\nSpeaking in the documentary, he described how time seemed to slow down as the car rolled over, and how his quick reactions as a cricketer allowed him to move his head in an attempt to avoid even worse injuries.\n\"As it started going over, I looked at the ground and I knew, if I get hit here on the side [of the head] then I'll break my neck, or if I get hit on the temple I'm dead. The best chance is to go face down.\n\"And then I remember hitting [the ground] and my head got hit,\" he added. \"But then I got dragged out, and the car went over, and I went over the back of the car, and then [I got] pulled face down on the runway about 50m underneath the car. And then I hit the grass and then [it] flipped back.\"\nSurgeon Jahrad Haq, who treated Flintoff, told the documentary the injuries were \"very complex\" - a mixture of hard and soft tissue injuries, broken teeth, lost teeth and elements of the upper jaw bone that were also fractured and displaced.\nHe \"lost a really significant portion of his upper lip - the skin and some of the underlying muscle - and also his lower lip,\" he said.\nMr Haq said the injuries were in the \"top five\" in terms of severity of those he had seen during his career.\nReflecting on the recovery, Flintoff said he \"didn't think I had it in me to get through\" the ordeal.\n\"This sounds awful. Part of me wishes I'd been killed. Part of me thinks I wish I'd died,\" he added.\n\"I didn't want to kill myself. I don't want to mistake the two things. I was not wishing, but thinking, this would have been so much easier...\n\"Now I try to take the attitude, you know what, the sun will come up tomorrow, and then my kids will still give me a hug, and I'm probably in a better place now.\"\nOne of England's most successful cricketers, Flintoff previously said he is \"loving\" his return to the sport coaching England Lions - the development squad underneath England Men's cricket team.\nFlintoff's wife Rachael told the documentary his return to the sport was crucial on the road to recovery. \n\"When Andrew needed it most, cricket was there for him,\" she said. \"It sounds a bit weird saying it, a bit over the top to say, but I do think cricket saved him. It gave him a reason for being, again.\"\nThe 47-year-old also returned to television last year with a second series of his BBC programme Freddie Flintoff's Field of Dreams, which saw him take a team of young cricketers from his hometown of Preston on a tour of India, a year after his crash.\nThe acclaimed series is up for a Bafta Television Award in the factual series category next month.\nHe also hosted a reboot of darts game show Bullseye over Christmas, which will return for a full series later this year.\nIn 2023, the BBC \"rested\" Top Gear for the foreseeable future. A financial settlement was also reached with Flintoff.\nThe documentary, titled Flintoff, is on Disney+ from Friday, 25 April.",

The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the BBC ahead of the summit that there was increased \"international fragmentation\" leaving countries unable to solve the biggest risks to energy security.\n\"Instead of cooperation, we see countries are really challenging each other. In my view the lasting solution to energy security challenges goes through cooperation among the countries.\"\nHe did not blame any countries specifically for a breakdown in relations, but energy prices have been particularly impacted by the war in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's recent trade war. \nGlobal gas prices spiked following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and have remained nearly 50% higher than pre-Covid levels. \nEurope was initially able to plug the shortage of gas, following sanctions of Russia, by purchasing LNG from the US. But that supply is now under threat as relations between the bloc and President Trump worsen. \nThe US is attending the summit, which should be seen as a \"success\" according to Mr Birol. But the Trump administration has been highly critical of the global energy watchdog for its promotion of clean energy and forecasting declines in oil and gas.\nMany think tanks and researchers have defended the IEA's position. \n\"On the big calls \u2013 like the future of global oil demand \u2013 the IEA has consistently proven a more reliable forecaster than fossil fuel companies,\" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO, of the European Climate Foundation\n\"As countries come together to shape a new energy security paradigm, they need unbiased, dependable data on the future direction of energy,\" he added.\nMiliband also read out a letter from King Charles III.\n\"As we all navigate the transition to cleaner energy for our planet and energy security for our citizens, summits such as these are of vital importance in facilitating shared learning between nations, particularly those in the global south and across the Commonwealth,\" King Charles wrote.\nThe UK government wants 95% of Great Britain's electricity mix to come from clean energy by the end of the decade - currently this stands around 60%. \nMiliband told the BBC's R4 Today programme that this would guarantee lower energy bills by 2030.

When contacted by the BBC,  The Atlantic had no comment. \nThe interview comes a month after Mr Goldberg published a story about being added to a secret group chat on the encrypted texting app Signal. In the text chain, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and other top US officials discussed the details of an upcoming attack against the Houthis. \nThe scandal rocked the White House. Then, in April, the New York Times and others reported that Hegseth had shared information about the same military action in a second private Signal group chat, which included his wife, brother and personal lawyer.\nTrump has continued to stand by his defence secretary and others involved in the incident, telling reporters earlier this week: \"Pete's doing a great job ... Everybody's happy with him.\" \nHegseth's wife, Jennifer Rauchet, is a former Fox News producer and holds no official position within the Pentagon. \nHis brother, Phil, and personal lawyer Tim Parlatore, both hold positions at the Department of Defense. But it is not clear why any of the three would require advanced warnings about sensitive US strike plans.\nThe White House repeatedly has played down the scandals, claiming no \"classified\" information was shared with the Atlantic editor in the first chat. That thread included information about the exact timings of the air strikes as well as the weaponry being used, before the attack had taken place. ",

It's going to be exciting, the first six rounds will be explosive.''\nRetired world champion Tony Bellew: ''I think Conor Benn will get to Eubank. If he does get through those first five or six rounds, he's took what Conor's got and he starts unloading himself. It's a fight of two halves. Neither's defence is that good and both of them want to get at to each other, bad.''\nRetired world champion Barry Jones: \"I think Eubank wins on points. Benn might be able to tough it out as he is a tough kid, but I don't know if he has the ability. Eubank can't make middleweight no more, it drains him and he beat an old Liam Smith in their rematch. But he's a massive guy, so if he's able to rehydrate correctly, he is just too fast and too big.\"\nHeavyweight Fabio Wardley: \"My initial feeling is Eubank will get the win. The weight factor will play quite a big part, asking Benn to come up two weights is a lot against someone who is naturally comfortable fighting at that weight. Benn can carry some strong power at his weight, but there is a large difference when those punches which you hit in your previous weight would take them out but a bigger guy is more used to taking bigger shots and they don't have the same effect.\"\nScotland's first female world champion Hannah Rankin: \"I think it will be a later-round stoppage from Eubank. Experience and size is in his favour. I will be very surprised if Benn gets the win. Eubank is stronger. He's been in there with solid opponents that have tested his chin. I'm surprised how many people see this as a 50-50.\"\nUnbeaten light-welterweight Adam Azim: \"Benn to knock him out. He's the younger fighter, very powerful. Eubank's last performance wasn't the greatest.\"\nThis video can not be played\nFighting Benn is 10 times bigger now - Eubank\nMiddleweight Hamzah Sheeraz: \"I think Benn is going to win. I want Eubank to win for selfish reasons and wanting to fight him in the future, but I feel like Benn will do the job.\"\nHeavyweight Delicious Orie: \"I see Eubank doing the job. It will be a great fight but Eubank edges it. He has the experience and weight advantage. I think he's probably got into Benn's head a little bit as well in the press conferences. It's more than just about the physicality of it, it's about the mental side too.\" \nScotland's former undisputed light-welterweight world champion Josh Taylor: \"Eubank is the naturally bigger and more experienced opponent but Benn is a young, hungry lion. He has the advantage of not having to cut weight and to be able to get bigger and stronger. He also has youth on his side. But my head is going with Eubank.\" \nBenn's promoter, Eddie Hearn: \"Benn has to start fast in this fight, he has to land and he has to hurt him early and get his respect and, quite frankly, get him out of there. I think we need him out in six rounds. He lands early, clean and cold, and I believe Eubank is stopped.\"\nLight-heavyweight Lyndon Arthur: \"I think Benn's going to come out and he might shock Eubank. He could get caught coming in though.\"\nCruiserweight Cheavon Clarke: \"I'm on the fence. Maybe a draw.\"\nFormer light-middleweight world champion Liam Smith: \"I find it hard to pick a winner, I won't be surprised with either result. I do edge towards Benn winning on points.\"\nEubank's promoter, Ben Shalom: \"I think Eubank wins by knockout. It will be a frantic first two or three rounds and then it will calm down and Eubank will take over. A knockout in round six.\"\nBritish heavyweight Derek Chisora: \"The smart money is on Eubank. He had fights when Benn was on holiday. But I'm friends with Benn, he comes to my house so my money is on him. I'm 50/50 but I'll go with Benn because I want him to win because of his family and legacy.\"\nFormer cruiserweight world champion Johnny Nelson: \"I'm saying Eubank because he had more consistency in his career. Benn's style is so ferocious and attacking that should suit Eubank in the first six rounds.\"\nLight-heavyweight Anthony Yarde: \"If Benn wins it is because he goes in with controlled aggression and detonates when he needs to. If Benn hurts Eubank then he is good at finishing. If Eubank wins then it's being himself but an aggressive version of himself. He needs to be switched on. The version we saw in his second fight against Liam Smith. Eubank is a world-class operator and he has shown that.\"\nEubank Sr's former promoter Barry Hearn: \"I think this is a 50-50 fight - of course I'm on Conor's side, but I'm not going to ignore that the other man is a much bigger man with more experience. It is going to be something awesome. I think Nigel will have Conor ready for war but in a more controlled way.\"\nSuper-bantamweight Francesca Hennessy: \"They're both great fighters. I've been going back and forth. Eubank is bigger at the weight but Benn is strong and will come forward.

But you look at River City, and you go maybe one day I'll get into River City because they'll want to do a story about a big guy trying to lose weight.\n\"It doesn't feel like something that'll be here for four months and then go away.\"    \nThe series, set in a fictional west of Scotland area called Shieldinch, is filmed on a specially-built set in Dumbarton and featured the likes of Outlander star Sam Heughan in early roles.\nDeacon Blue singer Lorraine McIntosh, Scottish acting veteran Johnny Beattie and EastEnders actor Alex Ferns also took roles in the show.\nBibby said he brought the motion in the hope it would encourage BBC Scotland to think again, and that he was particularly concerned over closure of the Dumbarton studio.\nHe said: \"River City has been a platform and a pathway for young creative talent in Scotland. It's really important we have that platform, and I hope the BBC think again and maintain this iconic soap.\" \nThe Scottish government's culture secretary Angus Robertson said during the debate the decision to end River City was \"more than regrettable\" and that it displayed a \"worrying trend in decision making that runs counter to the BBC's commitment to invest in the nations.\"\nPurdon admitted the cancellation would carry an emotional impact for him personally, too.\nHe said: \"I'm 42 this year and I started when I was 19 so it means everything to me. I was there before I had my kids and now they see me on screen, so it's very important to me.\" ",

All that went through my head. I told [sports psychiatrist] Steve Peters that and he said 'I'm coming - I will get you through the first match'.\n\"I was quite a bit scared coming and playing.

I just couldn't correct it and every time you make a change you think 'this is terrible'.\n\"I've changed my alignment, changed certain things. I had lost all connection with the cue, the timing had gone, the touch had gone, feeling had gone.

It was a nice feeling and I did enjoy being out there.\n\"I didn't feel too nervous because my expectation levels were maybe just to get a few frames and see where we go. I didn't feel pressure and normally when I come here with a half-decent game I feel pressure more as it is a chance to go deep [into the draw], but on this occasion I wasn't expecting to do much.\n\"I'm going to give myself two years. No more exhibitions, no more distractions off the table. It might take one month, six months, a year and give it a good go. I owe it to snooker and to myself. I just have to put everything into this tournament.\"\nCarter felt O'Sullivan would claim an eighth world title if he could maintain the form he showed on Wednesday.\n\"No question, no-one can live with that,\" said the world number 18. \"He could've had 10 years off and still come here. He is a freak natural, that's why you love to watch him - he played fabulously well.\n\"When the opponent is potting all the balls every mistake is highlighted and you just have to sit and watch and hope. He looks like he is in a good place and he is the man to beat.\"\nJohn Parrott, the 1991 world champion, speaking on BBC Two, added: \"There should be a sign in the foyer which should say 'Quiet please, genius at work'.\n\"We use the word 'genius' in sport with people like Lionel Messi and players like Tiger Woods in his pomp. This boy is in that [bracket]. It's been over an extended period as well, and when he plays the cue ball sings.\n\"O'Sullivan seems in a very good place.

        "article_text": "The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has told the BBC that Ukraine may have to give up land as part of a peace deal with Russia, amid a growing pressure from President Donald Trump to accept territorial concessions.\n\"One of the scenarios is\u2026 to give up territory. It's not fair. But for the peace, temporary peace, maybe it can be a solution, temporary,\" he said in response to questions from the BBC.\nBut the 53-year-old former boxing champion-turned politician stressed that the Ukrainian people would \"never accept occupation\" by Russia.\nHe was speaking hours after a Russian missile-and-drone attack on Kyiv killed 12 people and injured more than 80.\nIt was one of the deadliest Russian assaults on the Ukrainian capital in months.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.\nKlitschko is now one of the most senior Ukrainian politicians to indicate publicly that his country may have to give up territory, albeit temporarily.\nThe Kyiv mayor and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are political opponents. The mayor has repeatedly accused the president and his team of trying to undermine his authority.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme from his office in central Kyiv on Thursday, Klitschko noted that he was \"responsible for the capital of Ukraine\", describing it as \"the heart\" of the war-torn country.\nHe said Zelensky might be forced to take a \"painful solution\" to achieve peace. \nWhen asked whether Zelensky has been discussing with him any details of a possible settlement, Klitschko replied bluntly: \"No.\"\n\"President Zelensky does [it] himself. It's not my function,\" he added.\nReferring to a very public bust-up between Zelensky and Trump at the White House in February, the mayor suggested that key issues between top politicians would be better discussed \"without video cameras\".\nEarlier this week, Trump accused Zelensky of harming peace negotiations, after the Ukrainian leader again ruled out recognising Russian control of Crimea, a southern Ukrainian peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014.\nTrump has said \"Crimea will stay with Russia\", in an interview with Time magazine on Friday, having previously said the peninsula was \"lost years ago\".  \nBut Zelensky has pointed to a 2018 \"Crimea declaration\" by Trump's then-secretary of state Mike Pompeo saying the US \"rejects Russia's attempted annexation\".\nUkraine and its European allies have in recent weeks expressed alarm over what many on the continent see as Trump's warming of relations with Vladimir Putin's Russia. \nIn later remarks made after his BBC interview about the possibility of Ukraine ceding territory, Klitschko said he \"did not say anything new\" and that many world politicians and media outlets were discussing it as a potential outcome of a peace deal.\n\"We understand that the scenario involving territorial concessions contradicts our national interests and we must fight against its implementation until the very end. This will require extraordinary efforts both from us and European partners,\" he added.\nAs talks ramp up, Russian strikes on Ukraine have continued. \nOn Thursday, an attack on Kyiv killed 12 people and injured dozens, officials said.

It's going to be be tough for everyone because people have grown up watching him. It will take some getting used to not having him around the club.\"\nVardy has scored 198 times in 496 appearances for the Foxes since his \u00a31m move from Fleetwood in 2012, showing the quality that led to appearances at Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup. \nEven before their memorable and miraculous title achievement, though, he helped Leicester to their 'Great Escape' in the 2014-15 campaign where they won seven of their last nine games to avoid relegation under Nigel Pearson. \nVardy scored goals in the Champions League and Europa League, and won the Premier League's Golden Boot in 2019-20 after scoring 23 times - the oldest to win the prize at the age of 33.\nHe also beat current Foxes boss Ruud van Nistelrooy's record of scoring in consecutive Premier League games when he netted in his 11th straight match against Manchester United in 2015.\nVardy was Leicester's leading light and the influential figure they turned to, and could rely on, in times of need.\nAfter relegation in 2023, he scored 20 times in all competitions last season as they won the Championship and, amid Leicester's troubles in this campaign, he is their top scorer with eight goals.\nIt's no surprise he was on target when they last scored at home in the league on 8 December against Brighton. They have since failed to do so in nine successive matches at the King Power, setting an unwanted top-flight record and a major reason why they are second bottom in the table and 18 points adrift of safety.\nWinger Albrighton played with Vardy for 10 years after he moved to Leicester from Aston Villa on a free transfer in 2014, and they formed a tight bond on and off the pitch.\nThere is a view of Vardy, especially from opposition fans, as a wind-up merchant who takes delight in responding to abuse and gestures aplenty.\nA central figure in the dressing room too, players also have a pre-conceived opinion of him.\nBut that changes once they meet him as Albrighton, 35, revealed: \"He's a very unique character, very unique. There's nobody who came into the dressing room that was anything like him. I had a great relationship with him so he's always been fantastic with me. \n\"The way he is with everybody in the dressing room was incredible. New signings would come in with a perception of him and they'd quickly find out the true character behind his personality. \n\"He is a down-to-earth person, very, very humble, just normal. People make out he is some sort of a superstar, but he's just normal. \n\"He likes the normal things, the simple things in life, he's a family man and is just an all-round good person, he'll do anything for you.\"\nThis video can not be played\nWhen Vardy broke Van Nistelrooy's Premier League record\nAs the last player still left at the club, Vardy is also the remaining link to Leicester's title-winning squad and his departure will signal a new era.\nThe Foxes need a reset after relegation, with Van Nistelrooy's future in doubt after 17 defeats in 22 games during his five months in charge.\nVardy, and goalkeepers Daniel Iversen and Danny Ward, are the only players out of contract in the summer, meaning Leicester will need to work to move others on. \nThe forward's reported \u00a3140,000-a-week wages would have dropped to around \u00a3100,000-a-week in the Championship, so it will free up much-needed money.\nMore changes are expected off the pitch too, with fans demanding the dismissal of director of football Jon Rudkin.\nBut the club's future is uncertain, with the possibility of sanctions from the EFL following the club's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) breach in the three years up to the 2022-23 campaign. \nLeicester escaped a points deduction after successfully arguing they were not a top-flight club at the time of the charge, but the EFL could move, once they are officially a Championship club and transfer their Premier League share to one of the promoted sides.\nLeicester's financial situation could also have been a consideration on whether to extend Vardy's contract.\nJamie Vardy had a good relationship with boss Dean Smith at Leicester\nVardy, who will turn 39 next January, wants to keep on playing and there will be no shortage of takers at home or abroad.\nHe said: \"This isn't retirement. I want to keep playing and doing what I enjoy doing most, scoring goals. Hopefully there's one or two more for Leicester between now and the end of the season and many more in the future.\n\"I may be 38 but I've still got the desire and ambition to achieve so much more.\"\nHis wages are likely to be out of reach for any Championship club, even those with the deepest pockets, so he will need to take a significant cut.\nWrexham had already been mentioned as a possible destination before the announcement and their rise, from the National League to within two wins of a Championship place, is similar to Vardy's own personal journey.\nHe will surely have interest from Major League Soccer and enjoyed a strong relationship with Charlotte FC boss Dean Smith during his time in charge of the Foxes two years ago.\nSmith tried to sign Vardy last summer and could well reignite that interest.\nCharlotte are top of the Eastern Conference, while Vardy's former team-mate and fellow title winner Christian Fuchs is also one of Smith's assistants.\nSmith said in August: \"I did text him and see if he wanted to come over to America, but I knew that was going to be hard once he took Leicester back to the Premier League.\"\nThere could also be interest from Saudi Arabia, but his family will be a factor in any future destination as Vardy and wife Rebekah share five children.\nBut, as the Foxes icon looks to script another chapter in his career and life, football may never see a story like his and Leicester's again.",

This is a pillar of his economic agenda - as is a cut in interest rates, aimed at reducing the cost of borrowing for Americans.\nTrump has ratcheted the rate on Chinese goods up to 145% - sparking reciprocal measures from Beijing and warnings from economists about the global impact of a trade war.\nIn his comments to reporters on Tuesday, Trump said he would be \"very nice\" in negotiations with Beijing - in the hope of securing a trade deal. \nEarlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly said he expected a de-escalation of the trade war, which he said was unsustainable. Responding to comments from China, he said the current situation was \"not a joke\".\nThe trade war has led to turbulence in financial markets around the world - to which Trump's comments on Powell have also contributed. \nThe Fed has not cut rates so far this year, after lowering them by a percentage point late last year, a stance Trump has heavily criticised.\nLast week, the president intensified his attacks on the Fed chief, calling him \"a major loser\". The comments sparked a selloff of stocks, bonds and the US dollar - though markets have since been recovering from those losses. \nNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on Friday that Trump was looking into whether it would be possible to sack Powell - who he first nominated to lead the central bank in 2017. Powell was then renewed in 2021 by Joe Biden.\nIt is unclear whether Trump has the authority to fire the Fed chair. No other US president has tried to do so.\nMost major Asian stock markets were higher on Wednesday as investors appeared to welcome the latest remarks.\nJapan's Nikkei 225 index rose about 1.9%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed by around 2.2%, while mainland China's Shanghai Composite was down less than 0.1%.\nThat came after US shares made gains on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 ending Tuesday's session up 2.5% and the Nasdaq rose 2.7%. \nUS futures were also trading higher overnight. Futures markets give an indication of how financial markets will perform when they open for trading.\nInvestors feared that pressure on Powell to lower interest rates could cause prices to rise at a time when trade tariffs are already seen boosting inflation.\nTrade tensions between the world's biggest economies, as well as US tariffs on other countries around the world, have triggered uncertainty about the global economy. Those concerns triggered turmoil in financial markets in recent weeks.\nOn Tuesday, the forecast for US economic growth for this year was given the biggest downgrade among advanced economies by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) due to uncertainty caused by tariffs.\nThe sharp increase in tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a \"significant slowdown\" in global growth, the Fund predicted.\nTrump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are now facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July.\nHis administration said last week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nChina has hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US and vowed to \"fight to the end\".\nThe Chinese government has not yet officially responded to the latest statements from the Trump administration.\nHowever, an article in the state-controlled Global Times on Wednesday quoted commentators who said the remarks showed that the US is beginning to realise the tariffs do more harm than good to America's economy.",

        "article_text": "Fortified breakfast cereals can be a useful source of fibre, vitamins and minerals \u2013 but some are considered ultra-processed food.\nWe're often told that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Get this decision right and your nutritious morning meal can help keep you energised and focused for whatever challenges come your way. Yet the choice of what to eat for breakfast \u2013 or what to give your children if you have them \u2013 can feel overwhelming at times.\nIf, like 53% of the US population you decide to go the breakfast cereal route every week, then you can take your pick. There's porridge oats, granola, muesli, bran flakes, corn flakes, and puffed rice \u2013 the options are endless, with each colourful box promising to deliver a healthy, nutritious meal. Yet, although breakfast cereals have traditionally been seen this way, some scientists warn that these are ultra-processed snacks \u2013 and they are not actually good for us at all.\nSo, what is the truth, and what kind of cereals \u2013 if any \u2013 should we be eating?\nFirst off, some facts. Cereals are grasses from the Poaceae family, cultivated for their edible seeds, or grains. Cereal crops include wheat, rice, oats, barley and corn. Each cereal grain has three main edible components. There's the outer layer of bran, which is rich in fibre, B vitamins and trace minerals. Then there's the endosperm, which is packed with starch and proteins to support the developing plant embryo. Finally, the germ contains the embryo, and is rich in oils, vitamins and minerals.\nOne of the first people to come up with the idea of turning grains into breakfast cereals was John Harvey Kellogg, an American physician. At the time he was a superintendent\u00a0of the Battle Creek Sanatarium \u2013 a kind of hybrid between a hospital and a health resort. To improve the patients' diet, Kellogg developed, patented and introduced a variety of new foods, including Granola and Corn Flakes. However, these have now become so ubiquitous that there are dozens of generic versions on the market.\nToday the production of breakfast cereals is an industrial affair. After the grains are harvested, breakfast cereals will undergo various processing steps before being packaged and sent to supermarket aisles. Some cereals \u2013 such as bran flakes \u2013 are made from the entire, or whole grain, while in others, such as some corn flakes, the grain is crushed between large metal rollers to remove the outer layer of bran. Some cereals then undergo further processing where the grain is milled into flour.\nThe resulting product is then mixed with flavourings, salt, sweeteners and other ingredients such as vitamins and minerals. They are then cooked and shaped into flakes, loops or other forms. Finally, the cereal is baked or toasted to give it a crisp texture.\u00a0\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The perfect, but slow, way to boil an egg \u2013 according to science\n\u2022 Choline: The underappreciated nutrient that's vital for our brains\n\u2022 The ruler drop test: Check your reaction times\nBecause cereals are fortified with minerals and vitamins, they have long been seen as an effective way of ensuring that people get the nutrients they need. This is especially true for individuals with restricted diets who may struggle to get the vitamins they require from food. Vegetarian and vegan diets, for example, tend to be low in vitamin B12, while a person with lactose intolerance may avoid milk and therefore not get enough calcium and vitamin D. As we get older,\u00a0we absorb certain nutrients less efficiently, which can increase the risk of malnourishment.\u00a0Pregnant women and children are also at greater risk of nutrient deficiencies.\nResearch confirms that there may be some benefits from eating fortified breakfast cereals. For example, studies have shown that many populations around the world are deficient in key nutrients. A study in the US, meanwhile, found that without fortification, a high percentage of children and adolescents wouldn't get enough micronutrients, risking long term health problems. Many breakfast cereals are also high in fibre, a nutrient that fuels the \"good\" bacteria in our guts \u2013 which 90% of us don't get enough of.\n\"Generally speaking, fortified cereals can make a useful contribution to some of the vitamins and minerals that, in the UK, some of us are deficient in,\" says Sarah Berry, professor of nutrition at King's College London.\nFor example, Berry points to the fact that in the UK, almost 50% of girls aged 11 to 18 have low iron intakes. Meanwhile, 14% of adults in the US have inadequate intakes of this nutrient. (Read more from the BBC about the global challenge of iron deficiency, and the debate over when to take iron supplements.) \u00a0\n\"However, you have to balance this out against the fact that there are many cereals that are high in sugar, low in fibre, and have a high glycaemic index, which means they aren't going to keep you full for long,\" says Berry. There are also ways of getting these vitamins and minerals that might be better for you, such as fruits, nuts, and vegetables, she says.\nWhile some breakfast cereals are high in fibre, vitamins and minerals, many are also high in added sugar, salt and unhealthy fats.\nAccording to the British Heart Foundation, a charity that funds cardiovascular research based in the UK, a 30g serving of sugar-frosted corn flakes, for example, contains around 11g of sugar. This is 12% of the maximum total recommended intake (RI) for sugars in the UK. (In the US, there isn't a recommended limit for total sugars, but the daily reference intake for added sugars is 50g per day\u00a0(based on a 2,000 calorie diet). Meanwhile, a 45g serving of granola with dried fruit, nuts, and seeds, meanwhile, has 9.6g of sugar (10.7% of your total RI).\nEating so much sugar in one go is likely to lead to large blood sugar spikes, which over time may leave you at greater risk of developing diabetes, heart disease and other conditions. People who experience blood sugar spikes and dips are also inclined to feel hungrier sooner, leading to unhealthy snacking.\n\"We know from our own research that if you eat a breakfast high in sugar or refined carbohydrates, then two to four hours afterwards you tend to feel less energetic, more hungry, and less alert as well,\" says Berry. \"What we've also shown is that people who have that dip after their breakfast tend to consume their next meal 30 minutes before someone who has a breakfast that doesn't cause them to have a dip, and they tend to consume, on average, 100 calories more at their next meal.\"\nThere is also concern that some breakfast cereals are an ultra-processed food, which means that they have undergone significant industrial processing. They frequently contain added sugars, preservatives, artificial colours and other additives.\n\"As a mum and a scientist, I am cautious about allowing my children to eat cereals that contain a lot of colourants,\" says Berry.\n\"Whilst in the UK there are stringent regulations in place to show the safety of these additives and colourants, I think there's a lot that we still don't know about how they may impact our health in the long term,\" adds Berry. \"We are starting to understand that they may negatively impact factors such as our gut microbiome, but we just don't know enough yet.\"\nHowever, not everyone agrees. Some experts and health charities argue that lumping all ultra processed foods (UPF) together is too simplistic \u2013 and not all processed foods are bad for you. For example, a 2024 study by researchers at the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health, Massachusetts, found that while sugary drinks and processed meats raised the risk of cardiovascular disease, the opposite was true for ultra processed breads, breakfast cereals, yogurts and dairy desserts.\nAnd not all breakfast cereals are created equal. Berry counts granola and muesli as healthy options, as long as they don't contain too much added sugar. \"It's about building a breakfast that has the fats, the protein, and the carbohydrate that's going to cause that more sustained release of energy and keep you feeling fuller for longer,\" she says. \"Granolas and muesli have lots of nuts, seeds and berries in them, so they have got loads of fibre, but also protein and fat from the nuts. That will keep you full for longer and will therefore balance your energy levels better.\"\nAnother popular breakfast choice is porridge, or oatmeal as it is known in the US. One large review study included data from more than 470,000 individuals, and followed their health outcomes over years or decades. The researchers found that those with the highest oat intake had a 22% lower likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those with the lowest consumption. Those who consumed at least 19g per day also had a 24% lower risk of death from all causes compared to those who ate the least.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe key ingredient thought to be responsible for the health benefits of oats is a dietary fibre known as beta glucan. Beta glucan has been shown in many clinical trials to reduce circulating cholesterol levels, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the 'bad' cholesterol linked to heart disease.\u00a0Some studies also suggest that beta glucan may reduce a person's risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and help them develop better insulin control.\nHowever, many oat-based breakfast cereals are made from finely ground oat flours that do not have the same health benefits as whole, rolled oats. Compared to the latter, the large surface area of breakfast cereals made with oat flour means they are more quickly digested, causing sugar to rapidly enter the bloodstream. The same is true of pre-cooked porridges made from \"instant oats\".\nIn one clinical trial, volunteers were asked to eat rolled oats on one day, and instant finely-ground oats on another day. The researchers found that despite the oats containing the same amount of fibre, protein, fat, and carbohydrates, the more finely ground oats produced a much larger spike in the participants' blood sugar levels.\nMeanwhile, breakfast cereals made from refined grains, where the nutrient and fibre-rich bran and germ layers have been stripped away, may also have fewer benefits. While studies have shown that the consumption of whole grains is linked to a reduced risk of cancer, cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases, research suggests that some of these health effects don't seem to apply when grains are consumed in their refined forms.\n\"Whole grain cereals are healthy because they are packed with fibre,\" says Riccardo Caccialanza, a clinical nutritionist at the University of Pavia in Italy. He explains that one important function of this nutrient is to slow down the digestion of food, so you get fewer glucose peaks and better glucose control. \"However, if you take the fibre away, which happens when you refine the grain, then the glucose increases more quickly,\" he says.\nSo, are breakfast cereals good or bad for us? It depends entirely on the cereal.\nOne study in Australia looked at over 140,000 people aged 45\u00a0years and older. It found that eating muesli for breakfast lowered the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Another large study asked over 186,000 participants aged 40 to 69 years in the UK about their dietary habits \u2013 including breakfast cereal consumption \u2013 and then followed the participants for an average of 13 years. It found that people who ate at least one bowl muesli, bran-based cereals, and porridge a day were 15%, 12%, and 11% less likely to die during the follow up period than people who did not eat breakfast cereals. On the other hand, individuals who ate sweetened cereals for breakfast were more likely to die of cancer during the study period.\nThe key, then, is to look at the back of the pack carefully, say experts. \"If you're selecting cereals that have about less than five grams of sugar a portion, and more than three grams of fibre per portion, then you're on track to making a healthier choice for your cereal,\" says Berry.\nBut to make it extra healthy, both Berry and Caccialanza suggest 'hacking' or customising your cereal so that it doesn't just contain carbohydrates, but also has a good mix of healthy fats and protein that will keep you feeling full for longer.\n\"I love a granola, but I add extra nuts and kefir yoghurt to it,\" says Berry. \"I make a supermarket standard granola healthy by what I overlay on top. And I think that's something that people should be thinking about a little bit \u2013 what can they do to add some balance to [breakfast cereals]?\"\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better\u00a0health\u00a0and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health\u00a0Fix\u00a0newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and\u00a0health\u00a0stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

What caught my attention wasn't so much the body language or the greetings - it was the table.\nOn one side sat the combined might of the Russian delegation: President Putin, flanked by his veteran foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov, his envoy on foreign investment Kirill Dmitriev, plus an interpreter.\nOn the other side, clearly outnumbered: Witkoff and a translator.\nThis is not traditional diplomacy - but then again, Witkoff is not a traditional diplomat. \nHe is a billionaire New York real estate developer and long-time confidant of Trump - who himself is not a traditional president.\nLike Trump, Witkoff has made a career in doing deals.\nThis is how high-level US-Russian diplomacy is being conducted now in the Trump era.\nIt's how crucial decisions with potential implications for the global order are being debated.\nFollowing this round of talks, Ushakov held a conference call for reporters. He insisted that the negotiations with Witkoff had been \"constructive and very useful\".\n\"May I ask a question?\" I began. \"What are the main sticking points, the obstacles to peace in Ukraine?\"\n\"Thank you,\" Ushakov said. \"We'll end it there.\" Conference call over.\nFrom the various alleged peace proposals that have been leaked to the press, there seem to be plenty of \"sticking points\". There are differences over the territorial concessions Ukraine would be required to make, security guarantees, sanctions relief for Russia and the sequencing - that is, the order in which obligations undertaken be carried out.\nThe day Witkoff flew to Moscow, on the edge of the city, peace was shattered.\nA car bomb killed a senior Russian general.\nYaroslav Moskalik was deputy head of the Main Operations Directorate of the Russian General Staff. The Kremlin accused Kyiv of assassinating him.\nIf that's true, it's a sign of how Russia's war in Ukraine has come much closer to home.\nThere is no guarantee that talks between Putin and Witkoff will bring peace. And there will be concern in Kyiv and in Europe that they were not at the table.\nWhat is clear is that  Putin and Trump are determined to bring their countries closer - whatever happens with the Ukraine peace process.\nFor Moscow and Washington, now their watchword is co-operation.\nOn Friday, I attended a ceremony at a Moscow military park symbolising this. \nIt marked the moment, 80 years ago, when American and Soviet soldiers met on the Elbe River in the dying days of World War Two. That was a time when Russia and America were allies. \nA military band played as people lined up to lay flowers at a memorial to the Meeting on the Elbe.\nPutin's invasion of Ukraine put the US and Russia on opposite sides, but times are changing again. \nThe White House and the Kremlin are trying to repair relations. Could they secure a peace deal, one that's acceptable to Ukraine?\n\"We are just re-establishing contact,\" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told me at the ceremony. \n\"We are just trying to find a way out of this terrible crisis which was created by the previous American administration. They ruined many things.\"\nMoscow presents itself as peacekeeper. It blames Kyiv and the \"collective West\" for the fighting.\nAnd yet in February 2022, it was President Putin who ordered Russian troops to invade a sovereign neighbouring country, to force it back into Moscow's orbit.\nSo much has changed, not least the attitude of the White House. \nPresident Biden had promised to support Ukraine \"for as long as we can\".\nEarlier this month, Trump blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for starting the war.\n\"You don't start a war against someone 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles,\" Trump said.",

        "article_text": "Indonesia is on an ambitious mission to offer free meals to 80 million school children - but that hasn't exactly gone according to plan.\nNearly 80 students across two high schools in Cianjur, south of the capital Jakarta, fell ill after eating the meals this week. Most of those who ended up in hospital have since been discharged.\nThis is the latest in a series of food poisonings that have been linked to the programme, a signature policy of President Prabowo Subianto.\nAuthorities investigating the case say the suspected cause is negligent food preparation. Samples from the vomit of students have been sent for lab testing, and police say they have questioned people handling the food, from cooks to packers to delivery workers.\nA 16-year-old student told local media that the shredded chicken in the meal had an \"unpleasant odour\". \"I felt dizzy, nauseous and vomited,\" he said.\nAcross the world, programmes offering free meals to students have proved to be effective in improving health, academic performance and attendance.\nBut Indonesia's $28bn (\u00a321bn) version - shaping up to be the most expensive of its kind - has become the target of food safety concerns and heated anti-government protests.\nIn February, when thousands took to the streets to protest at budget cuts, they aimed their ire at the hefty price of Prabowo's free school meals: \"Children eat for free, parents are laid off,\" read one of their protest signs.\nA centrepiece of Prabowo's presidential campaign last year, the free meals programme was pitched as a way to tackle stunting - a condition caused by malnutrition that affects a fifth of children below the age of five in Indonesia.\n\"Through this initiative, our children will grow taller and emerge as champions,\" Prabowo said in 2023.\nSince he took office last October, this programme, along with other populist policies like new houses and free medical check-ups, has earned him political points. His approval ratings stood at 80% after his first 100 days in power.\nIn the first phase, which began in January, free school meals have made their way to 550,000 students in 26 provinces.\nWhile the programme is \"well-intentioned\", Maria Monica Wihardja, a visiting fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, told the BBC there has been \"no evidence\" of \"widespread urgency\" for free school meals.\nAccording to a national survey in 2024, less than 1% of Indonesia's households went at least one day without any meals in the past year.\nSince January, a series of food poisonings have raised apprehension about the free meals.\nMichelle, an elementary school student in East Nusa Tenggara province, was one of several in her school who suffered suspected food poisoning in February. She told BBC Indonesian at the time that the food, which had given her a stomach ache, was \"bland and stale\".\nAfter the incident, some parents started preparing homemade lunches for their children instead, a school official told BBC Indonesian.\nThis week, after the food poisoning in Cianjur, authorities have promised to step up food safety processes.\n\"We must improve quality,\" said Dadan Hindayana, head of the National Nutrition Agency, who had visited the students in hospital.\n\"\u2060One obvious thing is the lack of mature and in-depth planning before this program was launched,\" Eliza Mardian, a researcher at the Center of Reform on Economics Indonesia, told the BBC. \n\"The haste ends up sacrificing quality and effectiveness, which actually worsens the public's perception of this programme.\"\nThe cost of the programme has not helped matters. \nIndonesia has set aside more than $10bn this year for the free school meals.\nBy comparison, India spends $1.5bn a year to feed 120 million children in what is the world's largest such programme. Brazil's version costs about the same and serves some 40 million students.\nTo foot the steep bill in Indonesia, Prabowo has urged the country's tycoons to help, and accepted a funding offer from China. \nHe also ordered $19bn in cuts to pay for it, along with other populist schemes - which made it especially controversial.\nSeveral ministries, including education, had their budgets slashed by half. Bureaucrats who were not furloughed alleged they were forced to scrimp by limiting the use of air conditioning, lifts and even printers.\nUniversity students were furious as news spread of cancelled scholarship programmes and disruptions to their classes.\n\"The worst thing is when the stomach is full, but the brain is not filled,\" Muhammad Ramadan, a student protester in Bandung, told BBC Indonesian - referring to Prabowo's school meals plan.\nThere could be more challenges ahead, such as allegations of budget mismanagement, which have begun to emerge after Indonesia's anti-graft bureau flagged a \"real possibility\" of fraud in March.  \nPolice launched an investigation this month after a meal provider in south Jakarta accused authorities of embezzlement, saying that she has not been paid since her kitchen started preparing school meals in February.\nPrabowo, who has continued to defend the programme, said this week that his administration will \"handle\" the allegations and  \"safeguard every cent of public money\".\nExperts, however, say the problem runs much deeper. \nLarge-scale social assistance programmes in Indonesia have historically been \"riddled with corruption\", Muhammad Rafi Bakri, a research analyst at Indonesia's audit board, told the BBC.\n\"Given the sheer size of the budget,\" he said, \"this program is a goldmine for corrupt officials.\"\nWith reporting from BBC Indonesian",

        "article_text": "A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing. \nChinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened. \nChinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would \"fight to the end\".\nHere's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs.\nChina is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries.  \nWith more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs.  \nBeijing is still fumbling with the keys because Chinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to \"silver trains\" for travelling retirees, that could change. \nAnd Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential.\nThe leadership may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month.\nChina also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders.\nStill, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.\nThe economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.\nThe Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to \"weather storms together\".\nPresident Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: \"The sky will not fall.\"\nChina has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.   \nUnder Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance. \nIt has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI. \nExamples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which was celebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.\nRecently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI.\nUS companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.   \nChinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate.   \nThat unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term.\nEver since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order. \nIt has pumped billions into a contentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.\nThe expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.\nAmerican farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier. \n\"The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once\u2011captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,\" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute. \nThe US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024.\nThat doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner.\nFollowing reports that the White House will use bilateral trade negotiations to isolate China, Beijing has warned countries against \"reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests\".\nThat would be an impossible choice for much of the world\n\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC last week.\nTrump held firm as stocks plummeted following his sweeping tariffs announcement in early April, likening his staggering levies to \"medicine\".\nBut he made a U-turn, pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days after a sharp sell-off in US government bonds. Also known as Treasuries, these have long been seen as a safe investment. But the trade war has shaken confidence in the assets.\nTrump has since hinted at a de-escalation in trade tensions with China, saying that the tariffs on Chinese goods will \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".\nSo, experts point out, Beijing now knows that the bond market can rattle Trump.\nChina also holds $700bn in US government bonds. Japan, a staunch American ally, is the only non-US holder to own more than that.\nSome argue that this gives Beijing leverage: Chinese media has regularly floated the idea of selling or withholding purchases of US bonds as a \"weapon\".\nBut experts warn that China will not emerge unscathed from such a situation.\nRather, it will lead to huge losses for Beijing's investments in the bond market and destabilise the Chinese yuan.\nChina will only be able to exert pressure with US government bonds \"only up to a point\", Dr Zhang says. \"China holds a bargaining chip, not a financial weapon.\"\nWhat China can weaponise, however, is its near monopoly in extracting and refining rare earths, a range of elements important to advanced tech manufacturing.\nChina has huge deposits of these, such as dysprosium, which is used in magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines, and Yttrium, which provides heat-resistant coating for jet engines.\nBeijing has already responded to Trump's latest tariffs by restricting exports of seven rare earths, including some that are essential for making AI chips.\nChina accounts for about 61% of rare earths production and 92% of their refining, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nWhile Australia, Japan and Vietnam have begun mining for rare earths, it will take years before China can be cut out of the supply chain.\nIn 2024, China banned the export of another critical mineral, antimony, that is crucial to various manufacturing processes. Its price more than doubled amid a wave of panic buying and a search for alternative suppliers.\nThe fear is that the same can happen to the rare earths market, which would severely disrupt various industries from electric vehicles to defence.\n\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" Thomas Kruemmer, director of Ginger International Trade and Investment, told the BBC previously. \n\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial.\"",

        "article_text": "Will India be able to stop the Indus river and two of its tributaries from flowing into Pakistan?\nThat's the question on many minds, after India suspended a major treaty governing water sharing of six rivers in the Indus basin between the two countries, following Tuesday's horrific attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. \nThe 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) survived two wars between the nuclear rivals and was seen as an example of trans-boundary water management.\nThe suspension is among several steps India has taken against Pakistan, accusing it of backing cross-border terrorism -  a charge Islamabad flatly denies. It has also hit back with reciprocal measures against Delhi, and said stopping water flow \"will be considered as an Act of War\". \nThe treaty allocated the three eastern rivers \u2013 the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej \u2013 of the Indus basin to India, while 80% of the three western ones \u2013 the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab \u2013 to Pakistan.\nDisputes have flared in the past, with Pakistan objecting to some of India's hydropower and water infrastructure projects, arguing they would reduce river flows and violate the treaty. (More than 80% of Pakistan's agriculture and around a third of its hydropower depend on the Indus basin's water.)\nIndia, meanwhile, has been pushing to review and modify the treaty, citing changing needs - from irrigation and drinking water to hydropower - in light of factors like climate change.\nOver the years, Pakistan and India have pursued competing legal avenues under the treaty brokered by the World Bank.\nBut this is the first time either side has announced a suspension - and notably, it's the upstream country, India, giving it a geographic advantage.\nBut what does the suspension really mean? Could India hold back or divert the Indus basin's waters, depriving Pakistan of its lifeline? And is it even capable of doing so?\nExperts say it's nearly impossible for India to hold back tens of billions of cubic metres of water from the western rivers during high-flow periods. It lacks both the massive storage infrastructure and the extensive canals needed to divert such volumes.\n\"The infrastructure India has are mostly run-of-the-river hydropower plants that do not need massive storage,\" said Himanshu Thakkar, a regional water resources expert with the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People.\nSuch hydropower plants use the force of running water to spin turbines and generate electricity, without holding back large volumes of water.\nIndian experts say inadequate infrastructure has kept India from fully utilising even its 20% share of the Jhelum, Chenab and Indus waters under the treaty - a key reason they argue for building storage structures, which Pakistan opposes citing treaty provisions.\nExperts say India can now modify existing infrastructure or build new ones to hold back or divert more water without informing Pakistan.\n\"Unlike in the past, India will now not be required to share its project documents with Pakistan,\" said Mr Thakkar.\nBut challenges like difficult terrain and protests within India itself over some of its projects have meant that construction of water infrastructure in the Indus basin has not moved fast enough.\nAfter a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir in 2016, Indian water resources ministry officials had told the BBC they would speed up construction of several dams and water storage projects in the Indus basin.\nAlthough there is no official information on the status of such projects, sources say progress has been limited.\nSome experts say that if India begins controlling the flow with its existing and potential infrastructure, Pakistan could feel the impact during the dry season, when water availability is already at its lowest.\n\"A more pressing concern is what happens in the dry season - when the flows across the basin are lower, storage matters more, and timing becomes more critical,\" Hassan F Khan, assistant professor of Urban Environmental Policy and Environmental Studies at Tufts University, wrote in the Dawn newspaper.\n\"That is where the absence of treaty constraints could start to be felt more acutely.\"\nThe treaty requires India to share hydrological data with Pakistan - crucial for flood forecasting and planning for irrigation, hydropower and drinking water.\nPradeep Kumar Saxena, India's former IWT commissioner for over six years, told the Press Trust of India news agency that the country can now stop sharing flood data with Pakistan.\nThe region sees damaging floods during the monsoon season, which begins in June and lasts until September. But Pakistani authorities have said India was already sharing very limited hydrological data.\n\"India was sharing only around 40% of the data even before it made the latest announcement,\" Shiraz Memon, Pakistan's former additional commissioner of the Indus Waters Treaty, told BBC Urdu.\nAnother issue that comes up each time there is water-related tension in the region is if the upstream country can \"weaponise\" water against the downstream country.\nThis is often called a \"water bomb\", where the upstream country can temporarily hold back water and then release it suddenly, without warning, causing massive damage downstream.\nCould India do that?\nExperts say India would first risk flooding its own territory as its dams are far from the Pakistan border. However, it could now flush silt from its reservoirs without prior warning - potentially causing damage downstream in Pakistan.\nHimalayan rivers like the Indus carry high silt levels, which quickly accumulate in dams and barrages. Sudden flushing of this silt can cause significant downstream damage.\nThere's a bigger picture: India is downstream of China in the Brahmaputra basin, and the Indus originates in Tibet.\nIn 2016, after India warned that \"blood and water cannot flow together\" following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir which India blamed on Pakistan, China blocked a tributary of the Yarlung Tsangpo - that becomes the Brahmaputra in northeast India.\nChina, that has Pakistan as its ally, said they had done it as it was needed for a hydropower project they were building near the border. But the timing of the move was seen as Beijing coming in to help Islamabad. \nAfter building several hydropower plants in Tibet, China has green-lit what will be the world's largest dam on the lower reaches of Yarlung Tsangpo.\nBeijing claims minimal environmental impact, but India fears it could give China significant control over the river's flow.",

        "article_text": "Tragedy Titus Andronicus is the Bard's goriest work, and a new production is set to be one of the most extreme takes on it yet. It raises the question: why do we watch such brutality?\nGood theatre has the power to really move us \u2013 a statement that's usually taken metaphorically, rather than literally. Yet when it comes to Shakespeare's bloodiest play, Titus Andronicus, its impact can be so visceral it causes audience members to faint. I should know: while reviewing a production at Shakespeare's Globe in London, back in 2014, its disturbingly violent scenes caused me to start to feel light-headed, even while safely sat down in my seat. Unfortunately, it was a bench with no back: before the end of the first half, I had fainted away completely, falling backwards and waking up in a stranger's lap.\nWarning: this article contains some graphic descriptions of violence\nAnd I was far from the only person to have such a full-bodied response to Lucy Bailey's production of this gory revenge tragedy: the press went wild for stories of \"droppers\", with more than 100 people fainting during the run \u2013 testament to the immense power of Shakespeare's writing, and the skill of performers, as well as to the props department's handling of litres of fake blood.\nOne of the Bard's earliest plays, written in 1591-2, and almost certainly his first tragedy, Titus Andronicus is a story of violent vengeance: Titus, a general of Rome, returns from wars against the Goths with their queen, Tamora, and her sons held as captives. When her eldest son is sacrificed by Titus, Tamora swears revenge \u2013 setting in motion a series of increasingly brutal acts that ends \u00a0with an infamous scene involving the baking of pies... Boasting 14 deaths, it is the most violent of all Shakespeare's plays \u2013 and now it's back on stage, with a new production opening at the UK's Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon.\nThe play's unavoidable ultra-violence has meant that, for much of the performance history of Shakespeare \u2013 whose birthday is today \u2013 Titus Andronicus was considered a bit of an embarrassment, a bloody stain on his reputation: too gruesome, too over-the-top, to be considered in the same category of greatness as, say, Hamlet or Othello. Then there's its sometimes queasy tone: the excesses can tip Titus into a gleefully macabre, manic comedy (an aspect also embraced in Bailey's gore-fest). Let's just say, the Victorians were not fans.\u00a0\nBut the play's reputation began to revive in the second half of the 20th Century. At the Royal Shakespeare Company alone, there have been several seminal productions in the past 70 years, starring Laurence Olivier (1955), Patrick Stewart (1981), Brian Cox (1987) and David Bradley (2003), while Anthony Hopkins playing Titus on screen in Julie Taymor's influential, blackly funny film version in 1999 also surely helped boost the play's standing. Some of these productions leaned heavily on the horror, too: there were fainters and walk-outs in Deborah Warner's unflinching 1987 production, which Cox\u00a0once claimed\u00a0was the most interesting play he'd done and the best stage performance he'd ever given. But he also pointed to the odd humour of the play, calling it \"a young man's play\u2026 full of energy, joie de vivre and laughter that often strikes people as ludicrous\".\nTitus is not\u00a0always\u00a0staged with grisly literalness: in the Olivier-starring production by Peter Brook, the mutilation of Titus's daughter Lavinia was famously suggested with stylised red streamers \u2013 an aestheticised approach also used in the Japanese Ninagawa Company's production in the 2000s. More recently, Jude Christian's all-female 2023 production in London's candle-lit Sam Wanamaker Playhouse enacted the violence on candles themselves, with cast members stabbing, snapping or snuffing them.\u00a0\nIn the latest production of Titus Andronicus, however, there will be blood. Buckets of it. \"We are doing gallons of blood. We've made a sort of wet room [on stage], it's got a drainage system and an abattoir hook\u2026\" says Max Webster, the play's director, over a video call from Stratford-upon-Avon. He's had to figure out how to stage no fewer than 27 different acts of onstage violence, from punches through to limbs being lopped off and tongues being cut out. And the only limit on the amount of gore sloshing around is the practical question of how to clean it up between scenes. \"It's an unbelievably boring thing about how many crew members and squeegees it takes,\" laughs Webster. \"In one sentence, you're thinking 'what is the meaning of tragedy in relation to human nature?' \u2013 and then very quickly you get into 'how many mops can the crew hold?'.\"\nWebster, whose acclaimed productions include an adaptation of Booker Prize winner Life of Pi and a recent David Tennant-starring Macbeth, wanted to direct Titus Andronicus for one simple reason: Simon Russell Beale, one of Britain's greatest Shakespearean actors, asked him to. Titus was a part that Russell Beale fancied a crack at, and the RSC was happy to oblige. This version is updated \u2013 set in a crisp, besuited modern world riven by conflict, although where exactly is kept deliberately vague.\u00a0\n\"It's trying to be open \u2013 we're not setting it in Kosovo or Gaza or Sudan,\" says Webster, adding swiftly \"And we're not going to try to produce the US army onstage or something \u2013 it's trying to make sense of Rome as a 'superpower of empire' rather than as 'the United States of America'.\"\u00a0Still, he sees Titus as freshly, troublingly relevant, in light of shocking events such as the 7 October Hamas attacks, the war in Gaza, and the sudden invasion of Russian troops into Ukraine, the story's extreme violence doesn't seem so unimaginable.\nIn this production, the violence is certainly no laughing matter. In rehearsals, they have been playing it entirely seriously, and eschewing the blackly cartoonish or stylishly Tarantino-esque approach to the violence that some directors explore. This has risks: Webster fully expects that, when the show is in front of an audience, there may be some nervous laughter; it'll be their job in previews to figure out where these laughs form a necessary \"pressure release valve\", and where they're really just a sign to make the show even more harrowing.\nFor Webster, it isn't possible to laugh at the brutality of Titus Andronicus in 2025 \u2013 it's too real. He sees the play as \"a howl of pain\"; watching it becomes an act of witness, an attempt to face up to atrocities taking place right now \u2013 something that he acknowledges could be hard for an audience. \"I can walk down the Avon [river], and know my family is safe and it doesn't feel like the world is burning. But you look at other parts of the world\u2026 these horrors, that maybe feel historical to us, are actually happening.\"\u00a0\nBut Titus Andronicus isn't a documentary; it's an old play, that people choose to stage and choose to pay to go to see. So why, when we could just watch the news, do we opt to watch such harrowing content as art, as entertainment? It's a question that partly motivated Russell Beale to do Titus,\u00a0he told The Guardian last week: \"I don't understand the violence. I don't understand why as an audience we feel\u00a0excited, stimulated, challenged by\u00a0it; it's so relentless.\"\u00a0\nIt may have been shunned in later centuries, but Titus Andronicus's original audiences loved it \u2013 and many other forms of graphically horrible entertainment, from bear baiting to public hangings. Titus was a hit in Elizabethan England, and in writing it Shakespeare may, in fact, have been playing to the crowd: it resembles the super-violent revenge tragedies that were popular at the time, rarely-staged works such as Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy and Thomas Middleton's The Revenger's Tragedy. Such plays were, themselves, drawing inspiration from the incredibly bloody and outrageous tragedies written by Seneca in the First Century AD \u2013 including Thyestes, a source of direct inspiration for Shakespeare, where the title character is fed a pie made of the flesh of his own children. And obviously, Ancient Greek tragedies \u2013 even if they keep acts of violence off-stage \u2013 are a rich and enduring source of creative murders of family members and cycles of bloody revenge.\u00a0\nSuch tragedies, Webster points out, had their origins in ritual performances of sacrifice. \"I guess theatre came out of killing goats in Ancient Greece\u2026 there's always been some relationship between theatre and violence and the sacred stuff.\"\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Edward II: Did a gay love affair spark a royal crisis?\n\u2022 The Shakespeare words you don't know you know\n\u2022 The Shakespeare tragedy that speaks to us now\nIt does seem that watching the very worst things imaginable unfolding has an irresistible appeal \u2013 not only do we still return to Greek or Shakespearean tragedies, but we've also turned death and violence into major sources of entertainment, apparently appropriate for daily consumption. Horror films, true crime podcasts, police procedurals, first-person shooter video games\u2026 depictions of very, very bad things happening to bodies are pervasive across all art forms, all the time. You might even say we're addicted to the adrenaline shot we get from such emotionally-wringing, extreme forms of entertainment: research shows that the blood-pumping, heart-racing high we get from fear is close to the pleasurable bodily experience of excitement.\nFrom the high body count of fantasy shows like Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon to the dystopian chills of Squid Game to the seemingly endless appetite for the torture porn movies of the Saw franchise, much of our creative output would make Seneca smack his lips in approval.\u00a0But beyond the potential physical thrills, why are we so drawn to watching such violent content?\nWhen I ask Webster, he's as unsure as Russell Beale. \"The truth is, I don't know. But there\u00a0is\u00a0a lust to watch violence on-stage \u2013 it is a basic human urge.\" He wonders if it forms a safe outlet for our innate human darkness. And a common theory as to why we enjoy the terrors of a horror movie or the bleakness of a dystopian novel is just this: that such fictional outings are a secure way for us to rehearse terrible acts \u2013 without ever having to experience those in real life. \"Maybe it is so we don't have to do [violence] in our lives?\" Webster ponders. \"We all have these weird, dark, turbulent fantasies that we don't talk about because they're not socially acceptable\u2026 so maybe seeing it on-stage is an escape, or a relief?\"\u00a0\nThe academics Haiyang Yang and Kuangjie Zhang confirm Webster's theory, sharing research in the Harvard Business Review that found that horror entertainment \"may help us (safely) satisfy our curiosity about the dark side of human psyche\u2026 As an inherently curious species, many of us are fascinated by what our own kind is capable of. Observing storylines in which actors must confront the worst parts of themselves serves as a pseudo character study of the darkest parts of the human condition.\"\nIf I'm honest, the news that there's so much blood in Webster's Titus Andronicus that they need a drain on stage has got me nervous of watching the show, rather than gleefully ready to excise my inner demons. Is he worried that this Titus might be so powerful \u2013 so bloody, and so upsetting \u2013 that people will faint? He is not. \"It's important you provide a content warning, and then people can make an informed decision about if they want to see it,\" says Webster. \"If people faint, they faint.\"\nTitus Andronicus is at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 17 June\nHolly Williams\u00a0novel\u00a0The Start of Something\u00a0is out in paperback now\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Unfortunately, it was a bench with no back: before the end of the first half, I had fainted away completely, falling backwards and waking up in a stranger's lap.Warning: this article contains some graphic descriptions of violenceAnd I was far from the only person to have such a full-bodied response to Lucy Bailey's production of this gory revenge tragedy: the press went wild for stories of \"droppers\", with more than 100 people fainting during the run \u2013 testament to the immense power of Shakespeare's writing, and the skill of performers, as well as to the props department's handling of litres of fake blood.Simon AnnandStephen Boxer as Titus in a 2013 Royal Shakespeare Company production of Titus \u2013 most versions feature copious blood (Credit: Simon Annand)One of the Bard's earliest plays, written in 1591-2, and almost certainly his first tragedy, Titus Andronicus is a story of violent vengeance: Titus, a general of Rome, returns from wars against the Goths with their queen, Tamora, and her sons held as captives. \"Marc BrennerJoel MacCormack and Simon Russell Beale in the Royal Shakespeare Company's latest, very bloody production of Titus (Credit: Marc Brenner)Webster, whose acclaimed productions include an adaptation of Booker Prize winner Life of Pi and a recent David Tennant-starring Macbeth, wanted to direct Titus Andronicus for one simple reason: Simon Russell Beale, one of Britain's greatest Shakespearean actors, asked him to. Yet when it comes to Shakespeare's bloodiest play, Titus Andronicus, its impact can be so visceral it causes audience members to faint. In the latest production of Titus Andronicus, however, there will be blood.",

On Thursday, Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley Billhimer said \"technical advancements\" helped, although he did not provide further details.\nOfficials said the wildfire began after Mr Kling set wooden pallets on fire in a densely forested area, and then left the area while they were still burning.\nSpeaking to reporters, Mr Billhimer said he was \"very confident\" that Mr Kling intentionally set out to spark a wildfire. He added that witness statements have corroborated the allegation.\nMr Kling, who lives in New Jersey, faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Mr Billhimer told reporters that the arrest should send a \"message\" to the community.\n\"Starting a fire out in the woods when the conditions are dry in the forest could lead to widespread damage, loss of life, loss of property and potentially criminal charges,\" Mr Billhimer said. \n\"It's a very dangerous thing, and we were taught as kids not to play with fire, but starting a fire in a forest is such a dangerous thing.\"\nThe Jones Road Fire was first spotted by crews on Tuesday, and grew to 15,200 acres Thursday during abnormally dry conditions. Officials said it is poised to possibly become the state's largest wildfire in 20 years. \nIt remains only 50% contained, officials said, adding that rain forecast for Saturday should help extinguish the blaze.\nIt is burning through a relatively unpopulated part of the state in the Forked River Mountains area in Ocean County. On Wednesday, officials lifted an evacuation order affecting around 5,000 residents. \nNo injuries or deaths have been reported. No homes were damaged, although one commercial building and several vehicles were destroyed.\nThe blaze also sparked air quality alerts across New Jersey, America's most densely populated state, as well as in New York City and Long Island.",
