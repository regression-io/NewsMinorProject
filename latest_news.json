A coroner concluded the negative effects of online material contributed to her death.\nThe donations are thought to have gone to the Molly Rose Foundation, which campaigns for internet safety. Meta and Pinterest declined to comment.\nMolly's family said they had decided not to take legal action against the tech companies and would \"never accept compensation\" over Molly's death.\nIn a statement via their solicitor, the family said that they would \"pursue the aims we share with Meta and Pinterest through the Molly Rose Foundation to help ensure young people have a positive experience online\".\nMeta and other social media companies face multiple lawsuits in the US from families who claim their children were harmed by social media. The cases also involve attorneys general from more than 40 states, who claim that the design of the platforms caused harm to children.\nThe first trial is expected to be heard in November.\nDetails of payments to the Molly Rose Foundation have not been publicly disclosed. Rose was Molly's middle name.\nThe charity's annual report states: \"The Molly Rose Foundation has received grants from donors that wish to remain anonymous. Having considered their obligations, the Trustees have agreed to respect these wishes.\"\nThe BBC believes that this refers to the payments to the charity from the two social media companies. These payments started in 2024 and are expected to be paid over a number of years.\nIt's not known exactly when any agreement over donations was reached.\nWithin the last nine months the charity has recruited a CEO, two public policy managers, a head of communications and a fundraising manager.\nAsked about the donations, the charity repeated in a statement that it would \"respect these wishes\" for anonymity.\nIt is understood that no members of the Russell family have received any money from the donation.\nAfter approaching the family's solicitor, a statement was released saying: \"Following the coroner's inquest into Molly's death, we have decided that we will pursue the aims we share with Meta and Pinterest through the Molly Rose Foundation to help ensure young people have a positive experience online, instead of pursuing legal action. We, Molly's family, have always made clear that we would never accept compensation consequent upon Molly's death.\"\nThe Molly Rose Foundation has become a leading voice in highlighting the dangers of unregulated social media and remains highly critical of Meta.\nIt has called on the government to strengthen the existing Online Safety Act with more robust legislation.\nIt is not calling for a children's social media ban, as planned in Australia, but is demanding that technology companies take more responsibility for the content channelled to young people through social media algorithms.\nIn March this year, in association with publisher Pan Macmillan, the charity sent a copy of a book written by Facebook whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams to every MP in the country. In it Ms Wynn-Williams, who used to be the company's global public policy director, makes a series of critical claims about what she witnessed during her seven years at Facebook.\nMolly's father Ian Russell is an unpaid trustee of the foundation and remains an outspoken campaigner.\nIn January Mr Russell wrote to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, calling on the government to act urgently to protect young people online. In his letter, Mr Russell said the UK was \"going backwards on online safety\".\nHe singled out Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg for specific criticism after the company scrapped its fact-checking programme on Facebook.\nHe said Mr Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, the owner of X, were part of a \"wholesale recalibration\" of the online world, moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\".\nHe told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg: \"By turning the platforms backwards away from safety, Mark Zuckerberg has changed the game fundamentally and shown that the platforms aren't really here to play safe, they're here to make money.\"\nMatthew Bergman, a US lawyer and founder of the Social Media Victims Law Centre, welcomed the news of the donations and paid tribute to the \"indefatigable efforts\" of Molly's father \"to hold social media companies accountable\".\nMeta and Pinterest were approached by BBC News, but declined to comment.",

        "article_text": "Jonny Bairstow and James Anderson will not face off this season after Yorkshire were promoted and Lancashire relegated\nThe 2025 County Championship begins on Friday - and, remarkably for early April, the weather is set to be glorious.\nBut which county sides will sparkle this season and whose outlook is gloomy?\nThe BBC's local radio county cricket commentators and online journalists - who will be providing ball-by-ball radio and live text commentary throughout the season on the BBC Sport website and app - take a look at each club's prospects... \nCounty Championship preview: Who can stop Surrey?\nJennings 'job' is to win Lancashire silverware\nBears must spread wickets around - Hannon-Dalby\n2024 season - Eighth in Division Two\nDave Fletcher - BBC Radio Derby\nGiven Derbyshire finished bottom of Division Two in 2024, things can surely only improve. \nThey did at least win a game last year, unlike 2023, but it was another bitterly disappointing watch for the County Ground faithful.\nThey were not helped by an opening round washout against Gloucestershire last season which meant they were playing catch-up from the off.\nThat appears unlikely to be repeated so a quick start \u2013 against the same opposition - is essential.\nThey have added Australian opening batter Caleb Jewell to the squad and he will be joined by returning Kiwi quick bowler Blair Tickner, whose spell last season was all too brief.\nThere's a new captain at the helm, too, although it is a familiar figure. Wayne Madsen, who led the side to promotion in 2012, takes over from David Lloyd after his solitary campaign leading the side.\nTickner's return and the presence of experienced bowlers such as Zak Chappell and Pat Brown can only benefit newcomer Harry Moore.\nAlready in the England system, the much talked-about 17-year-old will be starting his first full season in the senior side having already shown he can more than hold his own at that level.\nWinter signings Jack Morley and Martin Andersson will be better for having been with the group last season.\nThe big challenge remains the ability to take 20 wickets a match, something Mickey Arthur's side have to do if they are to repeat the relative riches of his first season in charge in 2022.\nMatthew Potts' Durham appearances this season may be limited by England call-ups\n2024 season - Fifth in Division One\nMartin Emmerson - BBC Radio Newcastle\nDurham finished fifth on their return to Division One last season and in general more than held their own. They might be able to improve on that this year. We'll see.\nThey weren't helped by the loss of their entire opening game - at home to Hampshire in April \u2013 but there was only really Surrey who turned them over.\nThat was towards the end of the season and the week Surrey retained their title - and they beat a weakened Durham side struggling with injuries.\nFrom a batting point of view they have added Emilio Gay to the ranks. He joined towards the end of last season from Northants, while Will Rhodes chose to leave Warwickshire after seven seasons, despite the offer of a new contract. \nThey will help boost a line-up which includes the leading batter in Division One last season, in South African David Bedingham. He scored 1,331 runs, including a club-record 279 against Lancashire in September. He also became the first Durham batter to score centuries in four consecutive innings.\nOpener Michael Jones has left for Lancashire. His outings last season were limited due to selection choices, so he took the decision to head back home.\nBowling is the key issue. They've had no luck with overseas players in recent seasons. Scott Boland lasted part of one game before returning home to Australia in April. Neil Wagner managed just one game too. Veteran Peter Siddle came in and did well in his four games, while West Indian Chemar Holder didn't particularly pull up any trees in his three matches. Keeping their bowlers fit will be key.\nIt remains to be seen how much of a good signing Sam Conners will be. The bowler has joined from Derbyshire. While he boasted 50 championship wickets in 2022, he took 27 the following year, but only played five Championship matches last season. Australian seamer Brendan Doggett will play County Championship matches in April and May. The 30-year-old seamer plays for South Australia and has 157 first-class wickets to his name.\nThen there's the likes of ever-dependable all-rounder Ben Raine. Matthew Potts is important to the team too, when England allow him to be available. Seventeen-year-old James Minto looks a good prospect and fellow bowler Daniel Hogg will be looking to push on after a career-best 7-66 against Notts in Chester-le-Street.\n2024 season - Fourth in Division One\nVictoria Polley - BBC Radio Essex\nThere's been change at the top for Essex over the winter with Chris Silverwood returning to the club as director of cricket. \nEssex won successive titles (Div 2 & 1) in his previous tenure as head coach, including a first County Championship win in 25 years, before England came calling. \nWith his assistant Anthony McGrath taking over from then up until last season, it will hopefully be a more seamless transition than these changes can sometimes be.\nDean Elgar was vital at the top of the order last season but who will open alongside him is the big question? Do Essex give a chance to teenager Charlie Allison who has impressed in the white-ball formats? They have other options in the likes of Nick Browne or Robin Das, or even bumping Paul Walter or Michael Pepper up higher.\nJordan Cox was also key with the bat last season but has had a torrid winter, denied an England Test debut by a thumb injury. International opportunities could affect his availability.\nAn international call-up still eludes bowler Sam Cook but England's loss is very much Essex's gain - alongside Jamie Porter and Simon Harmer, it's a potent bowling attack.\nIt would've been strengthened with the signing of Shardul Thakur but his late involvement in the IPL has ruled him out of a move to Chelmsford, and Essex continue to hunt for a replacement.\nIt's been six years since Essex last won a County Championship title and they continue to punch above their weight in competing at the top end of the table. \nThey might not have the squad size and budgets of other counties but there's still plenty of talent and experience among the Essex ranks. Can Silverwood add more silverware to his Essex collection on his Chelmsford return?\n2024 season - Sixth in Division Two\nNick Webb - BBC Radio Wales Sport\nThe arrival of Richard Dawson as head coach after the unexpected departure of Grant Bradburn is the main change at Sophia Gardens, with the squad looking remarkably similar to last season. \nThe second One-Day Cup triumph in four years put a gloss on an otherwise disappointing 2024 campaign as Glamorgan showed only marginal improvement in the T20 Blast and fell away in the latter stages of the Championship promotion race.\nKey factors in the Championship will be finding a consistent opening partnership to go with the settled top order of Sam Northeast, Kiran Carlson, Colin Ingram and Chris Cooke, as well as getting the most out of a seam attack lacking raw pace. \nEddie Byrom, unlucky with injury in several seasons, is the most likely starter up top but his partner could be one of four or five candidates. \nSri Lankan Asitha Fernando is likely to partner Timm van der Gugten with the new ball in the opening stages of the season, while it will be interesting to see if on-loan England off-spinner Shoaib Bashir makes an impact as cover for Mason Crane early on when pitches usually don't help the twirlers.\nThere is little doubt that young all-rounder Ben Kellaway will become a regular in all formats sooner or later, but being thrown in as a red-ball opener was maybe a step too far. \nHis ambidextrous spin is a unique selling point added to some hard hitting in the middle order. \nOverall the county needs to manage a fair degree of change in the medium term, with a fair few of their stalwarts well past the 30 mark.\nJames Bracey played two Test matches for England in 2021\n2024 season - Seventh in Division Two\nEd Seabourne - BBC Radio Bristol\nGloucestershire approach the 2025 season with a renewed sense of ambition, keen to ensure this campaign isn't looked back on as the previous September's hangover.\nWhilst 2024 will always be remembered for the remarkable run to the county's first T20 Blast trophy, head coach Mark Alleyne made no bones about the fact he was disappointed to have ended so far behind the promotion spots in the County Championship.\nDespite the final positioning, significant strides forward were made on the batting side. \nWicketkeeper James Bracey is following a stellar year that saw him achieve the rare double of 1,000 runs and 50 dismissals, and there is increasing competition for spots in the top order.\nThe signing of Australian all-rounder Cameron Green for five matches will only add to that, and there is even hope he will be allowed to bowl towards the end of his stay.\nThe club possesses a group of promising young pace bowlers, including recent England Lions call-ups Zaman Akhter and Ajeet Singh Dale, and newly appointed Championship skipper Cameron Bancroft has spoken of his excitement in working with them.\nThe departure of Zafar Gohar, however, means the squad is without a proven red-ball spinner, and, especially with the dry spring, the serious question will be whether there is enough variety in the attack in its current form to force wins on a consistent basis.\n2024 season - Second in Division One\nKevan James - BBC Radio Solent\nTrying to improve on their second-place finish in the Championship last season may depend on a dip in form from Surrey, but also how Hampshire cope without being able to call upon two very influential players.\nJames Vince, the captain and leader of the batting line-up, has decided red-ball cricket is no longer for him. Mo Abbas, taker of 180 wickets over the past four seasons, has been moved on.\nVeteran Mark Stoneman looks a shrewd signing to partially or maybe fully offset the hole left by Vince.\nOn the bowling front, exciting prospects Sonny Baker and John Turner will be given more responsibility. They will certainly add pace.\nA disappointing T20 campaign will hopefully be turned around by the addition of two hard-hitting South Africans in Lhaun-dre Pretorius and Dewald Brevis.\nPretorius, 19, was the top run scorer in the recent SA20 competition, while Brevis finished the tournament with the top strike rate of 180.\nBy all accounts Pretorius has the potential to be world class very quickly.\n2024 season - 10th in Division One (relegated)\nMatt Cole - BBC Radio Kent\nThe summer of 2024 was a pretty dismal affair for both club and supporters. In the Championship they found themselves outgunned, particularly in the bowling department, and never really looked like they were escaping the drop from Division One they'd so narrowly avoided the year before.\nPerhaps more worrying was the T20 Blast campaign. The Spitfires - perennial contenders for the knockout stages - won just four of 14 games and finished bottom of the South Group. The One-Day Cup didn't add much encouragement for supporters desperate for something to hope for.\nKent come into the new season though with Adam Hollioake replacing Matt Walker as head coach. It's the former Surrey and England all-rounder's first time in the role for a county side and players and supporters alike have received the appointment with some excitement.\nThe playing ranks have been bolstered by new signings \u2013 Chris Benjamin moving from Warwickshire hoping to reinvigorate his career as an all-formats batter.\nKent's bowling was the major cause for concern last season, both injuries and lack of form making them look toothless at times. A double signing of seamers just before the start of the campaign is looking to address that \u2013 recent Test debutant for Pakistan, Kashif Ali, and experienced South African pace man Keith Dudgeon are in place for the first part of the campaign.\nThey've also added Corey Flintoff \u2013 son of Andrew, brother of Rocky \u2013 to the squad, the fast-bowling all-rounder joining on a rookie contract.\nWith Aussie bowlers Wes Agar and Tom Rogers returning for the T20 Blast, it appears more of an evolution than a revolution at Canterbury this summer.\nBut if Hollioake can get the best out of the squad they could be among the front-runners for promotion back to the top division of the Championship and a return to upsetting the big budget sides in the Blast.\nRocky Flintoff played four County Championship matches for Lancashire last season\n2024 season - Ninth in Division One (relegated)\nScott Read - BBC Radio Lancashire\nSince winning the County Championship title in 2011, Lancashire have been relegated four times. \nOn the previous three occasions they've won promotion straight back to Division One. \nThey'll be expected to continue that trend this season and will start as firm favourites. \nEven without James Anderson for the first month, the Red Rose have a healthy blend of senior professionals and young players making their way in the game. \nThe overseas signings of Marcus Harris and Anderson Phillip look like excellent business. \nPhillip, for the first 11 games, will provide some extra pace, Harris for the entire season to open the batting. \nThe arrival of the Australian opener will also allow Luke Wells to bat at six giving Lancashire some much-needed experience in the middle order. \nLancashire have some fine young players who endured a tough season for the club last year. A year on from that, the likes of Matty Hurst, George Balderson and George Bell should prosper. \nFor Hurst, almost 700 runs at an average of 32 in his debut season for a relegated team was an impressive return. \nThere will also be plenty of opportunities for Tom Aspinwall and Rocky Flintoff, who does not turn 17 until next week.\nAnderson not ruling out playing for three more years\nBancroft's winning experience 'boosts' Gloucestershire\nBairstow named new Yorkshire red-ball captain  \n2024 season - Fifth in Division Two\nRichard Rae - BBC Radio Leicester\nThe return of Peter Handscomb, who made 894 runs in 14 Championship innings at an average of 74.5 last season, the signing of Shan Masood from June onwards, the presence at the top of the order of the talented Rishi Patel and the fact most of the bowlers have legitimate claims to be described as all-rounders, should mean Leicestershire are not short of runs this season. \nNor, if the likes of Patel, Sol Budinger, Rehan Ahmed and Louis Kimber find form, will they score those runs slowly.\nThe big question is whether they have the firepower to bowl teams out twice. \nLast season, Leicestershire took the lowest number of wickets (139) in Division Two by some distance, and some supporters have argued the signing of New Zealand-born Netherlands international Logan van Beek adds to their ranks of bowling all-rounders rather than gives the Foxes the cutting edge they need to break games open.\nTall young left-arm prospect Josh Hull has that potential, but has spent the close season struggling with injury.\nThere is hope in the pre-season performances of the likes of veteran Chris Wright and the promising Tom Scriven, while Ben Green's return from Somerset for the first seven Championship matches adds depth.\n2024 season - Third in Division Two\nKevin Hand - BBC Radio London\nThe signing of New Zealand batter Kane Williamson is something of a coup for a county that are operating under strict financial restrictions imposed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).\nThe rearrangement of the budget for wage allocation within the squad meant a number of players were released last season, including the tough decision to let the popular former England opener Mark Stoneman go.\nWith the evergreen opener Sam Robson aging well and Leus de Plooy a gun player in all formats, Middlesex have a top order to be feared -  probably for the first time since Robson, Nick Gubbins and Nick Compton formed a top three that played a huge part in the 2016 Championship winning side.\nThe mark of the Middlesex team under former director of cricket Angus Fraser, who took charge in 2009, was the regular ability to blast through teams with the ball.\nIn the absence of the retired Tim Murtagh, Middlesex struggled to rattle through the wickets last year and captain Toby Roland-Jones bore a heavy burden on that front. \nIt was refreshing to see the right-armer clear of injury for the season and his team will desperately need that once more if they are to be promoted.\nThe former England international will have his workload eased this year by the arrival of South African seamer Dane Paterson, another crucial addition to the squad that could make a significant difference to a side that looked on course for promotion for most of last season.\nThe signings of Williamson and Paterson to bolster the Championship side are a clear indication that Middlesex want success to return in the shape of promotion this year.\nDarren Lehmann was Australia head coach between 2013 and 2018\n2024 season - Fourth in Division Two\nAndrew Radd - BBC Radio Northamptonshire\nThe arrival of Australian Darren Lehmann as head coach at Wantage Road has triggered a wave of pre-season positivity in a squad left feeling somewhat bruised by the events of the past couple of years.\nAfter being relegated from Division One in 2023 they failed to register a Division Two win in 2024 until September, by which time Lehmann's predecessor John Sadler had lost his job following defeat in the T20 Blast quarter-finals.\nWith opener Emilio Gay and fast bowler Jack White both heading north, to Durham and Yorkshire respectively, there will be opportunities for others to shine. \nYoung batters Krish Patel (who opened his account with five boundaries on first-class debut at Headingley last September) and Aadi Sharma have much to offer, while the seam attack has been bolstered by the signings of Dom Leech, left-armer Liam Guthrie and \u2013 for the four Championship fixtures in May \u2013 Harry Conway from South Australia. \nGeorge Scrimshaw and the hugely promising Raphy Weatherall suffered injuries last season and will be eager to re-establish themselves.\nMuch will depend \u2013 certainly in four-day cricket - on the tried-and-trusted trio of Luke Procter, Ben Sanderson and Rob Keogh. \nIndian leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal had a major impact towards the end of 2024 and returns this year for a longer second-half stint.\nOther key figures across all formats will be Saif Zaib, who \u2013 to the relief of supporters \u2013 agreed a contract extension until at least the end of 2027, plus a couple of upwardly-trending all-rounders in Justin Broad, son of former tennis star Neil and named the county's Media Player of the Year last season, and Gus Miller.\n2024 season - Eighth in Division One\nDave Bracegirdle - BBC Radio Nottinghamshire\nYazz knew what she was on about, didn't she? 'The Only Way Is Up' was not only a catchy hit single but is also a good place to approach Nottinghamshire's hopes for 2025.\nHead coach Peter Moores has emphasised that it's important to learn from what went wrong last year, as well as draw a line underneath it. \nAs a brief reminder, Notts narrowly avoided relegation from Division One of the County Championship, finished bottom of their group in the T20 Blast and barely raised a pulse in the One-Day Cup.\nSo what might be different this time around?\nThe only domestic signing sees Conor McKerr join from Surrey but with Josh Tongue now fully fit, those two bolster a fast-bowling unit that promises untold riches. \nIf Notts can keep Olly Stone healthy, alongside overseas recruits in Australia's Fergus O'Neill and Pakistan's Mohammad Abbas, throw in the evergreen Brett Hutton and the raw pace of Rob Lord, then their resources seem well stocked.\nTeenagers Farhan Ahmed and Freddie McCann both made their county debuts towards the back end of last season and already carry the weight of expectation.\nThe prodigious spinning fingers of 17-year old Ahmed have already marked him out as a generational talent, while 19-year-old team-mate McCann hit two centuries in just seven innings.\nSome astute observers are already wondering if Kyle Verreynne is the best wicketkeeper-batter in the world right now. The county fought off a lot of competition to secure the services of the South African for the whole campaign.\nThat just leaves the top order. While Trent Bridge members may not see too much of England's Ben Duckett once again, there are guaranteed runs from skipper Haseeb Hameed and the gifted Joe Clarke, both as good as any in the county game.\nShoaib Bashir will join Glamorgan on loan for the first three County Championship games of the season\n2024 season - Third in Division One\nAnthony Gibson - BBC Radio Somerset\nWith a strong and settled squad of players shrewdly captained by Lewis Gregory, and terrific team spirit, Somerset go into the new season with every hope of marking the club's 150th anniversary with a first County Championship.\nInjuries permitting, Matt Henry will be back to lead a powerful seam attack, balanced by the spin of Jack Leach, rising star Archie Vaughan and, once he returns from a loan spell at Glamorgan or his England duties are over, Shoaib Bashir. \nAmong the batters, the only real question is who will partner Vaughan at the top of the order, Sean Dickson being the most likely answer. \nThe three Toms - Lammonby, Abell and Banton - will once again make up the engine room of the batting, with James Rew ready to reinforce his reputation as one of the most promising wicketkeeper-batters in the country.\nUnlike the infinitely talented Will Smeed, who is happily returning to the red-ball fold, Tom Kohler-Cadmore will focus on the white ball and the Blast, so that the firepower which has seen Somerset reach Finals Day in each of the past three seasons remains very much intact.\nFor Somerset's team of youngsters to have reached the One-Day Cup Final last year was a surprise, but they can by no means be discounted. James Rew's younger brother, Thomas, will surely come into that side, and what a prospect he is.\nLast year was a case of so near and yet so far - in contention for all three trophies, ending up with none. \nThe team will have learned from that, and if they can graft staying power onto all their other strengths, this could, at last, be Somerset's season.\nTom Lawes is one of a number of exciting all-rounders at Surrey\n2024 season - First in Division One (champions)\nMark Church - BBC Radio London\nThere is no reason Surrey cannot win a fourth Championship title on the spin this summer. \nThey obviously know how to put all the parts together over the course of a season and the squad is much the same. \nThe addition of Matt Fisher is exciting and there will be international call-ups. But the spine of the side is solid and experienced and if someone is missing, the gap gets filled without anybody noticing.\nOne to keep an eye on is Tom Lawes. He has all the talent in the world with both bat and ball, and if he produces consistently, it would not be a surprise if he were representing England soon. He will be aiming for a permanent spot in the Championship XI but as always there is healthy competition for places.\nThere is one certainty. In terms of the Championship, Surrey will want to be better than last season. \nThey are always looking to improve, and they know everybody else is trying to catch them. \nThey will be tested, especially by the likes of Essex and Hampshire but they know how to win the Championship, and they still have all the players that have managed that in the past three years. It is a good recipe to have.\n2024 season - First in Division Two (promoted)\nAdrian Harms - BBC Radio Sussex\nThere's much excitement and anticipation on the south coast, as Sussex return to Division One after almost a decade in Division Two.\nDuring that period they have never mounted a serious promotion bid, and it's taken change at the top, and the subsequent appointment of Paul Farbrace to galvanise the club.\nFarbrace has introduced a winning mentality that had been sadly lacking, and  crucially supplemented a talented group of younger players with, in his words, \"knarled old pros\" who know how to win, and battle when the going gets tough.\nHowever, this is essentially a young Sussex side most with no experience of first division cricket, and therefore the experience of Australian Daniel Hughes, skipper John Simpson and Ollie Robinson will be crucial particularly during the opening weeks of the season.\nBut don't think Sussex will be a soft touch and are back in Division One for the ride.\nProvided the top order can score enough runs, they have a match-winning spinner in Jack Carson and are especially difficult to beat at Hove, where they haven't lost since Farbrace took the helm.\nSussex have taken nine long years to return to Division One, and the feeling around the club is that's where they want to stay.\nJacob Bethell's game time at Edgbaston is likely to be limited this season\n2024 season - Seventh in Division One\nMike Taylor - BBC Radio WM\nA confusing winter followed a confusing summer. \nOften in 2024 it seemed something was going to happen for Warwickshire - they were front-runners in both white-ball tournaments, and frequently built strong early positions in Championship games. \nAnd then nothing happened. No white-ball final, only one four-day win. \nSeveral leading players had outstanding individual seasons - runs for the captain Alex Davies, wickets for Olly Hannon-Dalby, both for Ed Barnard, England calls for Jacob Bethell and Dan Mousley - but the total, somehow, came to less than the sum of the parts. \nA detailed high-performance review had seemed, from the outside, to have also come to no significant conclusion, the exit of performance director Gavin Larsen being unrelated, until head coach Mark Robinson suddenly left seven weeks ago.\nNow, there is both change and continuity. Ian Westwood, a known and trusted leader, is promoted to replace Robinson. \nThe patient, determined approach he showed as an opening bat and captain in testing circumstances should serve him well. \nA collection of overseas players also mixes the familiar and the new. Hasan Ali is already popular at Edgbaston, while Beau Webster has the qualities that should see him thrive mid-summer. \nHopefully all will avoid the bad luck with injuries that has so weighed Warwickshire down in recent years, and has hit Tom Latham before he even arrives.\nEdgbaston is always a busy place, but had become grumpy in the stands by last September, with so much promise unfulfilled. \nHaving seemed at times to be pushing on all fronts at once, they had gone nowhere. The club has a lot of moving parts but no shortage of talent. \nIf Davies and Westwood can steer the team in a clear direction, and maintain a strong challenge at least in one competition, it will be a year of progress.\n2024 season - Sixth in Division One\nGed Scott - BBC Sport online's Pears reporter\nA long, hard, emotional season eventually blossomed into some happiness for Worcestershire in 2024.\nIn between all the trauma of not being able to play their first home game at flood-hit Worcester until 25 May then came the devastating loss of one of their players, Josh Baker, at the tragically early age of just 20.\nBut the spirit the Pears showed in adversity could only be admired.\nThey gave a string of youngsters their chance in an unexpectedly progressive One-Day Cup campaign \u2013 and, either side of the mid-summer County Championship break, they produced three huge red-ball victories on the trot.\nThat not only helped them stay in the top flight, it was enough to catapult them up to sixth - their highest finish since two-division cricket began in 2000. Finishing above both neighbours Warwickshire and also Nottinghamshire, where four of their former players are now based, was a source of particular pride and pleasure.\nBuilding on that and again keeping their place in an always competitive division is now the challenge - although they will have to do so without the retired Joe Leach, as well as Kiwi Nathan Smith, who did well over the first half of last summer but then opted to join champions Surrey.\nBut they have another New Zealand fast bowler Jacob Duffy arriving from the second game onwards. They have three more incomers in Ben Allison from Essex, Nottinghamshire spinner Fateh Singh and Australian seamer Ben Dwarshuis for the T20 Blast.\nThey also still have that same marvellous team spirit to fall back on \u2013 and a real, genuine hunger.\nLong-term doubts remain over their future at New Road - but, in the short term, prospects at Worcester are brighter than people might think.\nJonny Bairstow will captain Yorkshire in the County Championship this season\n2024 season - Second in Division Two (promoted)\nJonathan Doidge - BBC Radio Leeds\nIt is likely to be a very interesting 2025 for Yorkshire.\nWith financial concerns now, apparently, assuaged at the very moment the team has returned to the top flight of the Championship, plus a new coaching staff and new red ball and T20 captains, there should rightly be an air of optimism.\nJonny Bairstow follows in his late father David's footsteps to steer the Championship challenge. He'd love to have a title as captain on his CV but aside from captaincy, his presence alone with the bat will be huge.\nSimilarly, Dawid Malan is going to be back playing more red-ball cricket, a major plus. Add to that potent opening pair of Adam Lyth and Finlay Bean, plus James Wharton, whose career began to blossom last year in particular, and more established batters like George Hill and that end of the team should be capable of setting up games.\nAs we know, that's no good without the ability to take 20 wickets and in that department there's plenty of encouragement. \nThe outstanding Ben Coad will again lead the line. Overseas input comes from, in particular, New Zealand's Ben Sears plus Will Sutherland (two matches) and Jordan Buckingham (four) also chipping in, while there's also George Hill, Jordan Thompson, off-season recruit Jack White, plus Matt Revis and Matt Milnes, who are on the road back from injury.\nDom Bess looks likely to be this coach's first pick among the spinners, though Dan Moriarty and Jafer Chohan will want a say in that.\nWith Bairstow donning the wicketkeeping gloves, Jonathan Tattersall and Harry Duke are going to have to wait for further opportunities, unless required as batters. You'd certainly have to feel for Tattersall after he led the team back up last season - but this is professional sport.\nWith One-Day Cup centurion Will Luxton awaiting another opportunity, there'll be upward pressure with the bat and I'd be backing Ben Cliff to put some serious pressure on the more senior bowlers in the squad. He could really take his own game to the next level as the season unfolds.\nIn summary, there's optimism that head coach Anthony McGrath can take the team to places it hasn't been for quite some time.",

Wayne Madsen, who led the side to promotion in 2012, takes over from David Lloyd after his solitary campaign leading the side.Tickner's return and the presence of experienced bowlers such as Zak Chappell and Pat Brown can only benefit newcomer Harry Moore.Already in the England system, the much talked-about 17-year-old will be starting his first full season in the senior side having already shown he can more than hold his own at that level.Winter signings Jack Morley and Martin Andersson will be better for having been with the group last season.The big challenge remains the ability to take 20 wickets a match, something Mickey Arthur's side have to do if they are to repeat the relative riches of his first season in charge in 2022.Durham - 'Bowling the key issue'Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Matthew Potts' Durham appearances this season may be limited by England call-ups2024 season - Fifth in Division OneMartin Emmerson - BBC Radio NewcastleDurham finished fifth on their return to Division One last season and in general more than held their own.

        "article_text": "Jorgen Strand Larsen bundles in Wolves' late winner to push Ipswich closer to the drop\nIpswich are teetering on the brink. With seven games left and 12 points to make up on fourth-bottom Wolves, the battle to stay up looks over. \nJorgen Strand Larsen's scrappy 84th-minute goal settled a tense encounter between the two relegation rivals after Pablo Sarabia had cancelled out a Town opener from Liam Delap.\nDefeat pushed the Tractor Boys closer to the drop in a game they simply had to win. Their fairytale rise from League One to the top flight in successive seasons looks certain to end with an immediate return to the Championship. \nWolves' comeback success at Portman Road crucially stretched them further clear of the bottom three and even Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna conceded their fight for survival looks bleak.\n\"I think it's certainly more than likely on the balance of probabilities,\" he said when asked about the prospect of relegation. \"Not that I don't think we can't finish the season strongly, but Wolves are a strong side and the chance of them losing all their games is really low. \n\"The likelihood is we'll fall short of our ultimate dream.\"\nWhen Ipswich won 2-1 at Wolves in December through Jack Taylor's last-gasp header - which ended Gary O'Neil's managerial reign at Molineux - they moved three points above Wolves.\nTown were still third bottom at the time, but just a point behind Crystal Palace, while second-bottom Wolves were four adrift of safety.\nFast forward five months and defeat at Portman Road leaves them needing one of the greatest of escapes. \nThe biggest deficit overcome by a side to stay up after 30 matches of a Premier League season was West Ham United in 2006-07. \nAt that stage, Alan Curbishley's men were eight points from safety, having been 10 behind a match earlier. Ipswich have a game less and a bigger gap.\nBradford City, in 1999-2000, and Fulham, in 2007-08, came from six points behind to survive with just five matches left, but it seems fanciful for the Tractor Boys to think of achieving that.\nJust seven of their 20 points have been won in Suffolk this season, a huge Achilles heel for a newly promoted side. Just one victory - 2-0 against Chelsea in December - has been celebrated at Portman Road and they have now lost six successive home league games for only the second time in their history, matching a wretched run in 1963 when they went on to be relegated too.\nLeicester have won nine points at home, while bottom club Southampton's sorry season is epitomised by the five points they have earned at St Mary's and they will be relegated if they fail to win at Tottenham on Sunday. \n\"You can look at different games, Liverpool, Fulham, [Aston] Villa we started really well, then came up short in terms of trying to break teams down, like the Crystal Palace game,\" reflected McKenna. \n\"We have had a few high energy games and the other teams have punished us. Today it was a spirited and committed performance but not enough to win. We are talking about small sample sizes. \n\"It's strange not to have more wins at home than away. I don't think there's one outstanding reason. If there was, we would have found it and sorted it.\"\nIn contrast, Wolves have earned 10 points from their seven home games since Vitor Pereira replaced O'Neil in December. \nUnder the Portuguese, Wolves have won more points than the three promoted sides put together - 23 from 15 games, scoring 19 goals and conceding 19.\nThe bottom three have won 16 points from a combined 43 games in that time (Ipswich eight, Southampton five and Leicester three). \nNo side has dropped more points from winning positions in the top flight this season than Ipswich (25) and they have simply not been competitive enough.\nThey have led against Fulham (twice), Manchester City, Aston Villa,(twice), Brentford, Leicester, Bournemouth, Manchester United and now Wolves and failed to win. \nEven Liam Delap's 12 goals have been unable to help them bridge the gap at this level. He has scored 38.71% of Ipswich's 31 this season - only Alexander Isak (41%), Mohamed Salah (39%) and Erling Haaland (36.8%) have higher figures in this campaign.\n\"There will be plenty of time to talk about it, analyse it and reflect on the positives and negatives,\" added McKenna. \n\"We knew coming into this nine-game block the balance of probabilities was really small, but we committed as a group to show the right values and show full commitment. \n\"We have Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Arsenal here after that, Newcastle at St James' Park and Everton in one of the last games at Goodison. \n\"We have some fantastic fixtures coming up for a club who haven't been into the Premier League for 22 years. \n\"I know today is a big setback and it hurts, but I know the players and supporters and everyone are going to muster up the energy to compete as well as we can in the last few games.\" \nThis video can not be played\nIpswich \u2018sad\u2019 as relegation looms \u2013 McKenna",

        "article_text": "Ben McKinney has scored 634 runs at an average of 37.29 in 11 first-class matches\nBen McKinney has already had a brush with celebrity.\nDuring series one of Netflix's fly-on-the-wall documentary Sunderland 'Til I Die, he is shown celebrating a rare goal in a season most Black Cats supporters would rather forget.\n\"I got a message from one of my schoolmates saying they had seen me,\" McKinney tells BBC Sport.\n\"It summed the season up that it was just me and my dad because no-one else wanted to come any more.\"\nSix years on, 20-year-old McKinney looks ready start his own journey, one he hopes will have a happier ending.\nHaving made his debut for Durham aged 18 in 2023 and scored his first first-class hundred a year later, the opening batter was already seen as someone with a big future.\nScoring 110 runs from 110 balls for England Lions this winter against an Australia A side featuring six full internationals confirmed it.\n\"It was pretty surreal,\" McKinney says. \"In the moment you are just doing it off instinct.\n\"It is good, coming up against good players, to know you are worthy of playing at the standard.\"\nAnderson not ruling out playing for three more years\nStokes to miss early rounds of Championship season\nEngland's hierarchy have shown they are not afraid of giving inexperienced youngsters a chance and they are known to like what they see in McKinney.\nFormer spinner Graeme Swann, part of the Lions set-up with McKinney in Australia, said the left-hander could \"easily walk into Test cricket now\", comparing him to New Zealand great Stephen Fleming.\nHe is a former England Under-19 captain, stands at 6ft 7in and falls into the Bazball mould as an aggressive batter.\nIt leaves those in the know thinking McKinney could follow where Jacob Bethell, Shoaib Bashir and Josh Hull have gone before in being given an early international bow.\n\"You say it's a bit of pressure but you would rather that than no-one speaking about you, wouldn't you?\" McKinney says.\n\"Runs are your currency. I will just keep doing what I am doing and hopefully get opportunities.\"\nMcKinney's height is now seen as an advantage, giving him the ability to attack lengths others would have to leave or defend, but it was not always this way.\nA talented footballer, he played for both Durham and Sunderland's academy as a teenager, having joined the Black Cats' ranks aged \"six or seven\".\n\"I was a centre-mid but I was getting a bit too tall for it,\" he says. \"I probably would have been a centre-back by now.\n\"I was always OK but didn't really enjoy it.\"\nMcKinney committed to cricket at the age of 16 \u2013 given confidence by Durham's production line which has overseen the development of Ben Stokes, Mark Wood, Paul Collingwood and Steve Harmison among others.\n\"I remember a phone call my dad had with [Durham's academy manager] John Windows,\" McKinney says.\n\"It went something like 'we have never let a lad fail from where he is now'.\n\"That was a massive confidence boost when you are 15 or 16 years old. That tipped me over the edge. My love was always cricket.\"\nThat love was first formed at Seaham Harbour Cricket Club, where his father Neil was one of the area's leading club cricketers. McKinney Sr also spent hours throwing to his son in the nets.\n\"He was relentless and wouldn't let me leave,\" McKinney says.\n\"Sometimes that might be bad but it definitely set me up for the future. It is amazing to have someone who cares for your success and you improving.\"\nDespite the promise, there has been no contact between McKinney and the England set-up, other than what he has been able to glean from having England skipper Stokes alongside him in the Durham dressing room.\n\"How he practises is something I have never seen before,\" McKinney says. \"He is so particular and there is always purpose.\"\nThe opportunities given to McKinney are no coincidence, however.\nHe was picked to open when warm-up opposition were provided to West Indies and Sri Lanka last summer and returned scores of 22, 46 and 20.\nHe also toured Australia with England Under-19s in 2023 - another relevant point with an Ashes series to come this winter - and hit 12 fours in a 45-ball 70 in England's victory in Brisbane, hinting at a keenness to follow the Bazball mantra from the start.\n\"It's actually the opposite,\" he says. \"My dad is very old fashioned. I used to bat 50 overs for 80. \n\"I used to love batting for time but somehow that flicked a switch, probably at a good time.\n\"There was a period I was probably going too hard but trying to find that balance of soaking up pressure and putting it back on has been the most important thing for my success this winter.\"\nThose words will be likely be a soothing symphony in the ears of England fans.\nTheir faith in England's approach is wobbling at the worst possible time with only a Test against Zimbabwe from 22 May to come before five against both India and Australia over the seven months that follow.\n\"I would love to play all formats but I go back to being 10 years old and watching Alastair Cook opening the batting,\" McKinney says.\n\"I loved the way he did it. It's not the road I have gone down now but the basics behind it, I will be happy keeping him as my role model.\"\nThere are no vacancies in England's top seven but Zak Crawley's poor form, Jacob Bethell's Indian Premier League commitments and the chance for injuries means nothing can be ruled out at this stage.\nMcKinney will get six County Championship matches to push his case further before Zimbabwe arrive, starting with a trip to Nottinghamshire on Friday.",

        "article_text": "England Golf women's lead coach Steve Robinson will again caddie for Lottie Woad at the Augusta National Women's Amateur tournament\nIt was while standing on the 12th tee at Augusta National that Lottie Woad had one of those 'pinch me' moments.\nThe English amateur, from Farnham in Surrey, was seven holes away from securing a career highlight win that would kick-start a stellar 2024.\nIt was a year that started with her becoming the first European to claim the Augusta National Women's Amateur (ANWA) title at the home of the Masters - a title she will try to become the first to defend this week when the three-day competition starts on Wednesday.\nIt was a year in which the England Golf women's squad member played in her first majors, finished as top Briton at the Women's Open, helped win the Curtis Cup, and ended it as the world's number-one-ranked amateur.\n\"It was definitely a breakthrough year,\" the 21-year-old tells BBC Sport. \"Winning at Augusta was the highlight and that kicked off the whole year.\"\n\"I have respect for everyone playing the 12th hole because it looks bigger than it actually is, but there is not much room. It's probably like 20 feet deep max.\"\nAnd it was on the back nine at Augusta - where so many Masters dreams have flourished and floundered - that Woad managed to keep her nerve.\nThe 12th was among the pivotal holes and she had to steady herself to tackle one of the most daunting par-threes in golf.\nDozens of rounds have been ruined on this most picturesque of holes. Tiger Woods hit three balls in Rae's Creek, the water that protects the front of the green, on his way to a 10 in 2020, the year after he won his fifth Green Jacket.\n\"You're standing on the tee and you're just like, 'I'm on hole 12',\" she says.\n\"You're nervous but then you're also going 'I'm playing the 12th at Augusta', so it's not too bad.\"\nWoad, who went into the final round of the 54-hole event - of which the first 36 are played at the nearby Champions Retreat Golf Club - with a two-shot lead, marked a three on her card to stay at six under. \nBut up ahead American Bailey Shoemaker was putting the finishing touches to the first bogey-free round at Augusta in the five-year history of the ANWA. A sensational 66 set a target of seven under.\nA bogey on the par-five 13th meant Woad dropped two behind, but she produced a magical finish with three birdies in her final four holes to snatch victory on the final green.\nThe putt on the 18th was an 18-footer, downhill.\n\"It didn't have much break but it was pretty quick,\" she says.\n\"Then it went in and I've won at Augusta and everyone kind of went crazy.\"\nWoad's season was about to get a little more crazy. The victory opened the door to play the majors, the Chevron Championship two weeks later being the first.\nShe spent a hectic week catching up with friends and college work at Florida State University, where she is in the penultimate year of a sports management degree, before heading to Texas.\n\"My parents and coaches were at Augusta and they wanted to go home, so I was left on my own at my first major,\" she says.\n\"I had to get a local caddie, but I had a lot of confidence from Augusta, made the cut and was in contention.\" \nWoad finished joint 23rd, alongside England's Georgia Hall and Charley Hull, two of her \"favourite players\" that she had \"looked up to\" since concentrating on the sport from about the age of 13.\nShe had taken her first lessons, aged seven, with Farnham pro Luke Bone, who remains her coach.\nProgression to the England Girls followed by the age of 15 and, while perhaps not seen as the most naturally gifted golfer, Woad's work ethic impressed as she took advantage of resources not previously available to her.\n\"I had a putting coach, a strength and conditioning coach and a psychologist,\" she says.\n\"I was always pretty good at the long game, but I had to work a lot harder on my short game and I learned how to practise more effectively.\"\nShe went on to win the prestigious Girls Amateur Championship at Carnoustie in 2022, a decade after Hall triumphed in the event.\nWoad was back in Scotland for last year's Women's Open, which was held over the Old Course in St Andrews.\nShe had missed the cut at the US Women's Open and Evian Championship but arrived in Fife in buoyant mood for her fourth major.\nWoad would be in contention all week and finish joint 10th to win the Smyth Salver as the highest-placed amateur, with another highlight being a 60-yard chip-in eagle two on the par-four last in round three.\n\"That got me back into the top 10 going into final day. It was a really cool moment with the grandstand full of cheering people,\" she says.\n\"Then at the prize-giving I get to stand next to the winner, Lydia Ko. To see her lift that trophy motivates you.\n\"It was a perfect week. Home of golf, first Open - I couldn't have dreamed it better.\"\nThere was little time for celebration, though. The Curtis Cup, which pits Great Britain and Ireland's top female amateurs against their American counterparts, was the following week.\nThe Americans were favourites to win a fourth successive title after domineering victories in the previous three editions of the biennial event.\nBut GB&I were boosted by having Europe's victorious Solheim Cup captain Catriona Matthew as their leader.\nAnd Woad, who grew up 40 minutes from the Sunningdale Old Course that hosted the event, contributed 2\u00bd points in a nerve-shredding 10\u00bd-9\u00bd triumph.\nBy that point, Woad had ascended to top of the amateur rankings, which earned her the Mark H McCormack medal. Ko won the prize three successive times from its inception in 2011, while Ireland's Leona Maguire and rising US star Rose Zhang are also three-time recipients.\nSo what does 2025 hold for Woad?\nThe 'P' word is unavoidable, even if Woad will \"only be making that decision when I get to it\".\nTurning professional would appear to be the next logical step and Woad is on an LPGA pathway that could help accelerate that process.\n\"You can get an LPGA card when you reach 20 points and I'm currently on 16,\" she says. \"I'm trying to get 20 points this year and then we'll have a decision to make.\n\"If you make a cut in a major you get a point. If you get a top-25 finish you get a point. If you win Augusta or NCAAs (National Collegiate Athletic Associations), you get two points.\n\"I'm trying to not think too much about it. But if I play well I'm going to get those points.\"\nThe NCAAs are the pinnacle of collegiate golf in the US, pitting teams and individuals against each other. Woad finished runner-up in the individual competition last year, while her university team were joint 11th.\nThis season, Woad has posted an impressive eight consecutive top-three finishes since September. But her Florida State team-mate, 19-year-old Malaysian Mirabel Ting, has eclipsed that, winning six events since last year's AWNA to lead the NCAA individual rankings.\nJasmine Koo is also in a field which boasts 49 of the top 50 in the world. Over the past 12 months the number two ranked player has had four wins and seven top-five finishes.\nAnd 16-year-old Asterisk Talley is tipped to feature again. She finished joint eighth last year and went on to beat Woad in the singles at the Curtis Cup as she also enjoyed a superb 2024.\nHowever, Woad goes into the week knowing that she has conquered Augusta National before and she will again have England Golf women's lead coach Steve Robinson on the bag.\n\"That's going to be nice, to have that familiarity,\" she says. \"I'm just really excited. It's going to be a fun week, and hopefully I can be the first to defend the title.\"",

The airport was shutdown after a fire at an electrical substation.\nThe chaos at Heathrow has raised concerns about the reliability of the major transport hub - and brought into question the UK's energy resilience more broadly.\nSpeaking to MPs on the transport committee, Mr Wicking said he raised cases of \"theft of wire and cable around some of the power supply\" which he said temporarily took out runway lights, which are critical to passenger safety.\n\"I wanted to understand better the overall resilience of the airport.\"\nHe said he had spoken to the Team Heathrow director on 15 March about his concerns - six days before the fire - and the chief operating officer and chief customer officer on 19 March - two days before the fire.\nMr Woldbye said the airport had to rely on contracts it has with Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks for making the network resilient, and to improve that \"comes at a very high cost\", which would raise costs for airlines, and passengers.\nHowever, Mr Wicking said Heathrow is \"already the most expensive airport in the world\". \n\"From an airline perspective, we expect resilience, we expect there to be the capability there and the understanding of when a power supply or an asset is not available, what will you do next, and how quickly will you bring it back?\"\nOn the day of the shutdown, airlines had to divert 120 aircraft, which is \"not a light decision to be made in any context\", Mr Wicking added.\nAs a consequence, when Mr Wicking joined a call with NATs, the national air traffic service, at 05:30, \"they'd run out of space within the UK for aircraft to divert\".\n\"Aircraft were then going to Europe, and then some were even halfway across Europe and going back to base in India,\" he said. \"So, quite a level of disruption for those passengers, let alone all of the cancellations\".\nThere were 1,300 cancelled flights, he said.\nThe airport reopened on the Saturday following the fire.\nWhen asked why it had not reopened sooner, Mr Woldbye said that could have meant passengers got hurt.\nHe said: \"If we had got this wrong, we might be sitting here today having a very different discussion about why people got injured, and I think it would have been a much more serious discussion.\n\"So there is a margin within which our people have to take very serious safety decisions, and that is what they are trained for, that is what they do, and that requires that every single system is up and running, tested and safe.\"\nHowever, Mr Wicking said Terminal 5 could have reopened sooner.\nHe said: \"In terms of T5, my understanding both from British Airways but also on the day, was that pretty much everything was fine to operate by mid-morning, by 10 o'clock.\"\nAfter the substation fire began on the Thursday night, Mr Woldbye said Heathrow realised \"during the early hours\" of Friday 21 March that \"we were losing power to the airport\".\n\"In our operations centre you would seen all the red lights go, that the systems were powering down,\" he said. \"We had no information as to why.\"\n\"We then had a slightly later stage call from the fire department that the substation was on fire,\" he said.\nHeathrow is supplied by three substations, but knocking out one caused the airport to shut down.\nMr Woldbye said a third of the airport was powering down and that Terminal 2 was particularly affected, along with certain central systems. He added that it became \"first and foremost a safety situation\".\n\"We need to make sure, when a crisis happens, that people are safe,\" he said.\nThe safest way to proceed was to shut down airport systems, then bring them back on line, he said.\nThe first priority was to check that no-one been caught in lifts or was hurt.\nSafety critical systems such as runway lighting and the control tower \"switched in as they should\", however, he said.\nThe government has backed plans for Heathrow to build a third runway as part of efforts to boost UK economic growth.\nThe airport would need double the amount of power for its expansion plans, Mr Woldbye said.\nHowever, Mr Wicking said airlines, which support expansion, nevertheless had concerns that it would cost \u00a340bn to \u00a360bn, and that the costs would ultimately be passed onto passengers in the form of higher fees.\nThe danger was the expansion could turn into a \"white elephant\", he said.",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs - or import taxes - for nearly every country in the world could push prices up on almost all the staples Americans routinely buy, from clothes to coffee.\nAfter declaring a national economic emergency on Wednesday, the US president announced new tariffs on billions of dollars of goods of at least 10%. For countries he has deemed the \"worst offenders\", the rates can go as high as 50%. They start taking effect on 5 April.\nEconomists have warned the new levies - and those that other countries impose in retaliation - could push prices up for Americans across the board, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has said that they will increase inflation.\nThat's because the companies importing the goods may pass the costs of the tariffs on to customers or simply bring fewer products into the country, creating a limited supply.\nHere are six everyday items that could become more expensive for American consumers.\nThe \"worst offenders\" about to be hit with the highest tariffs include the clothing manufacturing hubs of Vietnam, China and Bangladesh. The three - among the top five largest apparel importers to the US - could soon see levies ranging from 34% to 46% charged on their products.\nThat means major US department stores like Target and Walmart, where Americans often turn for affordable clothing, and some familiar apparel brands may feel the pressure.\nThe Gap, an American clothing retailer that also operates Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta, sources about 21% of its clothing from Vietnam, according to an analysis by Prof Sheng Lu at the University of Delaware's Fashion & Apparel Studies department. Another 37% of its clothing comes from India, Indonesia and Bangladesh.\nH&M, known for its inexpensive fashions, manufactures most of its clothing in China and Bangladesh.\nThe tariffs could bring an \"unfair burden to American families, particularly lower-income households\", warned the US Fashion Industry Association in a statement on Wednesday.\nVietnam is open to working out a deal with the administration to avoid the tariffs, Trump has said. China, on the other hand, has retaliated with its own steep levies.\nAlmost all of the coffee consumed in the US comes from outside the country, meaning it could soon become a bigger burden on Americans' wallets.\nThe US mostly sources its coffee from Brazil and Colombia, which are subject to the baseline 10% tariffs. Vietnam is also a key exporter of certain varieties.\nWalter Haas, owner of San Francisco-based coffee roastery Graffeo, told the Washington Post that once tariffs hit, his company will feel it \"immediately\". \nIf they remain in place, those cost increases will be \"permanently baked into the price consumers pay\", he added.\nOther imported foods could similarly rise in price, especially those coming from European Union nations, who will all be hit by a 20% tariff. Prices of shelf staples such as olive oil, which is primarily imported from Italy, Spain and Greece, could rise further.\nShoes and trainers, among the most basic necessities and also one of Americans' biggest splurges, could become more expensive, including the popular Nike Air Force 1 and Adidas Samba trainers. Both sportswear companies rely heavily on Asian factory hubs for their inventories.\nAbout half of Nike and 39% of Adidas trainers are made in Vietnam.\nIn 2024, the US imported more than $27bn of footwear, mostly from China and Vietnam, which was subject to tariffs of about $3bn, according to data by Prof Lu. \nNow, that tax amount could nearly triple.\nUBS analysts told Reuters that, all in all, retailers may not be able to fully swallow the costs, and would need to raise prices by 10% to 12% to offset the levies on Vietnamese manufacturers.\nFrance is one of the biggest foreign suppliers of wine to the US, and its winemakers have expressed anxiety about what the 20% EU tariffs will mean for their business.\nThe Bourgogne Wine Board, which represents producers in the French region of Burgundy, said the US tariffs would deliver \"a serious blow\" to both exporters and American consumers.\n\"The risk with these additional tariffs is that they could push our wines past a psychological price threshold,\" warned Laurent Delaunay, president of the Bourgogne Wine Board - meaning above what buyers feel comfortable paying.\nPrice increases could be seen at restaurants, especially for imported beers or drinks using foreign spirits. Separately, Trump expanded an aluminium tariff to include all canned beer, which could also make it more expensive for those who stay home.\nUBS analysts told Reuters that large alcohol sellers would have to hike prices up to 5% to cover the tariffs if they choose not to absorb the costs themselves.\nCell phones, TVs and video game consoles tend to be big-ticket purchases, and the latest US tariffs could make them even bigger.\nChina, as well as Taiwan and South Korea, are all top exporters of electronics to the US.\nAlmost all iPhones are made in China, although some are also made in India (which, too, is on the \"worst offenders\" list with a 26% tariff). Samsung, meanwhile, has significant production operations in Vietnam.\nIt's still unclear how these major tech companies will respond to the new levies. But Japanese video gaming company Nintendo announced on Friday that it is delaying pre-orders of its Switch 2 console, saying it needs to \"assess the potential impact of tariffs.\"\nAmericans may soon find that loading up fast-fashion hauls from Chinese online retailers like Temu or Shein with a few swipes on their phones has gotten more expensive.\nAlong with imposing the country-level tariffs, Trump has signed an executive order ending an exemption that prevented charging the levies on small-dollar shipments from China. \nThe exemption is referred to as the \"de minimis\" loophole, and it had allowed shipments under $800 (\u00a3620) to enter the US duty-free. Experts say it was a big reason why Temu and Shein were able to keep their costs low.\nThe order means those companies may have to pay taxes for the first time on the clothes they often send directly to customers.\nIt is unclear just how much costs for these goods could rise with the elimination of the loophole, but the White House says small shipments sent to the US through the international postal network could be subject to a tax of \"either 30% of their value, or $25 per item.\"\nThat tax would then increase to $50 per item after 1 June, according to the White House.",

Americans could pay more for these everyday basics under Trump's new tariffs22 hours agoShareSaveNadine YousifBBC NewsShareSaveGetty ImagesPrices could increase at well-known American brands such as Gap, as they rely heavily on Asian countries for productionDonald Trump's plan to impose tariffs - or import taxes - for nearly every country in the world could push prices up on almost all the staples Americans routinely buy, from clothes to coffee.After declaring a national economic emergency on Wednesday, the US president announced new tariffs on billions of dollars of goods of at least 10%. Now, that tax amount could nearly triple.UBS analysts told Reuters that, all in all, retailers may not be able to fully swallow the costs, and would need to raise prices by 10% to 12% to offset the levies on Vietnamese manufacturers.Alcohol, including European wine and beerFrance is one of the biggest foreign suppliers of wine to the US, and its winemakers have expressed anxiety about what the 20% EU tariffs will mean for their business.The Bourgogne Wine Board, which represents producers in the French region of Burgundy, said the US tariffs would deliver \"a serious blow\" to both exporters and American consumers. Separately, Trump expanded an aluminium tariff to include all canned beer, which could also make it more expensive for those who stay home.UBS analysts told Reuters that large alcohol sellers would have to hike prices up to 5% to cover the tariffs if they choose not to absorb the costs themselves.Getty ImagesElectronics, like iPhones and video gaming consolesCell phones, TVs and video game consoles tend to be big-ticket purchases, and the latest US tariffs could make them even bigger.China, as well as Taiwan and South Korea, are all top exporters of electronics to the US.Almost all iPhones are made in China, although some are also made in India (which, too, is on the \"worst offenders\" list with a 26% tariff). China, on the other hand, has retaliated with its own steep levies.GettyCoffee and other imported foodsAlmost all of the coffee consumed in the US comes from outside the country, meaning it could soon become a bigger burden on Americans' wallets.The US mostly sources its coffee from Brazil and Colombia, which are subject to the baseline 10% tariffs.",

The European Union has vowed a united response, and China has threatened countermeasures.\nRatings agencies like Fitch have warned that the mass tariff hikes could result in lower growth, higher inflation and potentially a recession in some parts of the world.\nHow will India - Asia's third largest economy - navigate these global tremors?\nTrump has dealt the most brutal blow to Asian countries, slapping 34% tariffs on China in addition to the 20% previously levied. Vietnam and Cambodia will have to pay 46% and 49% respectively.\nIn relative terms, at 27% India has fared better.\nBut the rate is still steep and will severely affect major \"labour intensive exports\", says Priyanka Kishore of the consultancy Asia Decoded. \"That will likely have a knock-on impact on domestic demand and headline gross domestic product at a time when growth is already stuttering,\" said Ms Kishore.\nBut the new trade realities also throw up opportunities for India.\nIts new tariff differential with Asian peers may potentially lead to some export re-routing. \"We can bring the footwear and garments business from Asian peers if we get our act together,\" says Nilesh Shah, a veteran fund manager.\nThis will take time though.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government will thus have to be strategic in how it navigates the situation.\nForemost, the announcement should \"give the government a greater sense of urgency in wrapping up a trade deal with the US\", says Rahul Ahluwalia, a public policy expert who previously worked for a government department. \"The US is our largest export market, so this is serious stuff.\" \nIndia exports some $91bn (\u00a369bn) in goods to the US, which account for 18% of its overall exports. Hectic trade negotiations have been under way with a fall deadline for conclusion. Ahluwalia says that deadline could now be compressed and brought forward.\nWhile doing that, India must also expand export markets beyond the US and focus on regions where tariffs remain low, such as Europe, Southeast Asia, and Africa,  recommends Indian trade research agency GTRI.\nIn the last couple of years, India has shown a renewed appetite for trade deals, launching free trade agreement (FTA) talks with a range of countries and blocs, including the European Union and the United Kingdom.\nLast year, Delhi signed a $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union.\nExperts say talks with other partners could now be expedited as cracks deepen between the US and many other global economies over Trump's actions.\nBut even as trade negotiations carry on with global partners, the government will need a plan on how it deals with the domestic fallout of Trump's decision.\nImpact on sectors that employ millions of people - like gems and jewellery and textiles - is likely to be significant. The government will need to extend support through means like expanding production-linked subsidies to ensure that India's domestic industry stays globally competitive and can leverage the new opportunities this has thrown up, according to the consultancy, Ernst & Young\nThe tariffs are \"fundamentally reshaping the global trading system\", says Agneshwar Sen, a trade policy expert at Ernst & Young India. This will require a \"fundamental revaluation of trading strategies\" as new supply chains emerge, he adds.\nIndia will also have to be mindful of other risk factors that emerge from this  - such as \"Chinese dumping\", says Mr Shah.\nAs it becomes more difficult for Chinese goods to enter the US, these will have to find other markets. And there are few others that are as large as India.\n\"The global South accounts for more than 20% of global consumption and is where the new middle class is being created. This is where China will attempt to sell,\" according to Akash Prakash of Amansa Capital, an investment management company in Singapore.\nFor the moment there's little clarity and no official word from the government on what its plans are.\nIndia has already reduced tariffs on some goods including high-end motorbikes and bourbon whiskey. Unlike Canada, Mexico or the European Union, Modi's government has adopted a conciliatory approach to Trump and these announcements are unlikely to trigger a retaliation, say experts.\nIndian businesses will now most likely face a period of uncertainty which is unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\"Clearly, the (Trump) administration wants even broader and deeper tariff cuts. The question is what, if anything, will satisfy the Trump administration?\", Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow at Carnegie Endowment told the BBC.\nIt is a million dollar question, for which there are no immediate answers.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Ben McKinney has scored 634 runs at an average of 37.29 in 11 first-class matches\nBen McKinney has already had a brush with celebrity.\nDuring series one of Netflix's fly-on-the-wall documentary Sunderland 'Til I Die, he is shown celebrating a rare goal in a season most Black Cats supporters would rather forget.\n\"I got a message from one of my schoolmates saying they had seen me,\" McKinney tells BBC Sport.\n\"It summed the season up that it was just me and my dad because no-one else wanted to come any more.\"\nSix years on, 20-year-old McKinney looks ready start his own journey, one he hopes will have a happier ending.\nHaving made his debut for Durham aged 18 in 2023 and scored his first first-class hundred a year later, the opening batter was already seen as someone with a big future.\nScoring 110 runs from 110 balls for England Lions this winter against an Australia A side featuring six full internationals confirmed it.\n\"It was pretty surreal,\" McKinney says. \"In the moment you are just doing it off instinct.\n\"It is good, coming up against good players, to know you are worthy of playing at the standard.\"\nAnderson not ruling out playing for three more years\nStokes to miss early rounds of Championship season\nEngland's hierarchy have shown they are not afraid of giving inexperienced youngsters a chance and they are known to like what they see in McKinney.\nFormer spinner Graeme Swann, part of the Lions set-up with McKinney in Australia, said the left-hander could \"easily walk into Test cricket now\", comparing him to New Zealand great Stephen Fleming.\nHe is a former England Under-19 captain, stands at 6ft 7in and falls into the Bazball mould as an aggressive batter.\nIt leaves those in the know thinking McKinney could follow where Jacob Bethell, Shoaib Bashir and Josh Hull have gone before in being given an early international bow.\n\"You say it's a bit of pressure but you would rather that than no-one speaking about you, wouldn't you?\" McKinney says.\n\"Runs are your currency. I will just keep doing what I am doing and hopefully get opportunities.\"\nMcKinney's height is now seen as an advantage, giving him the ability to attack lengths others would have to leave or defend, but it was not always this way.\nA talented footballer, he played for both Durham and Sunderland's academy as a teenager, having joined the Black Cats' ranks aged \"six or seven\".\n\"I was a centre-mid but I was getting a bit too tall for it,\" he says. \"I probably would have been a centre-back by now.\n\"I was always OK but didn't really enjoy it.\"\nMcKinney committed to cricket at the age of 16 \u2013 given confidence by Durham's production line which has overseen the development of Ben Stokes, Mark Wood, Paul Collingwood and Steve Harmison among others.\n\"I remember a phone call my dad had with [Durham's academy manager] John Windows,\" McKinney says.\n\"It went something like 'we have never let a lad fail from where he is now'.\n\"That was a massive confidence boost when you are 15 or 16 years old. That tipped me over the edge. My love was always cricket.\"\nThat love was first formed at Seaham Harbour Cricket Club, where his father Neil was one of the area's leading club cricketers. McKinney Sr also spent hours throwing to his son in the nets.\n\"He was relentless and wouldn't let me leave,\" McKinney says.\n\"Sometimes that might be bad but it definitely set me up for the future. It is amazing to have someone who cares for your success and you improving.\"\nDespite the promise, there has been no contact between McKinney and the England set-up, other than what he has been able to glean from having England skipper Stokes alongside him in the Durham dressing room.\n\"How he practises is something I have never seen before,\" McKinney says. \"He is so particular and there is always purpose.\"\nThe opportunities given to McKinney are no coincidence, however.\nHe was picked to open when warm-up opposition were provided to West Indies and Sri Lanka last summer and returned scores of 22, 46 and 20.\nHe also toured Australia with England Under-19s in 2023 - another relevant point with an Ashes series to come this winter - and hit 12 fours in a 45-ball 70 in England's victory in Brisbane, hinting at a keenness to follow the Bazball mantra from the start.\n\"It's actually the opposite,\" he says. \"My dad is very old fashioned. I used to bat 50 overs for 80. \n\"I used to love batting for time but somehow that flicked a switch, probably at a good time.\n\"There was a period I was probably going too hard but trying to find that balance of soaking up pressure and putting it back on has been the most important thing for my success this winter.\"\nThose words will be likely be a soothing symphony in the ears of England fans.\nTheir faith in England's approach is wobbling at the worst possible time with only a Test against Zimbabwe from 22 May to come before five against both India and Australia over the seven months that follow.\n\"I would love to play all formats but I go back to being 10 years old and watching Alastair Cook opening the batting,\" McKinney says.\n\"I loved the way he did it. It's not the road I have gone down now but the basics behind it, I will be happy keeping him as my role model.\"\nThere are no vacancies in England's top seven but Zak Crawley's poor form, Jacob Bethell's Indian Premier League commitments and the chance for injuries means nothing can be ruled out at this stage.\nMcKinney will get six County Championship matches to push his case further before Zimbabwe arrive, starting with a trip to Nottinghamshire on Friday.",

        "article_text": "Red Bull's driver Yuki Tsunoda talks us through the must-see places in Tokyo ahead of his home race at the Japanese Grand Prix.\nWhenever Yuki Tsunoda returns to fast and furious Tokyo after months of (literally) racing around the globe, it's the city's bountiful food options that help remind him he's home.\nThe SpeciaList\nFormula 1 driver Yuki Tsunoda, the youngest ever Japanese F1 driver, began his career at AlphaTauri in the 2021 season. He has driven 90 races for the team, which rebranded as RB at the start of the 2024 campaign. At the 2024 Japanese Grand Prix, he became the first homegrown racer to score a point at the Suzuka Circuit since 2012.\n\"When I'm back I always make a detailed plan of where I'm going to eat,\" declares the young Red Bull driver; known for being one of Formula 1's biggest foodies. \"On every single street and every single block there are so many great restaurants. The competition for food is so high as currently Tokyo has the highest concentration of Michelin star restaurants in the world.\nA native of Sagamihara city, around 47km south-west of Tokyo, Tsunoda \u2013 who now lives in Faenza, Italy \u2013 heads straight to Tokyo whenever he's back in Japan.\u00a0 \"Even when I return to Japan now, which happens around three times a year, I normally stay in Tokyo,\" he says. \"That's where I can do business, enjoy the food and experience the nightlife. It's always so fun to be back there.\"\u00a0\nEach April, Tsunoda's return to Tokyo is particularly triumphant when he races in his home Grand Prix. For Tsunoda, what separates the Japanese Grand Prix from the other tracks is the scintillating and contagious atmosphere, which he insists he \"can feel in the car\". Every time Tsunoda emerges at the Suzuka Circuit, he's greeted with a tidal wave of cheers and support that only increases when he's in the car and racing around the circuit.\nThe excitement was particularly vibrant at the 2024 Japanese Grand Prix, when he finished 10th to become the first Japanese drive to score points since 2012. \"As soon as I got out of the car, I could see so many people were happy,\" he says. \"With that kind of support, you just feel like a hero. You also feel extra pressure too, and responsibility. But it's a special feeling.\"\nAfter the race, Tsunoda had no shortage of ways to celebrate. As the world's most populous metropolitan area, home to more than 41 million residents as of 2024, Tokyo is constantly abuzz with energy and excitement. Visitors (and locals) get lost in its bustling markets and bask in its futuristic, neon-lit shopping and nightlife sectors, while the city's many parks, gardens and ancient temples mean there's also room for contemplation and self-reflection.\u00a0\nHere are Tsunoda's top ways to enjoy Tokyo \u2013 off the grid.\nThe city now known as Tokyo began life as a small fishing village called Edo, inhabited since ancient times. Today, its centuries of rich history are proudly on display in its captivating backdrop of modern skyscrapers set against historic temples. Each of the city's 23 wards offers unique sights \u2013 like youthful, trendy Shibuya with its iconic \"scramble\" street crossing; and Ginza, lined with elegant luxury boutiques.\nTip:\nThe best time of year to visit Tokyo is undeniably the end of March or in April, says Tsunoda. There's one very good reason for that: cherry blossom season. \"They're only around for a very short time, so you need a bit of luck. But the cherry blossom trees bloom across all of Tokyo. It makes the city so beautiful.\" Tsunoda's favourite place to enjoy the sight is down by Meguro River. It's home to a tree-lined path that's more than 4km long; a picturesque and relaxing place to soak up Japan's natural wonder.\nWhen Tsunoda wants to soak up Tokyo's modern-meets-ancient scenery, he heads to Asakusa, a serene neighbourhood known for its traditional charm and for being one of Tokyo's main geisha districts. \"If you want to see the traditional side in Japan, the Sens\u014d-ji temple is so nice,\" says Tsunoda. Known for its majestic Hozomon Gate, Sens\u014d-ji is the oldest temple in Tokyo; a five-storey pagoda and Buddhist place of worship that instantly transports you to 7th-Century Japan. Visitors to Asakusa can also stroll down Nakamise-dori; one of Japan's oldest shopping streets.\nAnd for a mile-high view of the city, Tsunoda suggests visiting Tokyo Skytree. The tallest freestanding tower in the world at 634m, Tokyo Skytree offers stunning, all-encompassing views of Tokyo and beyond. \"It's the highest building in Tokyo and you can see the whole city from there,\" says Tsunoda. Visitors can also enjoy the mammoth tower's 300-plus shops and restaurants. Reserving a ticket in advance is strongly recommended to avoid queues.\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.senso-ji.jp/english/\nAddress: 2 Chome-3-1 Asakusa, Taito City, Tokyo 111-0032Phone: +81 3-3842-0181 \nWebsite: \nhttps://tokyo-skytree.net/\nAddress: 1 Chome-1-2 Oshiage, Sumida City, Tokyo 131-0045, Japan\nPhone: +81 570-550-634\nInstagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/tokyoskytree_official\nWhenever he's in Tokyo, Tsunoda always hits Osoba no Kouga in Minato City for their soba (buckwheat) noodles. Helmed by Hiroshi Kouga \u2013 who has been making soba for more than 20 years \u2013 the elegant space remains one of Tokyo's most affordable Michelin-starred soba noodle shops.\u00a0\nTsunoda also insists that visitors try wagyu steak when they're in Tokyo. Translating to \"Japanese cow\", wagyu is globally regarded as premium beef for its flavour and tenderness, made rich and juicy by the distinctive marbling pattern of fat. Tsunoda insists, \"Wagyu just tastes different when it's from a cow fed in Japan.\"\u00a0\nTsunoda's favourite place to enjoy wagyu steak is Ukai-Tei in the upscale Ginza district, lauded for its opulent mixture of Art Noveau and Japanese design. Watching its chefs prepare dishes on a teppan grill adds to the entertainment factor.\nWebsite: \nhttps://osobanokouga.com/\nAddress: 2-14-5 Nishiazabu, Minato-ku, Tokyo 106-0031\nPhone Number: +81 3-3797-6860\nSeafood is a staple in Japanese cuisine, taking the starring role in dishes from traditional breakfasts of grilled fish and rice to delicious, rainbow-coloured sushi.\nTip:\nWith sushi restaurants seemingly on every corner, Tsunoda offers this advice when picking one: \"You want to make sure it has a counter table and you can sit there and watch the chef cook right in front of you,\" he says. \"It might be a little more expensive. But it's worth it.\"\u00a0\nFor the best fish in town, Tsunoda heads to Tsukiji Outer Market, locally known as Japan's \"Food Town\". Located next to the historic Tsukiji Market where the city's famous tuna auctions were held for decades, the lively market is crammed with stalls selling the freshest seafood. Some of the city's most famous restaurants come here to get their fish, but the market is also packed to the brim with hole-in-the-wall spots where you can snack on some of Japan's most famous foods, like tamagoyaki (omelette on a stick), mochi (glutinous rice cake) and wagyu beef skewers. It's also where Tsunoda says you can find some of Tokyo's best sushi.\u00a0\n\"There are many sushi restaurants at Tsukiji Outer Market,\" he says. \"And since it is a fish market, the fish is very fresh, especially in the morning when you can enjoy it right there\u2026 It's just really great to watch people, walk around the fish market and soak up the atmosphere.\"\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.tsukiji.or.jp/english/\nAddress: 104-0045 Tokyo, Chuo City, Tsukiji\nPhone number: +81 3-3541-9444\nInstagram: \n@tsukijicity\n\u00a0\nWith scores of luxury and indie boutiques, Tokyo is a shopper's paradise \u2013 and there are a variety of areas that cater to Tsunoda's eclectic tastes. \"I go to Harajuku when I want more street-style fashion that younger people wear. There's a lot there,\" he says. Located just east of Shibuya, Harajuku \u2013 known as Japan's top fashion district \u2013 is full of colourful street art, while its mass of clothing and cosplay stores, hip bars and alluring dessert shops means it's constantly buzzing with youthful vigour.\nTsunoda's first port of call in Harajuku is GR8, which is home to many of the city's up and coming designers, selling popular clothes and footwear from the US and Europe. Its neon interior and wooden entrance makes it one of the most distinct shops in the city, too. But if Tsunoda is after vintage fashion, he heads to the Shimokitazawa neighbourhood, regarded as one of Tokyo's most bohemian areas, full of music venues, cafes and clothing stores. \"That's where you'll find more casual stuff,\" he says. When in Shimokitazawa, Tsunoda shops at BABE store, a used and vintage clothing shop where you can easily spend hours looking for lost gems amidst its mass of items.\nFor luxury clothes shopping, Tsunoda suggests the very fashionable Omotesando district, sometimes referred to as the Champs-Elysees of the city. \"That's where you get the brand stuff,\" he says. \"The items that are higher in price and where the most famous brands are.\"\nTsunoda likes jumping from store to store in the Tadao Ando-designed Omotesando Hills shopping complex. Home to high-end designer boutiques and imports from across the world, there's also the occasional vintage store and fine dining option, too.\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.gr8.jp\nAddress: 4 Chome-12-10 Jingumae, Shibuya, Tokyo 150-0001\nPhone: +81 3-3408-6908\nInstagram: \n@________gr8\nThe one drinking establishment Tsunoda always tries to frequent when he's in town is Bar Centifolia, located in the laid-back Azabu Juban neighbourhood; home to embassies as well as a smattering of bars and restaurants.\u00a0\nThe tiny bar has an exclusive, intimate feel with just 12 seats, and its theatrical bartenders have earned the spot a reputation for doubling as a performance space \u2014 tipplers will witness staff ferociously throwing bottles into the air, using liquid nitrogen and blue fire to create a specific taste and even chopping ice with a katana.\n\"Its bartender Yuzo Komai recently went viral because of the drinks that he makes,\" says Tsunoda. \"A lot of famous people have started going there. A lot of tourists, too. But it's such a nice bar.\" Komai's attention to detail when making cocktails, mixing each drink with surgical precision, recently saw him land the Suntory Cocktail Award Champion, one of the most coveted bartender prizes in the city.\u00a0\nAddress: 6F, 1-6-5 Azabu-Juban, Minato-ku\nPhone Number: +81 3-3478-6228\nInstagram: \n@bar_centifolia\n\u00a0\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

Racecards, live text, results & reports on the BBC Sport website and app.\nRunners, riders, trainers and form - all the key details you need to know for Saturday's big race at Aintree.\nNote: Colours and approximate odds may change.\n(Racecard number, horse, trainer, jockey, recent form, age, weight carried [ie 11st 12lb is top weight]. Form: F - Fell, P - Pulled up, U - Unseated rider.)\nVerdict: Lots with chances but Senior Chief could still be improving, while Hewick looks primed to run well.\n1 Senior Chief 2 Hewick 3 Stumptown 4 Iroko\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Paul Townend\nForm: 311-P8 Age: 9 Weight: 11-12\nConvincing victor last year, having won the Irish National 12 months earlier, and could well be in the shake-up again. Pinpointed two months ago by 20-time champion jockey AP McCoy - who advises the owner - as the pick of JP McManus' stellar squad. Would be the first horse carrying top weight to triumph since the legendary Red Rum in the 1970s.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Venetia Williams Jockey: Charlie Deutsch\nForm: F-1P66 Age: 11 Weight:11-9\nThrives in different conditions, at Haydock in the mud \u2013 scene of five of his seven career victories, including back-to-back runnings of the Betfair Chase. Past three runs have been disappointing. Owned by flamboyant former banker Rich Ricci, you might not get rich backing this one although trainer did triumph with 100-1 outsider Mon Mome in 2009.\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 125-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Patrick Mullins\nForm: 73-411 Age: 8 Weight: 11-8\nOwner Stewart Andrew clearly thinks he's a rocket - he eyed Cheltenham Gold Cup, but trainer preferred to go for the National. Would be an emotional winner as Andrew's wife Sadie died in December 2022, five days after watching Nick Rockett in his first race. A winner of the Thyestes Chase then Bobbyjo Chase, where Intense Raffles was runner-up, but that rival better off at the weights here. Jockey rides for trainer father.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Brian Hayes\nForm: 1-P625 Age: 9 Weight: 11-8\nWould be a poignant winner as the last horse bought for owners Cheveley Park Stud by joint boss David Thompson at the end of 2020, just 19 days before his death. Runner-up in Irish Gold Cup to Galopin Des Champs at 66-1 when finishing ahead of subsequent Cheltenham winners Fact To File and Inothewayurthinkin. Drying ground should suit.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: John Joseph Hanlon (IRE) Jockey: Gavin Sheehan\nForm: 232571 Age: 10 Weight: 11-7\nAn \u00a3800 bargain buy who has won big races including the King George VI Chase, Bet365 Gold Cup, Galway Plate and American Grand National. Trainer, nicknamed 'Shark', has taken horse into local pub to celebrate victories, and believes he could be sent off favourite. Well backed in lead-up to race, would be suited by dry spell with good going right up his street.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Henry de Bromhead (IRE) Jockey: Rachael Blackmore\nForm: 443-26 Age: 12 Weight: 11-3\nLooked a potential winner last year in closing stages before finishing third. Triumphed in 2021 Cheltenham Gold Cup for trainer, who won National a month later with stablemate Minella Times as Rachael Blackmore became first female jockey to win the race. Could easily be prominent again for her although would be some effort to become only third horse to complete Gold Cup-National double.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Sean O'Keeffe\nForm: 2-5351 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nShowed bundles of promise when winning the Supreme Novices' Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival four years ago but much of that has been unfulfilled. Won for the first time in two years last time out at Thurles. Not the most obvious victor in trainer's talented team and no guarantee at all that he will appreciate this marathon distance.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Jonathan Burke\nForm: 0-8P43 Age: 9 Weight: 11-2\nWhile powerful trainer has other hopefuls, including last year's winner, don't let this one go under the radar. Third under top weight to Intense Raffles in last year's Irish Grand National before winning Bet365 Gold Cup at Sandown. Breeding and form point to potential for big run. Minella horses take their name from a Tipperary family hotel run by racehorse trader John Nallen.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Jordan Gainford\nForm:  U58708 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nBoasts some decent form including Irish Gold Cup win, when Minella Indo was second, albeit that was three years ago. Has run well at this meeting before, including a good second to Jonbon over shorter distance last year. Trainer seeking fourth victory in race, but suspicion is age, weight and longer trip may be against this one.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Keith Donoghue\nForm: -U1111 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nSecured fourth straight victory of the season by winning Cross Country Chase at Cheltenham Festival in fine style last month. That is the same race Tiger Roll won before his 2018 and 2019 National triumphs. Stumptown's trainer went to town at Cheltenham by landing the Gold Cup with Inothewayurthinkin, who was then made hot favourite for this but skips the race.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 8-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Freddie Gingell\nForm: 83-222 Age: 9 Weight: 11-1\nPart-owned by former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, Hitman has been a bit hit and miss. Has a habit of coming second - finishing runner-up in 11 of his 26 races - and this distance is a real unknown. Talented 19-year-old jockey credits much of his success to his mother Kim who died in 2020 from cancer aged 43.\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 150-1\nTrainer: Nigel Twiston-Davies Jockey: Sam Twiston-Davies\nForm: 1P-132 Age: 9 Weight: 11-1\nJockey rides for trainer father, who has landed the race twice before. Winner of Midlands Grand National last year. Owner Bryan Burrough hoping for second success, 42 years after his colours were carried to victory by the Jenny Pitman-trained Corbiere. It's a tough ask but had a convincing victory over fences at Ascot earlier in season and stamina looks assured.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: James Reveley\nForm: 6-2383  Age: 10 Weight: 11-0\nForm has dipped since reaching top of his game two or three years ago. Won jump racing's festive showpiece, the King George VI Chase at Kempton, in 2022 and was second a year later. In between, finished runner-up in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Will take a brave man or woman to pick this one after an 11-race losing run. Stable jockey rides Kandoo Kid.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 50-1\nTrainer: Nicky Henderson Jockey: James Bowen\nForm: 9-5515  Age: 11 Weight: 10-13\nBit of an enigma. Was on a 10-race losing run when won well at Cheltenham on New Year's Day. Maybe he was just in the party mood. Green and gold colours of owner JP McManus look more likely to succeed elsewhere, although there is a breeding positive - Chantry House's sire Yeats was also dad to 2022 National winner Noble Yeats.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Harry Skelton\nForm: 210-32 Age: 10 Weight: 10-12\nNamed after owner Max McNeill's late father and ex-professional golfer Ted, who was three under par through five holes to lead The Open at Royal Portrush in 1951. Will the gelding be above or below par? Fourth in the Scottish National two years ago but well behind Minella Cocooner and Nick Rockett in last season's Bet365 Gold Cup.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Mark Walsh\nForm: 286411  Age: 8 Weight: 10-12\nAnother powerful weapon in the armoury of Cheltenham Gold Cup-winning trainer, who also has Stumptown and Vanillier. A beaten favourite for both the Galway Plate and Kerry National but form of his Leopardstown win in December reads well and now takes a big step up in trip. Named after a 1970s film about a 12th Century knight, could he put his rivals to the sword here?\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 12-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Harry Cobden\nForm: P23-18 Age: 9 Weight: 10-11\nDecent third in Topham Chase over National fences last year. Won Coral Gold Cup, formerly the Hennessy, at Newbury in November. Only one horse, Many Clouds, has gone on to also win the National, though trainer thinks he can do it. He won in 2012 with Neptune Collonges and says the grey Kandoo Kid is the \"ideal horse for the race\".\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 20-1\nTrainer: Oliver Greenall & Josh Guerriero Jockey: Jonjo O'Neill Jr\nForm: 2-2F42  Age: 7 Weight: 10-11\nA Cheltenham Festival winner in 2023. Second at Aintree meeting 12 months ago to subsequent Gold Cup winner Inowthewayurthinkin when nominated by owner JP McManus as his 'National horse for next year'. Joint-trainer Oliver Greenall's father Lord Daresbury is former racecourse chairman who has an Aintree stand named after him. Co-trainer Josh Guerriero won Foxhunters' Chase over National fences as amateur jockey in 2008.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 9-1\nTrainer: Tom Gibney (IRE) Jockey: JJ Slevin\nForm: 11-902 Age: 7 Weight: 10-10\nSounds like a deadly serious lottery, and has a deadly serious chance. Winner of the Irish Grand National last year. Nearly all of his races have been on soft or heavy ground. The grey runs in the 'double green' colours of owner-breeders Simon Munir and Isaac Souede. Showed his wellbeing when second, despite carrying more weight, to Nick Rockett at Fairyhouse in February.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Henry de Bromhead (IRE) Jockey: Darragh O'Keeffe\nForm: 1P-169 Age: 9 Weight: 10-10\nPulled up in last year's Irish National but marked himself out as a candidate for this race when winning well at Cheltenham in October. Subsequently sixth in the Coral Gold Cup at Newbury when he was staying on, which could be a good sign for the test ahead. Owned by the Lucky In Life Syndicate. Will the horse live up to their name?\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Richard Phillips Jockey: Harry Bannister\nForm: F03106 Age: 11 Weight: 10-10\nPreviously based in Ireland, where he won the Midlands National last summer at Kilbeggan. Having second run for amiable Gloucestershire trainer, who does a nice line in impressions. He helped buy the horse with John Rosbotham, a friend of 55 years with whom he dreamed in the school playground of having a National runner, and it runs for a syndicate of 12 called the Dozen Dreamers.\nRating: 4/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey:  Sam Ewing\nForm: 212433 Age: 7 Weight: 10-9\nFive of his six wins have come at roughly half the distance of this race. Looks an uphill task on the face of it, but interestingly mentioned as a potential surprise package by the trainer \u2013 who has won three times previously - when weights for the race were announced in February. Would probably benefit from soft ground.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Nigel Twiston-Davies Jockey: Tom Bellamy\nForm: 5-324P Age: 7 Weight: 10-9\nOwner David Proos hoping to go two better after his family silks were carried to third by Rinus in 1990. No forlorn hope based on his second to Kandoo Kid in Coral Gold Cup at Newbury. One for alliteration fans - could Broadway Boy follow Mon Mome, Party Politics and Red Rum as a nifty-sounding National winner for trainer, who has triumphed twice before?\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Jody McGarvey\nForm: U50029 Age: 10 Weight: 10-9\nEleventh in last year's race, when hampered late on, having previously finished eighth and pulled up. Prominent on each occasion before fading. Winner of the Troytown Chase in 2023. Will probably be spotted towards the front again but takes a leap of faith to see him stay there and become only the fourth grey horse to win the National.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Paul O'Brien\nForm: 3PP-P0 Age: 8 Weight: 10-9\nLooked to be heading for big things after winning Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham in 2023 but career over the bigger obstacles has not been straightforward and pulled up on three of his past four runs. Jockey called up for first ride in race after original bookings Bryony Frost (riding in France) then Johnny Burke (on Minella Cocooner instead) were unavailable\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Danny Mullins\nForm: 37-008 Age: 8 Weight: 10-7\n'Caught the eye' of last year's winning trainer when the weights were revealed in February. Finished seventh in 2024 when appeared to run out of steam. That could be perceived as a stamina doubt, although might see out the trip better now a year stronger and stable's Hedgehunter won in 2005 after a tired late fall the previous year.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Jonjo & AJ O'Neill Jockey: Nick Scholfield\nForm: 5P-241 Age: 9 Weight: 10-9\nIntriguing contender who finished fourth in the Welsh Grand National before ending a two-year losing run with victory at Uttoxeter. Finished third to subsequent National winner Corach Rambler at Cheltenham Festival two years ago. Formerly owned by Tory peer Michelle Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman before being sold last year to Martin Tedham, who sponsors the trainer's yard.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Sean Flanagan\nForm: -P6913 Age: 10 Weight: 10-6\nThis was my selection in 2023, when he ended up finishing second to Corach Rambler for shrewd trainer. Was 14th last year on softer ground but comfortable Punchestown win in February showcased his credentials. Nearly took the wrong route at Cheltenham last month before recovering to finish third in Cross Country Chase. Chance again if the satnav is working.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Michael Keady Jockey: Ciaran Gethings\nForm:  F22999  Age: 8 Weight: 10-6\nRunner-up in the Kerry and Munster Nationals when trained by Willie Mullins but switched stables last month. Now based in the Flat racing capital of Newmarket. Trainer set up on his own five months ago and is looking for first win over jumps in biggest steeplechase of all. Has to be a doubt over whether this contender possesses the same ability and stamina as some of his rivals.\nRating: 4/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Nicky Henderson Jockey: Nico de Boinville\nForm: 141122 Age: 8 Weight: 10-6\nNovice chaser looking to break duck for trainer, who is one of the greats but has poor record in this race \u2013 with no win from 43 previous runners. Sound jumper who should like the ground. Need an omen? One of the owners, Paul Humphreys, was born on same day as Grand National legend Red Rum. Their syndicate once included the late John Sillett, Coventry City's FA Cup-winning manager.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Philip Hobbs and Johnson White Jockey: Micheal Nolan\nForm: 45U4-1 Age: 13 Weight: 10-6\nThe obstacles should not be an issue, having finished eighth and fourth in the past two runnings of the shorter Topham Chase over the National fences. However, this is a longer and stiffer task. No 13-year-old horse has won the National since Sergeant Murphy 102 years ago and hard to see an equine teenager being celebrated this time around.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 150-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Sean Bowen\nForm: -33713  Age: 10 Weight: 10-5\nThis race has been the long-term plan, says the trainer, who has been successful three times before.

        "article_text": "From Drop to A Minecraft Movie, these are the films to stream at home and watch at the cinema this month.\nDavid Cronenberg's latest sci-fi-tinged drama stars Vincent Cassel as Karsh, an inventor who looks a lot like Cronenberg himself. Grief-stricken by the death of his wife (Diane Kruger), Karsh develops camera systems that can be buried with corpses, so that their relatives can watch them on monitors as they decompose. The invention catches on, but one night some graves containing these high-tech \"shrouds\" are desecrated, so Karsh and his brother-in-law (Guy Pearce) have to work out who was responsible. This may sound like the kind of scenario that the director of Scanners and The Fly might use to justify lots of gory body horror, but The Shrouds is a \"restrained, even elegant\" film inspired by Cronenberg's own bereavement, says Steve Pond at The Wrap. \"It's a deeply personal look at loss that finds plenty of time to get creepy but never loses sight of the fact that it's a movie about grief\u2026 Its focus, which never wavers, is always on the feeling of loss, not the sight of gore.\"\nReleased on 18 April in the US\nThree of Hollywood's brightest young stars get together in On Swift Horses, a handsome period romance directed by Daniel Minhan and adapted from Shannon Pufahl's novel. Daisy Edgar-Jones plays Muriel, the fianc\u00e9e of an upstanding Korean War veteran, Lee (Will Poulter). He is looking forward to a traditional family life in California in the go-getting 1950s, but when his younger brother Julius (Jacob Elordi) comes to stay, Julius's gay relationships and gambling sprees help Muriel to understand why she is attracted to women and drawn to betting on horse races. Graham Guttman at Screen Rant calls the film a \"quietly devastating [story of] great pain and even greater love, all of which is portrayed beautifully by the film's all-star cast\", adding: \"On Swift Horses, with its sweeping romance and epic nature, feels outside of time, transcending any issues to become something deeply affecting.\" On the other hand, the BBC's Caryn James considers it \"a disappointment [that] works much better as an idea than as a film\".\nReleased on 25 April in the US and Canada, and on 30 April in France\nOn a remote island in Eastern Europe, fanged and furry monsters called Ochi lurk in the forests. A farmer (Willem Dafoe) is obsessed by hunting them, but when his shy teenage daughter (Helena Zengel) finds an injured baby Ochi, it turns out to be a big-eyed, pointy-eared beastie that bears a striking resemblance to Gizmo from Gremlins and Grogu from The Mandalorian. The girl then defies her father and takes the creature back to its family \u2013 a journey that is visualised using practical rather than digital effects. \"The Legend of Ochi, the rare A24 family film, is a charming throwback to adventure movies of the 80s like The Neverending Story and The Dark Crystal,\" says Brian Tallerico at RogerEbert.com, \"complete with original puppetry that reportedly contains not an ounce of CGI manipulation. It feels like a family film made by flesh-and-blood people in an era when computers are doing so much of the work.\"\nReleased on 25 April in the US, the UK, Canada and Ireland\nRyan Coogler has already put his own personal stamp on the sports drama (Creed) and the superhero blockbuster (Black Panther), and now, with Sinners, the writer-director takes on gothic horror. His favourite leading man, Michael B Jordan, plays two gun-toting twin brothers, Smoke and Stack, who go back to their rural hometown in 1930s Louisiana, only to find that the local blues music \"can pierce the veil between life and death\". The town is soon infested with vampires \u2013 but don't think of Sinners as a straightforward vampire chiller. \"The film is very genre-fluid,\" Coogler said in The Hollywood Reporter. \"It switches in and out of a lot of different genres. Yes, vampires are an element, but it's not the only supernatural element in the movie... I'm blessed to have found this medium that I can work out deep philosophical and existential questions that I may be struggling with while contributing to an art form that means so much to my family.\"\nReleased internationally on 18 April\nFirst dates can be awkward, but not many are as awkward as the one in Drop, a high-concept one-location thriller from Christopher Landon, the writer-director of Happy Death Day and Freaky. Meghann Fahy stars as a single mother, Violet, who agrees to have dinner with the eligible Henry (Brandon Sklenar) in a Chicago skyscraper's restaurant. Everything is going smoothly until someone in the restaurant starts sending threatening messages to Violet's phone. She is told that there is an intruder in her home, and that unless she poisons Henry, her five-year-old son will be killed. \"[Fahy's] dialled-in performance is thankfully matched by an overarching crispness to the proceedings,\" says Adrian Horton in The Guardian. \"Just enough flourishes, an enjoyable but not unbearable amount of stress, no wasted time, a perfect match of star, script and style. For those who sort for lean and limber in their thrillers, Drop is a date worth making.\"\nReleased internationally on 11 April\nWhen Alex Garland was making his last film, Civil War, his military advisor for the battle sequences was Ray Mendoza, an Iraq War veteran. This collaboration prompted Garland and Mendoza to co-direct another film, a faithful recreation of a battle which Mendoza himself was in, that plays out in real time over 90 minutes. D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai plays Mendoza (alongside Will Poulter, Joseph Quinn and Charles Melton) in what some critics are calling cinema's most authentic and immersive ever depiction of a wartime firefight. It's a film that pushes the \"war is hell\" concept \"to its logical, visceral and most infernal conclusion\", says Kevin Maher in The Times. \"This is a movie that's as difficult to watch as it is to forget. It's a sensory blitz, a percussive nightmare and a relentless assault on the soul.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US and Canada, 16 April in Spain, 17 April in Australia, Brazil and Germany, and 18 April in the UK\nIf you finished watching Peter Jackson's series, The Beatles: Get Back, and you wanted to know what John Lennon got up to after the Fab Four broke up, then One to One: John & Yoko could be the film for you. Directed by Kevin Macdonald (One Day in September, Marley) along with Sam Rice-Edwards, the documentary chronicles the 18 months in the early 1970s when Lennon and Yoko One lived in Greenwich Village, New York. It covers the only full-length concert Lennon played after his time in The Beatles \u2013 but that was just one of the couple's many endeavours during their stay in the Big Apple. \"Drawing on televised interviews, taped phone calls with agents and managers, and personal film footage,\" says David Hughes in Time Out, \"Macdonald charts the couple's determination to fight for any worthy cause that crosses their eyeline, from the Vietnam War to fundraising for remanded prisoners unable to afford bail. The pair's artistry, individually and collectively, seems to be matched only by their energy and moral clarity.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US, the UK and Ireland\nWhat if Die Hard was set at a meeting of the world's most powerful political leaders? And what if the US president in Air Force One was a woman? The answer to both of these questions can be found in G20, a gleefully over-the-top action thriller directed by Patricia Riggen. Viola Davis stars as US President Danielle Sutton, who is at a G20 summit in South Africa when a terrorist group takes the guests hostage. What the bad guys (led by Antony Starr from The Boys) haven't counted on is that the POTUS is an army veteran, and even when she's wearing a cocktail dress, she can fight with the best of them. \"It was the sort of thing you'd imagine as a kid, just playing the most heroic character you could possibly play,\" Davis told Variety. The only question the film doesn't answer is whether the sequel will be called G21.\nReleased on 10 April on Prime\nA Minecraft Movie is a children's adventure co-starring Jack Black, and adapted from a video game about a colourful fantasy world being threatened by infernal invaders. Does that sound familiar? If so, it's because the very same summary applies to The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Still, that was the second highest grossing film of 2023, so maybe A Minecraft Movie will be just as lucrative. The difference is that the new film, which also stars Jason Momoa and Jennifer Coolidge, has live-action actors in a CGI world. Also, it's directed by Jared Hess, the maker of such eccentric comedies as Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre. \"By some force of alchemy, his cockeyed look at things \u2013 a mix of deadpan delivery, garish colours, and exaggerated interactions \u2013 is weirdly perfect for this adaptation,\" says Jordan Hoffman in Entertainment Weekly. \"There's an 'anything goes' attitude here\u2026 [and] this loosey-goosey attitude is a breath of fresh air after so many family films that seem preordained by lore.\"\nReleased internationally on 4 April\nWith a dynamic that's not a million miles away from the central relationship in A Real Pain, Sacramento is an indie comedy about two mismatched male friends \u2013 one neurotic, the other annoyingly outgoing \u2013 embarking on a trip together. Glenn, played by Michael Cera, is even more anxious than usual because he is about to become a father, while the extrovert Rickey, played by Michael Angarano, is traumatised by the death of his own father. Could a weekend in Sacramento, California help them to overcome all of their issues? Angarano is also the co-writer, co-producer and director of a film that features both his ex-partner, Kristen Stewart, and his current partner, Maya Erskine. David Ehrlich at IndieWire says that Angarano \"graduates from overeager dilettante to unusually shrewd comic director\" with Sacramento. \"Its casual nature and outward lack of ambition belie how well it manages to convey the terror that change brings into our lives, the mania of trying to deny it, and the relief that comes from recognising that someone else in your world is changing with you.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US\nAng Lee's second film, The Wedding Banquet, was a romantic comedy about a gay Taiwanese New Yorker who marries a Chinese woman so that she can get a green card, only for his unwitting parents to mark the occasion with a lavish party. The film made Lee's name as a director when it was released in 1993, and it went on to be nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Now it has been remade by Andrew Ahn (Fire Island), with a stellar cast that includes Bowen Yang (Wicked), Lily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon) and Kelly Marie Tran (Star Wars: The Last Jedi). Ahn moves the story to Seattle, adds a subplot about fertility treatment, and rejigs the nationalities and generations so that the visiting relative is now a grandmother (Minari's Youn Yuh-jung) from South Korea. \"An intended marriage of convenience still lies at its heart,\" says Amber Wilkinson in Screen Daily, \"but the relationships are given a modern makeover as Ahn probes questions of commitment and celebrates the families we choose to make for ourselves\".\nReleased on 18 April in the US and Canada\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Jack Doohan is one of six rookies in F1 this year\nJapanese Grand Prix\nVenue: Suzuka Dates: 4-6 April Race start: 06:00 BST on Sunday\nCoverage: Live radio commentary of practice and qualifying on BBC 5 Sports Extra, race live on BBC Radio 5 Live. Live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app\nAlpine's Jack Doohan suffered a high-speed crash as Friday practice at the Japanese Grand Prix was punctuated by four red-flag stoppages.\nThe Australian was uninjured in the crash, which was caused because Doohan failed to shut the DRS overtaking aid, which meant the car had less grip than he expected as he entered the 160mph first corner.\nTeam principal Oliver Oakes said it had been a \"misjudgement\" and \"something to learn from\".\nDoohan's was the first of four incidents that led to the session being stopped, two of which were for the grass catching fire beside the track.\nMcLaren's Oscar Piastri ended up fastest from team-mate Lando Norris.\nThe second stoppage was caused when Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso spun off and became beached in the gravel at Degner One, shortly after the session was restarted following a 20-minute delay to repair the damage to the barriers at Turn One.\nAnd a few minutes after the session was resumed, the cars had to return to the pits when the grass caught fire between Dunlop and Degner One.\nThat left only seven minutes of running at the end of the session, but it was stopped after six when a bigger patch of grass caught fire on the run down to Spoon Curve.\nThe fires are believed to have been caused by a combination of sparks from the cars and dry grass - Japan's wet season is in the summer. \nThe country's grand prix was held in the autumn until last year, when it was moved to avoid typhoon season and to improve Formula 1's sustainability with regard to travel and logistics.\nA statement from F1's governing body, the FIA, said: \"While we continue to look into the fires that occurred during FP2, our focus before tomorrow will be on taking preemptive measures. \n\"The grass has been cut as short as possible, and loose, dried grass has been removed from affected areas. Prior to tomorrow's sessions, the grass will be dampened, and specific response teams will be stationed around the track.\"\nProposal to bring back V10 engines set to be rejected\nHow to follow Japanese Grand Prix on the BBC\nDoohan's accident, which badly damaged his car, was the result of an oversight by a driver in only his fourth race in F1.\nHe was on only his second flying lap of the day, as his car had been driven by reserve Ryo Hirakawa in the first session.\nThe DRS, which boosts straight-line speed by reducing downforce, is triggered to shut automatically if the driver brakes.\nDoohan turned into the first corner having lifted off but not braked, and because he did not press the DRS button, the device remained activated.\nThat meant the wing was still in its open, low-downforce position, and the car immediately spun as he entered the corner. It careered across the gravel trap before making a heavy impact with the crash barrier.\nDoohan said: \"It was a heavy one, something that caught me by surprise, and I will learn from it.

        "article_text": "Donald Trump's tariffs have sparked falls in stock markets around the world - but how will they affect sport?\n\"It's potentially the difference between life and death.\"\nThe words of a \"hugely frustrated\" Lynn Calder - the head of Ineos Automotive, the car company owned by Manchester United minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe - when talking about the impact United States tariffs would have on the business.\nWith its manufacturing based in France, the company now faces the prospect of 25% tariffs being imposed on vehicles exported to the crucial American market, with Calder admitting it was \"vulnerable to tariffs\" and needed \"direct and urgent political intervention\"., external\nHer stark warning was a reminder of the effect the duties introduced by US President Donald Trump will have on the wide range of industries linked to sport through investment or sponsorship. \nGlobal stock markets have fallen as investors reacted amid fears of inflation, but beyond the wider economic turmoil, how else could the ripples of a trade war affect the world of sport?\nTrump's so-called 'Liberation Day' could have ramifications for a club such as Manchester United in other ways.\n\"It has $650m of loans from the US because the club is listed in New York,\" football finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport.\n\"If the Trump administration's tariffs have a positive impact on the US dollar and it strengthens, that means the value of those loans in sterling terms will increase, and this could hit United's accounts and have implications for Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR) that limit clubs' losses.\n\"In the 2022 accounts there was a \u00a358m cost due to foreign exchange movements on these loans. So the United board will be watching with interest as to what happens in terms of the market reaction to these tariffs as far as global exchange rates are concerned.\"\nThe US is set to stage some of the world's biggest sports events over the next few years, including the 2026 World Cup and 2028 LA Olympics and Paralympics. \nThese events are meant to provide overseas businesses with a key opportunity to raise their profile and boost sales in the US. \nKorean car manufacturer Hyundai Group, for instance, will look to take advantage of its sponsorship deal with football governing body Fifa during the Club World Cup this year, and then the World Cup in 2026. But could Trump's aggressive trade policies make such businesses think again?\n\"I suspect some sponsors are now re-assessing how they 'activate' such deals in the US, given the trade barriers that have now been imposed,\" says John Zerafa, a sports event bid strategist.\n\"Why would a sponsor spend millions of pounds doing so if it is now prohibitive to sell in America?\"\nMany sports teams and athletes are also sponsored by sportswear brands. \nWith most of these companies relying on materials and manufacturing in Asia - where Trump has directed some of the highest tariffs - it is no surprise that shares in the likes of Nike, Adidas and Puma have all fallen sharply, with fears that higher importing costs would be passed on to consumers.\nHowever Maguire says the impact should be limited. \"For a $100 (\u00a376.36) replica sports jersey sold in the US, manufacturing costs are likely to be in the region of $12-15 dollars at source, and maybe even lower,\" he says.\n\"So even if there's a 40% tariff when the goods are imported to the US, that'll only be around $4 more.\n\"Consumers are used to paying premium prices in sports retail. The manufacturer and retailer should absorb some of this, and it shouldn't impact on the amount being sold - or the commissions being earned by clubs that sell merchandise.\"\nThe European Sponsorship Association told BBC Sport that it was \"monitoring the situation closely and will actively seek the views of the sport sponsorship community\".\n\"As a representative body we will respond accordingly if there proves to be any sign of a material negative impact on the industry,\" it said.\nAmid talk of a trade war, Trump's tariffs have also raised questions over the atmosphere at the various sports events it is due to host, not least the Ryder Cup in the US later this year. \nWith European Union leaders highly critical of the policy, it would be little surprise if anti-European sentiment among the American fans is intensified.\nAnd then there's the 2026 World Cup, which the US is co-hosting alongside Mexico and Canada.\nIn January, Trump vowed to impose tariffs of 25% on imports from the neighbouring countries - America's two biggest trading partners - in a move he said was designed to address the entry of opioid drug fentanyl to the US, the large amounts of undocumented migrants that have come across US borders, as well as trade deficits.\nLast month Trump claimed the political and economic tensions between the US and its World Cup co-hosts would be good for the tournament. \"I think it's going to make it more exciting. Tension's a good thing,\" he said.\nHe also announced the formation of a World Cup taskforce, external which he will chair to ensure the tournament runs smoothly. Fifa has been approached for comment on their response to the US President's tariffs.\nBut Trump's protectionist policies raise serious questions over the three countries' willingness and ability to work together on security for instance, or to ensure fans can gain entry visas, and then pass easily across borders. \nWith imported materials such as steel and aluminium more expensive, there may also be concerns about the development of infrastructure for the tournament.\nTrump has also spoken provocatively about making Canada 'the 51st state', leading to the US anthem being booed by Canadian fans at NBA and NHL fixtures. \nCould the additional tensions over tariffs mean such scenes are repeated at the World Cup or even the Olympics?\n\"Nations and cities host global sports events for a variety of reasons, from enhancing reputation and driving global investment, to sending a message to the world that you are open, welcoming and ready to do business. It seems nothing could be further from the truth in terms of Trump's America,\" says Zerafa.\n\"It's not just tariffs. From forced repatriations, and hostility to the EU and Nato, to a possible takeover of Greenland and bad blood with Canada. All this makes it a very challenging backdrop for the World Cup 2026 and LA Games in 2028 to promote that narrative.\"\nThe IOC has been approached for comment. Insiders told BBC Sport they are confident that Trump's love of sport - and his desire for LA 2028 to be a successful global platform towards the end of his second term in office - will ensure that preparations for the Olympics are not derailed by geopolitics.\nWith retaliatory tariffs being imposed by other countries, a trade war could impact any person, team or league buying sports equipment that is made in the US, as well as American consumers of products manufactured overseas of course.\nThe Premier League exports its content to the US via its lucrative \u00a32bn TV deal with NBC, but because this is deemed a service rather than a product, the tariffs do not apply.\n\"As such there should be no consequences, unless there is some form of escalation in the trade relationship between the UK and the US,\" says Maguire. \n\"So the Premier League won't have to come to some sort of compromise with its broadcast partner.\"\nA bigger concern for the UK football industry will be consumers having less money to spend on tickets and TV subscriptions if fears of a recession come to pass.",

        "article_text": "Jorgen Strand Larsen bundles in Wolves' late winner to push Ipswich closer to the drop\nIpswich are teetering on the brink. With seven games left and 12 points to make up on fourth-bottom Wolves, the battle to stay up looks over. \nJorgen Strand Larsen's scrappy 84th-minute goal settled a tense encounter between the two relegation rivals after Pablo Sarabia had cancelled out a Town opener from Liam Delap.\nDefeat pushed the Tractor Boys closer to the drop in a game they simply had to win. Their fairytale rise from League One to the top flight in successive seasons looks certain to end with an immediate return to the Championship. \nWolves' comeback success at Portman Road crucially stretched them further clear of the bottom three and even Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna conceded their fight for survival looks bleak.\n\"I think it's certainly more than likely on the balance of probabilities,\" he said when asked about the prospect of relegation. \"Not that I don't think we can't finish the season strongly, but Wolves are a strong side and the chance of them losing all their games is really low. \n\"The likelihood is we'll fall short of our ultimate dream.\"\nWhen Ipswich won 2-1 at Wolves in December through Jack Taylor's last-gasp header - which ended Gary O'Neil's managerial reign at Molineux - they moved three points above Wolves.\nTown were still third bottom at the time, but just a point behind Crystal Palace, while second-bottom Wolves were four adrift of safety.\nFast forward five months and defeat at Portman Road leaves them needing one of the greatest of escapes. \nThe biggest deficit overcome by a side to stay up after 30 matches of a Premier League season was West Ham United in 2006-07. \nAt that stage, Alan Curbishley's men were eight points from safety, having been 10 behind a match earlier. Ipswich have a game less and a bigger gap.\nBradford City, in 1999-2000, and Fulham, in 2007-08, came from six points behind to survive with just five matches left, but it seems fanciful for the Tractor Boys to think of achieving that.\nJust seven of their 20 points have been won in Suffolk this season, a huge Achilles heel for a newly promoted side. Just one victory - 2-0 against Chelsea in December - has been celebrated at Portman Road and they have now lost six successive home league games for only the second time in their history, matching a wretched run in 1963 when they went on to be relegated too.\nLeicester have won nine points at home, while bottom club Southampton's sorry season is epitomised by the five points they have earned at St Mary's and they will be relegated if they fail to win at Tottenham on Sunday. \n\"You can look at different games, Liverpool, Fulham, [Aston] Villa we started really well, then came up short in terms of trying to break teams down, like the Crystal Palace game,\" reflected McKenna. \n\"We have had a few high energy games and the other teams have punished us. Today it was a spirited and committed performance but not enough to win. We are talking about small sample sizes. \n\"It's strange not to have more wins at home than away. I don't think there's one outstanding reason. If there was, we would have found it and sorted it.\"\nIn contrast, Wolves have earned 10 points from their seven home games since Vitor Pereira replaced O'Neil in December. \nUnder the Portuguese, Wolves have won more points than the three promoted sides put together - 23 from 15 games, scoring 19 goals and conceding 19.\nThe bottom three have won 16 points from a combined 43 games in that time (Ipswich eight, Southampton five and Leicester three). \nNo side has dropped more points from winning positions in the top flight this season than Ipswich (25) and they have simply not been competitive enough.\nThey have led against Fulham (twice), Manchester City, Aston Villa,(twice), Brentford, Leicester, Bournemouth, Manchester United and now Wolves and failed to win. \nEven Liam Delap's 12 goals have been unable to help them bridge the gap at this level. He has scored 38.71% of Ipswich's 31 this season - only Alexander Isak (41%), Mohamed Salah (39%) and Erling Haaland (36.8%) have higher figures in this campaign.\n\"There will be plenty of time to talk about it, analyse it and reflect on the positives and negatives,\" added McKenna. \n\"We knew coming into this nine-game block the balance of probabilities was really small, but we committed as a group to show the right values and show full commitment. \n\"We have Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Arsenal here after that, Newcastle at St James' Park and Everton in one of the last games at Goodison. \n\"We have some fantastic fixtures coming up for a club who haven't been into the Premier League for 22 years. \n\"I know today is a big setback and it hurts, but I know the players and supporters and everyone are going to muster up the energy to compete as well as we can in the last few games.\" \nThis video can not be played\nIpswich \u2018sad\u2019 as relegation looms \u2013 McKenna",

        "article_text": "It may be that zoo animals are so well cared for they develop allergies as a side effect.\nIn 2018, staff at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago began to notice something unusual about a male polar bear named Siku. He was losing hair, revealing patches of black skin underneath. Evidently itchy, he was scratching and rubbing himself against his enclosure. Kathryn Gamble, the zoo's director of veterinary medicine, had a hunch what was wrong: allergies.\nBut what would a polar bear be allergic to? Gamble and her colleagues anaesthetized Siku and conducted a skin test, injecting small amounts of various allergy-provoking substances into his skin. Siku's skin reacted against house mites, as well as elm, mulberry and red cedar pollen. Oddly enough, \"one of the things that he initially showed a very strong response to on his skin was actually human hair dander\", Gamble recalls.\nWe often think that allergies only afflict people, but a broad range of other animals can also develop them. That includes pet dogs and cats \u2013 in which experts say allergies are on the rise \u2013 but also everything from rhinoceroses, bats, dolphins to chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys. Lincoln Park Zoo staff say they have seen allergy-afflicted black leopards, fennec foxes, saki monkeys, Japanese macaques and black bears.\nFortunately for itchy animals living in captivity like Siku, animal allergies are treatable, just like in humans. But these cases may also tell us something deeper about how and why allergies develop.\nScientists speculate that animals get allergies for similar reasons as people in many Western countries \u2013 especially those living in cities \u2013 who are currently experiencing a rise in allergies.\nSome experts blame the fact that pets, as well as farm and zoo animals, are increasingly being raised in manmade environments where they're less exposed to the parasites, microbes and other pathogens that they evolved with, causing their immune system to go awry.\u00a0\n\"In dogs and cats, the numbers definitely have gone up, as the numbers in people have gone up,\" says Annette Petersen, a veterinary dermatologist at Michigan State University. \"I wouldn't be surprised if more zoo animals [are getting] allergies too,\" she adds \u2013 although no research has yet looked into whether or not this is the case.\u00a0\u00a0\nAllergy symptoms can vary across animals. Humans and other primates that inhale allergy-causing substances through the nose often develop hay fever-type symptoms, with discharge, sneezing and weepy eyes. But most animals absorb allergy-provoking substances through the skin and develop skin conditions, says Andrew Rosenberg, a veterinary dermatologist and director of medical operations at the Animal Dermatology Group, a US-based veterinary company.\nThe cats Rosenberg sees will often scratch their face and neck, tear out hair, or develop pink plaques or crusted pimples on their bodies. Allergic dogs will lick itchy paws and scratch at armpits and groin areas \u2013 and tend to develop ear infections. Horses can break out in hives. Occasionally, Rosenberg also sees allergic zoo animals \u2013 like the itchy female rhinoceros and her calf from New York's Bronx Zoo that developed severe rashes, bloody ulcerations and weeping infections.\u00a0 \u00a0\nPut simply, allergies occur when the immune system \u2013 which is supposed to protect us from harmful parasites, bacteria or viruses \u2013 mistakenly produces an exaggerated response to harmless substances, like peanuts or pollen.\nIt's unclear what exactly is causing the current rise in allergies among people. While some experts used to solely blame the fact that humans are increasingly growing up in cleaner, more hygienic environments where they're less exposed to microbes than in the wild, research is now pointing to a wider set of factors that also involves the loss of important microbes and parasites that live in and on our bodies, says Andrea Graham, a parasitologist at Princeton University.\nFrequent cleaning and soaps likely contributes to our reduced exposure to these organisms, alongside the use of antibiotic drugs and ointments, greater distancing from domesticated animals and parasite-free food, Graham says. (People can take some steps to help reduce the likelihood of allergies, however \u2013 read more about\u00a0the habits that help prevent allergies here).\nThe loss of certain parasites and microbes in our guts may be particularly consequential; scientists believe that these used to play an important role in our biology by suppressing and modulating our immune system in order to avoid being attacked by it, says Graham. Now, without these organisms to rein in and train our immune response, our immune system is more likely to go into overdrive, including against harmless pathogens, she adds.\nScientists also believe that early childhood exposure to microbes and parasites is especially important for training the immune system to correctly discriminate between harmful and harmless substances and mount an appropriate response. \"Early life is really important for getting the tuning of your immune system right,\" Graham says.\nSome of the best evidence for this theory comes from studies of Amish populations in the US. One 2016 study compared Amish children in Indiana state, who use traditional farming practices and are exposed to lots of microbes through interactions with farm animals and house dust, with children from Hutterite communities in South Dakota, who use highly industrialised farming practices and live in households less exposed to dust and animals. Though both populations were genetically very similar, \"the rate of allergies was about four times higher in the Hutterites who had taken on modern industrial farming\", says Andrew Flies, an immunologist at the University of Tasmania's Menzies Institute for Medical Research.\nFlies, Petersen, Graham and Rosenberg all suspect that animals kept in households, farms and zoos might develop allergies for similar reasons. They typically get dewormed and vaccinated to prevent infections, and are generally less exposed to the bacteria and parasites they evolved with compared to their relatives in the wild, Graham says.\nFor zoo animals, Petersen says, \"the food they're eating is parasite-free and probably not heavily bacterially contaminated\". Compare that to a bacteria-smothered cadaver a lion would eat in the Serengeti, probably together with the prey's microbe- and parasite-containing guts.\u00a0\nIn other words, it may be that animals are so well cared for in zoos they develop allergies as a side effect.\nWhile no-one has yet published a specific study looking into this, Flies and others suspect that allergies are much more common in these more human environments than in the wilderness. In the wild, allergies might affect the survival of animals \u2013 for instance if allergic animals scratch themselves and develop infections, Flies says. Petersen recalls a lion with allergies she once treated who had developed a bad ear infection. \"If he can't hear well in the wild \u2013 if the ears are plugged with pus and stuff from the infection \u2013 that would obviously be a major disadvantage,\" she says. For these reasons, allergies may have disappeared from wild populations.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut that theory is tough to prove. Animals in the wild may well have allergies, Gamble says \u2013 but we would be less likely to spot them.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat may have contributed to Siku's allergies, Gamble adds, is the fact that he had been moved to Chicago two years before he started developing them. Often, \"if a person moves to a new environment where they're exposed to pollens that their bodies have never seen before, they have a response to it,\" she says.\nOther factors may also be contributing to allergies in animals. Rosenberg says that in his clinic in the northeastern US, where he's seen rising cases of pet allergies, this may be linked to climate change, which is causing higher pollen counts and longer allergy seasons. \"It's my impression that we're seeing more common allergies and we're seeing more severe allergies than ever before,\" he says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why we may soon need to eat 'resurrection' plants\n\u2022 Elephants hate bees \u2013 here's why that's good news for Kenyan farmers\n\u2022 Mud, water and wood: The system that kept a 1604-year-old city afloat\nAs awareness around animal allergies is growing, so is knowledge on how to treat them. Rosenberg was able to treat the allergic rhinoceroses with an approach similar to allergy shots in people, injecting them with small doses of the allergy-provoking substances and gradually dialling up the dose to teach their immune systems that they don't represent a threat and to lessen their response.\nSiku the polar bear received a similar treatment, receiving a combination of allergy-provoking substances mixed into organic honey \u2013 the licking of which helped the substances get absorbed through the soft tissues in his mouth. Honey has the added benefit of containing some local pollen itself, Gamble adds. And sure enough, during another allergy test 36 months after the treatment, Siku was much less reactive to the substances he had previously been allergic to \u2013 including human hair dander.\u00a0 \u00a0\nFor a long time, studies of animals have been used to better understand health conditions in people, but allergies are a rare case where lessons learned in humans may help animals, Flies says.\nOne lesson is the value of being exposed to a rich community of microorganisms. As many people turn to yoghurts and other probiotics for their health benefits, including a reduction in allergies, perhaps researchers can find ways to do the same for zoo animals, farm animals and pets at risk of developing allergies, says Graham.\n\"I'm hopeful that more and more people will study it because I do think we're still battling against this idea that 'clean' is always healthier.\"\n--\u00a0\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "The bacteria and fungi living on your skin play a surprising role in keeping us healthy. Is it possible to give them a boost?\nScratch the surface of the skin, and you'll find a bustling community of bacteria living there. This is a good thing, as research increasingly shows that having the \"right kind\" of microbes can help keep our skin young, supple, and smooth for longer. Simply by being there, \"good bacteria\" protect us from infection from pathogenic, harmful microbes. They also help to repair wounds and may even counteract some of the harmful effects of UV rays.\u00a0\nAll-the-more reason to look after our skin microbiome. But how do we do this? One method that has become increasingly popular is the use of topical skin probiotics \u2013 which technically means applying live microorganisms to the skin to improve its health.\nAs far back as 1912, scientists were rubbing bacteria into people's faces in an attempt to improve conditions such as acne and seborrhea \u2013 a common form of dermatitis that causes a red, itchy rash and white or yellow scales.\nToday there are dozens of skincare companies selling what they describe as probiotic products, from serums to cleansers and moisturisers. In each case, the balms offer to rebalance the delicate skin microbiome, leaving it \"renewed\" and \"refreshed\".\nBut while skincare products often claim to be \"probiotic\", very few, if any, actually contain live bacteria.\nWhat's more, as probiotic skin treatments are classed as \"cosmetics\" and not medicines, their manufacturers don't have to share the results of any trials that have been conducted on their products, so it's difficult to know how effective they are.\u00a0\n\"The rules around skin care products are very different to the rules around drugs, so claims can be made with less rigorous testing than would be made for a pharmaceutical agent,\" says Richard Gallo, a dermatologist at UC San Diego School of Medicine.\nMost \"probiotic\" skincare products contain either prebiotics \u2013 nutrients that feed and encourage the growth of good bacteria on the skin, or postbiotics \u2013 proteins or other products made by beneficial bacteria.\n\"What we are seeing more and more are approaches that try to influence the microbiome,\" says Bernhard Paetzold, co-founder and chief scientific officer of\u00a0S-Biomedic, a company that aims to treat conditions by restoring the skin's microbiome through bacterial \"transplants\".\nAccording to Paetzold, the main reason for this is that live bacteria are extremely difficult to keep alive throughout the manufacturing, storing and distribution process. Once on the skin there's no guarantee that they'll even take hold, as they must fight to compete with the millions of other microbes already living there.\nThe idea of promoting a healthy skin microbiome is rooted in the theory that bacteria and fungi living on the outside of our body help to protect us from those that might do us harm.\nYet the science behind how certain \"bad\" bacteria can contribute to skin diseases isn't yet fully understood. What we do know is that people with eczema, rosacea, acne and psoriasis all have different types or levels of certain bacteria living on their skin.\n\"What exists at the moment is a lot of papers showing that nearly every skin disease imaginable is associated with a shift in the skin microbiome,\" says Paetzold. \"But this observation just shows an association. It doesn't say that the shift in the microbiome causes that disease. It could also be that the disease changes the skin environment, and that's why the bacterial population changes.\"\nTo prove that a particular strain of bacteria is causing a disease, you would need to either give a healthy person that skin disease by slathering the \"bad bacteria\" on their face, or cure their disease by applying \"good\" bacteria. While the first option is likely to encounter ethical barriers, there are a few researchers attempting the latter.\nThe limited clinical trials that have been published, however, do show promising results. Most focus on using live bacteria to treat eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis. They are based on the findings that the skin of people with eczema is dominated by Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium that can often be pathogenic.\n\"One of the big problems in the skin for diseases like eczema, is that certain pathogenic bacteria like S. aureus live on the surface of the skin and cause rashes, cause disease, and cause infection,\" says Gallo, whose own research group has been searching for ways of harnessing the skin microbiome to fight off the harmful bacteria found thriving on eczema patients. \"We mined the bacteria types that usually live on healthy skin looking for bacteria that could produce things that would fight off those bad bacteria\".\nGallo's are focusing on Staphylococcus hominis, a naturally occurring skin bacterium which is present in 21% of healthy people, but only 1% of atopic dermatitis patients.\n\"Our skin provides commensal bacteria like S. hominis with a safe place to live, so some of them have evolved a way of protecting their environment from these bad bacteria that are trying to invade,\" says Gallo.\nIn the case of S. hominis, the bacterium produces anti-microbial peptides \u2013 small fragments of protein \u2013 which directly kill S. aureus. They also produce chemicals called \"autoinducing peptides\", which stop bacterial cells from communicating with one another. Some bacteria like S. aureus signal to one another when their population density reaches a certain level \u2013 a mechanism known as quorum sensing \u2013 triggering the secretion of toxins that can cause skin inflammation. Disrupting that communication can prevent the toxins from being released.\nIn 2021, Gallo's team conducted a phase one randomised controlled trial with 54 adults with atopic dermatitis by applying a cream containing live S. hominis over the course of one week. The results showed that treatment with S. hominis dramatically reduced S. aureus\u00a0colonisation, and even decreased the redness and itch associated with atopic dermatitis in a subgroup of patients compared to a control group given a placebo cream.\nThe findings suggest that using special formulations of living bacteria could well help to make the skin's microbiome healthier. But more work needs to be done to prove its effectiveness before it can be used as a treatment. The team are now recruiting for a phase two randomised trial which will assess the efficacy of the treatment over a longer 14 week timescale.\u00a0\nElsewhere, other researchers have also had success treating eczema with probiotics. In one 2003 clinical trial, 11 patients with atopic dermatitis were given a cream containing the bacterium\u00a0Streptococcus thermophiles, which they applied for two weeks. The results showed\u00a0that the cream enhanced the skin's production of ceramides \u2013 lipids that help to keep the skin hydrated and maintain it as a healthy barrier.\u00a0\nMore recently, in 2018 10 adults and five children with atopic dermatitis were given a \"microbiome transplant\", where live Roseomonas mucosa bacteria collected from the skin of healthy volunteers was then applied to the skin of the patients twice a week. After 16 weeks, the treatment improved their symptoms by more than 50%.\nAlthough clinical trials focusing on other skin conditions are somewhat rarer, they also show promising results. Acne, for example, is linked to colonisation by the bacterium Cutibacterium acnes. Some researchers are therefore looking for bacteria that produce antimicrobial peptides to inhibit or kill this bacterium. In one clinical trial, a lotion containing\u00a0the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis\u00a0was given to patients suffering from severe acne. The lotion significantly reduced pustules compared to a placebo lotion.\nPaetzold and his company S-Biomedic, meanwhile, published a clinical trial in 2019 where they gave patients with acne a cream containing specific strains of Cutibacterium acnes. The results showedsome reduction in acne.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why a workout is good for your gut bacteria\n\u2022 The surprising benefits of the microbes living on your skin\n\u2022 How gut bacteria are controlling your brain\nGallo is also researching whether a strain of Staphylococcus capitis bacteria could be an effective acne treatment, with studies in animals showing promising results.\u00a0\n\"The basic mechanism of action is very straightforward. It just inhibits the C. acnes growth, much in the same way that topical antibiotics or oral antibiotics are used to treat acne,\" says Gallo.\u00a0\nUnlike topical antibiotics, however, the treatment specifically targets C. acnes, so the wider skin microbiome is left unharmed, he says.\nGallo's team has even found a specific strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria that produce molecules that may inhibit the development of sun induced skin cancer.\n\"It generates a small molecule that inhibits DNA synthesis in transformed or mutagenic skin cells,\" says Gallo. \"We've found in \nanimal models\n that if these bacteria are present on the surface of mice that undergo UV radiation damage, they get far fewer skin tumours than mice that have the same species of bacteria, but not the genes [in the bacteria] that make this anti-metabolite.\"\nOf course, such a treatment will have to go through much more testing and clinical trials before it can be shown to have a similar effect in humans.\nWhile most studies have looked at treating specific diseases with probiotics, there are also a few that have examined whether pre- or postbiotics could improve skin health generally. For example, some researchers are looking at whether inulin \u2013 a dietary fibre frequently found in cosmetics and personal care products \u2013 could serve as a prebiotic when taken as an oral supplement or applied topically to the skin. Preliminary results suggest that inulin makes the skin more smooth and supple, providing a more favourable environment for beneficial bacteria to thrive. Other studies have shown that slapping on sphingomyelinase, an\u00a0enzyme produced by bacteria such as Staphylococcus thermophilus \u2013 which are commonly found in fermented milk products and yogurt \u2013 can boost production of ceramides, which are needed to keep the skin healthy.\nHowever in all cases, large randomised double blind clinical trials \u2013 the gold standard of medical research \u2013 are needed to confirm whether any of these creams are effective.\u00a0\nFor example a recent review study examined all of the data from clinical trials conducted to date and concluded that while \"oral and topical probiotics appear to be effective for the treatment of certain inflammatory skin diseases and demonstrate a promising role in wound healing and skin cancer, more studies are needed to confirm these results\".\u00a0\nGallo agrees that more work is needed but is hopeful about the future of the field.\n\"It's moving in the right direction,\" he says. \"We've come to realise as a field that we need to understand what exactly they're doing, and there's a lot of efforts being put into that, as well as other ways to design microbes to help benefit us. So I'm very optimistic about where we'll be in a few years with probiotics.\"\nHowever for people who don't have a skin disease, but who might want to increase the smoothness of their skin, prevent wrinkles, or boost hydration levels, there is little evidence that probiotic creams readily available in shops will have any benefit.\n\"I think many of the probiotics on the market now don't have very strong evidence behind them, so I wouldn't recommend those necessarily,\" says Gallo. \"You can try them \u2013 but it might not be the best use of your money.\"\nWhile your skin microbiome changes as you age and encounter different environments, there are a few things you can do to help your skin's natural microbiome flourish.\n\"It's a two-way street, because the types of things that we're already doing to moisturise our skin or protect the skin from UV damage are creating an environment that's more hospitable for these beneficial organisms to live in,\" says Gallo.\n\"So normal skin care, appropriate moisturising and cleansing \u2013 all of those things will promote skin health.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "It may be that zoo animals are so well cared for they develop allergies as a side effect.\nIn 2018, staff at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago began to notice something unusual about a male polar bear named Siku. He was losing hair, revealing patches of black skin underneath. Evidently itchy, he was scratching and rubbing himself against his enclosure. Kathryn Gamble, the zoo's director of veterinary medicine, had a hunch what was wrong: allergies.\nBut what would a polar bear be allergic to? Gamble and her colleagues anaesthetized Siku and conducted a skin test, injecting small amounts of various allergy-provoking substances into his skin. Siku's skin reacted against house mites, as well as elm, mulberry and red cedar pollen. Oddly enough, \"one of the things that he initially showed a very strong response to on his skin was actually human hair dander\", Gamble recalls.\nWe often think that allergies only afflict people, but a broad range of other animals can also develop them. That includes pet dogs and cats \u2013 in which experts say allergies are on the rise \u2013 but also everything from rhinoceroses, bats, dolphins to chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys. Lincoln Park Zoo staff say they have seen allergy-afflicted black leopards, fennec foxes, saki monkeys, Japanese macaques and black bears.\nFortunately for itchy animals living in captivity like Siku, animal allergies are treatable, just like in humans. But these cases may also tell us something deeper about how and why allergies develop.\nScientists speculate that animals get allergies for similar reasons as people in many Western countries \u2013 especially those living in cities \u2013 who are currently experiencing a rise in allergies.\nSome experts blame the fact that pets, as well as farm and zoo animals, are increasingly being raised in manmade environments where they're less exposed to the parasites, microbes and other pathogens that they evolved with, causing their immune system to go awry.\u00a0\n\"In dogs and cats, the numbers definitely have gone up, as the numbers in people have gone up,\" says Annette Petersen, a veterinary dermatologist at Michigan State University. \"I wouldn't be surprised if more zoo animals [are getting] allergies too,\" she adds \u2013 although no research has yet looked into whether or not this is the case.\u00a0\u00a0\nAllergy symptoms can vary across animals. Humans and other primates that inhale allergy-causing substances through the nose often develop hay fever-type symptoms, with discharge, sneezing and weepy eyes. But most animals absorb allergy-provoking substances through the skin and develop skin conditions, says Andrew Rosenberg, a veterinary dermatologist and director of medical operations at the Animal Dermatology Group, a US-based veterinary company.\nThe cats Rosenberg sees will often scratch their face and neck, tear out hair, or develop pink plaques or crusted pimples on their bodies. Allergic dogs will lick itchy paws and scratch at armpits and groin areas \u2013 and tend to develop ear infections. Horses can break out in hives. Occasionally, Rosenberg also sees allergic zoo animals \u2013 like the itchy female rhinoceros and her calf from New York's Bronx Zoo that developed severe rashes, bloody ulcerations and weeping infections.\u00a0 \u00a0\nPut simply, allergies occur when the immune system \u2013 which is supposed to protect us from harmful parasites, bacteria or viruses \u2013 mistakenly produces an exaggerated response to harmless substances, like peanuts or pollen.\nIt's unclear what exactly is causing the current rise in allergies among people. While some experts used to solely blame the fact that humans are increasingly growing up in cleaner, more hygienic environments where they're less exposed to microbes than in the wild, research is now pointing to a wider set of factors that also involves the loss of important microbes and parasites that live in and on our bodies, says Andrea Graham, a parasitologist at Princeton University.\nFrequent cleaning and soaps likely contributes to our reduced exposure to these organisms, alongside the use of antibiotic drugs and ointments, greater distancing from domesticated animals and parasite-free food, Graham says. (People can take some steps to help reduce the likelihood of allergies, however \u2013 read more about\u00a0the habits that help prevent allergies here).\nThe loss of certain parasites and microbes in our guts may be particularly consequential; scientists believe that these used to play an important role in our biology by suppressing and modulating our immune system in order to avoid being attacked by it, says Graham. Now, without these organisms to rein in and train our immune response, our immune system is more likely to go into overdrive, including against harmless pathogens, she adds.\nScientists also believe that early childhood exposure to microbes and parasites is especially important for training the immune system to correctly discriminate between harmful and harmless substances and mount an appropriate response. \"Early life is really important for getting the tuning of your immune system right,\" Graham says.\nSome of the best evidence for this theory comes from studies of Amish populations in the US. One 2016 study compared Amish children in Indiana state, who use traditional farming practices and are exposed to lots of microbes through interactions with farm animals and house dust, with children from Hutterite communities in South Dakota, who use highly industrialised farming practices and live in households less exposed to dust and animals. Though both populations were genetically very similar, \"the rate of allergies was about four times higher in the Hutterites who had taken on modern industrial farming\", says Andrew Flies, an immunologist at the University of Tasmania's Menzies Institute for Medical Research.\nFlies, Petersen, Graham and Rosenberg all suspect that animals kept in households, farms and zoos might develop allergies for similar reasons. They typically get dewormed and vaccinated to prevent infections, and are generally less exposed to the bacteria and parasites they evolved with compared to their relatives in the wild, Graham says.\nFor zoo animals, Petersen says, \"the food they're eating is parasite-free and probably not heavily bacterially contaminated\". Compare that to a bacteria-smothered cadaver a lion would eat in the Serengeti, probably together with the prey's microbe- and parasite-containing guts.\u00a0\nIn other words, it may be that animals are so well cared for in zoos they develop allergies as a side effect.\nWhile no-one has yet published a specific study looking into this, Flies and others suspect that allergies are much more common in these more human environments than in the wilderness. In the wild, allergies might affect the survival of animals \u2013 for instance if allergic animals scratch themselves and develop infections, Flies says. Petersen recalls a lion with allergies she once treated who had developed a bad ear infection. \"If he can't hear well in the wild \u2013 if the ears are plugged with pus and stuff from the infection \u2013 that would obviously be a major disadvantage,\" she says. For these reasons, allergies may have disappeared from wild populations.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut that theory is tough to prove. Animals in the wild may well have allergies, Gamble says \u2013 but we would be less likely to spot them.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat may have contributed to Siku's allergies, Gamble adds, is the fact that he had been moved to Chicago two years before he started developing them. Often, \"if a person moves to a new environment where they're exposed to pollens that their bodies have never seen before, they have a response to it,\" she says.\nOther factors may also be contributing to allergies in animals. Rosenberg says that in his clinic in the northeastern US, where he's seen rising cases of pet allergies, this may be linked to climate change, which is causing higher pollen counts and longer allergy seasons. \"It's my impression that we're seeing more common allergies and we're seeing more severe allergies than ever before,\" he says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why we may soon need to eat 'resurrection' plants\n\u2022 Elephants hate bees \u2013 here's why that's good news for Kenyan farmers\n\u2022 Mud, water and wood: The system that kept a 1604-year-old city afloat\nAs awareness around animal allergies is growing, so is knowledge on how to treat them. Rosenberg was able to treat the allergic rhinoceroses with an approach similar to allergy shots in people, injecting them with small doses of the allergy-provoking substances and gradually dialling up the dose to teach their immune systems that they don't represent a threat and to lessen their response.\nSiku the polar bear received a similar treatment, receiving a combination of allergy-provoking substances mixed into organic honey \u2013 the licking of which helped the substances get absorbed through the soft tissues in his mouth. Honey has the added benefit of containing some local pollen itself, Gamble adds. And sure enough, during another allergy test 36 months after the treatment, Siku was much less reactive to the substances he had previously been allergic to \u2013 including human hair dander.\u00a0 \u00a0\nFor a long time, studies of animals have been used to better understand health conditions in people, but allergies are a rare case where lessons learned in humans may help animals, Flies says.\nOne lesson is the value of being exposed to a rich community of microorganisms. As many people turn to yoghurts and other probiotics for their health benefits, including a reduction in allergies, perhaps researchers can find ways to do the same for zoo animals, farm animals and pets at risk of developing allergies, says Graham.\n\"I'm hopeful that more and more people will study it because I do think we're still battling against this idea that 'clean' is always healthier.\"\n--\u00a0\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Yoon Suk Yeol, who was officially removed from office on Friday, follows a line of former South Korean leaders who have had their reputations marred or terms interrupted by scandal. \nAmong them are presidents who have faced indictment, exile and imprisonment.\nYoon, who was South Korea's public prosecutor, in fact led a probe that landed former president Park Geun-hye in prison. \nNow apart from being impeached, Yoon is also being investigated for treason over his botched martial law attempt last December. Some analysts believe that, ironically, the move was driven by his fear of prosecution. \nHere is a list of former South Korean presidents whose political careers ended dramatically.\nBefore he became South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee spent some three decades as a pro-independence activist against Japanese rule. \nBut his presidency was polarising. \nWhile some respect him for having laid the foundations for a modern country after World War Two, critics condemn his authoritarian streak. Shortly after his inauguration in 1948, he implemented laws to curtail political dissent; he has also been blamed for the killing of civilians during the Korean War. \nThe opposition rejected Rhee's re-election in 1960 and accused him of rigging the vote. This escalated into violent student-led protests, which saw some demonstrators shot dead by police, and ultimately forced Rhee to resign. \nRhee left the country for Hawaii in May that year, where he died in 1965.\nBorn to a poor rural family in the early years of the Japanese occupation, Park Chung-hee joined the military and was posted to Manchuria (a historical region of north-eastern China) where he served until the Japanese surrendered.\nPark led a coup in 1961 to overthrow Rhee's successor, Chang Myon, and later became president. Park led the country for 18 years through a period of rapid economic development known as the \"miracle on the Han river\". It was during this time that the government opened doors to foreign investment, while also helping to develop now-famous conglomerates like Hyundai, LG and Samsung.\nHowever, he moved towards greater authoritarianism later in his term. In 1972, he suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly and made himself \"president for life\". \nDespite Park's economic achievements, South Korea in the 1970s was rocked by growing protests against his iron-fisted rule, where dissenters were brutally punished.\nPark was assassinated at a dinner party in October 1979 by his own spy chief and lifelong friend Kim Jae-kyu. \nMilitary commander Chun Doo-hwan gained power in 1980 after yet another coup. He presided over a brutal military crackdown in the south-western city of Gwangju, which at the time was the centre of an uprising against martial law in South Korea. More than 200 pro-democracy demonstrators were either killed or disappeared.\nDuring Chun's term, the country saw growth rates hovering around 10% each year. However, he is mostly remembered as a dictator who was unapologetic till the end. \nIn 1983, Chun survived an assassination attempt orchestrated by North Korea forces, who bombed a ceremony he was at during a state visit to Myanmar. The attack killed 21 people and injured dozens more. \nIn 1988, Chun picked his coup comrade Roh Tae-woo, also a former general, as his successor. \nThe pair were convicted in 1996 of corruption, as well as their roles in the coup and the Gwangju massacre. Defending the coup while on trial, Chun said he \"would take the same action, if the same situation arose\". \nChun was handed a death sentence - which was later commuted to life imprisonment - while Roh was sentenced to 17 years in jail. Both men were pardoned in 1997 after serving just two years in prison.\nBorn to a poor family, Roh Moo-hyun educated himself and passed the bar exam to become a lawyer without having attended law school. He was appointed a judge in 1977 but later left the bench to become a human rights lawyer, where he advocated for student activists accused of being pro-communist.\nIn 2002, Roh won the presidential election as an underdog, with early polls giving him just 2% of the vote. He tried to shape South Korea as a \"middle power\" among other stakeholders in the region, and championed a so-called sunshine policy of engaging North Korea with trade and aid shipments. \nAfter leaving office in 2007, he returned to his hometown in the south-east and ran a duck farm. However, he took his own life 14 months later, as corruption investigators closed in over allegations he accepted $6m in bribes.\nPublic opinion on Roh improved considerably after his death. Polls by Gallup Korea have consistently ranked him the most beloved president in the country's history.\nFormer Hyundai CEO Lee Myung-bak entered politics in 1992 and was elected mayor of Seoul a decade later. He won the election by a landslide in 2007, even though a business scandal from his days at the automobile conglomerate resurfaced in the days leading up to the vote.\nLee led the country through the global financial crisis and won its bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics. His term ended in 2013, and he was succeeded by the country's first female president Park Geun-hye, who is the daughter of assassinated former leader Park Chung-hee. \nThe younger Park drew on her father's reputation as the man who pulled South Korea out of poverty. However, a corruption scandal involving a confidante, Choi Soon-sil - the daughter of a Shamanistic cult leader - led to her impeachment in 2016 and arrest a year later.\nFive years after leaving office, Lee too was charged with bribery and later found guilty of creating slush funds of tens of millions of dollars, and taking bribes from various sources, including Samsung. \nPark was handed a 22-year sentence and Lee 15 years, but both have since been pardoned.

        "article_text": "Ben McKinney has scored 634 runs at an average of 37.29 in 11 first-class matches\nBen McKinney has already had a brush with celebrity.\nDuring series one of Netflix's fly-on-the-wall documentary Sunderland 'Til I Die, he is shown celebrating a rare goal in a season most Black Cats supporters would rather forget.\n\"I got a message from one of my schoolmates saying they had seen me,\" McKinney tells BBC Sport.\n\"It summed the season up that it was just me and my dad because no-one else wanted to come any more.\"\nSix years on, 20-year-old McKinney looks ready start his own journey, one he hopes will have a happier ending.\nHaving made his debut for Durham aged 18 in 2023 and scored his first first-class hundred a year later, the opening batter was already seen as someone with a big future.\nScoring 110 runs from 110 balls for England Lions this winter against an Australia A side featuring six full internationals confirmed it.\n\"It was pretty surreal,\" McKinney says. \"In the moment you are just doing it off instinct.\n\"It is good, coming up against good players, to know you are worthy of playing at the standard.\"\nAnderson not ruling out playing for three more years\nStokes to miss early rounds of Championship season\nEngland's hierarchy have shown they are not afraid of giving inexperienced youngsters a chance and they are known to like what they see in McKinney.\nFormer spinner Graeme Swann, part of the Lions set-up with McKinney in Australia, said the left-hander could \"easily walk into Test cricket now\", comparing him to New Zealand great Stephen Fleming.\nHe is a former England Under-19 captain, stands at 6ft 7in and falls into the Bazball mould as an aggressive batter.\nIt leaves those in the know thinking McKinney could follow where Jacob Bethell, Shoaib Bashir and Josh Hull have gone before in being given an early international bow.\n\"You say it's a bit of pressure but you would rather that than no-one speaking about you, wouldn't you?\" McKinney says.\n\"Runs are your currency. I will just keep doing what I am doing and hopefully get opportunities.\"\nMcKinney's height is now seen as an advantage, giving him the ability to attack lengths others would have to leave or defend, but it was not always this way.\nA talented footballer, he played for both Durham and Sunderland's academy as a teenager, having joined the Black Cats' ranks aged \"six or seven\".\n\"I was a centre-mid but I was getting a bit too tall for it,\" he says. \"I probably would have been a centre-back by now.\n\"I was always OK but didn't really enjoy it.\"\nMcKinney committed to cricket at the age of 16 \u2013 given confidence by Durham's production line which has overseen the development of Ben Stokes, Mark Wood, Paul Collingwood and Steve Harmison among others.\n\"I remember a phone call my dad had with [Durham's academy manager] John Windows,\" McKinney says.\n\"It went something like 'we have never let a lad fail from where he is now'.\n\"That was a massive confidence boost when you are 15 or 16 years old. That tipped me over the edge. My love was always cricket.\"\nThat love was first formed at Seaham Harbour Cricket Club, where his father Neil was one of the area's leading club cricketers. McKinney Sr also spent hours throwing to his son in the nets.\n\"He was relentless and wouldn't let me leave,\" McKinney says.\n\"Sometimes that might be bad but it definitely set me up for the future. It is amazing to have someone who cares for your success and you improving.\"\nDespite the promise, there has been no contact between McKinney and the England set-up, other than what he has been able to glean from having England skipper Stokes alongside him in the Durham dressing room.\n\"How he practises is something I have never seen before,\" McKinney says. \"He is so particular and there is always purpose.\"\nThe opportunities given to McKinney are no coincidence, however.\nHe was picked to open when warm-up opposition were provided to West Indies and Sri Lanka last summer and returned scores of 22, 46 and 20.\nHe also toured Australia with England Under-19s in 2023 - another relevant point with an Ashes series to come this winter - and hit 12 fours in a 45-ball 70 in England's victory in Brisbane, hinting at a keenness to follow the Bazball mantra from the start.\n\"It's actually the opposite,\" he says. \"My dad is very old fashioned. I used to bat 50 overs for 80. \n\"I used to love batting for time but somehow that flicked a switch, probably at a good time.\n\"There was a period I was probably going too hard but trying to find that balance of soaking up pressure and putting it back on has been the most important thing for my success this winter.\"\nThose words will be likely be a soothing symphony in the ears of England fans.\nTheir faith in England's approach is wobbling at the worst possible time with only a Test against Zimbabwe from 22 May to come before five against both India and Australia over the seven months that follow.\n\"I would love to play all formats but I go back to being 10 years old and watching Alastair Cook opening the batting,\" McKinney says.\n\"I loved the way he did it. It's not the road I have gone down now but the basics behind it, I will be happy keeping him as my role model.\"\nThere are no vacancies in England's top seven but Zak Crawley's poor form, Jacob Bethell's Indian Premier League commitments and the chance for injuries means nothing can be ruled out at this stage.\nMcKinney will get six County Championship matches to push his case further before Zimbabwe arrive, starting with a trip to Nottinghamshire on Friday.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nWatch \"How to Win the Champions League: Liverpool\" on iPlayer now\nA meeting is about to take place at Liverpool and the subject will be Mohamed Salah.\nOn one side you have those providing data and video evidence that Salah is the right signing. On the other side is former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp.\n\"Jurgen's preferred option for that summer was Julian Brandt, who was a great player,\" said former Liverpool director of research Ian Graham, who spoke to BBC Sport as part of a documentary released on BBC iPlayer about Liverpool's journey to winning the 2018-19 Champions League.\n\"Jurgen had obviously known him very well, coming from the Bundesliga, and knew the German market very well.\n\"We agreed that Brandt was a very good young player but not a standout in the same way that Mo was. From our data analysis point of view Mo was the best young wide forward in Europe, full stop.\n\"Roma were under pressure to sell because their finances were not in a good place, so we knew he was available for a good price.\n\"He played a forward and wide role that we needed to fill at the time, whereas Brandt was more of an attacking midfielder.\"\nGraham added: \"It's to Jurgen's credit that he engaged in that debate in an honest way with his eyes open to say, 'OK, I'm open to be convinced, show me that Mo is better'.\"\nKlopp didn't need much convincing and Liverpool signed Salah from Roma in June 2017 for \u00a334m.\nThe Reds believed the Egypt international would be a \"future superstar\" and so it has proved.\nSalah, who is yet to agree a new contract with Liverpool beyond this summer, has gone on to become a Liverpool legend. \nHe has scored 243 goals and registered 109 assists for the club in 393 appearances and, under Klopp, helped the Reds win the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and Fifa Club World Cup.\nHow to Win the Champions League\nLiverpool\nGraham was a consultant at Tottenham from 2007-2012 but \"they never really had the ambition to make more\" of data whereas he said \"Liverpool were the first team to have an in-house analytics department\".\nHe was at Liverpool from 2012 to 2023 and was a key part of the 'Moneyball' strategy - the statistical method Major League \u00adBaseball side Oakland Athletics used in the 1990s to recruit players - that Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group (FSG) adopted at the club.\n\"Moneyball is really the concept of, 'can we get more value for money out of our squad? Can we get more performance per pound spent? Because, if we can, that means we can compete with clubs with a higher budget than us',\" said Graham.\n\"We started off with about seven or eight different leagues, by the time I left we were probably taking data from about 60 different leagues so that we really understood what players could do on the pitch.\"\nGraham worked under former Liverpool sporting director Michael Edwards, who left the club in 2022 before returning as FSG's chief executive of football in 2024.\nThe pair were part of a transfer committee who, along with Liverpool's manager, would \"come to a consensus decision on the best players to sign\".\nLiverpool had appointed Klopp as manager in October 2015 and his willingness to engage in the use of data in recruitment was in contrast to his predecessor Brendan Rodgers.\n\"Previously, we had robust debates with Brendan about which players to sign and the two differences were our ideas about which players would improve Liverpool were very different to Brendan's ideas,\" said Graham.\n\"Brendan, understandably, put a big premium on Premier League experience whereas we felt those players were quite often overvalued by the market and players from other markets, like Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino, were undervalued.\"\nGraham explained that Rodgers \"came in with a preconception that the player he wanted to sign was the only solution for that position\" and that \"it was very difficult to persuade him otherwise\".\nIn Klopp, Graham said they had found the \"missing piece\" and, in some cases, \"a manager who seemed to see what the data saw\".\nHe added: \"He [Jurgen] is very happy to thank us for our suggestions to have stopped some of the less sensible signings, which at the time caused big arguments but, in retrospect, he could see this was a good process for signing players.\"\nThis video can not be played\nHow Jurgen Klopp almost didn't sign Salah\nKlopp had managed at Mainz and Borussia Dortmund in Germany, winning the Bundesliga in 2011 and 2012 with the latter.\nHis first trophy at Liverpool was the 2019 Champions League, with data playing \"a big part in signing\" nine of the 11 Liverpool players who started the final against Tottenham - in a game the Reds won 2-0.\n\"The club needed it and, from our point of view, the data approach needed it as well,\" said Graham on that piece of silverware.\n\"Looking back, it is a source of pride and is some validation that data can be of help. It adds to recruitment.\n\"Our data analysis means nothing without the scouts to understand the traditional way of viewing a player, without Jurgen to get the best out of the players, without the ownership to trust in the process and without the sporting director to make decisions based on what the data is telling him.\n\"Jurgen's impact on the Champions League win, it can't really be overstated. His presence at the club attracted some really great players, he got the best out of those players and - by the time of that final - we had a world-class first XI that was quite different to the team that he inherited.\"\nKlopp went on to end the club's 30-year wait for a top-flight title by guiding them to the 2019-20 Premier League crown.\nGraham said: \"Jurgen, coming from the German system, was much more happy to take that compromised approach and it worked out really well for Liverpool.\"\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Hungary's government has announced it is withdrawing from the International Criminal Court (ICC).\nThe move was announced by a senior official in Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government hours after Israel's leader Benjamin Netanyahu, who is sought under an ICC arrest warrant, arrived in Hungary for a state visit. \nOrban had invited Netanyahu as soon as the warrant was issued last November, saying the ruling would have \"no effect\" in his country.\nIn November, ICC judges said there were \"reasonable grounds\" that Netanyahu bore \"criminal responsibility\" for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war between Israel and Hamas. Netanyahu has condemned the ICC's decision as \"antisemitic\".\nThe ICC, a global court, has the authority to prosecute those accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\nHungary is a founding member of the ICC, which counts 125 member states, and will be the first European Union nation to pull out of it. A withdrawal has no impact on on-going proceedings. \nThe ICC was a \"respectable initiative\", Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas told Hungarian state-owned news agency MTI, but added it had deviated from its original purpose and become a political body.\nHe said the warrant issued against Netanyahu was unacceptable and that the government did not want to participate in the court's work anymore. Hungary's parliament has never proclaimed the ICC's statute, so it is not part of the country's law, Gulyas added.\nIsrael meanwhile has thanked Orban for its \"clear and strong moral stance alongside Israel,\" Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar wrote on X.\n\"The so-called 'International Criminal Court' lost its moral authority after trampling the fundamental principles of international law in its zest for harming Israel's right to self-defence,\" Sa'ar added.\nHungary's decision aligns with its broader foreign policy stance under Orban, who has cultivated close ties with Israel and adopted a critical view of international institutions perceived as infringing on national sovereignty.\nWhile Hungary's withdrawal may carry symbolic weight and political implications, it does not significantly alter the ICC's operational capacity or legal framework. \nThe court has faced similar challenges in the past and continues to function with broad international support.\nBut Hungary's criticism of the ICC as \"politically biased\" and its decision to withdraw as Netanyahu visits may set a precedent for other nations to question or abandon their commitments to international justice based on political alliances or disagreements with specific rulings.\nThe US, Russia, China and North Korea are among the nations that are not part of the ICC, and therefore do not recognise its jurisdiction.\nIsrael is also not part of the treaty, but the ICC ruled in 2021 that it did have jurisdiction over the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, because the UN's Secretary General had accepted that Palestinians were a member.\nHungary now needs to send written notification to the UN Secretary General to leave the treaty, with the withdrawal taking effect one year later, according to article 127 of the Rome Statute.\nICC spokesman Fad El-Abdullah told the BBC: \"On the visit of Mr Netanyahu, the Court has followed its standard procedures, after the issuance of an arrest warrant. The Court recalls that Hungary remains under a duty to cooperate with the ICC.\"\nSince the warrant was issued, Hungarian authorities should technically arrest Netanyahu and hand him over to the court in the Hague, although member states do not always choose to enforce ICC warrants.\nIn Europe, some ICC member states said they would arrest the Israeli leader if he set foot in their country, while others, such as Germany, announced that he would not be detained if he visited.\nThe White House had said the US rejected the ICC decision and Netanyahu has visited the country since the warrant was issued in November. His visit to Hungary marks Netanyahu's first trip to Europe since then.\nHungarian Defence Minister Kristof Szalay-Bobrovniczky, greeted Netanyahu on the tarmac of Budapest airport on Wednesday night, welcoming him to the country.\nIsrael is appealing against the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant, and strongly rejects the accusations. It both denies the authority of the ICC and the legitimacy of the warrants.\nNetanyahu said at the time that it was a \"dark day in the history of humanity\", and that the ICC had become \"the enemy of humanity\".\n\"It's an antisemitic step that has one goal - to deter me, to deter us from having our natural right to defend ourselves against enemies who try to destroy us,\" he said.\nIn the same ruling, ICC judges also issued a warrant against Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, whom Israel says is dead.\nThe visit comes as Israel announced it was expanding its Gaza offensive and establishing a new military corridor to put pressure on Hamas, as deadly Israeli strikes were reported across the Palestinian territory.\nThe war in Gaza was triggered by the deadly Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed some 1,200 people and led to 251 hostages being taken to Gaza. Since then, more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed, Palestinian health authorities say.",

        "article_text": "Fundamentally wrong, was how Germany's outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, described the new Trump tariffs.\nA unilateral attack - that was the view of Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called them brutal, unfounded and certain to have a \"massive impact\" on the European economy.\nHe convened an emergency meeting with representatives of French businesses most affected by the newly announced 20% tariffs on EU goods sold to the US and issued a call to arms to European business \"not to invest in America for some time until we have clarified things\".\n\"What message would we send by having major European players investing billions of euros in the American economy at a time when [the US] is hitting us?\" he said.\nFor France it's wine, champagne and the aeronautical industry, for Germany it's cars, and for Italy it's luxury goods. It's well known these sectors sell well abroad and now risk being clobbered by US import taxes. \nOverall, the chemicals, machinery and equipment industries in the EU are seen as the most vulnerable to the tariffs.\nBut dig a little deeper and there are other EU sectors, reliant on the US market, that could come as a bit of a surprise. \nFrench cognac, generally dismissed as an old person's tipple in Europe, is the booze of choice for many American rappers, playing a prominent role in the music and lifestyle of stars like Jay-Z, 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg. More than 40% of French brandy is exported to the US.\nSpain exports a lot of gas turbines to the US, alongside tonnes of olive oil.\nWhen we look at which EU countries are most exposed to the US in terms of GDP, the picture is also not quite what you might imagine.\nIreland is highly dependent on the US in terms of goods and services. Those exports - a lot linked to the pharmaceutical industry (which is currently exempt from the 20% tariffs, until the US boosts its own production) and also tech - make up a fifth of Ireland's GDP.\nCyprus, Luxembourg and Malta are more exposed than the EU average in terms of services exports. \nBelgium, the Netherlands and Slovakia are in a similar position when it comes to goods. \nGermany has a greater exposure to the US than the other major EU economies, at over 5% of GDP, followed by Italy (about 4%), France (3%) and Spain (just over 2%). These figures were collated in 2024 by CaixaBank research based on Eurostat figures for the previous year.\nThe response to the new US tariffs is being coordinated at EU HQ in Brussels. The European Commission deals with all overarching trade matters for the bloc's members. \nCommission President Ursula von der Leyen claims they hold \"a lot of cards\", including the strength to negotiate and the power to push back.\nThe US economy is mighty. It makes up 25% of global GDP. \nBut the EU single market of 450 million people (the biggest single market in the world) stands very close in size at 22% of global GDP. \nSo, yes, the EU can bite - hard - as well as bark when it comes to retaliating against Donald Trump's tariffs. Especially if, as EU figures have suggested, the bloc targets US services like Big Tech, possibly including Apple, Meta, Amazon and even Elon Musk's platform X.\nBut that risks a new backlash by the Trump administration. And the EU wants to avoid upping the ante.\nIf you take politics into account, not just economics, the EU has less room for manoeuvre than you might think. \nTake energy supplies, the EU has been buying US liquified natural gas (LNG) after it weaned itself off Russian gas following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \nTricky to reduce or heavily tax those imports. That would badly impact EU consumers, not only US industry, and it would worsen already dismal relations with the US. \nThink of all the recent rows over defence spending and Ukraine. Aside from the economic hell the EU sees and hopes to avoid in the new Trump tariffs, the bloc also really wants to sidestep a trade war with the country that used to be Europe's best friend.\nSo, the Brussels plan is: threaten heavy retaliation, hope Donald Trump is persuaded to negotiate, then pray he'll stage a U-turn on tariffs. \nThe EU's trade commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, says he's speaking to his US counterparts on Friday. It's an opening gambit. The EU is in no rush to retaliate.\nThe Trump administration has ruled out any country negotiating its way out of the new tariffs before they become live this weekend. But after that, what could the EU offer the US president to persuade him to back down?\nTrump is incandescent about the EU's massive trade surplus. It sells far more goods than it buys from the US. The surplus for 2024 was around $200bn (\u20ac180bn; $153bn).\nIt's the other way round when it comes to services - the US sells far more to the EU than the other way round. That is why the EU thinks its main retaliatory leverage against the US would lie in services, like banks and big tech.\nTo redress the goods imbalance, the EU could offer to buy more LNG from the US, or more military equipment, following its pledge to Washington to do more for its own security.\nBut that would break a different EU promise - to boost withering European arms industries by trying to buy EU when re-arming EU countries. It is something the US has already objected to, so that's tricky.\nBrussels could also cut direct and indirect tariffs on US goods. It could lose quotas on US agricultural produce.\nIt would be hugely reluctant to comply with another US ask: to water down its much-trumpeted digital regulations, aimed at limiting monopolies and placing restrictions on speech and content in the EU.\nHow do you price in the possible collapse of the international trading system, EU officials ask.\nEuropean firms fret about their markets being flooded by cheap goods from non-EU countries that are also hit by Trump tariffs and seeking to sell elsewhere. \nThe risk is very real when it comes to China. Trump is slapping more that 50% tariffs on Beijing when you add it all up.\nWould the EU have to ratchet up its import duties on Chinese goods to protect itself and could that lead to an unintended trade war with China?\nThese are anxious and hugely uncertain economic times.\nWhich is why the European Commission says it also wants to focus on matters it can control - if EU capitals agree - and that is reducing internal barriers within the EU single market. \nThose barriers, such as tax regimes, vary from country to country and impact the EU's overall economic growth and competitiveness. \nThe IMF calculates they're equivalent to a 45% tariff on EU manufacturing; 110% when it comes to services.\nThat is far higher than the tariffs now imposed on the EU by Donald Trump. \nEU countries say they're united in combating those. So far they've been divided over completing their own internal market.",

        "article_text": "Last year, on 17 September, at around 15:30, a pager which a nurse called Adam was given at the start of his shift at a hospital in Lebanon received a message. The devices had been distributed by Hezbollah, the Shia Muslim group, to thousands of its members, including Adam, and he said it was how he and his colleagues expected to be alerted of emergencies or a disaster.\n\"The pager started beeping non-stop and, on the screen, it said 'alert',\" Adam, who did not want to use his real name for safety reasons, said. The text appeared to have been sent by the group's leadership. To read it, he had to press two buttons, simultaneously, with both hands. Adam did it many times, but the beeps continued. \"Then suddenly, as I was sitting at my desk,\" he said, \"the pager exploded\".\nOn his phone, Adam showed me a video of the room, filmed by a colleague minutes after he was rescued. There was a trail of blood on the floor. \"I tried to crawl to the door because I had locked it while I changed my clothes,\" he said. The blast had opened a hole in the wood desk. I noticed a beige-like object. \"That's my finger,\" he said.\nHezbollah is known for being a powerful militia and is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US. But in Lebanon, it is also a significant political movement with representation in parliament and a social organisation. Here, being a Hezbollah member does not necessarily mean you are a fighter. In fact, many are not. Adam told me he had never been one. People can work in the group's large array of institutions that include hospitals and emergency services, for example.\nHezbollah had decided to equip members with low-tech pagers for communicating rather than smartphones which it feared could be used by Israel, its arch-enemy, to gather sensitive information about the group. It turned out, though, that the devices which Hezbollah had distributed were part of a years-long elaborate Israeli plan: an explosive compound had been concealed within the pagers, waiting to be activated \u2013 and that is what happened on that day.\nIn the attack, Adam, who is 38, lost his thumb and two fingers on his left hand, and part of a finger on the other. He was blinded in his right eye, which has been replaced with a glass eye, and has only partial sight in the other. He showed me a picture of him in a hospital bed, taken an hour after the explosion, with his face burned, entirely blooded, covered with bandages. Despite his wounds, Adam remained committed to Hezbollah. I asked him how he felt when he looked at himself like that. \"Very good,\" he said in English. Then, in Arabic, he told me: \"Because we believe that the wounds are a kind of medal from God. Honouring what we go through fighting a righteous cause.\"\nBut the group is no longer the force it was since being dealt a devastating blow in Israel's bombing campaign and invasion of Lebanon, which followed the pager attacks, and faces serious challenges. At home, there is discontent among some supporters over the lack of funds for reconstruction, while the new government has vowed to disarm the group. In neighbouring Syria, the ouster of Bashar al-Assad's regime has disrupted the route used by Iran, its main supporter, for the supply of weapons and money.\nI visited communities in southern Lebanon that were destroyed by Israel's attacks, and saw that support for Hezbollah appeared undimmed. But, in views rarely expressed to media, others who backed it said the war had been a mistake, and even questioned the group's future as a military force.\nYou can listen to more from Hugo in his radio documentary - Crossing Continents: Hezbollah in trouble - here\nHezbollah, or Party of God, was created in the 1980s in response to Israel's occupation of Lebanon during the Lebanese civil war. To this day, the destruction of Israel remains one of its official goals. Their last war had been in 2006, which was followed by years of relative calm. Violence flared up again in 2023 after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. When Israel started bombarding Gaza, Hezbollah began firing rockets in around northern Israel, saying it was acting in support of Palestinians. Israel responded with air strikes on southern Lebanon, and tens of thousands of people were forced to flee on both sides of the border.\nThe pager attacks were a turning point in what had been, until then, an intensifying but relatively contained conflict. The devices exploded as people were working, shopping or at home. About a dozen people, including two children, were killed, and thousands wounded, many of them maimed. The attack caused anger in Lebanon, because of what was seen as its indiscriminate nature. A day later, walkie-talkies used by the group suddenly exploded too. I was at a funeral of some of the victims of the pagers when there was a loud blast. Hezbollah members, desperate, asked us to turn off our cameras or phones, as no-one knew what else could explode.\nIn the following weeks, Israel carried out a relentless bombing campaign and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. Across the country, around 4,000 people were killed and almost 18,000 others wounded. For Hezbollah, the conflict proved to be catastrophic. The group's top leaders were assassinated, many of its fighters killed and much of its arsenal destroyed. Among the dead was Hassan Nasrallah, who had been the head of Hezbollah for more than 30 years, assassinated in a massive air strike on the group's secret headquarters under apartment blocks in the Dahieh, where Hezbollah is based in Beirut.\nAt the end of November, battered, the group agreed on a ceasefire that was essentially a surrender.\nSouthern Lebanon is the heartland of Lebanon's Shia Muslim community, which is the bulk of Hezbollah's support base, and one of the regions of the country where the group has traditionally had a significant presence. I travelled to the border town of Kfar Kila, which had a pre-war population of 15,000 and was one of the first to fall when Israel invaded. Israel's stated war goal was to allow the return of residents to its northern communities, which had been emptied because of Hezbollah's attacks. In Kfar Kila, there was almost nothing left standing, and yellow Hezbollah flags dotted the huge piles of broken concrete and twisted metal.\nA 37-year-old woman called Alia had come with her husband and three daughters, aged 18, 14 and 10. The youngest was wearing a badge with a smiley picture of Nasrallah. \"I only knew that this was my house because of the remains of this plant over there, the roses, and this tree,\" Alia told me. From the street, she pointed at what she could identify in the rubble. \"This is the couch. There, the curtains. That was the living room. And that was the bedroom. That's my daughter's bicycle,\" she said. \"There's nothing to recover\".\nAccording to the World Bank, costs related to reconstruction and recovery are estimated at $11bn (\u00a38.5bn) across the country. One of Hezbollah's immediate challenges is to give financial help to people affected by the war, which is crucial to keep supporters on board. Those who lost their houses have received $12,000 to cover for a year's rent. But the group has not promised money to rebuild what was destroyed or to give compensation for destroyed businesses. The limited support is already fuelling discontent. Aila's shop had stock worth $20,000, and she was concerned no-one would cover her losses.\nIran, Hezbollah's backer, is one of the group's main sources of funds, weapons and training. But Lebanon's international allies want to cut off any financial support from Iran, to put even more pressure on Hezbollah, and say there will be no help if the Lebanese government does not act against Hezbollah. With the group weakened militarily, critics see this as a unique opportunity to disarm it.\nAlia told me: \"We don't want any aid that comes with conditions about our arms... We won't allow them to take our dignity, our honour, take away our arms just for us to build a house. We'll build it ourselves.\"\nIt is not surprising that Hezbollah's supporters remain defiant. For many, the group is a fundamental part of their lives, essential in their identities. But Hezbollah's power is seen - and felt - beyond its base. Before the war, its military wing was considered to be stronger than the Lebanese national army. A solid parliamentary bloc means that virtually no major decision has been possible without Hezbollah's consent. Because of Lebanon's fractured political system, the group has representation in the government. In short, Hezbollah has had the ability to paralyse the state, and many times has done so.\nBut the war has diminished the group's domestic position too. In January, the Lebanese parliament elected a new president, former army chief Joseph Aoun, after a two-year impasse that critics had blamed on Hezbollah. In the past, its MPs and allies would walk out of the chamber when a vote was scheduled. But Hezbollah, severely wounded and with its communities in need of help, felt it could no longer block the process, which was seen as vital to unlock some international support. In his inauguration speech, Aoun promised to make the Lebanese army the sole carrier of weapons in the country. He did not mention Hezbollah, but everyone understood the message.\nUltimately, Hezbollah's future may lie with Iran. One of the reasons for Iran to have a strong Hezbollah in Lebanon was to deter any Israeli attack, especially on its nuclear facilities. This is now gone. Other groups backed by Iran in the region, part of what it calls the Axis of Resistance, have also been significantly weakened, including Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen. And the fall of the Assad regime in Syria has interrupted Iran's land corridor to Lebanon - and Hezbollah. Even if Iran decides to rearm Hezbollah, it will not be easy.\nNasrallah has been succeeded by Naim Qassem, his former deputy, who is not seen as charismatic or influential. From time to time, rumours emerge of internal disagreements. And whispers of dissent among the rank and file are spreading. In southern Lebanon, I met a businessman who did not want to have his name published, fearing that he could become a target on social media. On the wall of his office, he had pictures of Hezbollah's leaders. Now, he was critical of the group.\n\"The mistakes have been huge,\" he said. \"Hezbollah decided to engage in a war to support Gaza without proper calculations, without consulting the people or the Lebanese state\". (To date, Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.) He told me a lot of supporters shared his view. \"If Hezbollah don't do a proper reassessment of the situation... they will destroy themselves and harm us along the way. We brought this destruction on ourselves, and we're now suffering\".\nAs part of the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah agreed to remove its weapons and fighters from southern Lebanon, and a Western diplomatic official told me the group had largely done it. Israel was required to withdraw its troops, but has remained in five positions, saying this is needed for the safety of its border communities. The Israeli military has also carried out air strikes on targets and people it says are linked to Hezbollah. Lebanon says the Israeli permanence in Lebanese territory and its attacks are violations of the deal.\nDiscussions about Hezbollah's disarmament are likely to be difficult and long. A source familiar with the group told me one of the options was for Hezbollah's arsenal, believed to still include long-range missiles, to be put under the control of the state, while its fighters, estimated to be several thousand, could be integrated into the Lebanese army.\nThe businessman told me: \"A lot of the families, especially those of wounded and martyred fighters, are totally dependent on Hezbollah. These people won't disengage from Hezbollah immediately\u2026 Without a plan, it would be a recipe for internal conflict. It would drive Lebanese to fight against each other\".\nFor weeks, I tried to interview a representative from Hezbollah, but no-one was made available.\nAdam, the pager casualty, has now returned to his work as a nurse. He no longer does nightshifts, however, as he cannot see well. The explosion also left shrapnel in head and chest. As he gets tired easily, he needs to take constant breaks to rest. Physiotherapy sessions are helping him adapt to using what is left of his left thumb and middle finger.\nProminent in his living room, is a picture he framed, of himself, with his injured hands, holding a pager. He shared with me another picture, of his maimed hand, only now it also bore a tattooed message which expressed that his wounds were a cheap sacrifice in honour of Nasrallah, the late Hezbollah leader. He, like many, still believes in the group's purpose, and the role it plays.",

China, however, dwarfs all of Australia's other trade partners - in 2023-24, A$212.7bn (\u00a3102.2bn, $133.4) was exported to the Asian superpower. \nIn comparison, last year, Australia exported $37.5bn in goods and services to the US. Business services were the biggest sector at $6.2bn, followed by intellectual property charges and beef. In the same year, Australia imported $88.2bn in goods and services from the US.",

        "article_text": "Warning: This article contains details and images that some readers may find distressing\nDriving into Mandalay, the massive scale of the destruction from last Friday's earthquake revealed itself bit by bit.\nIn nearly every street we turned into, especially in the northern and central parts of the city, at least one building had completely collapsed, reduced to a pile of rubble. Some streets had multiple structures which had come down.\nAlmost every building we saw had cracks running through at least one of its walls, unsafe to step into. At the main city hospital they're having to treat patients outdoors.\nMyanmar's military government has said it's not allowing foreign journalists into the country after the quake, so we went in undercover. We had to operate carefully, because the country is riddled with informers and secret police who spy on their own people for the ruling military junta.\nWhat we witnessed was a people who had very little help coming their way in the face of this massive disaster.\n\"I have hope that he's alive, even if it's a small chance,\" said Nan Sin Hein, 41, who's been waiting on the street opposite a collapsed five-storey building, day and night for five days. \nHer 21 year-old-son Sai Han Pha was a construction worker, renovating the interiors of the building, which used to be a hotel and was being turned into an office space.\n\"If they can rescue him today, there's a chance he'll survive,\" she says.\nWhen the 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck, the bottom of the building sank into the ground, its top lurching at an angle over the street, looking like it could tip over at any minute.\nSai Han Pha and four other workers were trapped inside.\nWhen we visited, rescue efforts had not even begun at the building and there was no sign they would start soon. There just isn't enough help available on the ground - and the reason for that is the political situation in the country.\nEven before the earthquake Myanmar was in turmoil - locked in a civil war that has displaced an estimated 3.5 million people. Its military has continued operations against armed insurgent groups despite the disaster.\nThis means that security forces are too stretched to put their full might behind relief and rescue operations. Except in some key locations, we didn't see them in large numbers in Mandalay.\nThe military junta has put out a rare appeal for international aid, but its uneasy relations with many foreign countries, including the UK and the US, has meant that while these countries have pledged aid, help in the form of manpower on the ground is currently only from countries like India, China and Russia, among a few others.\nAnd so far those rescue efforts appear to be focused on structures where masses of people are feared trapped \u2013 the high-rise Sky Villa condominium complex which was home to hundreds of people, and U Hla Thein Buddhist academy where scores of monks were taking an examination when the earthquake struck.\nNeeraj Singh, who is leading the Indian disaster response team working at the Buddhist academy, said the structure had collapsed like a \"pancake\" - one layer on top of another.\n\"It's the most difficult collapse pattern and the chances of finding survivors are very low. But we are still hopeful and trying our best,\" he told the BBC.\nWorking under the sweltering sun, in nearly 40C, rescuers use metal drills and cutters to break the concrete slabs into smaller pieces. It's slow and extremely demanding work. When a crane lifts up the concrete pieces, the stench of decaying bodies, already quite strong, becomes overwhelming.\nThe rescuers spot four to five bodies, but it still takes a couple of hours to pull the first one out.\nSitting on mats under a makeshift tent in the compound of the academy are families of the students. Their faces are weary and despondent. As soon as they hear a body has been recovered, they crowd around the ambulance it is placed in.\nOthers gather around a rescuer who shows them a photo of the body on his mobile phone.\nAgonising moments pass as the families try to see if the dead man is a loved one.\nBut the body is so disfigured, the task is impossible. It is sent to a morgue where forensic tests will have to be conducted to confirm the identity.\nAmong the families is the father of 29-year-old U Thuzana. He has no hope that his son survived. \"Knowing my son ended up like this, I'm inconsolable, I'm filled with grief,\" U Hla Aung said, his face crumpling into a sob.\nMany of Mandalay's historical sites have also suffered significant damage, including the Mandalay Palace and the Maha Muni Pagoda, but we could not get in to see the extent of the damage.\nAccess to everything - collapse sites, victims and their families - was not easy because of the oppressive environment created by the military junta, with people often fearful of speaking to journalists.\nClose to the pagoda, we saw Buddhist funeral rituals being held on the street outside a destroyed house. It was the home of U Hla Aung Khaing and his wife Daw Mamarhtay, both in their sixties.\n\"I lived with them but was out when the earthquake struck. That's why I survived. Both my parents are gone in a single moment,\" their son told us.\nTheir bodies were extricated not by trained rescuers, but by locals who used rudimentary equipment. It took two days to pull out the couple, who were found with their arms around each other.\nMyanmar's military government says 2,886 people have died so far, but so many collapse sites have still not even been reached by the authorities, that that count is unlikely to be accurate. We may never find out what the real death toll of the earthquake was.\nParks and open spaces in Mandalay have turned into makeshift camps, as have the banks of the moat that runs around the palace. All over the city we saw people laying out mats and mattresses outside their homes as evening approached, preferring to sleep outdoors.\nMandalay is a city living in terror, and with good reason. Nearly every night since Friday there have been big aftershocks. We woke up to an aftershock of magnitude 5 in the middle of the night.\nBut tens of thousands are sleeping outdoors because they have no home to return to.\n\"I don't know what to think anymore. My heart still trembles when I think of that moment when the earthquake struck,\" said Daw Khin Saw Myint, 72, who we met while she was waiting in a queue for water, with her little granddaughter by her side. \"We ran out, but my house is gone. I'm living under a tree. Come and see.\"\nShe works as a washerwoman and says her son suffers from a disability which doesn't allow him to work.\n\"Where will I live now? I am in so much trouble. I'm living next to a rubbish dump. Some people have given me rice and a few clothes. We ran out in these clothes we are wearing.\n\"We don't have anyone to rescue us. Please help us,\" she said, tears rolling down her cheeks.\nAnother elderly woman chimes in, eyes tearing up, \"No one has distributed food yet today. So we haven't eaten.\"\nMost of the vehicles we saw pulling up to distribute supplies were small vans with limited stocks - donations from individuals or small local organisations. It's nowhere near enough for the number of people in need, leading to a scramble to grab whatever relief is available.\nParts of Mandalay's main hospital are also damaged, and so in an already difficult situation, rows and rows of beds are laid out in the hospital compound for patients.\nShwe Gy Thun Phyo, 14, has suffered from a brain injury, and has bloodshot eyes. She's conscious but unresponsive. Her father tries to make her as comfortable as possible.\nThere were very few doctors and nurses around to cope with the demand for treatment, which means families are stepping in to do what medical staff should.\nZar Zar has a distended belly because of a serious abdominal injury. Her daughter sits behind her, holding her up, and fans her, to give her some relief from the heat.\nWe couldn't spend a lot of time at the hospital for fear of being apprehended by the police or military.\nAs the window to find survivors of the earthquake narrows, increasingly those being brought into the hospital are the dead.\nNan Sin Hein, who is waiting outside the collapsed building where her son was trapped, was initially stoical, but she now looks like she is preparing to face what seems like the most likely outcome.\n\"I'm heartbroken. My son loved me and his little sisters. He struggled to support us,\" she says.\n\"I am just hoping to see my son's face, even if he is dead. I want to see his body. I want them to do everything they can to find his body.\"",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nSix minutes to come to a clear & obvious decision - Ange on VAR 'lottery'\nTottenham head coach Ange Postecoglou is looking more isolated than ever.\nThe Australian directed a brief clap towards the furious travelling away fans from near the halfway line following his side's 1-0 loss at Chelsea but,  by then, it could be argued the damage had already been done.\nEnzo Fernandez's second-half header was enough to inflict a 16th defeat of the season on Tottenham and leave them 14th in the Premier League - 10 points away from the top 10 - and the signs are growing some fans have had enough.\nChants of \"you don't know what you're doing\" came from the away end after midfielder Lucas Bergvall was replaced by Pape Sarr in the 65th minute. \nRemarkably, Sarr found the net with an excellent long-range strike just four minutes later, leading Postecoglou to cup his ear and turn to the away end, only for VAR to then rule out the goal for a foul on Moises Caicedo. \nWhen asked about the incident after the match, Postecoglou said: \"Jeez mate, it's incredible how things get interpreted. We'd just scored, I just wanted to hear them cheer. Because we'd been through a tough time, and I thought it was a cracking goal. \n\"I wanted them to get really excited. I felt at that point we could potentially go on and win the game. I just felt momentum was on our [side]. It doesn't bother me. It's not the first time they've booed my substitutions or my decisions. That's fine, they're allowed to do that. \n\"But we'd just scored a goal, just scored an equaliser, I was just hoping we could get some excitement. If people want to read into that that somehow I'm trying to make a point about something, like I said, we'd been through a tough time, but I just felt there was a bit of a momentum shift there. \n\"If they get really behind the lads, I thought we had the momentum to finish on top of them.\"\nIt's just the latest in a season of incidents between Postecoglou and sections of the fanbase.\nThere was the recent exchange with an angry supporter after defeat by Fulham just before the international break, another similar back and forth happened after defeat at home to Leicester and he confronted the away end after they criticised players after losing at Bournemouth in December.\nHe added when asked if he was alienating the fans: \"You know what, I am at such a disconnect with the world these days, that who knows? Maybe you're right. I don't know. But that's not what my intention was.\"\nThis just compounds the lack of progress on the pitch, especially with almost a full squad of players available, as Spurs look to avoid their worst season in the Premier League era.\nFormer Spurs midfielder Jamie Redknapp put it plainly when he said on Sky Sports: \"Tottenham were awful. It could have been so much more. Not good enough in any department from Tottenham. Chelsea were so much better.\n\"When Sarr scored, it looked like Ange cupped his ears to say: I know better. There's a disconnect between the two [Tottenham fans and Ange Postecoglou] at the moment. \n\"It's not ideal for the manager. He's got some big games ahead. He's got to keep his head up, got to keep going, working hard and believing in what they do.\"\nHow does Daniel Levy run Tottenham - and would he ever leave?\nPostecoglou hopes Pochettino gets Spurs return\nChelsea boost top-four hopes to pile pressure on Postecoglou\nThis video can not be played\nThe game will be refereed by AI soon - Postecoglou\nPostecoglou is the first Spurs manager to lose his first four matches against Chelsea, while they have fewer points in London derbies this season than any of their neighbours - and the bigger picture offers no solace. \nWith eight games left, Spurs are 14th, and could well finish outside the top 10 for the first time in 17 years. They are now battling to avoid their worst season in the Premier League era.\nTottenham's lowest Premier League finish remains 15th in 1994 under manager Ossie Ardiles - when survival was only ensured in their penultimate match.\nThey have now lost 16 league games this season - their record in a 20-team league is 19, set in 2003-04.\nSince the Premier League's inception in 1992, only six times have Spurs lost 16 or more league matches in a campaign.\nSpurs' lowest points tally in a Premier League season - and in fact since three points for a win was introduced in 1981 - is 44. They need 11 points from their final eight games to pass that tally. \nWith 16 defeats in 30 matches, Spurs' loss percentage this season is 53% - and they haven't lost more than half of their league matches over a whole season since 1934-35. They lost exactly half of their league matches in 1953-94, 1974-75, 1976-77 - when they were relegated - and 2003-04.\nPostecoglou has only won 44 points from his past 39 league matches in charge - stretching back over the end of last season. \nReports suggest Postecoglou is under severe pressure. Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola, Fulham's Marco Silva and Brentford's Thomas Frank have all been linked with his job.\nThe 56-year-old, who became Spurs boss in June 2023 and is contracted to the club until 2027, even suggested in midweek there were plenty of outstanding candidates, external to replace him.\nHowever, Spurs are expected to at least wait until the culmination of the Europa League campaign - a chance not only to win a first trophy in 17 years, but also to qualify for next season's Champions League. They host Eintracht Frankfurt in the first leg of their quarter-final next Thursday.\nA club source indicated before the match that they weren't expecting any managerial changes before the end of the season. \nRedknapp, again speaking to Sky Sports, said after the match: \"I think for Ange Postecoglou, it feels like he's going to make history or be history.\n\"When you lose 16 games in a season as Tottenham manager, still having great players at your disposal, it's not going to wash with the fans. The performances haven't been good enough.\n\"If they can win some silverware, it'll be unbelievable for them.\"\nVice-captain James Maddison, reacting to the fan frustration, said: \"They have every right to be an angry bunch at the moment.\n\"I don't really want to be here talking and I'm sure the fans don't want to listen to me. It can still be a very special season if we lift silverware. We need them as much as they need us, so the message is to stick together.\"\nLike Postecoglou, chairman and co-owner Daniel Levy has faced criticism from the fans.\nBut Levy has given the head coach resources to shape a squad. Postecoglou has spent \u00a3214.8m, with the most recent arrivals signed in January - forward Mathys Tel, defender Kevin Danso and goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky. \nThat extra spend was an attempt to salvage the season while alive in three cup competitions, but after elimination from the domestic cups, it is Europa League or bust. \nIt will be Spurs' last chance to live up to Postecoglou's comment early in the campaign that he \"always wins a trophy in his second season\" - having done so in Scotland, Japan and Australia.\nWith little to play for in the Premier League, a end to the Spurs trophy drought would end the season on a high.\nOn another night, Postecoglou's post-match rant about VAR would have taken the headlines. On Thursday, it was a footnote.\nTottenham thought they had equalised when Sarr struck home from distance.\nThe celebrations followed but were cut short as VAR checked for a possible foul. After a lengthy delay, the goal was ruled out.\nPostecoglou told BBC Radio 5 Live he \"hated VAR to his core\", that there was no point in having referees - and that there would soon be AI officials.\nPostecoglou, who has often criticised VAR, become embroiled in a lively post-match interview with Sky Sports.\nHere is what he said in full:\n\"It's killing the game, mate. It's not the same game it used to be. \n\"We all sat on our couches last night and watched TV [when Everton's James Tarkowski was not sent off for a high challenge on Liverpool's Alexis Mac Allister] and I guarantee you if Jarred Gillett was VAR last night, it would've been a different outcome, so you just don't know what we're going to get.\n\"You are standing around for 12 minutes. It's just killing the game, but no-one cares about that. They just love the drama and controversy and I'm sure there will be 24 hours of discussion about it and that's what everyone wants - they're not really interested that it's killing the spectacle of the game.\n\"If a referee sees that and he needs to see it for six minutes, what's clear and obvious about it?\n\"Last night we were all sat on our couches and saw one replay and thought: 'Oh my God.'\n\"Tonight we sat there and were waiting for six minutes for something that VAR official Jarred Gillett thought was clear and obvious - it's crazy, it's madness. \n\"We accept it and have to take the fall out from it. Clear and obvious? What does that suggest? That it's on the first replay. That's why the game is going the way it is.\"",

        "article_text": "If I was writing a Russian language course for 2025, Lesson One would definitely contain the phrase for rollercoaster: Amerikanskiye gorki.\nIt means, literally, American Hills.\nHow appropriate.\nAfter all, with President Donald Trump now operating the ride, and Vladimir Putin pressing some of the buttons, US-Russian relations have become one of late, with highs and lows and twists and turns.\nYou never know quite where you are now.\nAnalysing geopolitical trends is hard enough at the best of times. It's even harder careering along on the American Hills of the 47th US president.\nWhen Trump returned to the White House in January, his direction of travel was clear: he set out to repair relations with Russia. \nThere were Trump/Putin phone calls, high-level US-Russia negotiations. At one point Washington voted with Moscow against a UN resolution that identified Russia as the \"aggressor\" in Russia's war against Ukraine.\nWhenever the Trump administration exerted pressure, it was always on Kyiv, never on the Kremlin.\nBut a week or so ago the rollercoaster ride began.\nAfter Vladimir Putin had proposed replacing President Volodymyr Zelensky's administration with \"external governance\" in Ukraine under the auspices of the UN, President Trump made it known that he was \"angry\" with Putin.\n\"I was disappointed in a certain way, some of the things that were said over the last day or two having to do with Zelensky,\" Trump commented on 30 March. \"Because when [Putin] considers Zelensky not credible, he's supposed to be making a deal with him. Whether you like him or you don't like him.\"\nAfter a day playing golf with Trump, the president of Finland, Alexander Stubb, told the Guardian newspaper: \"I think America, and my sense is also the president of the United States, is running out of patience with Russia.\"\nTrump threatened to impose secondary tariffs of up to 50% on Russian oil exports if Russia was found to be dragging its heels on a Ukraine peace deal. \nA bi-partisan group of US senators has gone even further. \nThey've drawn up a bill that would impose 500% secondary tariffs on countries that purchase Russian oil, gas and other resources.\nUp to this point the Russian press had been welcoming the thaw in relations between Moscow and Washington. The Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper last month ran a headline stating that US and Russian officials had \"started speaking the same language\".\nThis week things changed.\nOn Wednesday, Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper accused the Trump administration of \"administrative insanity\u2026 inexperience\u2026 immaturity\".\nIt criticised the administration's \"bragging and arrogance\" and \"its desire to declare 'huge breakthroughs' when the first steps have barely been taken\".\nThe same day, Komsomolskaya Pravda declared: \"On Ukraine talks, Donald's mood changes as often as the wind.\"\nSigns, perhaps, of a cold wind blowing between Moscow and Washington?\nAnd yet when Trump announced his sweeping tariffs this week, Russia wasn't on the list. \nInstead, US authorities had organised a sanctions waiver for a key Kremlin official: Putin's foreign investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev. \nDmitriev flew into Washington for talks with the Trump administration.\nA sign, perhaps, of Russia and America getting on with the business of\u2026 getting along?\nBut on Friday, another warning from Washington to Moscow. This time at a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels.\n\"President Trump's not going to fall into the trap of endless negotiations about negotiations,\" said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\"We will know soon enough, in a matter of weeks, not months, whether Russia is serious about peace or not.\"\n\"If they're not,\" he continued, \"then we'll have to re-evaluate where we stand and what we do moving forward about it.\"\nThis followed criticism of Russia by America's Nato allies. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Putin \"continues to obfuscate, continues to drag his feet\".\n\"He could accept a ceasefire now, he continues to bombard Ukraine\u2026 We see you, Vladimir Putin, we know what you are doing.\"\nEarlier on Friday there were rumours that Trump and Putin were about to speak again on the phone. These were followed by more rumours: the White House had changed its mind.\nThe Kremlin said that there were no plans for a conversation.\nBut there are reports that American companies are planning to take part in this year's St Petersburg Economic Forum.\nOkay. Stop the ride. I need to get off.\nMy conclusions from all of this.\nTrying to follow each twist and turn on the US-Russia rollercoaster can leave you giddy and confused.\nSometimes it's better observing from a distance. It often helps in order to identify the bigger picture. \nWhich is this: for months Donald Trump's team avoided criticising Putin and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \nKey White House officials, like special envoy Steve Witkoff, have repeatedly embraced and repeated Kremlin talking points. True, Washington says it's growing impatient with Russia and has threatened tougher sanctions on Moscow. But it hasn't imposed any. Not yet.\nWill it? \nIs the Trump administration prepared to pressure Moscow into ending the war? And would the Kremlin allow itself to be pressured into doing so? \nIt's a key question as Russia's war on Ukraine continues.",

        "article_text": "Jon Hamm excels in Apple TV+'s \"emotionally real but absurdist\" drama about a desperate corporate man who resorts to stealing from his neighbours.\nJon Hamm has his best role since Mad Men and brings all his sharp comic timing and dramatic nuance to it as Andrew Cooper, known as Coop, a hedge-fund manager who loses his job and manoeuvres to maintain his elaborate lifestyle and sense of himself. If you took Don Draper and dropped him into 2025 he might be Coop, a corporate man with a broken marriage and two teenaged children, a decent guy and a charmer with all-around bad judgement. Your Friends and Neighbors is emotionally real and affecting but also absurdist and funny, a rare combination.\nThe show begins with Coop waking up in a pool of blood next to a man's dead body in the foyer of a neighbour's mansion. He cleans up the blood \u2013 a bad move \u2013 and in one of the many mordant voiceovers that run through the series, looks back four months to reflect on \"the swirling hot mess of my life\". His worst choice is replacing his lost income by stealing loot from friends so rich they'll never miss it. The robberies are the comic vein in the story, but also a Trojan horse for its drama. Coop is hurt and distraught over the loss of his marriage, but that theme exists next to the caper-like thefts. The series is edgier and smarter than its entertaining surface suggests, as it deftly takes on issues of family, class privilege, vapid materialism and toxic masculinity.\nLike most series, this could start a bit faster, as it sets up the life Coop is accustomed to in a suburban New York community of huge houses and country clubs, where $200,000 cars and $60,000 donations to charity are ordinary. That was his life until he found his wife Mel (Amanda Peet) in bed with his so-called friend, Nick (Mark Tallman), a former basketball star still in great shape. The divorce has sent Coop out of his expansive home into a smaller rental house nearby.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 11 of the best TV shows to watch this April\n\u2022 A new Hollywood take-down is a must-see\n\u2022 Why on-screen male nudity is still taboo\nBut soon enough the first episode gets to its boldest turn as we see why Coop lost his job. A woman who works at his firm, whom he has never met and who doesn't report to him, comes on to him in a bar. Months later, that consensual hookup leads to his being fired for violating the company's HR rules. Pop culture has at times gingerly dipped a toe into the theme of sexual harassment. On The Morning Show, Steve Carell's character, a toxic predator, was sent off a cliff to die. But there has been nothing as complicated as this. The show doesn't deny Coop's bad judgement but also makes it clear through the woman herself and Coop's ruthless boss that the HR rule was a convenient excuse to get rid of him while keeping his clients. The show doesn't go far beyond that in exploring the issue, but it sets up the series' complex realism about social standards.\u00a0\nA non-compete clause makes Coop unhireable, but he insists on keeping up appearances. His burglaries are treated like adventures, punctuated by mock ads as he describes the luxury items he's lifting, with voiceovers that slyly echo Hamm's in all those Mercedes-Benz commercials. \"The Patek Phillippe Nautilus: sealed 18-carat white gold...\" Coop says, talking about an item no one really needs.\nThe series' real strength, though, is in his relationships, most of them driven by his wounded pride, and the way his identity has been tied to his role as a successful man of the world. Hamm smoothly navigates the shifts in tone, never allowing the humour to flag while letting us see the emotional pain Coop won't reveal to anyone around him. There is a lot of residual affection between Coop and his cheating ex-wife, whom Peet manages to make sympathetic. When Mel worries and asks him what's wrong, he displays a classic alpha-male inability to share feelings. \"I'm fine,\" he tells her when clearly he is not. Olivia Munn has less to do as Sam, a divorced neighbour and Coop's occasional fling. And Lena Hall is brilliant as Coop's sister, Ali. Briefly off her meds, she stalks her ex-fianc\u00e9, sitting on his lawn with her guitar and singing. Hall, who won a Tony for her role in the Broadway revival of Hedwig and the Angry Inch in 2014, sings occasionally through the series \u2013 an asset, not an intrusion. She makes Ali empathetic, funny and warm, and the bond between the brother and sister is touching. After she is back on her meds, her romantic subplot suggests that theirs really is a family full of bad choices.\nA second season of the show has already been ordered, so the question of whether Coop will pay for his crimes will linger. That plot is an effective hook, but his resonant feelings and increasing self-knowledge set the show apart. At a party of male friends hosted by Nick \u2013 why is Coop even there? more bad choices \u2013 he looks around at the men who still have their jobs and money, and sees the person he might have become. \"Their future was already written, and so the quest to stave off the emptiness began,\" he says in voiceover, observing their devotion to \"Scotch and cigars\", to \"custom golf clubs and high-end escorts\". He recognises that there are \"entire industries built to cash in on the quiet desperation of rich middle-aged men\". By even acknowledging that desperation, through a hero who is sympathetic \u2013 however wrong-headed his path to self-awareness \u2013 Your Friends and Neighbors is radically different from any other show around.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nYour Friends and Neighbors is on Apple TV+ from 11 April.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0\nsign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0\nFacebook, \nX and \nInstagram.

        "article_text": "The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) must take \"urgent action\" to protect Northern Ireland's most precious places for nature.\nA review by the Office for Environmental Protection has found that the framework of laws to support the identification and management of protected sites is strong, but their implementation falls short.\nAnd not enough priority sites are getting legal protection, with Northern Ireland lagging behind the rest of the UK, Ireland and Europe in its coverage.\nThe OEP has made 14 recommendations to Daera.\nThey include setting targets supported by a plan, working with landowners, and ensuring that restoring protected sites is a key consideration in the new Farming with Nature agri-environment scheme, which is currently being developed by the Department.\nThe chief executive of the OEP, Natalie Prosser, called for work to turn things around.\n\"Instead of seeing the improvement of these precious sites we see deterioration.

That's a disappointing outcome.\"\nMr Ricks said he did not support the imposition of tariffs but understood its intention and respected President Trump's political mandate.\n\"We don't support tariffs, to be clear. In pharma, about 70% of global R&D takes place in the United States. So we're creating the next generation of breakthroughs and cures.\n\"But the production is heavily weighted outside the US. And that's not unique to our industry. It happened with electronics and software and other things\".\n\"So I think what this administration is saying is we want both. We want the means of production and we want the research and development intellectual property generation.\"\nEli Lilly are in the process of building a new additional $800m facility in Ireland, where they employ more than 3,000 people. Mr Ricks said that development would proceed.\n\"There's plenty of demand outside the US so we'd have to look at the flow of goods because we wouldn't want to have to pay tariffs if we didn't need to, but I think for the moment that's fine.\"\nBut Mr Ricks said that its investment in the UK had been in decline and warned that slow regulation and poor uptake of new medicines threatened the UK's reputation as an important life sciences hub and that patients were missing out on new advances in medicine.\nMr Ricks said he delivered some \"candid\" comments to senior ministers including the prime minister, health secretary and business secretary.\n\"The UK's advantage is slipping. If you look at the numbers there is disinvestment in research and development. It's been on a steady decline,\" he said.\nSo is the UK complacent when it thinks of itself as a life sciences super power?\n\"That's one way to put it.\"\nMr Ricks said countries like Germany spend nearly double of their health budget on medicines.\n\"The UK is not a large market. But what it could be is an exceptional market.\n\"You need three things to make our industry work. A strong intellectual property system, and the UK is quite good.\n\"You need a regulator that's timely, efficient and predictable - pretty good there as well.\n\"But most importantly you need a commercial market that rewards innovation - and here there's been significant backsliding\".",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump's tariffs have sparked falls in stock markets around the world - but how will they affect sport?\n\"It's potentially the difference between life and death.\"\nThe words of a \"hugely frustrated\" Lynn Calder - the head of Ineos Automotive, the car company owned by Manchester United minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe - when talking about the impact United States tariffs would have on the business.\nWith its manufacturing based in France, the company now faces the prospect of 25% tariffs being imposed on vehicles exported to the crucial American market, with Calder admitting it was \"vulnerable to tariffs\" and needed \"direct and urgent political intervention\"., external\nHer stark warning was a reminder of the effect the duties introduced by US President Donald Trump will have on the wide range of industries linked to sport through investment or sponsorship. \nGlobal stock markets have fallen as investors reacted amid fears of inflation, but beyond the wider economic turmoil, how else could the ripples of a trade war affect the world of sport?\nTrump's so-called 'Liberation Day' could have ramifications for a club such as Manchester United in other ways.\n\"It has $650m of loans from the US because the club is listed in New York,\" football finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport.\n\"If the Trump administration's tariffs have a positive impact on the US dollar and it strengthens, that means the value of those loans in sterling terms will increase, and this could hit United's accounts and have implications for Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR) that limit clubs' losses.\n\"In the 2022 accounts there was a \u00a358m cost due to foreign exchange movements on these loans. So the United board will be watching with interest as to what happens in terms of the market reaction to these tariffs as far as global exchange rates are concerned.\"\nThe US is set to stage some of the world's biggest sports events over the next few years, including the 2026 World Cup and 2028 LA Olympics and Paralympics. \nThese events are meant to provide overseas businesses with a key opportunity to raise their profile and boost sales in the US. \nKorean car manufacturer Hyundai Group, for instance, will look to take advantage of its sponsorship deal with football governing body Fifa during the Club World Cup this year, and then the World Cup in 2026. But could Trump's aggressive trade policies make such businesses think again?\n\"I suspect some sponsors are now re-assessing how they 'activate' such deals in the US, given the trade barriers that have now been imposed,\" says John Zerafa, a sports event bid strategist.\n\"Why would a sponsor spend millions of pounds doing so if it is now prohibitive to sell in America?\"\nMany sports teams and athletes are also sponsored by sportswear brands. \nWith most of these companies relying on materials and manufacturing in Asia - where Trump has directed some of the highest tariffs - it is no surprise that shares in the likes of Nike, Adidas and Puma have all fallen sharply, with fears that higher importing costs would be passed on to consumers.\nHowever Maguire says the impact should be limited. \"For a $100 (\u00a376.36) replica sports jersey sold in the US, manufacturing costs are likely to be in the region of $12-15 dollars at source, and maybe even lower,\" he says.\n\"So even if there's a 40% tariff when the goods are imported to the US, that'll only be around $4 more.\n\"Consumers are used to paying premium prices in sports retail. The manufacturer and retailer should absorb some of this, and it shouldn't impact on the amount being sold - or the commissions being earned by clubs that sell merchandise.\"\nThe European Sponsorship Association told BBC Sport that it was \"monitoring the situation closely and will actively seek the views of the sport sponsorship community\".\n\"As a representative body we will respond accordingly if there proves to be any sign of a material negative impact on the industry,\" it said.\nAmid talk of a trade war, Trump's tariffs have also raised questions over the atmosphere at the various sports events it is due to host, not least the Ryder Cup in the US later this year. \nWith European Union leaders highly critical of the policy, it would be little surprise if anti-European sentiment among the American fans is intensified.\nAnd then there's the 2026 World Cup, which the US is co-hosting alongside Mexico and Canada.\nIn January, Trump vowed to impose tariffs of 25% on imports from the neighbouring countries - America's two biggest trading partners - in a move he said was designed to address the entry of opioid drug fentanyl to the US, the large amounts of undocumented migrants that have come across US borders, as well as trade deficits.\nLast month Trump claimed the political and economic tensions between the US and its World Cup co-hosts would be good for the tournament. \"I think it's going to make it more exciting. Tension's a good thing,\" he said.\nHe also announced the formation of a World Cup taskforce, external which he will chair to ensure the tournament runs smoothly. Fifa has been approached for comment on their response to the US President's tariffs.\nBut Trump's protectionist policies raise serious questions over the three countries' willingness and ability to work together on security for instance, or to ensure fans can gain entry visas, and then pass easily across borders. \nWith imported materials such as steel and aluminium more expensive, there may also be concerns about the development of infrastructure for the tournament.\nTrump has also spoken provocatively about making Canada 'the 51st state', leading to the US anthem being booed by Canadian fans at NBA and NHL fixtures. \nCould the additional tensions over tariffs mean such scenes are repeated at the World Cup or even the Olympics?\n\"Nations and cities host global sports events for a variety of reasons, from enhancing reputation and driving global investment, to sending a message to the world that you are open, welcoming and ready to do business. It seems nothing could be further from the truth in terms of Trump's America,\" says Zerafa.\n\"It's not just tariffs. From forced repatriations, and hostility to the EU and Nato, to a possible takeover of Greenland and bad blood with Canada. All this makes it a very challenging backdrop for the World Cup 2026 and LA Games in 2028 to promote that narrative.\"\nThe IOC has been approached for comment. Insiders told BBC Sport they are confident that Trump's love of sport - and his desire for LA 2028 to be a successful global platform towards the end of his second term in office - will ensure that preparations for the Olympics are not derailed by geopolitics.\nWith retaliatory tariffs being imposed by other countries, a trade war could impact any person, team or league buying sports equipment that is made in the US, as well as American consumers of products manufactured overseas of course.\nThe Premier League exports its content to the US via its lucrative \u00a32bn TV deal with NBC, but because this is deemed a service rather than a product, the tariffs do not apply.\n\"As such there should be no consequences, unless there is some form of escalation in the trade relationship between the UK and the US,\" says Maguire. \n\"So the Premier League won't have to come to some sort of compromise with its broadcast partner.\"\nA bigger concern for the UK football industry will be consumers having less money to spend on tickets and TV subscriptions if fears of a recession come to pass.",

Form: F - Fell, P - Pulled up, U - Unseated rider.)\nVerdict: Lots with chances but Senior Chief could still be improving, while Hewick looks primed to run well.\n1 Senior Chief 2 Hewick 3 Stumptown 4 Iroko\nQuick guide to runners\nPreview: I Am Maximus seeks repeat win\nAintree race times and BBC coverage\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Paul Townend\nForm: 311-P8 Age: 9 Weight: 11-12\nConvincing victor last year, having won the Irish National 12 months earlier, and could well be in the shake-up again. Pinpointed two months ago by 20-time champion jockey AP McCoy - who advises the owner - as the pick of JP McManus' stellar squad. Would be the first horse carrying top weight to triumph since the legendary Red Rum in the 1970s.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 6-1\nTrainer: Venetia Williams Jockey: Charlie Deutsch\nForm: F-1P66 Age: 11 Weight:11-9\nThrives in different conditions, at Haydock in the mud \u2013 scene of five of his seven career victories, including back-to-back runnings of the Betfair Chase. Past three runs have been disappointing. Owned by flamboyant former banker Rich Ricci, you might not get rich backing this one although trainer did triumph with 100-1 outsider Mon Mome in 2009.\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 125-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Patrick Mullins\nForm: 73-411 Age: 8 Weight: 11-8\nOwner Stewart Andrew clearly thinks he's a rocket - he eyed Cheltenham Gold Cup, but trainer preferred to go for the National. Would be an emotional winner as Andrew's wife Sadie died in December 2022, five days after watching Nick Rockett in his first race. A winner of the Thyestes Chase then Bobbyjo Chase, where Intense Raffles was runner-up, but that rival better off at the weights here. Jockey rides for trainer father.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Brian Hayes\nForm: 1-P625 Age: 9 Weight: 11-8\nWould be a poignant winner as the last horse bought for owners Cheveley Park Stud by joint boss David Thompson at the end of 2020, just 19 days before his death. Runner-up in Irish Gold Cup to Galopin Des Champs at 66-1 when finishing ahead of subsequent Cheltenham winners Fact To File and Inothewayurthinkin. Drying ground should suit.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: John Joseph Hanlon (IRE) Jockey: Gavin Sheehan\nForm: 232571 Age: 10 Weight: 11-7\nAn \u00a3800 bargain buy who has won big races including the King George VI Chase, Bet365 Gold Cup, Galway Plate and American Grand National. Trainer, nicknamed 'Shark', has taken horse into local pub to celebrate victories, and believes he could be sent off favourite. Well backed in lead-up to race, would be suited by dry spell with good going right up his street.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Henry de Bromhead (IRE) Jockey: Rachael Blackmore\nForm: 443-26 Age: 12 Weight: 11-3\nLooked a potential winner last year in closing stages before finishing third. Triumphed in 2021 Cheltenham Gold Cup for trainer, who won National a month later with stablemate Minella Times as Rachael Blackmore became first female jockey to win the race. Could easily be prominent again for her although would be some effort to become only third horse to complete Gold Cup-National double.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Sean O'Keeffe\nForm: 2-5351 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nShowed bundles of promise when winning the Supreme Novices' Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival four years ago but much of that has been unfulfilled. Won for the first time in two years last time out at Thurles. Not the most obvious victor in trainer's talented team and no guarantee at all that he will appreciate this marathon distance.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Jonathan Burke\nForm: 0-8P43 Age: 9 Weight: 11-2\nWhile powerful trainer has other hopefuls, including last year's winner, don't let this one go under the radar. Third under top weight to Intense Raffles in last year's Irish Grand National before winning Bet365 Gold Cup at Sandown. Breeding and form point to potential for big run. Minella horses take their name from a Tipperary family hotel run by racehorse trader John Nallen.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Jordan Gainford\nForm:  U58708 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nBoasts some decent form including Irish Gold Cup win, when Minella Indo was second, albeit that was three years ago. Has run well at this meeting before, including a good second to Jonbon over shorter distance last year. Trainer seeking fourth victory in race, but suspicion is age, weight and longer trip may be against this one.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Keith Donoghue\nForm: -U1111 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nSecured fourth straight victory of the season by winning Cross Country Chase at Cheltenham Festival in fine style last month. That is the same race Tiger Roll won before his 2018 and 2019 National triumphs. Stumptown's trainer went to town at Cheltenham by landing the Gold Cup with Inothewayurthinkin, who was then made hot favourite for this but skips the race.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 8-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Freddie Gingell\nForm: 83-222 Age: 9 Weight: 11-1\nPart-owned by former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, Hitman has been a bit hit and miss. Has a habit of coming second - finishing runner-up in 11 of his 26 races - and this distance is a real unknown. Talented 19-year-old jockey credits much of his success to his mother Kim who died in 2020 from cancer aged 43.\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 150-1\nTrainer: Nigel Twiston-Davies Jockey: Sam Twiston-Davies\nForm: 1P-132 Age: 9 Weight: 11-1\nJockey rides for trainer father, who has landed the race twice before. Winner of Midlands Grand National last year. Owner Bryan Burrough hoping for second success, 42 years after his colours were carried to victory by the Jenny Pitman-trained Corbiere. It's a tough ask but had a convincing victory over fences at Ascot earlier in season and stamina looks assured.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: James Reveley\nForm: 6-2383  Age: 10 Weight: 11-0\nForm has dipped since reaching top of his game two or three years ago. Won jump racing's festive showpiece, the King George VI Chase at Kempton, in 2022 and was second a year later. In between, finished runner-up in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Will take a brave man or woman to pick this one after an 11-race losing run. Stable jockey rides Kandoo Kid.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 50-1\nTrainer: Nicky Henderson Jockey: James Bowen\nForm: 9-5515  Age: 11 Weight: 10-13\nBit of an enigma. Was on a 10-race losing run when won well at Cheltenham on New Year's Day. Maybe he was just in the party mood. Green and gold colours of owner JP McManus look more likely to succeed elsewhere, although there is a breeding positive - Chantry House's sire Yeats was also dad to 2022 National winner Noble Yeats.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Harry Skelton\nForm: 210-32 Age: 10 Weight: 10-12\nNamed after owner Max McNeill's late father and ex-professional golfer Ted, who was three under par through five holes to lead The Open at Royal Portrush in 1951. Will the gelding be above or below par? Fourth in the Scottish National two years ago but well behind Minella Cocooner and Nick Rockett in last season's Bet365 Gold Cup.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Mark Walsh\nForm: 286411  Age: 8 Weight: 10-12\nAnother powerful weapon in the armoury of Cheltenham Gold Cup-winning trainer, who also has Stumptown and Vanillier. A beaten favourite for both the Galway Plate and Kerry National but form of his Leopardstown win in December reads well and now takes a big step up in trip. Named after a 1970s film about a 12th Century knight, could he put his rivals to the sword here?\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 12-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Harry Cobden\nForm: P23-18 Age: 9 Weight: 10-11\nDecent third in Topham Chase over National fences last year. Won Coral Gold Cup, formerly the Hennessy, at Newbury in November. Only one horse, Many Clouds, has gone on to also win the National, though trainer thinks he can do it. He won in 2012 with Neptune Collonges and says the grey Kandoo Kid is the \"ideal horse for the race\".\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 20-1\nTrainer: Oliver Greenall & Josh Guerriero Jockey: Jonjo O'Neill Jr\nForm: 2-2F42  Age: 7 Weight: 10-11\nA Cheltenham Festival winner in 2023. Second at Aintree meeting 12 months ago to subsequent Gold Cup winner Inowthewayurthinkin when nominated by owner JP McManus as his 'National horse for next year'. Joint-trainer Oliver Greenall's father Lord Daresbury is former racecourse chairman who has an Aintree stand named after him. Co-trainer Josh Guerriero won Foxhunters' Chase over National fences as amateur jockey in 2008.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 9-1\nTrainer: Tom Gibney (IRE) Jockey: JJ Slevin\nForm: 11-902 Age: 7 Weight: 10-10\nSounds like a deadly serious lottery, and has a deadly serious chance. Winner of the Irish Grand National last year. Nearly all of his races have been on soft or heavy ground. The grey runs in the 'double green' colours of owner-breeders Simon Munir and Isaac Souede. Showed his wellbeing when second, despite carrying more weight, to Nick Rockett at Fairyhouse in February.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Henry de Bromhead (IRE) Jockey: Darragh O'Keeffe\nForm: 1P-169 Age: 9 Weight: 10-10\nPulled up in last year's Irish National but marked himself out as a candidate for this race when winning well at Cheltenham in October. Subsequently sixth in the Coral Gold Cup at Newbury when he was staying on, which could be a good sign for the test ahead. Owned by the Lucky In Life Syndicate. Will the horse live up to their name?\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Richard Phillips Jockey: Harry Bannister\nForm: F03106 Age: 11 Weight: 10-10\nPreviously based in Ireland, where he won the Midlands National last summer at Kilbeggan. Having second run for amiable Gloucestershire trainer, who does a nice line in impressions. He helped buy the horse with John Rosbotham, a friend of 55 years with whom he dreamed in the school playground of having a National runner, and it runs for a syndicate of 12 called the Dozen Dreamers.\nRating: 4/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey:  Sam Ewing\nForm: 212433 Age: 7 Weight: 10-9\nFive of his six wins have come at roughly half the distance of this race. Looks an uphill task on the face of it, but interestingly mentioned as a potential surprise package by the trainer \u2013 who has won three times previously - when weights for the race were announced in February. Would probably benefit from soft ground.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Nigel Twiston-Davies Jockey: Tom Bellamy\nForm: 5-324P Age: 7 Weight: 10-9\nOwner David Proos hoping to go two better after his family silks were carried to third by Rinus in 1990. No forlorn hope based on his second to Kandoo Kid in Coral Gold Cup at Newbury. One for alliteration fans - could Broadway Boy follow Mon Mome, Party Politics and Red Rum as a nifty-sounding National winner for trainer, who has triumphed twice before?\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Jody McGarvey\nForm: U50029 Age: 10 Weight: 10-9\nEleventh in last year's race, when hampered late on, having previously finished eighth and pulled up. Prominent on each occasion before fading. Winner of the Troytown Chase in 2023. Will probably be spotted towards the front again but takes a leap of faith to see him stay there and become only the fourth grey horse to win the National.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Paul O'Brien\nForm: 3PP-P0 Age: 8 Weight: 10-9\nLooked to be heading for big things after winning Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham in 2023 but career over the bigger obstacles has not been straightforward and pulled up on three of his past four runs. Jockey called up for first ride in race after original bookings Bryony Frost (riding in France) then Johnny Burke (on Minella Cocooner instead) were unavailable\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Danny Mullins\nForm: 37-008 Age: 8 Weight: 10-7\n'Caught the eye' of last year's winning trainer when the weights were revealed in February. Finished seventh in 2024 when appeared to run out of steam. That could be perceived as a stamina doubt, although might see out the trip better now a year stronger and stable's Hedgehunter won in 2005 after a tired late fall the previous year.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Jonjo & AJ O'Neill Jockey: Nick Scholfield\nForm: 5P-241 Age: 9 Weight: 10-9\nIntriguing contender who finished fourth in the Welsh Grand National before ending a two-year losing run with victory at Uttoxeter. Finished third to subsequent National winner Corach Rambler at Cheltenham Festival two years ago. Formerly owned by Tory peer Michelle Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman before being sold last year to Martin Tedham, who sponsors the trainer's yard.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Sean Flanagan\nForm: -P6913 Age: 10 Weight: 10-6\nThis was my selection in 2023, when he ended up finishing second to Corach Rambler for shrewd trainer. Was 14th last year on softer ground but comfortable Punchestown win in February showcased his credentials. Jockey is qualified aircraft pilot although nearly took wrong route at Cheltenham last month before recovering to finish third in Cross Country Chase. Chance again if the satnav is working.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Michael Keady Jockey: Ciaran Gethings\nForm:  F22999  Age: 8 Weight: 10-6\nRunner-up in the Kerry and Munster Nationals when trained by Willie Mullins but switched stables last month. Now based in the Flat racing capital of Newmarket. Trainer set up on his own five months ago and is looking for first win over jumps in biggest steeplechase of all.

However, this is a longer and stiffer task. No 13-year-old horse has won the National since Sergeant Murphy 102 years ago and hard to see an equine teenager being celebrated this time around.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 150-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Sean Bowen\nForm: -33713  Age: 10 Weight: 10-5\nThis race has been the long-term plan, says the trainer, who has been successful three times before.

But the coalition led by Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is expected to have enough numbers to get it passed, barring a major surprise. It will then be sent to the Rajya Sabha, or upper house, for discussion and passage.\nIf it is passed by both houses of parliament, it will be sent to President Droupadi Murmu for her assent before it becomes law.\nMallikarjun Kharge, Congress MP and leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha, said the opposition was united and would work to defeat \"the unconstitutional and divisive agenda of the Modi government on the Waqf Amendment Bill\".\nMuslim groups have argued that the bill \"aims to weaken the waqf laws and pave the way for the seizure and destruction of waqf properties\".\nMoving the bill in parliament on Wednesday, Rijiju accused the opposition of spreading rumours that the bill would take away the rights of Muslims.\n\"The Waqf (Amendment) Bill that we have introduced includes several recommendations from the JPC, which we have accepted and incorporated into this bill,\" he said.\nBut opposition members have alleged that the JPC accepted the changes suggested by the BJP and its allies while rejecting all amendments they proposed.\n\nThe waqf properties, which include mosques, madrassas, shelter homes and thousands of acres of land donated by Muslims, are managed by boards. Some of these properties are vacant while others have been encroached upon.\nIn Islamic tradition, a waqf is a charitable or religious donation made by Muslims for the benefit of the community. Such properties cannot be sold or used for any other purpose - which implies that waqf properties belong to God.\nThe government says that the waqf boards are among India's largest landholders. There are at least 872,351 waqf properties across India, spanning more than 940,000 acres, with an estimated value of 1.2 trillion rupees ($14.22bn; \u00a311.26bn).\nA major criticism from opponents of the bill is that it grants the government undue power to regulate the management of these endowments and determine whether a property qualifies as \"waqf\".\nThe bill also proposes the induction of two non-Muslim members on the waqf boards which oversee these properties. Critics have opposed this provision, arguing that most religious institutions run by non-Muslims do not permit followers of other faiths in their administration.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook",

        "article_text": "The Masters was first contested in 1934 and won by American Horton Smith\nThe 89th Masters takes place 10-13 April, with defending champion Scottie Scheffler among a field featuring an in-form Rory McIlroy looking, once again, to complete the career Grand Slam.\nBBC Sport will have live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra across all four days.\nThere will also be live text commentary, in-play clips, video highlights, reaction and analysis on the BBC Sport website and app.\nRound one: Thursday, 10 April \nRound two: Friday, 11 April \nRound three: Saturday, 12 April \nRound four: Sunday, 13 April \nThe tee times and groupings for rounds one and two will be announced on Tuesday, 8 April.\nMcIlroy has won four majors but none since 2014 and is yet to win the Masters, while Scheffler's two major triumphs have come at Augusta National \nThe general feeling in the golfing world is that if a player finishes above both Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy this week then they will probably be donning the Green Jacket.\nAmerican Scheffler is the world number one and turning into something of a Masters specialist. He is looking for a third victory in four years, while McIlroy is seeking to win the title for the first time.\nScheffler had a standout year in 2024, winning nine events including the Masters, and while he has not enjoyed the same stellar start to 2025, he is yet to finish outside the top 20 in five previous appearances in the first men's major of the year.\nMcIlroy, ranked second, needs this title to become just the sixth player to win the career Grand Slam of all four majors. It will be his 11th attempt to join a pantheon of greats including Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Ben Hogan, Gene Sarazen and Gary Player.\nFor the first time, the Northern Irishman has won twice on the PGA Tour before arriving at Augusta, including last month's prestigious Players Championship, which has only intensified the hype.\nBut there are potential winners everywhere in the 96-man field.\nSwedish sensation Ludvig Aberg finished runner-up to Scheffler last year in a debut major to remember. Could he go on to emulate Jordan Spieth, who finished second in his debut year, before winning the title 12 months later in 2015?\nEngland's Tommy Fleetwood will be encouraged by his joint third last year, while his compatriot Matt Fitzpatrick is a proven major winner and Wolverhampton's Aaron Rai is making his Masters debut after rising through the rankings.\nScotland's Bob MacIntyre is making his first start in three years but made the cut in his first two attempts, with a best finish of joint 12th. He arrives in Augusta with five top-15 returns in 2025.\nXander Schauffele has had four top-10 finishes in his previous six Masters and is coming off the back of a breakthrough 2024 in the majors where he won his first and second titles.\nCollin Morikawa, ranked one place below Schauffele at fourth in the world, also enjoys Augusta and has had three top-10s in his past three starts, finishing joint third in 2024.\nUS Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley is enjoying something of a renaissance in his career and is 14th in the world rankings.\nThe 38-year-old has never finished inside the top 20 at Augusta but won his seventh PGA Tour title at last year's BMW Championship and has had two top-10s this season, making the cut in all seven events he has played.\nLIV Golf is well represented, with a dozen players from the Saudi-backed circuit heading to Georgia.\nJon Rahm won this title in 2023 and perhaps has a better chance of adding to his tally than Dustin Johnson (2020), Patrick Reed (2018) and Sergio Garcia (2017) who are all recent champions.\nChile's Joaquin Niemann has won twice on the LIV circuit this year and is once again being touted as a potential winner, while Bryson DeChambeau showed playing the 54-hole LIV tournaments had not harmed his major aspirations as he won his second US Open title last year\nAnd finally... although he is not a favourite to win, many eyes will be on Germany's Bernhard Langer this week as the 67-year-old makes his 41st and final start on the 40th anniversary of the first of his two wins.\nFive-time Masters champion Tiger Woods will not be playing at Augusta National this year because he is still recovering after rupturing an Achilles tendon in March.\nOn 1 April the 15-time major champion wrote on X: \"I can't believe I am saying this, but a few weeks after rupturing my left Achilles, the sleeping in a hyperbaric chamber plus the explosive lifts, my doctors and trainers have me ready to play the Masters next week! Can't wait! See y'all on the course.\"\nHowever, minutes later, he added the message: \"P.S. April Fools my Achilles is still a mess :)\"\nWoods had surgery on the injury, which also kept him out of the PGA Tour's flagship Players Championship, on 11 March.\nHe had been hoping to make his comeback at Augusta, having not competed in a PGA Tour event since last July's Open at Royal Troon.\nThe 49-year-old then had his sixth back procedure in 10 years in September 2024.\nWoods planned to return at the Genesis Invitational in February but withdrew following the death of his mother, Kultida.\n\nThe BBC weather forecast for Augusta, Georgia is predicting drizzle and light rain on the Monday and Wednesday practice days of Masters week, with a sunnier day on Tuesday and maximum temperatures of 15C.\nThere is little to no rain and light winds forecast for the Championship days. The temperature is set to warm up throughout the week with a maximum of 18C for the final round on Sunday.\nMasters tradition dictates that the new champion is helped into his Green Jacket by the previous year's winner\nIt is arguably the most sought-after jacket in sport.\nThe great Bobby Jones, founder of the Augusta National Golf Club in 1933 and co-founder of the Masters which began in 1934, came up with the idea of a members' jacket.\nThe American amateur, who won seven majors, took his lead from Royal Liverpool, after winning The Open in 1927. He liked the red hunting jacket worn by the club's former captains.\nRed, yellow and 'Georgia peach' colours were all floated between Jones and his business partner Clifford Roberts before the latter, inspired by the colour of the leaves on the azalea bushes that dominate Augusta National, suggested green.\nThe idea was that members wore the jacket and were therefore easily recognisable by spectators visiting the course.\nSam Snead was the first Masters winner to be awarded a Green Jacket, in 1949.\nIt is made of an inexpensive wool-polyester mix and costs about \u00a3195 to make each one. The colour is known as 'Pantone 342'.\nEach jacket is kept permanently in the Champions Locker Room and only worn during Masters Week, strictly within the confines of Augusta National's clubhouse.\nInitially, only first-time winners were allowed to remove the jacket from the property and then just for the first 12 months. Recently, winners have been given a replica jacket they can take away.\nThe Par 3 Contest is a relaxing Wednesday-afternoon event with families and friends heavily involved\nFirst played in 1960, the Par 3 Contest has become the traditional fun curtain-raiser to the Masters.\nIt will start around 17:00 BST on Wednesday, 10 April. Most players have their wives, girlfriends, children, or even grandchildren as caddies and dressed in the traditional white boiler suits.\nNon-competing past champions such as Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Tom Watson still play in the nine-hole event that criss-crosses DeSoto Springs Pond and Ike's Pond.\nFamously, no player has won the Par 3 Contest and then gone on to win the Green Jacket in the same year.\nBBC Sport will have live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra across all four days.\nThere will also be live text commentary, in-play clips, video highlights, reaction and analysis on the BBC Sport website and app. \nMonday, 7 April\n21:00-22:00 BST - BBC Radio 5 Live preview show, also on BBC Sounds and via BBC Sport website\nThursday, 10 April\n12:30-01:00 - live text commentary on round one on BBC Sport website, with in-play clips\n20:00-01:00 - live radio commentary on 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds\nFriday, 11 April\n12:30-01:00 - live text commentary on round two on BBC Sport website, with in-play clips\n20:30-22:00 - live radio commentary on 5 Live and BBC Sounds\n22:00-01:00 - live radio commentary on 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds\nSaturday, 12 April\n17:00-01:00 - live text commentary on round three on BBC Sport website, with in-play clips\n21:00-01:00 - live radio commentary on 5 Live and BBC Sounds\nSunday, 13 April\n17:00-01:00 - live text commentary on round four on BBC Sport website, with in-play clips\n20:00-01:00 - live radio commentary on 5 Live and BBC Sounds\n",

        "article_text": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has dismissed accusations that Washington was left unable to help in the Myanmar earthquake due to the Donald Trump administration's shuttering of its humanitarian aid agency.\nAsked by the BBC why the US had not meaningfully responded, as it routinely has to past such disasters, Rubio said \"we are not the government of the world\".\nEarlier this week, former officials at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) said the US was left unable to send rescuers and dogs due to the agency's dismantling. \nRubio said the US had to balance global humanitarian rescue work with \"other needs\" and \"other priorities\" that were in the US national interests.\n\"There's a lot of other rich countries in the world, they should all be pitching in.\n\"We're going to do our part. We already have people there. We'll have more people there. We'll help as much as we can [but] it's not the easiest place to work\u2026 they have a military junta that doesn't like us,\" Rubio said.\nOn Tuesday, a former USAID official told the BBC the shuttering of the agency, led by the billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk, meant the White House could not send teams from the US to save lives in the immediate aftermath of the 28 March magnitude 7.7 earthquake. \nThe confirmed death toll rose to 3,354 on 4 April, Myanmar's ruling military said. The number of injured stood at 4,508, while 220 were still missing.\nRoutinely in such earthquakes, the US can deploy up to 200 rescue workers and sniffer dogs along with specialist equipment, and is often the biggest and best equipment foreign response team on the ground. \nLast week, the state department said a US team of three advisers based in the region was being sent to disaster zone.\nSpeaking to reporters at a Nato meeting in Brussels,  Rubio blamed the military regime in Myanmar for the lack of access, even though the state department said earlier this week the country had made a formal request for assistance. \nFormer USAID officials say their work is seen as non-political, and they have previously accessed countries regarded as politically hostile.\n\"That would have impeded our response, no matter what,\" said Rubio.\n\"That said, we are willing to continue to help in the humanitarian crisis. Other countries need to do so as well. China is a very rich country. India is a rich country. There are a lot of other countries in the world, and everyone should pitch in.\"\nChina and India were among the first to have teams on the ground in Myanmar, according to former American humanitarian officials.\nRubio dismissed the accounts of humanitarian aid experts who said the inability to deploy a large US rescue team was due to the USAID cuts.\n\"These are people that make millions and hundreds of millions of dollars in these NGOs [non-governmental organisations] all over the world that stand up and they get flooded with the US taxpayer money, and then we have to spend 10 [or] 100 million dollars to get 10 million to people. We're not doing that anymore. Okay? We have stopped. We are no longer going to spend 10 million, 100 million dollars to get 10 million to recipients.\n\"We're not going to fund these global NGOs all over the world that are living off of this. We're not doing it.\n\"We are prepared to help and work with governments and appropriate NGOs on the ground that are delivering assistance. We will be there, and we will be helpful [but] there are a lot of other rich countries, they should also pitch in and help\u2026 we are going to do our part,\" Rubio added.\nAs news of the Myanmar earthquake emerged, the White House had reportedly tried to deploy a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) from the US - but could not do so because the Trump administration's cuts had cancelled logistics contracts and fired officials who oversaw such deployments, according to the former officials. \nThe cuts to USAID had been led by Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) after President Trump targeted foreign assistance on his first day in office, calling it an \"industry\" that was in many cases \"antithetical to American values\".",

        "article_text": "The bacteria and fungi living on your skin play a surprising role in keeping us healthy. Is it possible to give them a boost?\nScratch the surface of the skin, and you'll find a bustling community of bacteria living there. This is a good thing, as research increasingly shows that having the \"right kind\" of microbes can help keep our skin young, supple, and smooth for longer. Simply by being there, \"good bacteria\" protect us from infection from pathogenic, harmful microbes. They also help to repair wounds and may even counteract some of the harmful effects of UV rays.\u00a0\nAll-the-more reason to look after our skin microbiome. But how do we do this? One method that has become increasingly popular is the use of topical skin probiotics \u2013 which technically means applying live microorganisms to the skin to improve its health.\nAs far back as 1912, scientists were rubbing bacteria into people's faces in an attempt to improve conditions such as acne and seborrhea \u2013 a common form of dermatitis that causes a red, itchy rash and white or yellow scales.\nToday there are dozens of skincare companies selling what they describe as probiotic products, from serums to cleansers and moisturisers. In each case, the balms offer to rebalance the delicate skin microbiome, leaving it \"renewed\" and \"refreshed\".\u00a0\nBut while skincare products often claim to be \"probiotic\", very few, if any, actually contain live bacteria.\nWhat's more, as probiotic skin treatments are classed as \"cosmetics\" and not medicines, their manufacturers don't have to share the results of any trials that have been conducted on their products, so it's difficult to know how effective they are.\u00a0\n\"The rules around skin care products are very different to the rules around drugs, so claims can be made with less rigorous testing than would be made for a pharmaceutical agent,\" says Richard Gallo, a dermatologist at UC San Diego School of Medicine.\nMost \"probiotic\" skincare products contain either prebiotics \u2013 nutrients that feed and encourage the growth of good bacteria on the skin, or postbiotics \u2013 proteins or other products made by beneficial bacteria.\n\"What we are seeing more and more are approaches that try to influence the microbiome,\" says Bernhard Paetzold, co-founder and chief scientific officer of\u00a0S-Biomedic, a company that aims to treat conditions by restoring the skin's microbiome through bacterial \"transplants\".\nAccording to Paetzold, the main reason for this is that live bacteria are extremely difficult to keep alive throughout the manufacturing, storing and distribution process. Once on the skin there's no guarantee that they'll even take hold, as they must fight to compete with the millions of other microbes already living there.\nThe idea of promoting a healthy skin microbiome is rooted in the theory that bacteria and fungi living on the outside of our body help to protect us from those that might do us harm.\nYet the science behind how certain \"bad\" bacteria can contribute to skin diseases isn't yet fully understood. What we do know is that people with eczema, rosacea, acne and psoriasis all have different types or levels of certain bacteria living on their skin.\n\"What exists at the moment is a lot of papers showing that nearly every skin disease imaginable is associated with a shift in the skin microbiome,\" says Paetzold. \"But this observation just shows an association. It doesn't say that the shift in the microbiome causes that disease. It could also be that the disease changes the skin environment, and that's why the bacterial population changes.\"\nTo prove that a particular strain of bacteria is causing a disease, you would need to either give a healthy person that skin disease by slathering the \"bad bacteria\" on their face, or cure their disease by applying \"good\" bacteria. While the first option is likely to encounter ethical barriers, there are a few researchers attempting the latter.\nThe limited clinical trials that have been published, however, do show promising results. Most focus on using live bacteria to treat eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis. They are based on the findings that the skin of people with eczema is dominated by Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium that can often be pathogenic.\n\"One of the big problems in the skin for diseases like eczema, is that certain pathogenic bacteria like S. aureus live on the surface of the skin and cause rashes, cause disease, and cause infection,\" says Gallo, whose own research group has been searching for ways of harnessing the skin microbiome to fight off the harmful bacteria found thriving on eczema patients. \"We mined the bacteria types that usually live on healthy skin looking for bacteria that could produce things that would fight off those bad bacteria\".\nGallo's are focusing on Staphylococcus hominis, a naturally occurring skin bacterium which is present in 21% of healthy people, but only 1% of atopic dermatitis patients.\n\"Our skin provides commensal bacteria like S. hominis with a safe place to live, so some of them have evolved a way of protecting their environment from these bad bacteria that are trying to invade,\" says Gallo.\nIn the case of S. hominis, the bacterium produces anti-microbial peptides \u2013 small fragments of protein \u2013 which directly kill S. aureus. They also produce chemicals called \"autoinducing peptides\", which stop bacterial cells from communicating with one another. Some bacteria like S. aureus signal to one another when their population density reaches a certain level \u2013 a mechanism known as quorum sensing \u2013 triggering the secretion of toxins that can cause skin inflammation. Disrupting that communication can prevent the toxins from being released.\nIn 2021, Gallo's team conducted a phase one randomised controlled trial with 54 adults with atopic dermatitis by applying a cream containing live S. hominis over the course of one week. The results showed that treatment with S. hominis dramatically reduced S. aureus\u00a0colonisation, and even decreased the redness and itch associated with atopic dermatitis in a subgroup of patients compared to a control group given a placebo cream.\nThe findings suggest that using special formulations of living bacteria could well help to make the skin's microbiome healthier. But more work needs to be done to prove its effectiveness before it can be used as a treatment. The team are now recruiting for a phase two randomised trial which will assess the efficacy of the treatment over a longer 14 week timescale.\u00a0\nElsewhere, other researchers have also had success treating eczema with probiotics. In one 2003 clinical trial, 11 patients with atopic dermatitis were given a cream containing the bacterium\u00a0Streptococcus thermophiles, which they applied for two weeks. The results showed\u00a0that the cream enhanced the skin's production of ceramides \u2013 lipids that help to keep the skin hydrated and maintain it as a healthy barrier.\u00a0\nMore recently, in 2018 10 adults and five children with atopic dermatitis were given a \"microbiome transplant\", where live Roseomonas mucosa bacteria collected from the skin of healthy volunteers was then applied to the skin of the patients twice a week. After 16 weeks, the treatment improved their symptoms by more than 50%.\nAlthough clinical trials focusing on other skin conditions are somewhat rarer, they also show promising results. Acne, for example, is linked to colonisation by the bacterium Cutibacterium acnes. Some researchers are therefore looking for bacteria that produce antimicrobial peptides to inhibit or kill this bacterium. In one clinical trial, a lotion containing\u00a0the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis\u00a0was given to patients suffering from severe acne. The lotion significantly reduced pustules compared to a placebo lotion.\nPaetzold and his company S-Biomedic, meanwhile, published a clinical trial in 2019 where they gave patients with acne a cream containing specific strains of Cutibacterium acnes. The results showedsome reduction in acne.\u00a0\nGallo is also researching whether a strain of Staphylococcus capitis bacteria could be an effective acne treatment, with studies in animals showing promising results.\u00a0\n\"The basic mechanism of action is very straightforward. It just inhibits the C. acnes growth, much in the same way that topical antibiotics or oral antibiotics are used to treat acne,\" says Gallo.\u00a0\nUnlike topical antibiotics, however, the treatment specifically targets C. acnes, so the wider skin microbiome is left unharmed, he says.\nGallo's team has even found a specific strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria that produce molecules that may inhibit the development of sun induced skin cancer.\n\"It generates a small molecule that inhibits DNA synthesis in transformed or mutagenic skin cells,\" says Gallo. \"We've found in \nanimal models\n that if these bacteria are present on the surface of mice that undergo UV radiation damage, they get far fewer skin tumours than mice that have the same species of bacteria, but not the genes [in the bacteria] that make this anti-metabolite.\"\nOf course, such a treatment will have to go through much more testing and clinical trials before it can be shown to have a similar effect in humans.\nWhile most studies have looked at treating specific diseases with probiotics, there are also a few that have examined whether pre- or postbiotics could improve skin health generally.\u00a0 For example, some researchers are looking at whether inulin \u2013 a dietary fibre frequently found in cosmetics and personal care products \u2013 could serve as a prebiotic when taken as an oral supplement or applied topically to the skin. Preliminary results suggest that inulin makes the skin more smooth and supple, providing a more favourable environment for beneficial bacteria to thrive. Other studies have shown that slapping on sphingomyelinase, an\u00a0enzyme produced by bacteria such as Staphylococcus thermophilus \u2013 which are commonly found in fermented milk products and yogurt \u2013 can boost production of ceramides, which are needed to keep the skin healthy.\nHowever in all cases, large randomised double blind clinical trials \u2013 the gold standard of medical research \u2013 are needed to confirm whether any of these creams are effective.\u00a0\nFor example a recent review study examined all of the data from clinical trials conducted to date and concluded that while \"oral and topical probiotics appear to be effective for the treatment of certain inflammatory skin diseases and demonstrate a promising role in wound healing and skin cancer, more studies are needed to confirm these results\".\u00a0\nGallo agrees that more work is needed but is hopeful about the future of the field.\n\"It's moving in the right direction,\" he says. \"We've come to realise as a field that we need to understand what exactly they're doing, and there's a lot of efforts being put into that, as well as other ways to design microbes to help benefit us. So I'm very optimistic about where we'll be in a few years with probiotics.\"\nHowever for people who don't have a skin disease, but who might want to increase the smoothness of their skin, prevent wrinkles, or boost hydration levels, there is little evidence that probiotic creams readily available in shops will have any benefit.\n\"I think many of the probiotics on the market now don't have very strong evidence behind them, so I wouldn't recommend those necessarily,\" says Gallo. \"You can try them \u2013 but it might not be the best use of your money.\"\nWhile your skin microbiome changes as you age and encounter different environments, there are a few things you can do to help your skin's natural microbiome flourish.\n\"It's a two-way street, because the types of things that we're already doing to moisturise our skin or protect the skin from UV damage are creating an environment that's more hospitable for these beneficial organisms to live in,\" says Gallo.\n\"So normal skin care, appropriate moisturising and cleansing \u2013 all of those things will promote skin health.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Not like in the amateurs where you get protected from all the outside noise,\" said Orie, who makes his pro debut in Manchester on Saturday.\n\"You hear a lot of stories about it being a rough transition. You hear about the sharks that are coming for you.\"\nBut Orie - who in 2020 graduated with a first class honours degree in economics and management - would not succumb to the \"dirty\" side of boxing.\nAfter snubbing an offer from WWE, he assembled a trusted backroom team and signed with Frank Warren's Queensberry Promotions.\n\"We're not going to take the mick with the progression,\" Orie added. \"It will be slow enough so I can improve but not too fast that the wheels fall off within two years.\"\nOrie said he \"let Great Britain down\" after he lost by split decision to Davit Chaloyan at the Paris Olympics\nOrie will kick off his pro journey against Bosnian journeyman Milos Veletic. \nHe looked remarkably at ease with the spotlight as he shared his fascinating story on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC One Breakfast.\nHe opened up on the struggles of not being able to speak a word of English when he moved from Russia to England aged seven, and how he was inspired to take up boxing by Anthony Joshua.\n\"I've always felt I'm inferior. That I've got more to prove. That I'm not good enough and always have to push myself to get to the next level,\" he later told BBC Sport.\nOrie was equally engaging during light-hearted filming for social media, where in a play on his unique name he revealed why he thinks pineapple on pizza is not 'delicious'.\nWhen conversation turned to his early exit in Paris, however, it was clear his Olympic disappointment still cuts deep.\n\"I always wanted to get at tattoo of the Olympic rings it but I don't feel worthy of one. What have I got to celebrate? I didn't win any medals,\" he said.\nOrie's parents tell him he will one day change his mind, that to even reach the pinnacle of the amateur code should be celebrated.\nHe is not convinced, but nor is he wallowing in misery. \n\"It's life and life sometimes doesn't give you what you want - and that's OK,\" he added.\nThis video can not be played\nOrie, speaking to BBC Sport in 2021\nUnder the tutelage of Sheffield-based coach Grant Smith, Orie has found the \"mental shift\" in preparing for longer bouts - rather than three rounds in amateur boxing - quite challenging.\nHe acknowledges the strong depth in heavyweight boxing, particularly in Britain, but is confident he has the attributes to one day emulate his hero Joshua and win a world title.\n\"It's about the reach a world title brings,\" he says. \"More than anything, I was inspired by Joshua because of how he presented and conducted himself out of the ring.\"\nOrie is an ambassador for BoxWise, a charity which delivers 10-week, non-contact boxing programmes to disadvantaged young people in the UK.\n\"Some of the kids I've seen, they go home and have troubled and messy home lives. The gym is all they have,\" he said.\n\"A boxing gym could be the difference from potentially getting life in prison to having a disciplined lifestyle.\"\nThere is a long road ahead for Orie's world-title quest. It is no easy feat - there are great fighters who never fulfilled their potential.

I hope you enjoy them.\"\nThe music will be revealed on a box set of seven CDs (or nine vinyl discs), titled Tracks II: The Lost Albums.\nThe scale of the release is quite different from its predecessor, Tracks, whose four discs collected random off-cuts and b-sides from the first 25 years of Springsteen's career.\nAccording to a press release, Tracks II will feature 83 songs, of which 74 have never been officially released in any form.\nMany of the tracks, including Fugitive's Dream and Don't Back Down on Our Love, have circulated on bootlegs for years, but will finally be heard in studio quality. \nSpringsteen said the release had been made possible when the Covid-19 pandemic allowed him to \"finish everything I had in my vault\".\nFans have known for years that Springsteen's vault contains hours and hours of unheard material. \nSpeaking to Variety magazine in 2017, the star admitted: \"We've made many more records than we released. Why didn't we release those records? I didn't think they were essential. \n\"I might have thought they were good, I might have had fun making them... but over my entire work life, I felt like I released what was essential at a certain moment, and what I got in return was a very sharp definition of who I was, what I want to do, what I was singing about. \n\"And I still basically judge what I'm doing by the same set of rules.\"\nIn a video trailer for Tracks II, Springsteen added: \"I often read about myself in the '90s as having some lost period or something. \n\"And I really, really was working the whole time.\"\n\nFans will finally get to hear those \"lost\" songs in June. \nSpringsteen said they would offer a glimpse into the home recordings he made after the commercial success of Born To Run and Born In The USA freed him from the pressure of using commercial recording studios.\n\"The ability to record at home whenever I wanted allowed me to go into a wide variety of different musical directions,\" he said in a statement. \nThat includes the \"sonic experimeentation\" of Faithless, a film soundtrack to a movie that never got made.\nOther unreleased albums include the country-leaning Somewhere North of Nashville, cut in May 1995; and Twilight Hours, an orchestrated pop album that was written and recorded in the same period as 2018's Western Stars.\nThere are also the \"richly-woven border tales\" of Inyo, whose song titles - including The Aztec Dance and Ciudad Juarez - suggest a Latin American influence.\nSpringsteen described the last disc, Perfect World, as \"the one thing on this that wasn't initially conceived as an album\", instead highlighting several songs he wrote with longtime collaborator Joe Grushecky in the 1990s and early 2000s.\nAs a first taste of the collection, he released Rain In The River, from Perfect World, whose muscular drums and squalling feedback showcase the raw power of his regular backing band E Street Band.\n\nThe announcement comes a month before Springsteen kicks off his European tour, with dates in Manchester, Liverpool, Marseille, Berlin and Prague, amongst others.\nThe 75-year-old recently vowed to keep playing live \"until the wheels come off\", but said he had scaled back his tours after his wife, Patti Scialfa, was diagnosed with myeloma, a rare blood cancer.",

        "article_text": "Rural North Yorkshire is having its Hollywood moment. \nThe latest production to be filmed in the region is a new adaptation of the classic novel Wuthering Heights, which has just finished shooting in the Yorkshire Dales National Park.\nIt stars Australian actress Margot Robbie, who recently took the lead role in Barbie, and will play Cathy alongside Jacob Elordi's Heathcliff.\nEmily Bronte's novel was written in 1847 and set in the rugged Yorkshire moors.\nThe locations chosen for the new film included Arkengarthdale, Swaledale and the village of Low Row. Robbie, 35, stayed at the hotel Simonstone Hall, near Hawes, with other cast members.\nShe was also photographed in a white wedding gown surrounded by film crew for a scene believed to be her marriage to Heathcliff's rival, Edgar Linton.\nFashion bible Vogue has criticised her dress as being historically inaccurate, as the style was only popularised by Queen Victoria 40 years after the story is set.\nThe hotel is a \"historic country lodge\" where presenter Jeremy Clarkson famously got into a fight with a Top Gear producer in 2015. \nA staff member said Robbie was \"very lovely\" and even enjoyed a Sunday roast and afternoon tea there with her husband and new baby. \nThe employee told the BBC: \"The weekend was great fun, where she met lots of other guests and visitors and she introduced her baby to the resident pigs and peacocks here.\" \nThe film crew's base camp was near Holiday Home Yorkshire in Reeth, whose owner said it was \"very exciting\" seeing the trailers in the tiny village. \nOne local holiday let owner said he saw Robbie driving a tractor with her co-star - although the agricultural vehicles were not invented until the late 19th Century.\nHe said: \"There were four tractors, old-fashioned open-to-the-elements style and they were being escorted by two Range Rovers.\"\nAnother Dales resident said he had seen filming at Surrender Bridge, which is close to an old lead smelting mill. The landmark also featured in the opening scene of the BBC series All Creatures Great and Small in the 1980s and is on the Coast to Coast path route.\nCrew members also stayed at the Charles Bathurst Inn, in Arkengarthdale, and were described as \"very friendly\". \nThe film, directed by Emerald Fennell, is due for release in February 2026. \nThere are hopes that it will lead to an upsurge in interest in the Bronte sisters and their work.\nThe director of the Bronte Parsonage Museum, a literary museum located at the former Bronte family home in Haworth, West Yorkshire, said: \"Every screen or theatre adaptation brings something fresh for contemporary audiences to think about. \n\"It is a testimony of Emily's legacy that her writing continues to inspire creatives today and we look forward to seeing what Emerald Fennell's adaptation adds to the mix.\" \nHaworth Parsonage is where Emily Bronte wrote Wuthering Heights and lived with her sisters Charlotte and Anne, and it was gifted to the Bronte Society in 1928. \nIt has the largest collection of Bront\u00eb items in the world. \nDirector Rebecca Yorke added: \"We're also delighted that some filming has taken place at nearby locations and hope that this will attract new visitors to the area and to the Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum.\" \nThere have been at least 10 film and television adaptations of Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte's only novel. \nOne of the most well-known was the 1939 version starring Merle Oberon as Cathy and Laurence Olivier as Heathcliff. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.\nOther high-profile actors who have played Heathcliff over the years include Ralph Fiennes, Tom Hardy and Richard Burton. \nMeanwhile, North Yorkshire was also the filming location for a Christmas film starring Rebel Wilson and Kiefer Sutherland. \nTinsel Town will be released in December 2025 and was shot in Knaresborough.\nWilson, 45, said at the time she \"loved\" the area and had been practising her Yorkshire accent. \nIn 2021, Tom Cruise surprised locals of Pickering when he touched down in a helicopter to shoot scenes for Mission: Impossible at a heritage railway. \nThe owner of a local B&B said in a Facebook post they had been walking the dog when they \"bumped into\" the Hollywood megastar.\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.",

        "article_text": "Rural North Yorkshire is having its Hollywood moment. \nThe latest production to be filmed in the region is a new adaptation of the classic novel Wuthering Heights, which has just finished shooting in the Yorkshire Dales National Park.\nIt stars Australian actress Margot Robbie, who recently took the lead role in Barbie, and will play Cathy alongside Jacob Elordi's Heathcliff.\nEmily Bronte's novel was written in 1847 and set in the rugged Yorkshire moors.\nThe locations chosen for the new film included Arkengarthdale, Swaledale and the village of Low Row. Robbie, 35, stayed at the hotel Simonstone Hall, near Hawes, with other cast members.\nShe was also photographed in a white wedding gown surrounded by film crew for a scene believed to be her marriage to Heathcliff's rival, Edgar Linton.\nFashion bible Vogue has criticised her dress as being historically inaccurate, as the style was only popularised by Queen Victoria 40 years after the story is set.\nThe hotel is a \"historic country lodge\" where presenter Jeremy Clarkson famously got into a fight with a Top Gear producer in 2015. \nA staff member said Robbie was \"very lovely\" and even enjoyed a Sunday roast and afternoon tea there with her husband and new baby. \nThe employee told the BBC: \"It was a very positive stay for over a week and they enjoying the restaurant and and eating in the bar with her co-stars and production crew too.\n\"The weekend was great fun, where she met lots of other guests and visitors and she introduced her baby to the resident pigs and peacocks here.\" \nThe film crew's base camp was near Holiday Home Yorkshire in Reeth, whose owner said it was \"very exciting\" seeing the trailers in the tiny village. \nOne local holiday let owner said he saw Robbie driving a tractor with her co-star - although the agricultural vehicles were not invented until the late 19th Century.\nHe said: \"There were four tractors, old-fashioned open-to-the-elements style and they were being escorted by two Range Rovers.\"\nAnother Dales resident said he had seen filming at Surrender Bridge, which is close to an old lead smelting mill. The landmark also featured in the opening scene of the BBC series All Creatures Great and Small in the 1980s and is on the Coast to Coast path route.\nCrew members also stayed at the Charles Bathurst Inn, in Arkengarthdale, and were described as \"very friendly\". \nThe film, directed by Emerald Fennell, is due for release in February 2026. \nThere are hopes that it will lead to an upsurge in interest in the Bronte sisters and their work.\nThe director of the Bronte Parsonage Museum, a literary museum located at the former Bronte family home in Haworth, West Yorkshire, said: \"Every screen or theatre adaptation brings something fresh for contemporary audiences to think about. \n\"It is a testimony of Emily's legacy that her writing continues to inspire creatives today and we look forward to seeing what Emerald Fennell's adaptation adds to the mix.\" \nHaworth Parsonage is where Emily Bronte wrote Wuthering Heights and lived with her sisters Charlotte and Anne, and it was gifted to the Bronte Society in 1928. \nIt has the largest collection of Bront\u00eb items in the world. \nDirector Rebecca Yorke added: \"We're also delighted that some filming has taken place at nearby locations and hope that this will attract new visitors to the area and to the Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum.\" \nThere have been at least 10 film and television adaptations of Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte's only novel. \nOne of the most well-known was the 1939 version starring Merle Oberon as Cathy and Laurence Olivier as Heathcliff. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.\nOther high-profile actors who have played Heathcliff over the years include Ralph Fiennes, Tom Hardy and Richard Burton. \nMeanwhile, North Yorkshire was also the filming location for a Christmas film starring Rebel Wilson and Kiefer Sutherland. \nTinsel Town will be released in December 2025 and was shot in Knaresborough.\nWilson, 45, said at the time she \"loved\" the area and had been practising her Yorkshire accent. \nIn 2021, Tom Cruise surprised locals of Pickering when he touched down in a helicopter to shoot scenes for Mission: Impossible at a heritage railway. \nThe owner of a local B&B said in a Facebook post they had been walking the dog when they \"bumped into\" the Hollywood megastar.\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.",

        "article_text": "Blanche Hosched\u00e9-Monet has barely been acknowledged in art history. But not only did she help her stepfather Claude, she created her own fine works \u2013 often of the same scenes as him.\nHaystack at Giverny, Poplars at the Water's Edge, Morning on the Seine. These painting titles bring only one name to mind \u2013 the great Claude Monet, whose flickering evocations of light and atmosphere are the cornerstone of Impressionism.\u00a0\nBut\u00a0while Monet painted\u00a0these very subjects, the paintings\u00a0belong to the oeuvre of his stepdaughter, and subsequently daughter-in-law, Blanche Hosched\u00e9-Monet (1865\u20131947). She learned to paint at Monet's shoulder, and exhibited and sold her work through the leading Parisian dealers of the time. Her finest paintings suggest an artist of such flair that you wonder how she has slipped from history's grasp.\u00a0\nA new exhibition and accompanying monograph \u2013 the artist's first \u2013 seeks to restore her reputation.\u00a0Blanche Hosched\u00e9-Monet in the Light\u00a0at The Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Museum of Art, Indiana, brings together 40 of her paintings, along with sketchbooks, photographs and letters, establishing not just her impressionist credentials, but her role as Monet's assistant and companion on\u00a0plein air\u00a0painting expeditions \u2013 the only one of his children, blood-related or otherwise, whose passion for painting mirrored his own.\nThe difficulty of extracting Hosched\u00e9-Monet from history has been compounded by the fact that few of her 300-ish works are in public collections. In her native France, the former Mus\u00e9e Municipal de Vernon, near the Normandy village of Giverny, where the Monet family lived for decades, holds the largest number \u2013 eight paintings and one pastel \u2013 and was\u00a0valiantly renamed the Mus\u00e9e Blanche Hosched\u00e9-Monet last year to coincide with the 150th anniversary of Impressionism. Meanwhile Paris's Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay (widely regarded as the best collection of Impressionist art)\u00a0has only a further two \u2013 neither of which, at the time of writing, is on display.\nThere are no Hosched\u00e9-Monet paintings in British public collections at all, and in the US, only one, The Weeping Willows on the Lily Pond at Giverny (c 1893-7) at the Columbus Museum of Art in Ohio. The Indiana exhibition is the artist's first solo show on US soil, in fact, and an indication that her reputation is finally growing.\n\"While Hosched\u00e9-Monet's work remains relatively unknown and somewhat underappreciated in the marketplace, it is clear that she is gaining more recognition with collectors and institutions,\" says Julia Leveille, head of modern-day auctions at Sotheby's New York.\" Strong prices have been set for her work at auction recently, and we are excited to see where her market goes from here.\"\nHosched\u00e9-Monet was the daughter of Eugene Hosched\u00e9, a wealthy businessman and connoisseur of avant-garde painting. \u00c9douard Manet, Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, Mary Cassatt and of course Monet were regular guests at his beautiful homes on the Boulevard Haussmann in Paris, and at his estate at Montgeron, on the city's edge.\u00a0\nHosched\u00e9-Monet was 11 when she first met Claude Monet in 1876. The then-35-year-old had been commissioned by her father to paint a quartet of panels for the dining room at Montgeron. Hosched\u00e9 was an important early patron of Monet's \u2013 in fact, it was he who bought Impression, Sunrise (1872), the painting that gave Impressionism its name.\u00a0\n\"I remember his arrival. He was introduced to me as a great artist, and he had long hair,\" she recollected in autobiographical notes she wrote towards the end of her life, which her brother Jean-Pierre then used as a basis for a personal and intimate account of Monet's life and family at Giverny. \" That struck me, and I immediately had sympathy for him because we could tell he was fond of children.\"\nIn her notes, Hosched\u00e9-Monet also singled out Monet's Springtime or The Reader (1872) as the painting she loved most in her father's considerable collection. She was \"deeply struck\", she said, by the touches of sunlight on the skirt of the woman \u2013\u00a0Monet's first wife, Camille.\nThe six months Monet spent at Montgeron in 1876 led to a magnificent set of paintings that includes the much-loved Turkeys and Willows at the River's Edge, though they did not remain in Hosched\u00e9's possession for long. Dire financial pressures forced him to sell most of his collection in 1878, along with both of his homes.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How Monet changed the way we see London\n\u2022 The overlooked painting that unlocked Impressionism\n\u2022 The surprising story of Van Gogh's guardian angel\nMonet brought Hosched\u00e9, his wife Alice and their six children (Marthe, Blanche, Suzanne, Jacques, Germaine, and Jean-Pierre) to live with him, Camille and their two sons Jean, 11, and newborn Michel, at his home in V\u00e9theuil, northwest of Paris.\nCamille's\u00a0health deteriorated post-partum,\u00a0however, and in 1879 she died, after which Alice and Monet entered into \"what we believe was a domestic partnership,\" says Haley Pierce, co-curator of Blanche Hosched\u00e9-Monet in the Light. But they didn\u2019t marry until 1892, after Hosched\u00e9 had passed away. [Hosched\u00e9] had been estranged from the family for a while at this point.\"\nJuvenalia aside, the earliest works in the show date from 1882, when the newly-merged family rented a house in the seaside resort of Pourville, near Dieppe. Monet's painting Cliff Walk at Pourville features the then-17-year-old Hosched\u00e9-Monet with her elder sister, Marthe, and Hosched\u00e9-Monet filled a sketchbook with her own sunlit views.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn spring 1883, Monet moved the family to Giverny, where Hosched\u00e9-Monet began to paint in earnest. Delighted by her enthusiasm, he began taking her with him on his outdoor\u00a0painting expeditions. According to the biography of Hosched\u00e9-Monet's which her brother Jean-Pierre also wrote, \"she helped him in all circumstances\u2026 transporting his canvases and easel as well as her own. She did it all with the help of a wheelbarrow, following elusive paths, across fields and meadows sometimes drenched in dew. That was the case, for example, with his morning views of the Seine. Here again, she would help her stepfather by taking up the oars of the canoe.\"\nMonet also suggested exhibitions she might enjoy. In 1891, for instance, he asked his friend Gustave Geffroy, an influential critic, to obtain a pass for her to the Salon of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts, and later that year, took her with him to dine at the home of the British artist James McNeill Whistler in London (they were visiting her brother Jacques in Lymington) and to see the famous Peacock Room that Whistler created for shipping magnate Frederick Leyland's mansion near Hyde Park.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nMonet's 1887 painting In the Woods at Giverny: Blanche Hosched\u00e9 at Her Easel with Suzanne Hosched\u00e9 Reading, confirms that he and Hosched\u00e9 set up their easels within spitting distance of each other, or even, if she is the figure in the white dress at an easel in John Singer Sargent's oil sketch, Monet in his Bateau Atelier (also 1887), squashed together in the floating studio which Monet designed to paint while drifting along the river.\nUnsurprisingly, then, Hosched\u00e9-Monet's paintings often share her mentor's visual vocabulary: Shadows on the Meadow (Giverny, the Ajoux plain) matches his Spring Landscape at Giverny (1894) for instance, and\u00a0The Small Grainstacks (Les Moyettes) (c 1894) his\u00a0Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) (1890-91). Julie Manet, daughter of the impressionist Berthe Morisot and Manet's brother Eug\u00e8ne, would also describe two of Blanche's paintings of \"trees reflected in the Epte [that] are very like Monsieur Monet's painting\" while visiting Giverny in 1893.\u00a0\nAs Hosched\u00e9-Monet's great-nephew, the art historian Philippe Piguet, further explains, \"her touch is more emphatic, out of concern for capturing what she saw on her canvas rather than what she felt\" \u2013 meaning that Hosched\u00e9-Monet's paintings can be described as more solid or direct in their rendering and composition, and less atmospheric, as compared to Monet. She also preferred to paint a subject from varying viewpoints, he adds, rather than, as Monet did, at different times of day.\nConsider her painting Haystack at Giverny alongside the Monet Haystacks at Giverny (1893) that was\u00a0sold at Sotheby's last year. \"They're at the same or approximate location, but she has distinctly chosen a different view,\" says Pierce. \"Her painting is also more solid. She has less interest in the quality of atmosphere, and more in really getting down her subject. Her compositions are very well thought out.\"\nBy now, Hosched\u00e9-Monet was blooming. The previous year, the US artist Theodore Robinson noted in his diary: \"I saw some things by Mlle Blanche, she has improved greatly since I saw her work last \u2013 a spring landscape, sold to [the Chicago millionaire] Potter Palmer quite charming.\" Her rapid progress excited Monet, too: away in Norway in 1895, he wrote to Alice, \"I can't wait to see what she has done in my absence, especially from what you tell me\".\u00a0\nIn 1897, Hosched\u00e9-Monet married Jean and they moved to Rouen, but returned to Giverny at weekends. For a time, her upward trajectory continued \u2013 in 1905, she began exhibiting with the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in Paris, and in 1907 the Salon de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Rouennais \u2013 but when Jean had a serious fall in 1912, she gave up painting to care for him.\nWhen Jean died two years later, Hosched\u00e9-Monet returned to live at Giverny, where the recently widowed Monet was panic-stricken that he was losing his sight and finding it difficult to work. Her decision delighted his friends. Geffroy told her he was \"happy for him and happy for you. Your mutual misfortune makes your reunion stronger.\"\nHer reassuring presence gave Monet the strength he required to begin the monumental compositions of water lilies that occupied his final years and which he hoped would create\u00a0\"the illusion of an endless whole\". The exhibition includes a photograph of him working on these \"Grand Decorations\", as he called them, with Hosched\u00e9 Monet at his side.\u00a0\nMonet's close friend, Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, later wrote that she had prepared the canvas grounds, but Hosched\u00e9-Monet refuted the claim. \"Contrary to what has been said and what has been written, I didn't make a brushstroke on [Monet's] canvases. It would have been a sacrilege.\" She also described Monet's death in 1926: \"It was the soul of the house who left\u2026 Everything here was illuminated by him.\"\nWith Michel's approval, Hosched\u00e9-Monet remained at Giverny for the rest of her life, caring for the house and studio, and tending to Monet's beloved gardens. She resumed painting again almost immediately, and in 1927\u00a0had her first solo exhibition at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune in Paris. Critics took great interest in her renaissance,\u00a0with one from newspaper Le Peuple proclaiming her \"more than the heiress of a great name\".\nImpressionism lost its grip on the art world almost as soon as Monet died, but Hosched\u00e9-Monet always remained loyal to her mentor's painting style. We might see her as the comet's tail of that hugely influential artistic movement, though perhaps her greatest contribution to it was her steadfast support. \"Without her, Claude Monet would have lived in an isolation that would have killed him,\" wrote the art dealer Ren\u00e9 Gimpel. \"It was she who kept him alive for us, posterity must not forget her.\"\nBlanche Hosched\u00e9-Monet in the Light is at the The Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Museum of Art, Indiana until 15 June.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0\nsign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.For more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on \nFacebook, \nX and \nInstagram\n.",

        "article_text": "Fundamentally wrong, was how Germany's outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, described the new Trump tariffs.\nA unilateral attack - that was the view of Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called them brutal, unfounded and certain to have a \"massive impact\" on the European economy.\nHe convened an emergency meeting with representatives of French businesses most affected by the newly announced 20% tariffs on EU goods sold to the US and issued a call to arms to European business \"not to invest in America for some time until we have clarified things\".\n\"What message would we send by having major European players investing billions of euros in the American economy at a time when [the US] is hitting us?\" he said.\nFor France it's wine, champagne and the aeronautical industry, for Germany it's cars, and for Italy it's luxury goods. It's well known these sectors sell well abroad and now risk being clobbered by US import taxes. \nOverall, the chemicals, machinery and equipment industries in the EU are seen as the most vulnerable to the tariffs.\nBut dig a little deeper and there are other EU sectors, reliant on the US market, that could come as a bit of a surprise. \nFrench cognac, generally dismissed as an old person's tipple in Europe, is the booze of choice for many American rappers, playing a prominent role in the music and lifestyle of stars like Jay-Z, 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg. More than 40% of French brandy is exported to the US.\nSpain exports a lot of gas turbines to the US, alongside tonnes of olive oil.\nWhen we look at which EU countries are most exposed to the US in terms of GDP, the picture is also not quite what you might imagine.\nIreland is highly dependent on the US in terms of goods and services. Those exports - a lot linked to the pharmaceutical industry (which is currently exempt from the 20% tariffs, until the US boosts its own production) and also tech - make up a fifth of Ireland's GDP.\nCyprus, Luxembourg and Malta are more exposed than the EU average in terms of services exports. \nBelgium, the Netherlands and Slovakia are in a similar position when it comes to goods. \nGermany has a greater exposure to the US than the other major EU economies, at over 5% of GDP, followed by Italy (about 4%), France (3%) and Spain (just over 2%). These figures were collated in 2024 by CaixaBank research based on Eurostat figures for the previous year.\nThe response to the new US tariffs is being coordinated at EU HQ in Brussels. The European Commission deals with all overarching trade matters for the bloc's members. \nCommission President Ursula von der Leyen claims they hold \"a lot of cards\", including the strength to negotiate and the power to push back.\nThe US economy is mighty. It makes up 25% of global GDP. \nBut the EU single market of 450 million people (the biggest single market in the world) stands very close in size at 22% of global GDP. \nSo, yes, the EU can bite - hard - as well as bark when it comes to retaliating against Donald Trump's tariffs. Especially if, as EU figures have suggested, the bloc targets US services like Big Tech, possibly including Apple, Meta, Amazon and even Elon Musk's platform X.\nBut that risks a new backlash by the Trump administration. And the EU wants to avoid upping the ante.\nIf you take politics into account, not just economics, the EU has less room for manoeuvre than you might think. \nTake energy supplies, the EU has been buying US liquified natural gas (LNG) after it weaned itself off Russian gas following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \nTricky to reduce or heavily tax those imports. That would badly impact EU consumers, not only US industry, and it would worsen already dismal relations with the US. \nThink of all the recent rows over defence spending and Ukraine. Aside from the economic hell the EU sees and hopes to avoid in the new Trump tariffs, the bloc also really wants to sidestep a trade war with the country that used to be Europe's best friend.\nSo, the Brussels plan is: threaten heavy retaliation, hope Donald Trump is persuaded to negotiate, then pray he'll stage a U-turn on tariffs. \nThe EU's trade commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, says he's speaking to his US counterparts on Friday. It's an opening gambit. The EU is in no rush to retaliate.\nThe Trump administration has ruled out any country negotiating its way out of the new tariffs before they become live this weekend. But after that, what could the EU offer the US president to persuade him to back down?\nTrump is incandescent about the EU's massive trade surplus. It sells far more goods than it buys from the US. The surplus for 2024 was around $200bn (\u20ac180bn; $153bn).\nIt's the other way round when it comes to services - the US sells far more to the EU than the other way round. That is why the EU thinks its main retaliatory leverage against the US would lie in services, like banks and big tech.\nTo redress the goods imbalance, the EU could offer to buy more LNG from the US, or more military equipment, following its pledge to Washington to do more for its own security.\nBut that would break a different EU promise - to boost withering European arms industries by trying to buy EU when re-arming EU countries. It is something the US has already objected to, so that's tricky.\nBrussels could also cut direct and indirect tariffs on US goods. It could lose quotas on US agricultural produce.\nIt would be hugely reluctant to comply with another US ask: to water down its much-trumpeted digital regulations, aimed at limiting monopolies and placing restrictions on speech and content in the EU.\nHow do you price in the possible collapse of the international trading system, EU officials ask.\nEuropean firms fret about their markets being flooded by cheap goods from non-EU countries that are also hit by Trump tariffs and seeking to sell elsewhere. \nThe risk is very real when it comes to China. Trump is slapping more that 50% tariffs on Beijing when you add it all up.\nWould the EU have to ratchet up its import duties on Chinese goods to protect itself and could that lead to an unintended trade war with China?\nThese are anxious and hugely uncertain economic times.\nWhich is why the European Commission says it also wants to focus on matters it can control - if EU capitals agree - and that is reducing internal barriers within the EU single market. \nThose barriers, such as tax regimes, vary from country to country and impact the EU's overall economic growth and competitiveness. \nThe IMF calculates they're equivalent to a 45% tariff on EU manufacturing; 110% when it comes to services.\nThat is far higher than the tariffs now imposed on the EU by Donald Trump. \nEU countries say they're united in combating those. So far they've been divided over completing their own internal market.",

        "article_text": "April Hubbard sits on the theatre stage where she plans to die later this year.\nShe is not terminally ill, but the 39-year-old performance and burlesque artist has been approved for assisted dying under Canada's increasingly liberal laws.\nWarning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing\nShe is speaking to BBC News from the Bus Stop Theatre, an intimate auditorium with a little under 100 seats, in the eastern city of Halifax, Nova Scotia.\nIlluminated by a single spotlight on a stage she has performed on many times before, she tells me she plans to die here \"within months\" of her imminent 40th birthday. She'll be joined by a small group of her family and friends.\nApril plans to be in a \"big comfy bed\" for what she calls a \"celebratory\" moment when a medical professional will inject a lethal dose into her bloodstream.\n\"I want to be surrounded by the people I love and just have everybody hold me in a giant cuddle puddle and get to take my last breath, surrounded by love and support,\" she says.\nApril was born with spina bifida and was later diagnosed with tumours at the base of her spine which she says have left her in constant, debilitating pain.\nShe's been taking strong opioid painkillers for more than 20 years and applied for Medical Assistance in Dying (Maid) in March 2023. While she could yet live for decades with her condition, she qualified to end her life early seven months after applying. For those who are terminally ill it is possible to get approval within 24 hours.\n\"My suffering and pain are increasing and I don't have the quality of life anymore that makes me happy and fulfilled,\" April says. Every time she moves or breathes, she says it feels like the tissues from the base of her spine \"are being pulled like a rubber band that stretches too far\", and that her lower limbs leave her in agony.\nWe meet April as, almost 3,000 miles away, MPs are scrutinising proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. They voted in principle in support of those plans in November 2024, but months of detailed scrutiny have followed - and further votes in the Commons and Lords are required before the bill could possibly become law.\nThis week, the BBC witnessed a man's death in California, where assisted dying laws are far more similar to those being considered in Westminster.\nCritics say Canada is an example of the \"slippery slope\", meaning that once you pass an assisted dying law it will inevitably widen its scope and have fewer safeguards.\nCanada now has one of the most liberal systems of assisted dying in the world, similar to that operating in the Netherlands and Belgium. It introduced Maid in 2016, initially for terminally ill adults with a serious and incurable physical illness, which causes intolerable suffering. In 2021, the need to be terminally ill was removed, and in two years' time, the Canadian government plans to open Maid to adults solely with a mental illness and no physical ailment.\nOpponents of Maid tell us that death is coming to be seen as a standard treatment option for those with disabilities and complex medical problems.\n\"It is easier in Canada to get medical assistance in dying than it is to get government support to live,\" says Andrew Gurza, a disability awareness consultant and friend of April's.\nAndrew, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, says he respects April's decision, but tells us: \"If my disability declines and my care needs got higher, I'd still want to be here. To know there's a law that's saying you could easily end your life - it's just really scary.\"\nBefore she was approved for Maid, April was assessed by two independent physicians who were required to inform her of ways to alleviate her suffering and offer alternative treatments.\n\"The safeguards are there,\" she says, when we press her about disabled people who feel threatened by assisted dying, or whether Maid is being used as a shortcut to better quality care. \"If it's not right for you and you're not leading the charge and choosing Maid, you're not going to be able to access it unless it's for the right reasons,\" she adds.\nThere were 15,343 Maid deaths in 2023, representing around one in 20 of all deaths in Canada - a proportion that has increased dramatically since 2016 and is one of the highest in the world. The average age of recipients was 77.\nIn all but a handful of cases, the lethal dose was delivered by a doctor or nurse, which is also known as voluntary euthanasia. One doctor we spoke to, Eric Thomas, said he had helped 577 patients to die.\nDr Konia Trouton, president of the Canadian Association of Maid Assessors and Providers, has also helped hundreds of patients to die since the law was introduced.\nThe procedure is the same each time - she arrives at the home of the person who has been given approval for Maid and asks if they wish to go ahead with it that day. She says the patients always direct the process and then give her the \"heads up and ready to go\".\n\"That gives me an honour and a duty and a privilege to be able to help them in those last moments with their family around them, with those who love them around them and to know that they've made that decision thoughtfully, carefully and thoroughly,\" she adds.  If the answer is yes, she opens her medical bag.\nDemonstrating to the BBC what happens next, Dr Trouton briefly puts a tourniquet on my arm. She shows me where the needle would be inserted into a vein in the back of my hand to allow an intravenous infusion of lethal drugs.\nIn her medical bag she also has a stethoscope. \"Strangely, these days I use it more to determine if someone has no heartbeat rather than if they do,\" she tells me.\nA list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line\nSome 96% of Maid provisions are under \"track one\" where death is \"reasonably foreseeable\". Dr Trouton says that means patients are on a \"trajectory toward death\", which might range from someone who has rapidly spreading cancer and only weeks to live or another with Alzheimer's \"who might have five to seven years\".\nThe other 4% of Maid deaths come under \"track two\". These are adults, like April, who are not dying but have suffering which is intolerable to them from a \"grievous and irremediable medical condition\".\nThat is in stark contrast to Labour MP Kim Leadbeater's bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales, which says patients must be expected to die within six months. The Westminster bill would not allow doctors to give a lethal dose \u2013 rather patients would have to self-administer the drugs, usually by swallowing them.\nDeath via intravenous infusion normally takes just a few minutes, as the lethal drugs go straight into the bloodstream, whereas swallowing the drugs means patients usually take around an hour or two to die, but can take considerably longer, although they are usually unconscious after a few minutes.\nDr Trouton told me she regarded the Canadian system as quicker and more effective, as do other Maid providers. \"I'm concerned that if some people can't swallow because of their disease process, and if they're not able to take the entire quantity of medication because of breathing difficulties or swallowing difficulties, what will happen?\"\nBut opponents argue it's being used as a cheaper alternative to providing adequate social or medical support.\nOne of them is Dr Ramona Coelho, a GP in London, Ontario, whose practice serves many marginalised groups and those struggling to get medical and social support. She's part of a Maid Death Review Committee, alongside Dr Trouton, which examines cases in the province.\nDr Coelho told me that Maid was \"out of control\". \"I wouldn't even call it a slippery slope,\" she says \"Canada has fallen off a cliff.\"\n\"When people have suicidal ideations, we used to meet them with counselling and care, and for people with terminal illness and other diseases we could mitigate that suffering and help them have a better life,\" she says. \"Yet now we are seeing that as an appropriate request to die and ending their lives very quickly.\"\nWhile at Dr Coelho's surgery I was introduced to Vicki Whelan, a retired nurse whose mum Sharon Scribner died in April 2023 of lung cancer, aged 81. Vicki told me that in her mum's final days in hospital she was repeatedly offered the option of Maid by medical staff, describing it as like a \"sales pitch\".\nThe family, who are Catholic, discharged their mother so she could die at home, where Vicki says her mum had a \"beautiful, peaceful death\". \"It makes us think that we can't endure, and we can't suffer a little bit, and that somehow now they've decided that dying needs to be assisted, where we've been dying for years.\n\"All of a sudden now we're telling people that this is a better option. This is an easy way out and I think it's just robbing people of hope.\"\nSo is Canada an example of the so-called slippery slope? It's certainly true that the eligibility criteria has broadened dramatically since the law was introduced nine years ago, so for critics the answer would be an emphatic yes and serve as a warning to Britain.\nCanada's assisted dying laws were driven by court rulings. Its Supreme Court instructed Parliament that a prohibition on assisted dying breached the country's Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The extension of eligibility for those who were not terminally ill was in part a response to another court decision.\nIn Britain, judges in the most senior courts have repeatedly said any potential change to the law around assisted dying is a matter for Parliament, after the likes of Tony Nicklinson, Diane Pretty and Noel Conway brought cases arguing the blanket ban on assisted suicide breached their human rights.\nApril knows some people may look at her, a young woman, and wonder why she would die.\n\"We're the masters of masking and not letting people see that we're suffering,\" she says. \"But in reality, there's days that I just can't hide it, and there's many days where I can't lift my head off the pillow and I can't eat anymore.\n\"It's not a way I want to live for another 10 or 20 or 30 years.\"\nAdditional reporting by Joshua Falcon.",

        "article_text": "After graduating college Kelsey Krakora worked full time in a steakhouse, bartending and serving meals.\nShe had dabbled with selling clothes online, but only part-time. \nBut in 2021 that all changed for Cleveland-based Ms Krakora.\nShe switched to selling clothes on Whatnot and then Poshmark - online marketplaces where people can also use live video to sell items.\n\"My first live show with Poshmark was 27th November 2022. I sold zero things on my first show... but that didn't last long!\"\nNow she sells around 100 items per show, worth about $1,000 in sales (\u00a3773). \nHer shows are on average three hours long and she does between two and three a week.\n\"These events are inclusive, welcoming, you can shop in your PJs, and there's no need to head to the shopping mall,\" says Ms Krakora.\nLive shopping has been popular in the Asia-Pacific region for some time, where social networks such as China's Douyin regularly host live shopping streams, but now European and US brands are experimenting with this new way of selling their products.\nLive shopping is a close relative to shopping channels like QVC, where viewers are urged to call in and buy the products demonstrated by presenters. \nBut live shopping acts as a quicker shortcut from buyer to product, especially in the era of one-click purchases, made popular by online retailers such as Amazon.\nAlso, as younger generations increasingly cut the chord and can't access cable TV, shopping channels don't hold the same relevance as they once did.\nIt's estimated the live shopping market has reached $32bn, with the most active sectors being fashion, cosmetics and collectibles.\nA 2024 survey from digital commerce platform VTEX found that 45% of US consumers have browsed or purchased from live shopping events in the past 12 months. \n\nGuillaume Faure, chief executive of LiveMeUp, which provides live shopping video software, remembers when interest in live shopping surged.\n\"When Instagram introduced Reels, and when YouTube launched Shorts, we saw live shopping really take off.\" \nHe's noticed the popularity of tutorials and how-to videos in live shopping events, such as how hosts can teach shoppers how to apply a certain type of make-up, or arrange a variety of flowers to deliver the most evocative bouquet.\nHowever, some analysts think that live shopping is likely to have a limited appeal.\n\"Many companies have tried live shopping but it simply doesn't scale,\" says Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at Forrester Research.\n\"Maybe it works in China where they don't have the same kind of store density we have in the US, where it's better for consumers to go and try something on rather than watch a host try on a piece of clothing,\" she adds. \nJonathan Reynolds,  academic director of the Oxford Institute of Retail Management, University of Oxford, also highlights that the Chinese market is different.\n\"In China, so-called key opinion leaders (KOLs) like Li Jiaqi, the so-called 'Lipstick King, are well established,\" he says.\n\"Li has carefully built his personal brand to demonstrate his expertise and build consumer trust. KOLs are also working within much more sophisticated platform ecosystems,\" Mr Reynolds explains.\nEven Ms Krakora admits that not all products work on a live shopping stream.\nFor example, she prefers to shop for jeans in-person. \"I'm tall, and I have specific cuts of jeans that I wear,\" she says, \"and there are tried-and-true styles and brands I like.\"\nBruce Winder, a retail analyst in Toronto, also says that for some shoppers, the convenience of live shopping might be too attractive. \n\"Consumers may get addicted to the show or channel... and some consumers may not be able to stop watching and spending as they get caught up in the moment,\" he adds.\nDespite those potential pitfalls, major brands and platforms have jumped on the live shopping bandwagon.\nNordstrom, Kit Kat, Samsung and L'Oreal have sold products during these streams as hosts showcased new or discounted products, and joining Poshmark as the host for these events are Amazon, eBay, TikTok, YouTube and Instagram.\n\"Live shopping lets shoppers have a conversation with someone who knows the products being sold, and that generates a lot of excitement,\" says Manish Chandra, the chief executive and founder of Poshmark.\n\"It also creates a community where other shoppers are in the same show, and it's really a different experience than a traditional shopping trip.\"\nFor some brands live shopping has been a game-changer.\nHigh-end fragrance brand The House of Amouage partnered with Nordstrom in late 2024 to bring their live shopping events to the US.\nOman-based Amouage was following up on the success they enjoyed in China. In the 140 live streams they hosted with Chinese influencers on the social platforms Douyin and Taobao in 2023, they sold more than 3,000 units.\nThe firm's chief creative officer Renaud Salmon says it's helping the company learn about what its customers want. \n\"In the past, we would have used customer satisfaction surveys,\" says Mr Salmon, \"but with live shopping, we get feedback right away and I bring that back to my team to help refine our products.\"",

Cosmetic surgery is \"more normalised\", she added.\nSome of the growth in cosmetic surgery is also caused by people who previously had non-surgical procedures, like filler and Botox, now choosing to go under the knife because they were getting \"fatigue\" from repeatedly going to clinics to get the work done, Nugent said.\nAnd the rise of weight-loss injections such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro have played a role, too. Nugent said that some people taking these medications, also known as \"skinny jabs\", are getting surgery on their face.\n\"As they lose weight they start to notice deflation and some sagging of their face,\" she said.\nThe BAAPS statistics do not show how many people have surgery after taking weight-loss drugs, but Nugent said that of the patients she has treated, \"more and more\" are people taking the medications.\nPeople have cosmetic surgery for a wide range of reasons.\nKirsten White, 33, a talent acquisition specialist from Sheffield, had a breast reduction and uplift after losing weight with a gastric sleeve.\nShe said her \"breasts were basically down to my bellybutton\" before surgery, leading to backache and the need for physiotherapy, she said.\n\"I don't think people are surprised when I tell them I've had cosmetic surgery because I think it's pretty normal now,\" she said. \n\"There's not so much the stigma that there used to be that it's really taboo and people are a lot more supportive of doing what will make you feel happy.\"\nMen underwent 1,799 surgical procedures in 2024, a slight drop from 2023 - making up just 6.6% of all surgeries in the BAAPS dataset.\nNose jobs (rhinoplasty) remained the most popular among men, with 332 surgeries done in 2024, which is a 14% drop on 2023.\nFace and neck lifts increased by 26%, with 140 done in 2024, suggesting a growing interest in anti-aging procedures among men - though Nugent said it was harder to spot trends for men due to the smaller numbers treated.\nBeauty standards are shaped by social media and celebrity culture, said Dr Beth Daniels, director of the Centre for Appearance Research at UWE Bristol. \nThe pandemic also caused a shift, when the move towards video calls \"heightened our awareness of our appearance\" because people saw their own faces on their computer screens.\nDr Daniels said that society places value on youthful looks, which could push some women to get cosmetic procedures.\n\"As women age, they're often discounted in a number of ways\" and are \"made to feel invisible in society\", she said.\nBAAPS vice president Anthony Macquillan suggested the overall increase in facelifts could be linked to societal changes, such as the rising pension age.\nHe said: \"For many, this type of surgery is not just aesthetic but also functional, helping to maintain confidence, secure employment, and reduce anxiety associated with age-related bias.\"\nThe BAAPS data is based on statistics from 233 of its members. Jim Frame, president of the UK Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons and professor at Anglia Ruskin University, said that it does not cover all of the cosmetic surgery operations that happen in the UK because some is carried out by ENT and maxillofacial surgeons, or by non-BAAPS members, especially fillers and Botox.\nThe data also does not include surgeries carried out overseas, where the lower cost of treatment in countries like Turkey attracts Brits. \nCosmetic procedures and surgery carry risks and the NHS warns that they \"can lead to serious complications if they're not done correctly\". \nIt advises people to research thoroughly beforehand, including checking the credibility of the clinic and getting information about the most common complications of the procedure.\n\"There are a lot of susceptible people that are committing to surgeries that a fairly large proportion will regret,\" Prof Frame said.",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump's politics have shifted considerably over his decades in the public sphere. But one thing he has been consistent on, since the 1980s, is his belief that tariffs are an effective means of boosting the US economy.\nNow, he's staking his presidency on his being right.\nAt his Rose Garden event at the White House, surrounded by friends, conservative politicians and cabinet secretaries, Trump announced sweeping new tariffs on a broad range of countries \u2013 allies, competitors and adversaries alike.\nIn a speech that was equal parts celebration and self-congratulation, regularly punctuated by applause from the crowd, the president recalled his longtime support of tariffs, as well as his early criticism of free trade agreements like Nafta and the World Trade Organization.\nThe president acknowledged that he will face pushback in the coming days from \"globalists\" and \"special interests\", but he urged Americans to trust his instincts.\n\"Never forget, every prediction our opponents made about trade for the last 30 years has been proven totally wrong,\" he said.\nNow, in a second term in which he is surrounded by like-minded advisers and is the dominant force in a Republican Party that controls both chambers of Congress, Trump is in a position to turn his vision of a new America-focused trade policy into reality. These policies, he said, had made the United States into a wealthy nation more than a century ago and would again.\n\"For years, hard working American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense,\" he said. \"With today's action, we are finally going to be able to make America great again - greater than ever before.\"\nIt is still an enormous risk for this president to take.\nEconomists of all stripes warn that these massive tariffs \u2013 53% on China, 20% on the European Union and South Korea, with a 10% baseline on all nations \u2013 will be passed along to American consumers, raising prices and threatening a global recession.\nKen Rogoff, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, predicted that the chances of the US, the world's largest economy, falling into recession had risen to 50% on the back of this announcement.\n\"He just dropped a nuclear bomb on the global trading system,\" Mr Rogoff told the BBC World Service, adding that the consequences for this level of taxes on imports into the US \"is just mind-boggling\".\nTrump's move also risks escalating a trade war with other countries and alienating allies that America has otherwise tried to strengthen ties with. The US, for instance, sees Japan and South Korea as a bulwark against Chinese expansionist ambitions. But those three countries recently announced that they would work together to respond to America's trade policies.\nIf Trump is successful, however, he would fundamentally reshape a global economic order that America had originally helped to construct from the ashes of World War 2. He promises that this will rebuild American manufacturing, create new sources of revenue, and make America more self-reliant and insulated from the kind of global supply chain shocks that wreaked havoc on the US during the Covid pandemic.\nIt's a tall order \u2013 and one that many believe to be highly unrealistic. But for a president who seems fixated on cementing his legacy, whether through ending wars, renaming geographic locations, acquiring new territory or dismantling federal programmes and its workforce, this is the biggest, most consequential prize to be won.\nIt would be, he styled, America's \"liberation day\".\nWhat appears clear, however, is that Wednesday's announcement, if he follows through, is almost certain to mark a historic change. The question is whether it will be a legacy of achievement or one of notoriety.\nTrump's speech was triumphant - one that belied the potentially high costs his moves would impose on the American economy and on his own political standing.\nBut, he said, it was worth it - even if, at the very end of his remarks, a small shadow of presidential doubt may have peaked through the bravado.\n\"It's going to be a day that - hopefully - you're going to look back in years to come and you're going to say, you know, he was right.\"\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Willie Mullins (left) has now won back-to-back Grand Nationals \nTearful Willie Mullins said he had reached the peak of his record-breaking career as a trainer after his jockey son Patrick led home an unprecedented 1-2-3 in the Grand National.\nVictory confirmed the dominance of the Irish trainer, who saddled five of the first seven home, including winner Nick Rockett.\nThe Irish trainer is now odds-on to repeat his landmark success of last year by winning the British championship again.\n\"This is the summit for me, I don't think it can get any better than this. It's just huge. It's like something out of a Disney film,\" he said.\nNick Rockett won at Aintree from last year's winner I Am Maximus with fellow stablemate Grangeclare West in third.\nWillie is normally coolness personified, the even-tempered master of jump racing.\nLast year, when he became the first trainer to saddle 100 career winners at the Cheltenham Festival, he gave a tip of his trilby and a wave to the crowd.\nBut this was different. This was family.\n\"I don't know if I gave him a cheer, I was just speechless. I just broke down completely. I did for about 20 minutes after. I just couldn't help it, I just completely lost it,\" the 68-year-old told BBC Radio 5 Live.\nNick Rockett wins Grand National for Mullins duo\nGrand National 2025 result - where your horse finished\nPatrick, 35, is an amateur rider as a sideline to being his father's assistant at a training establishment in County Carlow that stands head and shoulders ahead of its jump racing rivals.\nStanding at 6ft 1in tall, Patrick's height and weight of about 11st 7lb limit the rides he can take, but the rocket that is Nick Rockett proved the ideal conveyance.\n\"To have one horse run in the National, but then to have one your son can ride is millions, millions, millions-to-one what happened today,\" said Willie.\n\"It is just something else to be able to leg up your son in the greatest race of all time.

        "article_text": "England Golf women's lead coach Steve Robinson will again caddie for Lottie Woad at the Augusta National Women's Amateur tournament\nIt was while standing on the 12th tee at Augusta National that Lottie Woad had one of those 'pinch me' moments.\nThe English amateur, from Farnham in Surrey, was seven holes away from securing a career highlight win that would kick-start a stellar 2024.\nIt was a year that started with her becoming the first European to claim the Augusta National Women's Amateur (ANWA) title at the home of the Masters - a title she will try to become the first to defend this week when the three-day competition starts on Wednesday.\nIt was a year in which the England Golf women's squad member played in her first majors, finished as top Briton at the Women's Open, helped win the Curtis Cup, and ended it as the world's number-one-ranked amateur.\n\"It was definitely a breakthrough year,\" the 21-year-old tells BBC Sport. \"Winning at Augusta was the highlight and that kicked off the whole year.\"\n\"I have respect for everyone playing the 12th hole because it looks bigger than it actually is, but there is not much room. It's probably like 20 feet deep max.\"\nAnd it was on the back nine at Augusta - where so many Masters dreams have flourished and floundered - that Woad managed to keep her nerve.\nThe 12th was among the pivotal holes and she had to steady herself to tackle one of the most daunting par-threes in golf.\nDozens of rounds have been ruined on this most picturesque of holes. Tiger Woods hit three balls in Rae's Creek, the water that protects the front of the green, on his way to a 10 in 2020, the year after he won his fifth Green Jacket.\n\"You're standing on the tee and you're just like, 'I'm on hole 12',\" she says.\n\"You're nervous but then you're also going 'I'm playing the 12th at Augusta', so it's not too bad.\"\nWoad, who went into the final round of the 54-hole event - of which the first 36 are played at the nearby Champions Retreat Golf Club - with a two-shot lead, marked a three on her card to stay at six under. \nBut up ahead American Bailey Shoemaker was putting the finishing touches to the first bogey-free round at Augusta in the five-year history of the ANWA. A sensational 66 set a target of seven under.\nA bogey on the par-five 13th meant Woad dropped two behind, but she produced a magical finish with three birdies in her final four holes to snatch victory on the final green.\nThe putt on the 18th was an 18-footer, downhill.\n\"It didn't have much break but it was pretty quick,\" she says.\n\"Then it went in and I've won at Augusta and everyone kind of went crazy.\"\nWoad's season was about to get a little more crazy. The victory opened the door to play the majors, the Chevron Championship two weeks later being the first.\nShe spent a hectic week catching up with friends and college work at Florida State University, where she is in the penultimate year of a sports management degree, before heading to Texas.\n\"My parents and coaches were at Augusta and they wanted to go home, so I was left on my own at my first major,\" she says.\n\"I had to get a local caddie, but I had a lot of confidence from Augusta, made the cut and was in contention.\" \nWoad finished joint 23rd, alongside England's Georgia Hall and Charley Hull, two of her \"favourite players\" that she had \"looked up to\" since concentrating on the sport from about the age of 13.\nShe had taken her first lessons, aged seven, with Farnham pro Luke Bone, who remains her coach.\nProgression to the England Girls followed by the age of 15 and, while perhaps not seen as the most naturally gifted golfer, Woad's work ethic impressed as she took advantage of resources not previously available to her.\n\"I had a putting coach, a strength and conditioning coach and a psychologist,\" she says.\n\"I was always pretty good at the long game, but I had to work a lot harder on my short game and I learned how to practise more effectively.\"\nShe went on to win the prestigious Girls Amateur Championship at Carnoustie in 2022, a decade after Hall triumphed in the event.\nWoad was back in Scotland for last year's Women's Open, which was held over the Old Course in St Andrews.\nShe had missed the cut at the US Women's Open and Evian Championship but arrived in Fife in buoyant mood for her fourth major.\nWoad would be in contention all week and finish joint 10th to win the Smyth Salver as the highest-placed amateur, with another highlight being a 60-yard chip-in eagle two on the par-four last in round three.\n\"That got me back into the top 10 going into final day. It was a really cool moment with the grandstand full of cheering people,\" she says.\n\"Then at the prize-giving I get to stand next to the winner, Lydia Ko. To see her lift that trophy motivates you.\n\"It was a perfect week. Home of golf, first Open - I couldn't have dreamed it better.\"\nThere was little time for celebration, though. The Curtis Cup, which pits Great Britain and Ireland's top female amateurs against their American counterparts, was the following week.\nThe Americans were favourites to win a fourth successive title after domineering victories in the previous three editions of the biennial event.\nBut GB&I were boosted by having Europe's victorious Solheim Cup captain Catriona Matthew as their leader.\nAnd Woad, who grew up 40 minutes from the Sunningdale Old Course that hosted the event, contributed 2\u00bd points in a nerve-shredding 10\u00bd-9\u00bd triumph.\nBy that point, Woad had ascended to top of the amateur rankings, which earned her the Mark H McCormack medal. Ko won the prize three successive times from its inception in 2011, while Ireland's Leona Maguire and rising US star Rose Zhang are also three-time recipients.\nSo what does 2025 hold for Woad?\nThe 'P' word is unavoidable, even if Woad will \"only be making that decision when I get to it\".\nTurning professional would appear to be the next logical step and Woad is on an LPGA pathway that could help accelerate that process.\n\"You can get an LPGA card when you reach 20 points and I'm currently on 16,\" she says. \"I'm trying to get 20 points this year and then we'll have a decision to make.\n\"If you make a cut in a major you get a point. If you get a top-25 finish you get a point. If you win Augusta or NCAAs (National Collegiate Athletic Associations), you get two points.\n\"I'm trying to not think too much about it. But if I play well I'm going to get those points.\"\nThe NCAAs are the pinnacle of collegiate golf in the US, pitting teams and individuals against each other. Woad finished runner-up in the individual competition last year, while her university team were joint 11th.\nThis season, Woad has posted an impressive eight consecutive top-three finishes since September. But her Florida State team-mate, 19-year-old Malaysian Mirabel Ting, has eclipsed that, winning six events since last year's AWNA to lead the NCAA individual rankings.\nJasmine Koo is also in a field which boasts 49 of the top 50 in the world. Over the past 12 months the number two ranked player has had four wins and seven top-five finishes.\nAnd 16-year-old Asterisk Talley is tipped to feature again. She finished joint eighth last year and went on to beat Woad in the singles at the Curtis Cup as she also enjoyed a superb 2024.\nHowever, Woad goes into the week knowing that she has conquered Augusta National before and she will again have England Golf women's lead coach Steve Robinson on the bag.\n\"That's going to be nice, to have that familiarity,\" she says. \"I'm just really excited. It's going to be a fun week, and hopefully I can be the first to defend the title.\"",

        "article_text": "Is it simply the modern language of football? Or just \"jargon\" dressing up the game's time-honoured glossary of terms in fancy new clothes?\nFrom a \"low block\" to a \"high press\", football's phrase book has gained countless new entries in recent years that have become part of the conversations before, during and after games.\nThese words alone spark debate from supporters to players past and present, from the cynics who dismiss them, to the newer generation who embrace them as an integral part of the football experience.\nBBC Sport pundits Pat Nevin and Chris Sutton, who have to decide which to use or avoid, have outspoken views on the subject.\nFormer Scotland forward Nevin says: \"I think it's just jargon used in every industry. It is showing someone you're in a little cosy club. You are saying 'we know about these things' and it makes you sound a bit cleverer.\n\"It is saying 'we're in the club, we're in the know - you're not'. I never use them, or if I do I immediately apologise or flag it up. \n\"For instance, I might say a team is defending really deep, then add 'or as they say in the modern parlance, a low block'.\"\nSutton said: \"It's just the evolution of the game. They're just different words aren't they? I'm not one who gets too stuck in the past - but there might be one I take real umbrage with.\"\nSo what are these modern terms? And what do they really mean?\nThe official description, according to statisticians Opta and data firm Second Spectrum, is when \"a defensive team has recently lost the ball and has not had time to re-organise its defensive shape. [The team] is out of position, and is either pressing or actively moving to get back into a stable defensive position\".\nNevin: \"The gold standard of the new jargon. It says you probably don't know what you're talking about, but you want people to think you are.\n\"I have never used it, other than facetiously. There should be a ban on it. Let's invoke a three-strike-and-out transitions law. \n\"Use it once as a co-commentator and you get a stern look, twice a yellow card, then three times you're on your way.\n\"What does it mean? You've given the ball away again. That's it.\n\"When coaches say they have to work on transitions, they should just not give the ball away and be better.\"\nSutton: \"I've always thought transition is when you win the ball back. It's a change isn't it? It's what the word means. Change from defending to attacking.\"\nA \"low block\", as defined by Opta, is the starting position of your team from your own goal.\nInterestingly, Nottingham Forest - third in the Premier League and heading towards the Champions League - are currently second-lowest with a starting position of 39.6 metres, sandwiched in between Southampton (39.8 metres) and Ipswich Town (39.4 metres) who are both almost certainly heading back to the Championship.\nNevin: \"Nottingham Forest suggests an exception and a successful strategy, but my overall definition is it means you're not good enough as a team, you can't get the ball out, so you defend deep.\n\"There you go - it's defending deep. It's just easier to say 'we're playing in a low block' rather than admit you're not good enough to play out so we have to sit back and play on the break.\n\"It's a fairly modern, generational thing. You can spot it a mile away. You can't wear a big sticker saying 'I've got my coaching badges' but this is almost telling people you've read the manuals and you've got your badges.\"\nSutton: \"It's the new phrase for defending your own box or defending deeply. I don't know where some of these phrases come from.\"\nThis is a defensive tactic where a team places its defenders higher up the pitch. Much focus has been placed on the \"high line\" Ange Postecoglou employs at Tottenham Hotspur, but the current highest line in the top flight is Manchester City at 45.9 metres.\nNevin: \"This is the one I'm absolutely fine with, because it is descriptive and perfectly explains what is happening to someone who may not know football very well. \n\"It's probably much older than the rest of the cliches and I would say it would have been used when I played.\"\nSutton: \"Fine by me. Making sure the distance between defenders and midfield isn't too great, teams can't play through out and you look to catch careless forwards offside. \n\"If you use this phrase, listeners or viewers will understand exactly what you mean.\"\nThis means defending high up the pitch to force the opposition into mistakes.\nNevin: \"New jargon. Been done for years. It's not a new Pep Guardiola thing. 'The Crazy Gang' at Wimbledon used to do it when I played and were brilliant at it.\n\"The old phrase was 'closing down'. You close the opposition down and get right in their faces high up the pitch. It's been rebranded as some new concept but every team used to do it.\n\"The recent great Barcelona sides were the high watermark, but it started in the 1970s when Johan Cruyff used to do it with Ajax. I did it for the first time in under-15s football at Celtic Boys Club.\n\"When I played, we usually did with a sign, which could be anything, but the favourite sign was 'when you see that big useless centre-back get the ball, all go in to try and make him give the ball away'.\"\nSutton: \"If someone talked to me about a 'high press' when I was playing, I would have thought they were telling me to iron my shirt.\n\"It's closing down and I suspect Herbert Chapman's great Arsenal side in the 1930s was doing this.\n\"It's a classic from people who think football didn't exist before 2010 and the '60s, '70s and '80s never happened. Do they think players of that era just stood around in a rigid 4-4-2 and didn't run or close down?\"\nWimbledon - pioneers of the high press?\nThis is when teams try to win the ball back quickly after conceding possession, to avoid being hit on the counter-attack by their opponents and potentially starting an attack of their own.\nNevin: \"It's not one I've come across too much but you press up to try and retrieve the ball immediately. Seems simple enough.\"\nSutton: \"I used this phrase north of the border and got absolutely rinsed by my fellow pundits. \n\"I meant when you won the ball back high up quickly by shutting down the opposition. Just another version of the press, and you're then on the counter-attack.\"\nHigh turnovers, as measured by Opta metrics, are \"the number of possessions that start in open play and begin 40 metres or less from the opponent's goal\".\nNevin: \"Of limited use. Winning the ball back high up the pitch.\"\nSutton: \"When someone mentions 'turnovers' to me I think of the apple things you used to buy in shops. \n\"You hear all this stats-based stuff now and it's basically winning the ball in the opposition half, that's all.\"\nSpurs boss Postecoglou called this \"the most useless statistic in world football. Seriously, it could fall off your backside, fall to somebody on the halfway line who scores and it's an assist. It doesn't impress me\".\nThe Opta definition is simple - the player who passes the ball to the player who scores.\nNevin: \"I like assists because I got far more assists than goals in my playing career, but Ange makes a great point. I used to keep a record of them. I agree with Ange, but as a phrase people do know what it means.\n\"I was always a bit miffed on the other side of that argument when I beat seven men, drew the keeper and passed it to John Aldridge to tap in at Tranmere.\"\nSutton: \"I take Ange's point. There could be a proper assist but what if the ball hits you on the backside? Is that really an assist? \n\"And what about when a player lets the ball run through his legs, or draws a defender out of position. That's one for the nerds and laptop crunchers.\"\nUsually the assist maker, Nevin celebrates a rare goal instead\nThis is measured by simply adding assists and goals.\nNevin: \"I hate the wording but I'm OK with the concept. I think the new purveyors of football parlance need to up their game a bit here. It needs a better phrase. Very simplistic this one, but I'm fine with what it stands for.\"\nSutton: \"It used to just be goals, but now this has been added. Next throw-ins and corners will be in there, all sorts of things. I think people do get what it means, though.\"\nTypically a striker (often wearing number nine) dropping deeper into midfield to link play, disturb the opponents' defence and make space for others, rather than playing in the traditional forward's role.\nNevin: \"I'm absolutely OK with this. The first time it was used to me was in 1982 at the European Under-18 championships when I was with Scotland. We won it in Finland and I was player of the tournament. We beat Czechoslovakia in the final so I was very happy with it.\n\"The coaches were Andy Roxburgh and Walter Smith. Andy ended up becoming Uefa's first technical director. He used a phrase 'unreal nine' or 'false nine'. It simply means no-one playing as as a traditional centre forward. It is a false striker.\n\"We rotated it with Scotland between myself, Ally Dick of Spurs and Gary Mackay of Hearts. We had two wide attackers and a false nine but all three of us could do all three jobs.\"\nSutton: \"What is the difference between a 'false nine' and 'number 10'? Think of Roberto Firmino at Liverpool. Someone who is essentially a forward who drops deep to show for the ball and link everything.\n\"At Blackburn when we won the title, we played 4-4-2 but a striker would drop deep when the opposition had the ball to attach themselves to a midfielder. Is that the same thing?\"\nThree phrases for the price of one. Effectively a defensive midfielder - or two - used by some teams to act as a shield for defence and link the whole side together. As the word means, \"a central point\".\nNevin: \"It's just a new name for the deep-lying central midfield player. In South America they would call that a 'five'. It is trying to pigeonhole all of them into one simple term.\n\"Chelsea play with two pivots, two 'sixes'. It's 4-3-3 with two deep-lying midfield players. It was used with Scotland when I played. Graeme Souness could do that easily and brilliantly.\n\"Chelsea do it all the time with Moises Caicedo and they have Enzo Fernandez, Romeo Lavia and are asking Reece James to do it as well.\"\nSutton: \"I don't know where this 'pivot' thing came from. It was a defensive midfielder, then a holding midfielder - and now we've got pivot.\n\"The 'pivots' I played with were Neil Lennon at Celtic and David Batty at Blackburn. Strong defensive holding midfield players.\"\nA full-back who moved into a more central possession when their team has the ball. Can be an extra midfielder and helps both attacking and defensive strategies.\nNevin: \"Stevie Clarke and myself did this at Chelsea. It can be described, as it used to be, as an underlapping full-back, someone stepping into midfield. [Inverted full--back] is an upgrade linguistically and one I don't mind.\n\"When I hear hybrid full-back, I can just say I won't be using that one and never will.\"\nSutton: \"I always think about left-footers playing on the right and vice-versa here, enabling them to step inside into midfield. We had Mark Bowen at Norwich City but we used to just call them attacking full-backs.\n\"As for hybrid' - that just makes me think of cars.\"\nThis is taken to mean the spaces between the edge of the penalty box towards the 'D' on either side of the area.\nNevin: \"Instantly droppable. Nonsensical. It only exists when a little gap opens up, basically just looking for a space between the striker and the midfielder. I don't think it's a very helpful phrase and is pretty meaningless.\"\nSutton: \"An absolute no-no. It's simply wrong. What a load of nonsense.\n\"How can you have a half-space? A space is a space is a space. If I dig a hole it's a hole. It is not a half-hole.\nThis phrase is believed to have originated in American football to describe an area of the field that forms around the quarterback on passing plays.\nNevin: \"Pockets of space is telling people to find space, It's just new words for the same thing.\"\nSutton: \"I get this a bit more. I think that's allowed. You can also call it a zone.\n\"I think this is the space in between the opposition defence and midfield, in the wider channels when teams play with three forwards and the highest forward will drop into spaces.\n\"As a description people will understand what you're talking about.\"\nBayern Munich and Germany's Thomas Muller has been bestowed with his own positional term\nThis is used to describe spaces between lines line of forwards and midfield players or midfield players and defenders.\nNevin: \"Teams never stand in straight lines, which is the silliness of all of this. If the formation has what you might call 'lines', you're trying to find the gaps and spaces between those lines.\n\"The last thing you do is go there between the line. You have to arrive when the ball arrives in there. That's the skill Cole Palmer is the best at it in the Premier League. Never stand there - always arrive there.\"\nSutton: \"I don't know who thought of this. Teams don't just line up in straight lines in a 4-3-3 or 4-4-2. \n\"The term itself presumably means you try to play through these so-called 'lines', mainly between the midfield and attack.\"\nAnd one to watch out for...\nThis was coined by, and has been used for, Bayern Munich's Germany attacker Thomas Muller and translates to \"space investigator\".\nMuller described himself as \"an interpreter of space\".\nNevin: \"I'll leave the German to others.\"\nSutton: \"Does what it says on the tin.\"\nThis video can not be played\nTonali's goal - a cross?

Fitness is a non-negotiable. We should be fit.\"\nAfter England's early exit from the T20 World Cup in October, former spinner Alex Hartley said some players were \"letting the team down\" in terms of fitness.\nAthleticism again came into focus during the Ashes clean sweep, but Lewis attributed that to a cultural difference between the UK and Australia.\nThe Lewis regime was also characterised by a more relaxed approach. During the World Cup, some England players attended boat parties in Dubai.\n\"Honesty and hard work are key to any culture,\" said Edwards, England's all-time leading run-scorer.\n\"If we've got that in place we will move pretty quickly in the right direction. We've got to work hard. That's for me to implement in training. We will talk to our science and medicine teams in terms of what we have to do with our fitness standards.\"\n'Everyone should be excited by this' - England appoint Edwards as head coach\nKnight sacking leaves 'enormous shoes to fill' - who may England turn to?\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nEdwards won the Ashes and both World Cups as England captain only to be sacked in 2016 and replaced by Knight.\nNow Knight has been sacked but has indicated her desire to continue as a player. Edwards, 45, said she was not consulted in the decision to remove Knight.\n\"She sets such high standards, she's the ultimate professional and what we need around the England team right now,\" said Edwards. \n\"She's playing as well as I've ever seen her play. It was hard to watch the Ashes, because of the toll it was taking on her. Without the captaincy, hopefully she'll be able to go on to bigger and better things as a player.\"\nIn order to take the England job, Edwards has left all of her roles in domestic cricket, including her post as Mumbai Indians head coach in the Women's Premier League. While he was England coach, Lewis was in charge of UP Warriorz in the same competition.\nEngland will appoint a new national selector, as well as a new captain, which Edwards said will be in place for the series against West Indies in May.\nKnight's vice-captain Nat Sciver-Brunt has previously said she would be interested in the job, while off-spinner Charlie Dean admitted she would not turn it down if approached.\nEdwards, who captained England on more than 200 occasions, said she is looking for \"someone who leads from the front in everything they do, someone who has the respect of the current playing group\". She also said England will have one captain, rather than splitting the role across formats.\nCharlotte Edwards played more than 300 times for England in a 19-year career\nEdwards has been appointed after a review into the Ashes led by England director of women's cricket Clare Connor and performance director Jonathan Finch.\nConnor, herself an Ashes-winning England captain, confirmed Edwards was given the job without a formal process.\nIn 2018, the England and Wales Cricket Board pledged to adopt the Rooney Rule - interviewing at least one applicant from black, Asian or minority ethic backgrounds for all coaching roles in its national teams. It was not used for the appointment of Edwards.\n\"In these particular circumstances, with the criteria in front of me, I did not believe an open recruitment process was needed or would have benefited anyone,\" said Connor.\n\"I was very, very clear there was one person in the world of coaching who could have filled this role. Charlotte Edwards is the only person on the planet that can tick every box to the degree that she can.\"\nConnor also opted against bringing in internal or independent leadership for the review. When asked if that was tantamount to Connor and Finch \"marking their own homework\", Connor said: \"I understand that perspective. I'm accountable to the board for England women's cricket. \n\"I'm very confident in the steps we are taking and the way we are setting the team up for success. That is the job I'm paid to do.\n\"I'm under no illusion the buck does stop with me and I'm accountable for the England women's cricket team and how we perform.\"",

        "article_text": "From Saturday, most goods imported to the US from anywhere in the world will face a 10% \"baseline\" tariff.\nDonald Trump announced higher rates for some countries he singled out as the \"worst offenders\" for trade.\nOur correspondents have been answering your questions about what this means and the impact it could have.\nDavid Rash, in Yeovil, asks Deputy Economics editor, Dharshini David, if the tariffs will lead to a stagnant world economy following a reduced supply of foreign goods into the US and a reduction of US exports?\nThis is a very real risk.\nThe tariffs introduced by President Trump amount to the largest such levy to face American consumers in almost a century.\nIf they do get put in place \u2013 and remain \u2013 there is likely to be a serious dent to the amount bought by Americans, still the world's biggest shoppers, from the rest of the world.\nAnd those who are prepared to fork out for higher prices due to tariffs will have less to spend on other things.\nIn the event of the retaliation threatened by other countries, American exporters will suffer \u2013 hence the concern that not just the US but the whole global economy, so reliant on trade flows, could slow.\nBut as you say, the natural inclination is for countries hardest hit \u2013 toymakers from China to apparel manufacturers in Vietnam - to boost sale in other markets.\nThat might appeal to consumers \u2013 but obviously, could disadvantage businesses in those target markets.\nMike Heafield, 60, in Preston, asks Senior Technology reporter, Graham Fraser, What happens to products - like the iPhone - that are made in China by US companies? \nOne eye-catching consequence of the tariffs announcement has been the impact on Apple, with its share price falling 7%.\nThe US tech giant has large manufacturing bases in some of the countries hit hardest by President Trump's policy - notably China, which faces tariffs of 54%, and Vietnam (46%).\nIn 2019, when Trump was first in the White House, Apple was given Chinese tariff exemptions. Apple bosses will be hoping to work out a similar deal this time.\nThe global investment bank Citi said: \"If Apple cannot get exempted this time and assuming Apple gets hit by the accumulative 54% China tariffs and does not pass it through, we estimate about 9% negative impact to the company's total gross margin.\"\nIn February, Apple committed to invest more than $500bn (\u00a3396bn) in the US over the next four years. At the time, Trump claimed Apple's support for US manufacturing was partially a response to his trade policies, including tariffs.\nPaul Miller, in Devon, asks Dharshini David, Deputy Economics editor, about the impact of tariffs on US consumers, and whether the UK could gain from them.\nUS shoppers could very much be the frontline casualties in this trade war, blighted by higher prices and less choice, regardless of the president's rhetoric.\nAnd that does mean that producers will seek out and take advantage of new markets.\nWe saw that in the president's first term, when the likes of Vietnam and Malaysia took advantage of the tariffs he imposed on China to increase the amount they sold to America.\nIronically, they consequently are in the firing line now - and so will likely be vying to sell more to the UK \u2013 good for consumers, less so for competing businesses\nAlready, many producers are turning their sights beyond established customers \u2013 think whisky makers looking towards Asia. That is likely to intensify.\nTrump's announcement may mean a redraft of the global trade map \u2013 and our own shopping lists.\nJock Scott, from Nuneaton, asks Business reporter Nick Edser if the US tariffs have an effect on the UK's cost of living. \nAs ever when looking at the implications of the tariffs, there's a lot of uncertainty over this. In some circumstances UK prices could go up, in others they could fall.\nThe tariffs announced by Trump on Wednesday will be paid for by the businesses which import goods into the US. This means the initial impact of price rises is likely to be on US consumers, if American firms pass on the extra costs.\nHowever, some economists think the tariffs could strengthen the value of the dollar against other currencies. If the pound weakens against the dollar, then UK firms importing goods from the US will face higher costs. This could then lead to higher prices of these goods in UK shops if companies cannot absorb the increased costs themselves.\nAlso, if the UK government decides to retaliate with tariffs of its own on US goods entering the UK, there is a risk UK prices could rise if British businesses pass on the extra costs to customers.\nHowever, some economists have suggested prices could also fall as a result of the tariffs.\nSwati Dhingra, an economist and member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, has suggested that firms which normally send their goods to the US may instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK, potentially leading to a flood of cheaper goods.\nRobert Jones, from Cardiff, asks Kevin Peachey, Cost of living correspondent, about the impact of tariffs on our pension investments.\nThere is little doubt Trump's announcement on tariffs has led to immediate moves in share prices and are also likely to have a longer-term economic impact.\nRobert and Stephen have mentioned the drop in the value of their pension investments, and the situation will be unsettling for millions of people with any kind of investments.\nExperts say that investors have always had to ride economic shocks. Investments, by definition, require a long-term outlook and strategy. So, they are urging people not to panic or make knee-jerk decisions.\nThat said, for those about to draw on investments, it may be more worrying, albeit that most pension savings are moved into safer holdings like cash or bonds as people approach retirement age. The state pension is unaffected.\nPaul Naldrett from Windsor asks Business correspondent Marc Ashdown if the UK's position outside of the European Union is actually an opportunity as the EU is given 20% tariffs.\nSome are referring to a \"Brexit benefit\" because the UK is only subject to 10% tariffs rather than the 20% being slapped on the EU.\nNot only will that limit the pain felt by British businesses compared to their European neighbours, but it could present trading opportunities.\nUK exporters to America could have a competitive edge, with US importers only facing half the tax by dealing with UK businesses instead of EU businesses.\nBritish firms - and consumers - could also benefit from cheaper goods finding their way here instead of America if the extra costs prove insurmountable.\nBut, there are concerns about the impact that could have on homegrown industries if cheap products, possibly with lower standards, flood the UK market.",

It is also lower than the new US tariffs levied on other countries, such as the 20% tax on the European Union.\n\"Ironically it could be a good thing,\" he says. \"These retailers who would have sourced from Europe might now say 'actually we'll buy more from the UK.\"\nFor something not visible to the naked eye, organic chemicals are a huge US export for the UK, totalling close to \u00a33bn last year.\nThey are used across a massive range of industries from food to make-up to engines and into agriculture.\nRather than feeling fearful about the US tariff, Robinsons Brothers reckons it may help the West Bromwich-based organic chemicals firm wrestle back American customers from cheaper overseas rivals.\nChief executive Adrian Hanrahan says: \"We supplied a lot more to the US but China and India knocked us out of that because of very low pricing.\"\nUnder Trump's new regime, China's imports face a 34% tariff while India's products will be taxed at 27%. Robinsons Brothers chemicals are already taxed at 6% when they reach the US \nMr Hanrahan says he is still trying to nail down whether the new 10% US tariff on UK goods means Robinsons Brothers' American customers will be paying an additional 4% or a total 16%.\n\"Either way, it is a lot less than China or India will see going into the US,\" he says. \"So I am really hoping and seeing an opportunity for us here in one area.\" \nHe says that since January, the company has been receiving more enquiries from the US, including two customers Robinsons Brothers lost five years ago \"at great expense\".\nAt the moment, Robinsons Brothers derives between 1.5% and 2% of total sales - which reached \u00a324m last year - from America. \nThis \"doesn't seem a lot\" says Mr Hanrahan but they are high margin products.\nThere are, of course, concerns that rival countries may have to dump products once destined for the US on other markets, such as the UK which, in turn, could drive down domestic prices.\nMr Hanrahan says: \"I am hoping that the UK government is preparing for that and putting something in place to mitigate any form of product dumping in the UK and in the EU.\"\nUK exports to the US linked to aircraft totalled \u00a32.2bn in 2024, official figures show.\nDPS Designs contributes a small - but important part - to that industry. The Forest of Dean-based firm makes metal moulds that are used to create plastic sections of airplane seats.\nThe US is DPS's biggest growth market. Around \u00a3150,000 worth of sales come directly from the US out of a total \u00a33m.  \nThe company's managing director of engineering, Sebastian Down, says the firm will negotiate with its customers \"to see if we can share in the pain\" of the new 10% tariffs - once he deciphers what they apply to.\n\"The amount of detail is paper-thin,\" he said.\nDPS Designs has already had to grapple with the ambiguous language used by the White House around tariffs, after Trump announced 25% trade tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to the US. The company uses aluminium to make its moulds.\n\"There was no-one you could speak to so it relied on me going onto the US department of whatever website, trying to look at lots of detail that basically didn't exist,\" he says.\nUltimately, the aluminium tariff does not apply to his business. But the new 10% tariff criteria isn't clear either. Does it, for example, apply to parts that make up a product or only to the finished article itself? \n\"It is as clear as mud,\" says Mr Down. \nThe US market for British-made cars is of enormous consequence for the UK economy. Last year, the UK exported \u00a39bn worth to America. \nThe sector was already reeling from Trump's previously announced 25% US tariff on cars and light vehicles.  \nMike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, says: \"These tariff costs cannot be absorbed by manufacturers, thus hitting US consumers who may face additional costs and a reduced choice of iconic British brands.\"\nWith Trump's announcement on Wednesday of 10% US taxes on nearly all UK imports, the net will now widen to include the likes of electric motorcycle-maker Maeving.\nSeb Inglis-Jones, co-founder and co-chief executive of the Coventry company, says that sales from the US are \"ever evolving\". Last month, for example, 68% of sales came from America though typically, the US makes up about 40% of its \u00a36m annual turnover.\nMr Inglis-Jones says that the US has helped counterbalance a less-than-optimistic economic outlook in Maeving's other key markets such as the UK, France and Germany.\n\"In the US, there's just more disposable income and so with a slightly more discretionary purchase like ours, a slightly more expensive British built electric motorcycle, Americans are just way more able to spend that money.\"\nHe says that Maeving recently raised prices in the US, not as a pre-emptive move before tariffs but because the cost of doing business in the States had increased.\nWill the company now lift prices again?\n\"We haven't got that far,\" says Mr Inglis-Jones. \"I think we care more about, as a young EV [electric vehicle] company, about the growth and making sure the price is right for the US customer.\n\"If we can't stomach it, we will have to put the prices up again.\"",

This \"doesn't seem a lot\" says Mr Hanrahan but they are high margin products.There are, of course, concerns that rival countries may have to dump products once destined for the US on other markets, such as the UK which, in turn, could drive down domestic prices.Mr Hanrahan says: \"I am hoping that the UK government is preparing for that and putting something in place to mitigate any form of product dumping in the UK and in the EU.",

I love it.\"\nThe hijab can sometimes be a controversial topic in sport and at last year's Paris Olympics, French athletes were banned from wearing one even though the International Olympic Committee allowed them to.\nIn 2023, Moroccan footballer Nouhaila Benzina made history as the first player to wear a hijab at the Women's World Cup. They had been banned until 2014 by the game's governing body Fifa. \nSince first appearing on the show, Aneila says not everyone has been so positive about her hijab though.\nShe's posted about receiving Islamophobic and racist abuse on social media, but says overall it's been heavily outweighed by the encouraging reaction.\nThat's important to Aneila who says she wants to show \"you can wear a hijab, be involved in fitness and still pursue your dreams\".\n\"I'm getting messages from girls as young as 12 telling me that I'm the reason they're taking gymnastics again and that they feel that they can now be involved in sport.\"\nAnd it's not just young girls who've been inspired by Aneila. \n\"Since being on Gladiators, I've received messages from women in their 40s who say if there was a visible Muslim woman wearing a headscarf when they were younger, their whole journey with fitness would have been different,\" she says.\nAnd she hopes her journey on Gladiators will encourage her own children to feel comfortable being themselves too. \n\"My daughter was getting older and I wanted to be a visible Muslim role model for her,\" she says.\n\"I have used my children to be my inspiration. It's because of them I wanted to wear a headscarf.\"\nAneila says the reaction she's had since first appearing on Gladiators helped her realise \"we can push the barriers out, break any stereotypes\".\n\"The hijab is not a limitation.\"\nGladiators will air on BBC One at 17:50 on Saturday 5 April.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

A prominent Syrian human rights group said four defence ministry employees were killed, and a dozen other people injured.\nThe air strikes hit Syria, but their real target was Turkey.\nShortly afterwards, Israel's foreign minister accused Turkey of playing a \"negative role\" in Syria, and Israel's defence minister warned Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, that he would \"pay a very heavy price\" if he allowed \"hostile forces\" to enter his country.\nAnkara is currently negotiating a joint defence pact with Sharaa's new government, and there have been widespread reports that Turkey is moving to station aircraft and air defence systems at Syria's T4 and Aleppo airbases.\nSome analysts compared Israel's intense air strikes on Hama airport this week with the much lighter bombing on the edge of the T4 base, suggesting that Turkey may have already moved some equipment there and that Israel was calibrating its attack to avoid a full-blown escalation.\nRelations between Israel and Turkey have nose-dived since the Gaza war began in October 2023, with Ankara introducing trade restrictions and accusing Israel of genocide.\nThat regional tension is now playing out on new ground in Syria.\nAfter the air strikes on Wednesday, Turkey's foreign ministry accused Israel of destabilising the region by \"both causing chaos and feeding terrorism\" and said it was now the greatest threat to the security of the region.\nBut foreign minister Hakan Fidan told Reuters news agency that his country was not seeking confrontation with Israel, and that Syria could set its own policies with its southern neighbour.\nSyria's new leader has repeatedly signalled that he was not looking for confrontation with Israel.  Soon after sweeping President Bashar al-Assad from power last December, he told the BBC that Syria would not pose a threat to any country.\nHe has even left the door open to normalising diplomatic relations with Israel in the future, telling the Economist last month that Syria wanted peace with all parties, but that it was too early to discuss such a sensitive issue.\nHis top priority since taking power has been to unite a bitterly divided Syria, and pacify external relations with its neighbours, while he cements his power and control.\nBut Israel has not made that easy. Its military interventions in Syria are fuelling conflict with both external powers like Turkey, and with internal groups like jihadists in the country's south.\nOnce an implacable enemy of Syria's former president and his Iranian ally, Israel is also suspicious of Sharaa, a man who once led the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda and whose new government is backed by Turkey.\nSince he took power, Israel's military has repeatedly pounded Syrian weapons stores, airfields and other military sites left by the former regime, to avoid them falling into enemy hands, it says.\nIt has also occupied a demilitarised buffer zone, set up after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, and has sent forces onto the Syrian side of a nearby mountain, setting up nine bases across the area.\nIsraeli troops are also making regular incursions into Syria's south-western provinces, vowing to prevent the presence of any armed groups or government forces there.\nEarlier this week, the local government in the southern city of Deraa said nine civilians were killed in an Israeli bombardment, during the deepest incursion there yet by Israeli forces.\nAnother four people were killed in Israeli shelling near the village of Koya late last month, after local gunmen tried to stop the advance of Israeli forces there.\nSince then, mosques in both Deraa and Damascus have reportedly called for jihad against Israeli forces.\nCharles Lister, head of the Syria Programme at the US-based Middle East Institute, which studies the region, has counted more than 70 ground incursions into south-west Syria since February, describing this as \"an extraordinarily dangerous moment \u2013 and an unnecessary one\".\nSince the fall of Assad four months ago, he says, not one attack has targeted Israel from Syria, the country's security forces have intercepted \"at least 18 weapons shipments destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon, and dismantled at least eight formerly Iranian-linked rocket launch sites\".\nMany Syrians are disappointed by Israel's response to their new government. They watched for years as Israel targeted the Assad regime, and believed that Assad's fall would bring the chance for a less confrontational relationship with Israel.\nSome say that view is now changing.\n\"We used to believe that the Israeli army was only targeting Assad's regime forces,\" said Ismail, a restaurant owner in the west of the country.  \"But its continued, incomprehensible bombings are sadly making us think that Israel is an enemy of the Syrian people.\"\nSyria is vulnerable because its internal divisions are easily inflamed by regional and global interventions. The roots of sectarian conflict run deep here, nourished by decades of repressive rule by the Assad family, members of Syria's Alawite minority.\nAhmed al-Sharaa's attempts to reassure the country's minorities were interrupted in early March by an explosion of violence in Syria's coastal region \u2013 a stronghold of the former regime.\nAt least 1,000 Alawite civilians or disarmed fighters were massacred by pro-government forces, after government units were ambushed in a co-ordinated attack led by remnants of Syria's former armed forces.\nThose former armed forces were once backed by Iran.  Some analysts believe their remnants may still be receiving some support from Tehran.\nSyrians celebrated the fall of Bashar al-Assad as an end to their civil war, and a chance to unite.\nBut outside powers helped fuel that civil war for more than a decade, and its neighbours are now eyeing the vacuum left by Assad. The risk is growing that Syria will again fall victim to the conflicts of outside powers, played out on Syrian soil.",

        "article_text": "South Korea's Constitutional Court has ruled Yoon Suk Yeol abused his power by declaring martial law last December, and permanently removed him from office.\nBefore that, South Korea was not somewhere you might expect a military takeover - a peaceful and proud democracy, admired across the globe for its K-dramas and technological innovation.\nSo, when President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law, ordering his army to seize control, he stunned the country and the world. Everyone, from regular Koreans to world leaders, was left with the same burning question:\nWhat was he thinking?\nYoon underestimated the resistance from the public, his military and members of parliament. He cancelled the order after just six hours. \nThe BBC has spoken to some of those closest to the president \u2013 his friends, confidantes, and political aides - to understand what drove this once successful and principled prosecutor, famed for his belief in right and wrong, to trigger an authoritarian takeover: a decision that would upend his country, tarnish its international reputation and destroy his career.\nFrom a young age, Yoon was \"obsessed with winning\", his oldest friend, Chulwoo Lee, told me in the weeks after martial law. \n\"Once he decides something, he drives it forward in a very extreme way.\"\nMr Lee was in the same primary school class as Yoon. The pair later went on to study law together, before Yoon became a prosecutor. \nAt school, he was the biggest boy in the class, Mr Lee said, which meant he always sat at the back so as not block the other pupils' view. \nHe was popular and clever, Mr Lee added, keen to counter a myth that Yoon struggled academically because it took him nine attempts to pass the bar exam.\nYoon attended college in the early 1980s, when South Korea's military dictator Chun Doo-hwan ruled the country using martial law. \nWhen the military massacred protesters in the city of Gwangju, the nation was horrified. Angry students took to the streets, but according to Lee, Yoon \"didn't participate much\". \n\"He wasn't particularly interested in the student movement or politics,\" Lee said, but he did have \"a strong belief in justice\".\nMr Lee remembers walking through campus one day, when they saw a girl being interrogated by two plain clothes policemen. Yoon immediately started shouting at them. \n\"Because he was so big and angry, the officers were frightened. They practically ran away,\" he said. \"His temper was uncontrollable.\"\nDecades later, Mr Lee would find himself on the receiving end of his friend's temper. \nAs a state prosecutor, Yoon cemented his reputation as an explosive character who was almost obsessively guided by an innate sense of right and wrong. \nBut over the years, Lee worried his investigations were becoming unnecessarily aggressive. When he called Yoon to tell him so, \"he threw the telephone across the room\" in anger.\nBy then, Yoon was already famous, having investigated the intelligence service in 2013 for corruption, against the orders of his boss. He was suspended from his job, but according to Mr Lee, who defended him, the public viewed him as brave for defying political pressure. \nWhen testifying, Yoon famously declared: \"I do not owe my loyalty to anyone.\"\nThis was evident again when he went on to prosecute and jail South Korea's impeached conservative president Park Geun-hye in 2018, making him a darling of the left. \nIt won him the job of chief prosecutor for the left-leaning government at the time. But rather than curry favour, he launched an investigation into one of its ministers. It was then that Mr Lee phoned to warn his friend \"he was crossing a bridge of no return\", which incensed Yoon. The pair did not talk for over a year.\nBut this dogged, non-partisan approach won him support.  \"I was rooting for him because he always did the right thing rather than what his boss told him to do. I felt there should be more people like him,\" said one friend, Shin*, who asked to stay anonymous. \nShin, who refers to Yoon as his older brother - a term of affection in South Korea - claims he was different to many prosecutors at the time, who sold their influence by marrying into rich and powerful families.\nBut by investigating the government, Yoon had picked a fight he couldn't win, and he was pushed out of his job as chief prosecutor. Such side-switching set him up as a hero and villain to both sides of the politician divide, giving him a unique appeal.\nStill, the decision to run for president was not an easy one, Shin said. \nThe pair met regularly to brainstorm a game plan. They worried about Yoon's lack of political connections. \n\"If you've been a politician your whole life you have people backing you. Without these allies, Yoon knew he was going to be a very lonely president,\" Shin said.\n\"I greatly regret choosing him as our candidate\", Yoon's campaign strategist Kim Keun-sik admitted to me in the aftermath of martial law.\nKim was initially enamoured by Yoon's principled approach to the law, but said he quickly grew concerned. \"He didn't listen to any of our advice. He only did as he pleased - he was stubborn to the core.\" \nHe would make decisions spontaneously, in private, preferring to take advice from the friends he went drinking with, Kim said. \"We kept having to clear up his mess.\"\nYet despite these warning signs, he was selected as the presidential candidate for South Korea's conservative People Power Party. \n\"We knew he was a risk, but we thought he gave us the best chance of beating our opponent,\" Kim said.\nAfter being endorsed by the party, Yoon's politics lurched rapidly to the right. \nAccording to his friends, he was bombarded by very right-wing politicians and journalists who \"planted ideas in his mind.\" He developed an extreme hostility towards the opposition party, believing it had links to North Korea. \n\"I felt very sad, because he was changing,\" said Shin. \"He wanted to win, and the wrong advice went to his head. He started to think he was engaged in a war.\"\nBy now, Yoon's schoolfriend Lee was alarmed. \n\"He came into politics with such a wide spectrum of support. I hoped he would unite the country. But he moved so quickly to the right and was losing support almost every day.\" \u202f\nThe problem, Lee said, was that those on the far right were fanatically supportive. The more backing Yoon lost, the more he believed he had to rely on these loyalists, and the further right he slid.\nIt was a self-defeating cycle. Yoon won the election by the narrowest margin in South Korea's history \u2013 0.7%.\nAfter his victory, Mr Lee messaged his school friend to cut ties, concerned about the direction he would take the country. \"I congratulated him and said I would see him after he had served his term.\"\nBy the time he entered office, Yoon had not only alienated his oldest friend, but many moderate voters, and he had set himself up for a clash with the powerful opposition, that controlled the parliament. \nHe brought his prosecutorial instincts into politics. Yet the very traits that made him a formidable prosecutor would hamper him as president.\n\"Usually politicians with no experience listen to their aides a lot, but Yoon wanted to take the wheel,\" said one of his political advisers, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \nThe aide, who worked in the president's office, said Yoon would argue his points \"loudly and forcefully\", making it \"uncomfortable\" to voice an alternative opinion.\nIn the early days of his presidency, most of his team pressed him to sit down with the opposition leader, to resolve their differences and find a way to govern effectively, but Yoon refused, the aide said. \n\"He viewed the opposition leader, Lee Jae-myung, as a criminal.\" \nInstead, Yoon sided with a small faction within the presidential office who wanted him to \"fight the party head on\".\nFairly quickly, those pushing for dialogue either left or were pushed out, leaving Yoon surrounded by people who agreed with him, and lower-level bureaucrats, too scared to speak out.\nThis bullish leadership led him to make a strategic miscalculation \u2013 he overlooked the need to be liked by voters. He pushed ahead with unpopular policies, and refused to apologise for his wife, who had antagonised the public by accepting luxury gifts.\n\"He didn't care enough what people thought of him; whether they thought he was doing a good job or not,\" said his friend Shin, who remembers struggling to convince Yoon to dress smartly in the early days of the campaign. \nYoon feared that pandering to the public might prevent him achieving his goals, and hoped people would eventually recognise he was doing a good job, Shin explained.\nThe opposite turned out to be true. \nTwo years into his term, his party suffered a bruising defeat in parliamentary elections, handing the opposition party an even bigger majority. Yoon was left hamstrung, unable to enact his agenda.\n\"It's arrogant to say you don't want to be popular, that you don't want approval ratings,\" said Shin, labelling this Yoon's \"biggest mistake\". \n\"He's a funny, likeable person. He could have been a popular president.\"\nPerversely, Yoon seemed untroubled by his party's election defeat. \n\"He said he could still give executive orders and accomplish a lot. He told me not to worry\", said Linton, a conservative politician and one of the president's close confidantes at the time.\nAccording to various testimonies, this was about the time Yoon's martial law plot began to take shape.\nBy now, he appeared to be fully immersed in unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, peddled by influential far-right YouTubers whose content he was consuming. He believed the opposition was taking orders from North Korea, or at least those who idolised the regime, though he never presented any proof.\nLinton said Yoon talked repeatedly of how the opposition party was being run by Marxists, once comparing them to the Chinese Communist Party. He thought that, if in power, they would turn South Korea into an authoritarian communist state and bankrupt the country. \n\"I got this speech at least 15 to 20 times.\"\nThe stronger the opposition got, the more headstrong Yoon became, using his presidential veto to block parliament's decisions. In return the assembly slashed his budgets, impeached an unprecedented number of his political appointees, and tried to investigate his wife for corruption.\nAccording to Linton, Yoon was \"livid\". \"They are trying to bring me down, the government down, and end our democracy - and we can't put up with it,\" he told him.\nOn 3 December, he finally snapped.\n\"He saw martial law as a method for punishing the opposition. He felt that somebody had to stand up to them,\" Linton said. \n\"Once he makes a decision he doesn't hesitate,\" he added, suggesting it was unlikely Yoon had fully thought his plan through. \"It was a poor decision, and he is paying the consequences now, but I think he sincerely thought he had the country's best interests at heart.\"\nIn a roundabout way, his schoolfriend Chulwoo Lee agrees: \"He had this delusion he could save the nation from communist threats, but I have no sympathy for him; he has jeopardised our democracy.\"\nAs misguided as he was, Yoon did what he thought was right with little care for the consequences, echoed Shin. \n\"This was exactly how he lived his 30 years as a prosecutor. In this sense, martial law was something only Yoon could have done.\"",

Despite reporting it to Roblox, she never received a response.\nShe welcomed the announcements as a \"start\", but said Roblox \"needs to do better\".\nShe added: \"What's missing is proper authentication of users. How does the company know that users are who they say they are - how will perpetrators be traced when grooming keeps happening?\"\nRoblox highlighted to BBC News its community standards, which have a zero-tolerance policy for the exploitation of minors.\nAmir from Leeds told the BBC last month that his 15-year-old son is \"addicted\" to Roblox, and can use the site for up to 14 hours a day.\nHe has welcomed the changes announced today for younger users, but wants the platform itself to do more and target the availability of inappropriate games for children.\nKathryn Foley's nine-year-old daughter Helene is a regular on Roblox.

The pressure remains to urgently find a viable long-term solution for the canal. \n\"We will continue to call on the Welsh government to help secure a more sustainable future for this beautiful canal that brings so much to the area.\"\nThe Welsh government previously said \"protecting and enhancing our environment and natural resources is key to addressing the climate and nature emergencies\".\nIt added any arrangement between the canal and Welsh Water would be a commercial contractual decision in which it should not be involved.\nWelsh Water said it was \"pleased to have come to an agreement to support the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal that covers the cost of providing the water and doesn't incur additional costs for our customers or put at risk the supply of drinking water over the summer\".\n\"We will continue to work closely with the Canal and Rivers Trust, Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Government on a longer-term solution that can support the canal beyond the coming year,\" it added.",

That might not sound like much, but the fix has required some serious engineering - much more than just laying some tarmac.\nIn fact, the tarmacking and painting only took about a week. But what went before was far more complex, not least because the road was still slowly sliding away.\nWiltshire Council said it had to wait for the land to mostly stop moving before it could do much.\nIt also had to get a lot of ground investigations done, something the council has said was \"absolutely necessary\" and means the same problem should not happen again.\nThe new section of road and its supports has been designed to last around 120 years and took 25,000 work hours.\nContractors Octavius did the work, which the company perhaps understatedly described as \"a challenge\", starting in July 2024.\n\"The hillside was still creeping when we commenced work, and such ground conditions demanded some creative solutions,\" said Chris Hudson, operations director of Octavius' highways business.\nMassive excavators and cranes were needed - something made trickier by being in a rural area with limited access to the site.\nThe repair crews also had extra issues with more wet weather and not wanting to make the slipping worse.\n\"We came with an initial plan - the access changed that plan several times. We adapted,\" said Mr Hudson.\nHe explained that masses of earth had to be taken away to make the area more stable.\nThen a 108m-long huge retaining wall had to be put in place.\nBig concrete pillars called bored piles - 120 of them - were put into the ground. \nThey go down 14 metres. To put that into perspective, most UK homes would not have foundations beyond a couple of metres into the earth.\nA large beam was then put on top of those and the slope above and below the road was reshaped with new drainage, using 560m of drainage channels and grates and 1,000 tonnes of stone counterforts.\nAltogether for the project, 650 cubic metres of concrete was needed and 2,370 bags of grout.\nThere have been finishing touches too - 600 new plants now run alongside the road.\nThe road would usually take around 5,500 vehicles a day, but for three years these have all been diverted through smaller villages.\nLocals have said they are thrilled to have it re-open and Wiltshire Council has thanked the community for its patience\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "Last year, on 17 September, at around 15:30, a pager which a nurse called Adam was given at the start of his shift at a hospital in Lebanon received a message. The devices had been distributed by Hezbollah, the Shia Muslim group, to thousands of its members, including Adam, and he said it was how he and his colleagues expected to be alerted of emergencies or a disaster.\n\"The pager started beeping non-stop and, on the screen, it said 'alert',\" Adam, who did not want to use his real name for safety reasons, said. The text appeared to have been sent by the group's leadership. To read it, he had to press two buttons, simultaneously, with both hands. Adam did it many times, but the beeps continued. \"Then suddenly, as I was sitting at my desk,\" he said, \"the pager exploded\".\nOn his phone, Adam showed me a video of the room, filmed by a colleague minutes after he was rescued. There was a trail of blood on the floor. \"I tried to crawl to the door because I had locked it while I changed my clothes,\" he said. The blast had opened a hole in the wood desk. I noticed a beige-like object. \"That's my finger,\" he said.\nHezbollah is known for being a powerful militia and is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US. But in Lebanon, it is also a significant political movement with representation in parliament and a social organisation. Here, being a Hezbollah member does not necessarily mean you are a fighter. In fact, many are not. Adam told me he had never been one. People can work in the group's large array of institutions that include hospitals and emergency services, for example.\nHezbollah had decided to equip members with low-tech pagers for communicating rather than smartphones which it feared could be used by Israel, its arch-enemy, to gather sensitive information about the group. It turned out, though, that the devices which Hezbollah had distributed were part of a years-long elaborate Israeli plan: an explosive compound had been concealed within the pagers, waiting to be activated \u2013 and that is what happened on that day.\nIn the attack, Adam, who is 38, lost his thumb and two fingers on his left hand, and part of a finger on the other. He was blinded in his right eye, which has been replaced with a glass eye, and has only partial sight in the other. He showed me a picture of him in a hospital bed, taken an hour after the explosion, with his face burned, entirely blooded, covered with bandages. Despite his wounds, Adam remained committed to Hezbollah. I asked him how he felt when he looked at himself like that. \"Very good,\" he said in English. Then, in Arabic, he told me: \"Because we believe that the wounds are a kind of medal from God. Honouring what we go through fighting a righteous cause.\"\nBut the group is no longer the force it was since being dealt a devastating blow in Israel's bombing campaign and invasion of Lebanon, which followed the pager attacks, and faces serious challenges. At home, there is discontent among some supporters over the lack of funds for reconstruction, while the new government has vowed to disarm the group. In neighbouring Syria, the ouster of Bashar al-Assad's regime has disrupted the route used by Iran, its main supporter, for the supply of weapons and money.\nI visited communities in southern Lebanon that were destroyed by Israel's attacks, and saw that support for Hezbollah appeared undimmed. But, in views rarely expressed to media, others who backed it said the war had been a mistake, and even questioned the group's future as a military force.\nYou can listen to more from Hugo in his radio documentary - Crossing Continents: Hezbollah in trouble - here\nHezbollah, or Party of God, was created in the 1980s in response to Israel's occupation of Lebanon during the Lebanese civil war. To this day, the destruction of Israel remains one of its official goals. Their last war had been in 2006, which was followed by years of relative calm. Violence flared up again in 2023 after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. When Israel started bombarding Gaza, Hezbollah began firing rockets in around northern Israel, saying it was acting in support of Palestinians. Israel responded with air strikes on southern Lebanon, and tens of thousands of people were forced to flee on both sides of the border.\nThe pager attacks were a turning point in what had been, until then, an intensifying but relatively contained conflict. The devices exploded as people were working, shopping or at home. About a dozen people, including two children, were killed, and thousands wounded, many of them maimed. The attack caused anger in Lebanon, because of what was seen as its indiscriminate nature. A day later, walkie-talkies used by the group suddenly exploded too. I was at a funeral of some of the victims of the pagers when there was a loud blast. Hezbollah members, desperate, asked us to turn off our cameras or phones, as no-one knew what else could explode.\nIn the following weeks, Israel carried out a relentless bombing campaign and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. Across the country, around 4,000 people were killed and almost 18,000 others wounded. For Hezbollah, the conflict proved to be catastrophic. The group's top leaders were assassinated, many of its fighters killed and much of its arsenal destroyed. Among the dead was Hassan Nasrallah, who had been the head of Hezbollah for more than 30 years, assassinated in a massive air strike on the group's secret headquarters under apartment blocks in the Dahieh, where Hezbollah is based in Beirut.\nAt the end of November, battered, the group agreed on a ceasefire that was essentially a surrender.\nSouthern Lebanon is the heartland of Lebanon's Shia Muslim community, which is the bulk of Hezbollah's support base, and one of the regions of the country where the group has traditionally had a significant presence. I travelled to the border town of Kfar Kila, which had a pre-war population of 15,000 and was one of the first to fall when Israel invaded. Israel's stated war goal was to allow the return of residents to its northern communities, which had been emptied because of Hezbollah's attacks. In Kfar Kila, there was almost nothing left standing, and yellow Hezbollah flags dotted the huge piles of broken concrete and twisted metal.\nA 37-year-old woman called Alia had come with her husband and three daughters, aged 18, 14 and 10. The youngest was wearing a badge with a smiley picture of Nasrallah. \"I only knew that this was my house because of the remains of this plant over there, the roses, and this tree,\" Alia told me. From the street, she pointed at what she could identify in the rubble. \"This is the couch. There, the curtains. That was the living room. And that was the bedroom. That's my daughter's bicycle,\" she said. \"There's nothing to recover\".\nAccording to the World Bank, costs related to reconstruction and recovery are estimated at $11bn (\u00a38.5bn) across the country. One of Hezbollah's immediate challenges is to give financial help to people affected by the war, which is crucial to keep supporters on board. Those who lost their houses have received $12,000 to cover for a year's rent. But the group has not promised money to rebuild what was destroyed or to give compensation for destroyed businesses. The limited support is already fuelling discontent. Aila's shop had stock worth $20,000, and she was concerned no-one would cover her losses.\nIran, Hezbollah's backer, is one of the group's main sources of funds, weapons and training. But Lebanon's international allies want to cut off any financial support from Iran, to put even more pressure on Hezbollah, and say there will be no help if the Lebanese government does not act against Hezbollah. With the group weakened militarily, critics see this as a unique opportunity to disarm it.\nAlia told me: \"We don't want any aid that comes with conditions about our arms... We won't allow them to take our dignity, our honour, take away our arms just for us to build a house. We'll build it ourselves.\"\nIt is not surprising that Hezbollah's supporters remain defiant. For many, the group is a fundamental part of their lives, essential in their identities. But Hezbollah's power is seen - and felt - beyond its base. Before the war, its military wing was considered to be stronger than the Lebanese national army. A solid parliamentary bloc means that virtually no major decision has been possible without Hezbollah's consent. Because of Lebanon's fractured political system, the group has representation in the government. In short, Hezbollah has had the ability to paralyse the state, and many times has done so.\nBut the war has diminished the group's domestic position too. In January, the Lebanese parliament elected a new president, former army chief Joseph Aoun, after a two-year impasse that critics had blamed on Hezbollah. In the past, its MPs and allies would walk out of the chamber when a vote was scheduled. But Hezbollah, severely wounded and with its communities in need of help, felt it could no longer block the process, which was seen as vital to unlock some international support. In his inauguration speech, Aoun promised to make the Lebanese army the sole carrier of weapons in the country. He did not mention Hezbollah, but everyone understood the message.\nUltimately, Hezbollah's future may lie with Iran. One of the reasons for Iran to have a strong Hezbollah in Lebanon was to deter any Israeli attack, especially on its nuclear facilities. This is now gone. Other groups backed by Iran in the region, part of what it calls the Axis of Resistance, have also been significantly weakened, including Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen. And the fall of the Assad regime in Syria has interrupted Iran's land corridor to Lebanon - and Hezbollah. Even if Iran decides to rearm Hezbollah, it will not be easy.\nNasrallah has been succeeded by Naim Qassem, his former deputy, who is not seen as charismatic or influential. From time to time, rumours emerge of internal disagreements. And whispers of dissent among the rank and file are spreading. In southern Lebanon, I met a businessman who did not want to have his name published, fearing that he could become a target on social media. On the wall of his office, he had pictures of Hezbollah's leaders. Now, he was critical of the group.\n\"The mistakes have been huge,\" he said. \"Hezbollah decided to engage in a war to support Gaza without proper calculations, without consulting the people or the Lebanese state\". (To date, Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.) He told me a lot of supporters shared his view. \"If Hezbollah don't do a proper reassessment of the situation... they will destroy themselves and harm us along the way. We brought this destruction on ourselves, and we're now suffering\".\nAs part of the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah agreed to remove its weapons and fighters from southern Lebanon, and a Western diplomatic official told me the group had largely done it. Israel was required to withdraw its troops, but has remained in five positions, saying this is needed for the safety of its border communities. The Israeli military has also carried out air strikes on targets and people it says are linked to Hezbollah. Lebanon says the Israeli permanence in Lebanese territory and its attacks are violations of the deal.\nDiscussions about Hezbollah's disarmament are likely to be difficult and long. A source familiar with the group told me one of the options was for Hezbollah's arsenal, believed to still include long-range missiles, to be put under the control of the state, while its fighters, estimated to be several thousand, could be integrated into the Lebanese army.\nThe businessman told me: \"A lot of the families, especially those of wounded and martyred fighters, are totally dependent on Hezbollah. These people won't disengage from Hezbollah immediately\u2026 Without a plan, it would be a recipe for internal conflict. It would drive Lebanese to fight against each other\".\nFor weeks, I tried to interview a representative from Hezbollah, but no-one was made available.\nAdam, the pager casualty, has now returned to his work as a nurse. He no longer does nightshifts, however, as he cannot see well. The explosion also left shrapnel in head and chest. As he gets tired easily, he needs to take constant breaks to rest. Physiotherapy sessions are helping him adapt to using what is left of his left thumb and middle finger.\nProminent in his living room, is a picture he framed, of himself, with his injured hands, holding a pager. He shared with me another picture, of his maimed hand, only now it also bore a tattooed message which expressed that his wounds were a cheap sacrifice in honour of Nasrallah, the late Hezbollah leader. He, like many, still believes in the group's purpose, and the role it plays.",

        "article_text": "From Drop to A Minecraft Movie, these are the films to stream at home and watch at the cinema this month.\nDavid Cronenberg's latest sci-fi-tinged drama stars Vincent Cassel as Karsh, an inventor who looks a lot like Cronenberg himself. Grief-stricken by the death of his wife (Diane Kruger), Karsh develops camera systems that can be buried with corpses, so that their relatives can watch them on monitors as they decompose. The invention catches on, but one night some graves containing these high-tech \"shrouds\" are desecrated, so Karsh and his brother-in-law (Guy Pearce) have to work out who was responsible. This may sound like the kind of scenario that the director of Scanners and The Fly might use to justify lots of gory body horror, but The Shrouds is a \"restrained, even elegant\" film inspired by Cronenberg's own bereavement, says Steve Pond at The Wrap. \"It's a deeply personal look at loss that finds plenty of time to get creepy but never loses sight of the fact that it's a movie about grief\u2026 Its focus, which never wavers, is always on the feeling of loss, not the sight of gore.\"\nReleased on 18 April in the US\nThree of Hollywood's brightest young stars get together in On Swift Horses, a handsome period romance directed by Daniel Minhan and adapted from Shannon Pufahl's novel. Daisy Edgar-Jones plays Muriel, the fianc\u00e9e of an upstanding Korean War veteran, Lee (Will Poulter). He is looking forward to a traditional family life in California in the go-getting 1950s, but when his younger brother Julius (Jacob Elordi) comes to stay, Julius's gay relationships and gambling sprees help Muriel to understand why she is attracted to women and drawn to betting on horse races. Graham Guttman at Screen Rant calls the film a \"quietly devastating [story of] great pain and even greater love, all of which is portrayed beautifully by the film's all-star cast\", adding: \"On Swift Horses, with its sweeping romance and epic nature, feels outside of time, transcending any issues to become something deeply affecting.\" On the other hand, the BBC's Caryn James considers it \"a disappointment [that] works much better as an idea than as a film\".\nReleased on 25 April in the US and Canada, and on 30 April in France\nOn a remote island in Eastern Europe, fanged and furry monsters called Ochi lurk in the forests. A farmer (Willem Dafoe) is obsessed by hunting them, but when his shy teenage daughter (Helena Zengel) finds an injured baby Ochi, it turns out to be a big-eyed, pointy-eared beastie that bears a striking resemblance to Gizmo from Gremlins and Grogu from The Mandalorian. The girl then defies her father and takes the creature back to its family \u2013 a journey that is visualised using practical rather than digital effects. \"The Legend of Ochi, the rare A24 family film, is a charming throwback to adventure movies of the 80s like The Neverending Story and The Dark Crystal,\" says Brian Tallerico at RogerEbert.com, \"complete with original puppetry that reportedly contains not an ounce of CGI manipulation. It feels like a family film made by flesh-and-blood people in an era when computers are doing so much of the work.\"\nReleased on 25 April in the US, the UK, Canada and Ireland\nRyan Coogler has already put his own personal stamp on the sports drama (Creed) and the superhero blockbuster (Black Panther), and now, with Sinners, the writer-director takes on gothic horror. His favourite leading man, Michael B Jordan, plays two gun-toting twin brothers, Smoke and Stack, who go back to their rural hometown in 1930s Louisiana, only to find that the local blues music \"can pierce the veil between life and death\". The town is soon infested with vampires \u2013 but don't think of Sinners as a straightforward vampire chiller. \"The film is very genre-fluid,\" Coogler said in The Hollywood Reporter. \"It switches in and out of a lot of different genres. Yes, vampires are an element, but it's not the only supernatural element in the movie... I'm blessed to have found this medium that I can work out deep philosophical and existential questions that I may be struggling with while contributing to an art form that means so much to my family.\"\nReleased internationally on 18 April\nFirst dates can be awkward, but not many are as awkward as the one in Drop, a high-concept one-location thriller from Christopher Landon, the writer-director of Happy Death Day and Freaky. Meghann Fahy stars as a single mother, Violet, who agrees to have dinner with the eligible Henry (Brandon Sklenar) in a Chicago skyscraper's restaurant. Everything is going smoothly until someone in the restaurant starts sending threatening messages to Violet's phone. She is told that there is an intruder in her home, and that unless she poisons Henry, her five-year-old son will be killed. \"[Fahy's] dialled-in performance is thankfully matched by an overarching crispness to the proceedings,\" says Adrian Horton in The Guardian. \"Just enough flourishes, an enjoyable but not unbearable amount of stress, no wasted time, a perfect match of star, script and style. For those who sort for lean and limber in their thrillers, Drop is a date worth making.\"\nReleased internationally on 11 April\nWhen Alex Garland was making his last film, Civil War, his military advisor for the battle sequences was Ray Mendoza, an Iraq War veteran. This collaboration prompted Garland and Mendoza to co-direct another film, a faithful recreation of a battle which Mendoza himself was in, that plays out in real time over 90 minutes. D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai plays Mendoza (alongside Will Poulter, Joseph Quinn and Charles Melton) in what some critics are calling cinema's most authentic and immersive ever depiction of a wartime firefight. It's a film that pushes the \"war is hell\" concept \"to its logical, visceral and most infernal conclusion\", says Kevin Maher in The Times. \"This is a movie that's as difficult to watch as it is to forget. It's a sensory blitz, a percussive nightmare and a relentless assault on the soul.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US and Canada, 16 April in Spain, 17 April in Australia, Brazil and Germany, and 18 April in the UK\nIf you finished watching Peter Jackson's series, The Beatles: Get Back, and you wanted to know what John Lennon got up to after the Fab Four broke up, then One to One: John & Yoko could be the film for you. Directed by Kevin Macdonald (One Day in September, Marley) along with Sam Rice-Edwards, the documentary chronicles the 18 months in the early 1970s when Lennon and Yoko One lived in Greenwich Village, New York. It covers the only full-length concert Lennon played after his time in The Beatles \u2013 but that was just one of the couple's many endeavours during their stay in the Big Apple. \"Drawing on televised interviews, taped phone calls with agents and managers, and personal film footage,\" says David Hughes in Time Out, \"Macdonald charts the couple's determination to fight for any worthy cause that crosses their eyeline, from the Vietnam War to fundraising for remanded prisoners unable to afford bail. The pair's artistry, individually and collectively, seems to be matched only by their energy and moral clarity.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US, the UK and Ireland\nWhat if Die Hard was set at a meeting of the world's most powerful political leaders? And what if the US president in Air Force One was a woman? The answer to both of these questions can be found in G20, a gleefully over-the-top action thriller directed by Patricia Riggen. Viola Davis stars as US President Danielle Sutton, who is at a G20 summit in South Africa when a terrorist group takes the guests hostage. What the bad guys (led by Antony Starr from The Boys) haven't counted on is that the POTUS is an army veteran, and even when she's wearing a cocktail dress, she can fight with the best of them. \"It was the sort of thing you'd imagine as a kid, just playing the most heroic character you could possibly play,\" Davis told Variety. The only question the film doesn't answer is whether the sequel will be called G21.\nReleased on 10 April on Prime\nA Minecraft Movie is a children's adventure co-starring Jack Black, and adapted from a video game about a colourful fantasy world being threatened by infernal invaders. Does that sound familiar? If so, it's because the very same summary applies to The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Still, that was the second highest grossing film of 2023, so maybe A Minecraft Movie will be just as lucrative. The difference is that the new film, which also stars Jason Momoa and Jennifer Coolidge, has live-action actors in a CGI world. Also, it's directed by Jared Hess, the maker of such eccentric comedies as Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre. \"By some force of alchemy, his cockeyed look at things \u2013 a mix of deadpan delivery, garish colours, and exaggerated interactions \u2013 is weirdly perfect for this adaptation,\" says Jordan Hoffman in Entertainment Weekly. \"There's an 'anything goes' attitude here\u2026 [and] this loosey-goosey attitude is a breath of fresh air after so many family films that seem preordained by lore.\"\nReleased internationally on 4 April\nWith a dynamic that's not a million miles away from the central relationship in A Real Pain, Sacramento is an indie comedy about two mismatched male friends \u2013 one neurotic, the other annoyingly outgoing \u2013 embarking on a trip together. Glenn, played by Michael Cera, is even more anxious than usual because he is about to become a father, while the extrovert Rickey, played by Michael Angarano, is traumatised by the death of his own father. Could a weekend in Sacramento, California help them to overcome all of their issues? Angarano is also the co-writer, co-producer and director of a film that features both his ex-partner, Kristen Stewart, and his current partner, Maya Erskine. David Ehrlich at IndieWire says that Angarano \"graduates from overeager dilettante to unusually shrewd comic director\" with Sacramento. \"Its casual nature and outward lack of ambition belie how well it manages to convey the terror that change brings into our lives, the mania of trying to deny it, and the relief that comes from recognising that someone else in your world is changing with you.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US\nAng Lee's second film, The Wedding Banquet, was a romantic comedy about a gay Taiwanese New Yorker who marries a Chinese woman so that she can get a green card, only for his unwitting parents to mark the occasion with a lavish party. The film made Lee's name as a director when it was released in 1993, and it went on to be nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Now it has been remade by Andrew Ahn (Fire Island), with a stellar cast that includes Bowen Yang (Wicked), Lily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon) and Kelly Marie Tran (Star Wars: The Last Jedi). Ahn moves the story to Seattle, adds a subplot about fertility treatment, and rejigs the nationalities and generations so that the visiting relative is now a grandmother (Minari's Youn Yuh-jung) from South Korea. \"An intended marriage of convenience still lies at its heart,\" says Amber Wilkinson in Screen Daily, \"but the relationships are given a modern makeover as Ahn probes questions of commitment and celebrates the families we choose to make for ourselves\".\nReleased on 18 April in the US and Canada\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Lesotho was slapped with the White House's highest tariff rates in the list released by US President Donald Trump on Wednesday.\nAmericans bringing goods in from the small southern African country will have to pay an additional 50% import tax.\nThe US has a big trade deficit with Lesotho, which sells textiles \u2013 including jeans \u2013 and diamonds to America.\nThe 50% rate for Lesotho was part of what Trump described as \"reciprocal tariffs\" imposed on imports from dozens of countries, including 20 in Africa. All nations face a minimum rate of 10%.\nResponding to the news, Lesotho's Trade Minister Mokhethi Shelile said his government would send a delegation to Washington to argue against the new trade measure.\n\"My biggest concern was the immediate closure of factories and job losses,\" the AFP news agency quotes him as telling journalists on Thursday.\nOne of Trump's aims with his tariff announcement is to reduce his country's trade deficit with the rest of the world.\nAnd this gives a clue as to why Lesotho has been hit so hard.\nAccording to White House figures, in 2024 while the US exported just $2.8m (\u00a32.1m) worth of goods to Lesotho, its imports from the southern African country amounted to $237.3m.\nIn their calculations, US officials used the difference between the value of imports and exports in setting the tariff rates for different countries.\nIn recent years, Lesotho has been successful in selling textiles to the US, making the most of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa). This US legislation from 2000 allowed eligible African countries to send some goods to the US without having tariffs slapped on them.\nSigned into law by President Bill Clinton, Agoa was intended to help African countries grow their economies and create jobs, but these tariffs appear to threaten its future.\nLesotho's garment factories have made jeans for major American brands such as Levi's and Wrangler in recent years.\nClothes make up nearly three-quarters of what Lesotho exports to the US \u2013 its second biggest trading partner after South Africa.\nThe value of that US trade amounts to more than 10% of its total annual national income. The extra costs that the tariffs will incur for American buyers could reduce demand and therefore have a big impact on Lesotho's economy.\n\"This has been a devastating day for us,\" Teboho Kobeli, founder of Lesotho clothes manufacturer Afri-Expo Textiles, told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.\nHe said he had spent the day in talks with industry colleagues and the government about what to do next. \nWhile his business, which Mr Kobeli says employs around 2,000 people, can look for other markets, the US is so significant  that \"we can't just shelve the US market... we need to do everything we can to bring [it] back\".\nColette van der Ven, a lawyer who specialises in international trade, told the BBC that the 50% figure Trump has imposed on Lesotho \"makes little sense logically\".\nShe described it as \"ironic\" that the US was effectively punishing Lesotho for the success it has enjoyed under Agoa.\n\"It's this sense that the US is being taken advantage of because it's running a trade deficit. It's really reflective of a new ideology about trade and who is benefiting and who is not\".\nOther African countries hit with extra tariffs include 47% for Madagascar, 40% for Mauritius, 37% for Botswana and 30% for South Africa.\nNigerian exports will be hit too - at a rate of 14%.\nKenya, Ghana, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Senegal and Liberia were among those countries whose exports to the US will be subject to the baseline tariff of 10%. The US is not running a trade deficit with these countries.\n\nTrump said the reciprocal tariffs were \"for countries that treat us badly\".\nDuring Wednesday's announcement at the White House, the Republican president said that the US had been taken advantage of by \"cheaters\" and had been \"pillaged\" by foreigners.\n\"Our taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, but it is not going to happen any more,\" Trump said.\nSouth Africa is on the long list of countries dubbed the \"worst offenders\", which also includes China, Japan and the European Union. These now face higher US rates - payback for unfair trade policies, Trump said.\n\"They have got some bad things going on in South Africa. You know, we are paying them billions of dollars, and we cut the funding because a lot of bad things are happening in South Africa,\" he said, before going on to name other countries.\nUS-South Africa relations have become increasingly strained since the start of the Trump presidency in January.\nSouth Africa's biggest export to the US is platinum, which may be exempted from the import tax. But its second biggest export - cars - will be hit hard.\nIn a statement, the South African presidency condemned the new tariffs as \"punitive\", saying they could \"serve as a barrier to trade and shared prosperity\".\n\"We now have to look amongst ourselves and say, within the customs union in southern Africa... how we're going to respond to these issues,\" South Africa's Trade Minister Parks Tau is quoted by AFP as saying.\n\"Diversifying our trade is going to be important... enhancing our work on the African continent and collaborating,\" he said.\nThe White House released a list of roughly 100 countries and the tariff rates that the US would impose on what Trump dubbed \"liberation day\" for the American people.\nTrump added 34% to the existing 20% duties on all Chinese imports to the US, making it the highest rate globally.\nIn addition, Trump imposed a 25% tariff on all foreign-made cars.\nThe US is expected to start charging the 10% tariffs on 5 April, with the higher duties for certain nations starting on 9 April.\nAfrican countries like South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya have long-standing trade relations with the US, and the new tariffs could significantly affect existing economic ties.\nAnnabel Bishop, chief economist at Investec, a South Africa-based banking and investment firm, believes the impact will be \"very negative\".\nBut she told the BBC that the tariffs could accelerate the current shift in Africa's trading practices.\n\"What we would expect to see is greater trade with the Global South, where possible, [there] is likely to be some switching in trade partners.\"\nThe tariffs also come in as many African countries are already grappling with the effects of US foreign aid cuts, which provided health and humanitarian assistance to vulnerable nations.\nTrump announced the aid freeze on his first day in office in January as part of a review into the US government spending.\nAdditional reporting by Basillioh Rukanga, Mayeni Jones and Cecilia Macaulay\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Being Maria, a new film starring Matt Dillon and Anamaria Vartolomei, explores the life of Maria Schneider and the making of one of the most notorious films in cinema history.\nIt may be the most infamous scene in the entire history of cinema. The sexually explicit drama Last Tango in Paris, made by Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci and released in 1972, is the story of an affair between a middle-aged man, Paul, and a young woman, Jeanne, in a Paris apartment. The notorious \"butter scene\" was not in the original script and elements of it were made without 19-year-old actress Maria Schneider's prior consent.\nWarning: This article contains themes of sexual assault that some may find upsetting.\u00a0\nSchneider struggled with drug addiction and her mental health for years after the film's release, but her story, and the making of Last Tango in Paris, is now being told through the film Being Maria. It stars Matt Dillon as Marlon Brando, who played Paul, and Anamaria Vartolomei as Schneider. The film's French director Jessica Palud adapted the story from a 2018 memoir by journalist Vanessa Schneider, Maria's cousin.\n\"I think we have to look at the context of the time of Last Tango in Paris, it's now fifty years since the film was made,\" Matt Dillon tells the BBC. \"That time was a different time, but it's very important to look at it now from a different perspective.\n\"It was really a traumatic experience for her. And not just at the time it happened, but as it continued to follow her and haunt her wherever she went in her life, in so many ways.\"\nBeing Maria explores Schneider's background: she was the product of an affair between a famous French actor, Daniel G\u00e9lin, and a Romanian model. She first met her father as a teenager, and he introduced her to film sets. Last Tango in Paris was her first leading role, and she would later recall in a 2007 interview, then in her fifties, that she was persuaded to take the part instead of starring in a film with French film star Alain Delon, and, at the age of 19, \"didn't understand all of the film's sexual content\". She \"had a bad feeling about it all\", she said, but was told by her agency she couldn't possibly turn down working with Marlon Brando, one of the greatest stars of 20th-Century cinema.\nShe remembered what happened on the day of filming that scene, in which her character is raped by Brando's, using butter as a lubricant. \"That scene wasn't in the original script. The truth is it was Marlon who came up with the idea. They only told me about it before we had to film the scene and I was so angry\u2026 I felt humiliated and to be honest, I felt a little raped, both by Marlon and by Bertolucci. After the scene, Marlon didn't console me or apologise,\" she said. \"Marlon said to me: 'Maria, don't worry, it's just a movie,' but during the scene, even though what Marlon was doing wasn't real, I was crying real tears.\n\"Thankfully, there was just one take.\"\nBertolucci would later talk about why he withheld details of the scene from Schneider, saying: \"I wanted her reaction as a girl, not as an actress. I wanted her to react humiliated.\" He insisted that it was only the use of the butter that had surprised the actress, but Matt Dillon says what happened was \"really wrong\".\n\"It's something that we often do, actors, we won't tell the other actor, or the director will encourage us to not reveal what we're going to do, so we can get a real reaction,\" he says. \"But it was really wrong, with a scene that was so sensitive, to do something like that.\"\u00a0\nJessica Palud tells the BBC that recreating the rape scene \"couldn't be avoided\" in Being Maria, but this time, the audience sees events from Maria Schneider's perspective. \"I couldn't avoid shooting this scene because it was the very moment in which her life completely switches. Everything goes wrong from there,\" Palud says. \"It was important to have the scene from her point of view, in her body, in her gaze, what she went through, and the fact that there were witnesses. Maria was being assaulted in the presence of the whole crew, who were observing and not reacting.\"\nThis time the scene was prepared using an intimacy co-ordinator, which 61-year-old Dillon says was his first time working with one. \"I said to the intimacy co-ordinator, 'do you know what the scene is about?'\" he recalls. \"They said yes, and I said, 'Because you can probably trace back the role of an intimacy co-ordinator to that moment, in that film.'\"\u00a0\nThe use of an intimacy co-ordinator, who acts as a choreographer and a liaison between actors and production during simulated sex and nude scenes, is increasingly standard in the industry since the #MeToo movement. It now makes headlines when they're declined, including by Mikey Madison in Oscar winner Anora, or when Gwyneth Paltrow revealed that she told one to \"step a little bit back\" during her sex scenes with Timoth\u00e9e\u00a0Chalamet in Marty Supreme.\n\"I don't think it's a bad thing, I think it can evolve into being something good,\" Dillon says of using intimacy co-ordinators. \"It seems they're there to prevent people from crossing boundaries, but in fact it's creating boundaries that give opportunities for different ways of approaching these scenes. I hope that's how it evolves rather than people feeling like 'they're here to tell us what we can and can't do.' And Anamaria and I were very comfortable.\"\nAnamaria Vartolomei (who also made Golden Lion winner Happening, featuring scenes of illegal abortion) says that although she felt \"safe, protected and guided\" shooting the rape scene on the Being Maria shoot, she still became upset. \"This scene was really violent,\" she tells the BBC. \"I couldn't imagine what it was for Maria as she felt it for real. I'm just playing her. But this thing really happened to her, and she had no one around her. She just had people looking at her without doing anything. I think the violence of it was double because she didn't have the support I had on set, but I still felt it was really hard.\u00a0\n\"I was so emotional that day. I couldn't stop crying because I feel I accumulated the violence of the scene when I saw it on screen. When I had to play it, all my tears came out. I think it's very brutal. And it's insane to think that somebody could do this.\"\u00a0\nMaria Schneider was not only professionally unsupported on set, but she also lacked the experience to know that Bertolucci couldn't make her to do the scene. \"I should have called my agent or had my lawyer come to the set because you can't force someone to do something that isn't in the script, but at the time, I didn't know that,\" she would say later.\u00a0\nBut it was also the sensation the film Last Tango in Paris caused when it was shown from October 1972 that would undo Schneider. Despite (or helped by) it being banned or restricted in some countries; it made around $36m in the US alone. In France, it was reported audiences were queueing round the block for two hours or more to get a ticket.\nThe disparity between Bertolucci, Brando and Schneider became clear: critical reaction to the film aided Bertolucci's reputation as an international auteur, and both he and Brando were nominated for Oscars for the film. Brando, now doubly legendary for making Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather during the same period, is reported to have made around $3m out of Last Tango, as he took a share of the profits; Schneider recalled she was paid around $4,000. She appeared in full-frontal nudity; Brando never appeared naked in the film.\nThe young woman found the overnight fame increasingly hard to deal with. She told interviewers when the film came out that she had slept with 50 men and 20 women and \"had tried heroin\", because, she later explained, that although this was untrue, she was seen [as] \"that sexy bimbo\". Her erratic behaviour, she said, was down to being afraid. \"To be suddenly famous all over the world was frightening,\" she said. \"I didn't have bodyguards like they do today. People thought I was just like my character, and I would make up stories for the press, but that wasn't me\u2026 It made me go mad. I got into drugs\u2026 it was like an escape from reality. It was the 70s and at that time, it was all going on.\"\nHer cousin, Vanessa Schneider, has said of her that she was also a victim of the double standards of the time: \"For puritanical viewers, she was an easy woman who made pornography. It was brutal for her, especially since it wasn't at all in her nature \u2013 she was pretty modest, reserved and fairly conservative in certain respects.\"\n\"People thought I was like the girl in the movie, but that wasn't me,\" Maria Schneider declared in a 2007 interview. \"I felt very sad because I was treated like a sex symbol, I wanted to be recognised as an actress, and the whole scandal and the aftermath of the film turned me a little crazy and I had a breakdown.\" Schneider also revealed that she tried to take her life during this period.\nLater on, Schneider would get sober, but although she made around 50 films during her career (including the critically acclaimed 1975 film The Passenger, co-starring Jack Nicholson) she remarked that \"Last Tango is still the one everyone asks me about.\" She died in 2011, from cancer.\n\"The unfortunate thing is Maria Schneider gave an incredible performance in that film, and you could see how her career could have taken a different path,\" Matt Dillon says. \"But she already had so many strikes against her. Her family of origin was a very messy situation. She was abandoned by her parents and then abandoned by the people that she worked with. I think this abandonment followed her.\"\nSchneider is not the only female actor of that era who suffered because of the hype around an erotic movie they starred in \u2013 Sylvia Kristel also found it hard to escape the sensation created by 1974's soft porn movie Emmanuelle, in which she had the leading role, and which also featured a rape scene. Nor was it only women who suffered making films with sexual content; Schneider would later say that \"even Brando said he felt raped and manipulated\" during the infamous Last Tango scene.\n\"It was an era of celebrity directors,\" Anna Smith, host of the podcast Girls on Film, tells the BBC. \"And the pattern seems to be mainly domineering male directors exploiting and bullying younger actresses. The entitlement of some of these lauded men enabled them to exert control over women.\"\n\"We had this idea of the creator, the director that has the supreme power,\" says Vartolomei, \"and that they were a sort of guru of directing, and that all the people around him were listening to him as if he was God. I think that was the problem back then. Now we're more protected and our voice is heard, and it is also valued, which [it] wasn't back then.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How Snow White became 2025's most divisive film\n\u2022 10 of the best films to watch in March\n\u2022 Why cult film Emmanuelle is 'extremely problematic' \nBut Being Maria director Jessica Palud points out that one of the more extraordinary aspects of Schneider's character was that long before the era of #MeToo, she was speaking out about what happened on the set of Last Tango in Paris. \"The thing is that what I really found interesting and touching about her is that although it was in the 1970s and at the time, many young actresses would get assaulted or raped, but they kept it inside. Maria was extremely vocal and clear in interviews\u2026 she would speak up, but she wasn't listened to.\"\u00a0\nSchneider's experience on Last Tango was eventually taken seriously in 2016, when footage of Bertolucci's 2013 interview with Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise about the infamous scene and his desire for Schneider's humiliation to be real resurfaced. This time, it caused outrage. Some did not realise that the sex scene was, however traumatic, only simulated by Brando and Schneider. The then 76-year-old director called the furore \"ridiculous\" and reiterated that Schneider knew about the scene beforehand.\nAll three of the main storytellers of Last Tango in Paris \u2013 Bertolucci, Brando and Schneider \u2013 are now dead. Knowing that the horror, shock, upset and fury seen on Maria Schneider's face is real, and deliberately provoked, should the film, as French newspaper Le Monde pondered after the cancellation of a 2024 screening in Paris due to protests, carry some kind of warning?\n\"I have long thought that the perceived canon of cinematic greats needs re-examining \u2013 as it comes from an inherently patriarchal place,\" says Smith. \"I think it's healthy to revisit classics from a modern perspective; I hope our understanding of the damage that can be caused by certain attitudes and practices has evolved.\"\nBeing Maria, Palud says, attempts to show that, but she says that \"I did not want to judge nor condemn, but to show the system and show what needs to change in the system for this younger generation to be protected. There's still a lot to do. But a scene like this wouldn't happen now, thank God.\"\nVartolomei adds: \"I feel this movie is clearing things up for Maria, along with Vanessa Schneider's book. Back then, Maria was considered a victim, but for me she's far from that, as she found the strength to talk, for the story to be heard, even if she decided to talk in a society that wasn't ready to receive her voice. But now I'm just happy that we are finally able to hear her.\"\nBeing Maria has a US-wide release from 4 April.\u00a0\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Warning: This article contains details and images that some readers may find distressing\nDriving into Mandalay, the massive scale of the destruction from last Friday's earthquake revealed itself bit by bit.\nIn nearly every street we turned into, especially in the northern and central parts of the city, at least one building had completely collapsed, reduced to a pile of rubble. Some streets had multiple structures which had come down.\nAlmost every building we saw had cracks running through at least one of its walls, unsafe to step into. At the main city hospital they're having to treat patients outdoors.\nMyanmar's military government has said it's not allowing foreign journalists into the country after the quake, so we went in undercover. We had to operate carefully, because the country is riddled with informers and secret police who spy on their own people for the ruling military junta.\nWhat we witnessed was a people who had very little help coming their way in the face of this massive disaster.\n\"I have hope that he's alive, even if it's a small chance,\" said Nan Sin Hein, 41, who's been waiting on the street opposite a collapsed five-storey building, day and night for five days. \nHer 21 year-old-son Sai Han Pha was a construction worker, renovating the interiors of the building, which used to be a hotel and was being turned into an office space.\n\"If they can rescue him today, there's a chance he'll survive,\" she says.\nWhen the 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck, the bottom of the building sank into the ground, its top lurching at an angle over the street, looking like it could tip over at any minute.\nSai Han Pha and four other workers were trapped inside.\nWhen we visited, rescue efforts had not even begun at the building and there was no sign they would start soon. There just isn't enough help available on the ground - and the reason for that is the political situation in the country.\nEven before the earthquake Myanmar was in turmoil - locked in a civil war that has displaced an estimated 3.5 million people. Its military has continued operations against armed insurgent groups despite the disaster.\nThis means that security forces are too stretched to put their full might behind relief and rescue operations. Except in some key locations, we didn't see them in large numbers in Mandalay.\nThe military junta has put out a rare appeal for international aid, but its uneasy relations with many foreign countries, including the UK and the US, has meant that while these countries have pledged aid, help in the form of manpower on the ground is currently only from countries like India, China and Russia, among a few others.\nAnd so far those rescue efforts appear to be focused on structures where masses of people are feared trapped \u2013 the high-rise Sky Villa condominium complex which was home to hundreds of people, and U Hla Thein Buddhist academy where scores of monks were taking an examination when the earthquake struck.\nNeeraj Singh, who is leading the Indian disaster response team working at the Buddhist academy, said the structure had collapsed like a \"pancake\" - one layer on top of another.\n\"It's the most difficult collapse pattern and the chances of finding survivors are very low. But we are still hopeful and trying our best,\" he told the BBC.\nWorking under the sweltering sun, in nearly 40C, rescuers use metal drills and cutters to break the concrete slabs into smaller pieces. It's slow and extremely demanding work. When a crane lifts up the concrete pieces, the stench of decaying bodies, already quite strong, becomes overwhelming.\nThe rescuers spot four to five bodies, but it still takes a couple of hours to pull the first one out.\nSitting on mats under a makeshift tent in the compound of the academy are families of the students. Their faces are weary and despondent. As soon as they hear a body has been recovered, they crowd around the ambulance it is placed in.\nOthers gather around a rescuer who shows them a photo of the body on his mobile phone.\nAgonising moments pass as the families try to see if the dead man is a loved one.\nBut the body is so disfigured, the task is impossible. It is sent to a morgue where forensic tests will have to be conducted to confirm the identity.\nAmong the families is the father of 29-year-old U Thuzana. He has no hope that his son survived. \"Knowing my son ended up like this, I'm inconsolable, I'm filled with grief,\" U Hla Aung said, his face crumpling into a sob.\nMany of Mandalay's historical sites have also suffered significant damage, including the Mandalay Palace and the Maha Muni Pagoda, but we could not get in to see the extent of the damage.\nAccess to everything - collapse sites, victims and their families - was not easy because of the oppressive environment created by the military junta, with people often fearful of speaking to journalists.\nClose to the pagoda, we saw Buddhist funeral rituals being held on the street outside a destroyed house. It was the home of U Hla Aung Khaing and his wife Daw Mamarhtay, both in their sixties.\n\"I lived with them but was out when the earthquake struck. That's why I survived. Both my parents are gone in a single moment,\" their son told us.\nTheir bodies were extricated not by trained rescuers, but by locals who used rudimentary equipment. It took two days to pull out the couple, who were found with their arms around each other.\nMyanmar's military government says 2,886 people have died so far, but so many collapse sites have still not even been reached by the authorities, that that count is unlikely to be accurate. We may never find out what the real death toll of the earthquake was.\nParks and open spaces in Mandalay have turned into makeshift camps, as have the banks of the moat that runs around the palace. All over the city we saw people laying out mats and mattresses outside their homes as evening approached, preferring to sleep outdoors.\nMandalay is a city living in terror, and with good reason. Nearly every night since Friday there have been big aftershocks. We woke up to an aftershock of magnitude 5 in the middle of the night.\nBut tens of thousands are sleeping outdoors because they have no home to return to.\n\"I don't know what to think anymore. My heart still trembles when I think of that moment when the earthquake struck,\" said Daw Khin Saw Myint, 72, who we met while she was waiting in a queue for water, with her little granddaughter by her side. \"We ran out, but my house is gone. I'm living under a tree. Come and see.\"\nShe works as a washerwoman and says her son suffers from a disability which doesn't allow him to work.\n\"Where will I live now? I am in so much trouble. I'm living next to a rubbish dump. Some people have given me rice and a few clothes. We ran out in these clothes we are wearing.\n\"We don't have anyone to rescue us. Please help us,\" she said, tears rolling down her cheeks.\nAnother elderly woman chimes in, eyes tearing up, \"No one has distributed food yet today. So we haven't eaten.\"\nMost of the vehicles we saw pulling up to distribute supplies were small vans with limited stocks - donations from individuals or small local organisations. It's nowhere near enough for the number of people in need, leading to a scramble to grab whatever relief is available.\nParts of Mandalay's main hospital are also damaged, and so in an already difficult situation, rows and rows of beds are laid out in the hospital compound for patients.\nShwe Gy Thun Phyo, 14, has suffered from a brain injury, and has bloodshot eyes. She's conscious but unresponsive. Her father tries to make her as comfortable as possible.\nThere were very few doctors and nurses around to cope with the demand for treatment, which means families are stepping in to do what medical staff should.\nZar Zar has a distended belly because of a serious abdominal injury. Her daughter sits behind her, holding her up, and fans her, to give her some relief from the heat.\nWe couldn't spend a lot of time at the hospital for fear of being apprehended by the police or military.\nAs the window to find survivors of the earthquake narrows, increasingly those being brought into the hospital are the dead.\nNan Sin Hein, who is waiting outside the collapsed building where her son was trapped, was initially stoical, but she now looks like she is preparing to face what seems like the most likely outcome.\n\"I'm heartbroken. My son loved me and his little sisters. He struggled to support us,\" she says.\n\"I am just hoping to see my son's face, even if he is dead. I want to see his body. I want them to do everything they can to find his body.\"",

Several media reports have linked Mr Polyakov to a YouTube account, which features videos of a recent trip to Afghanistan. \n\"As well as all the somewhat more established threats to such peoples - from things like logging and mining in the Amazon where most uncontacted peoples live - there are now an increasing number of... influencers who are trying to do this kind of thing for followers,\" Mr Mazower said.\n\"There's a growing social media fascination with this whole idea.\"\nSurvival International describes the Sentinelese as \"the most isolated Indigenous people in the world\" living on an island around the size of Manhattan.  \nMr Mazower told the BBC an estimated 200 people belong to the tribe, before adding it was \"impossible\" to know its true number.\nFew details are known about the group, other than they are a hunter-gatherer community who live in small settlements and are \"extremely healthy\", he said. \nHe added that the incident highlighted why government protections for communities such as the Sentinelese are so important.\nThe UN's Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention sets out obligations for governments to protect the rights. India's government has an initiative focusing on tribal welfare, but the country has come under criticism in recent years for failing to protect against evictions. \nIt is not the first time an outsider has attempted to make contact with the Sentinelese. \nIn November 2018, John Allen Chau, also a US national, was killed by the tribe after visiting the same island. \nLocal officials said the 27-year-old was a Christian missionary. \nMr Chau was shot with bows and arrows upon landing. Reports at the time suggested he had bribed fisherman to take him to the island.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on Wednesday including a 10% tariff on most countries. \nSome of America's biggest trading partners will see even higher tariffs beginning 9 April. \nThe aggressive shift in trade policy makes clear where Trump stands on tariffs, but has left much of the world wondering what Americans - who are expected to see the side effects - think of the move. \nWe asked five people what they think. \nShe thinks the pain Americans will feel will be temporary and worth it. \nI know we're all going to get pinched in the pocket for a while. I think in the long run, it's going to get us out of the massive deficit that we're in. \nI am concerned about the price of goods going up. I am going to end up being more particular about what I buy, basically I'll tighten the belt for a while. \nBut then I think it's going to go full circle and it's going to be a good thing for the economy and for people in general. \nWe've been the world's financial doormat for a while and we've gotta stop it. \nThe soon-to-be-retiree worries about economic instability prompted by Trump's actions. \nI'm very unhappy. I'm probably a couple of years away from retiring and I don't know if I'm going to be able to retire. \nMy 401k's not doing great, Social Security is on the line and I don't think the tariffs are going to help America's standing on the world platform. \nTrump is not a king and I feel like our Congress and Senate is letting us down, both parties, by not pushing back [on tariffs].\nThey know better, and they're not doing anything. Why? \nThe trucker welcomes the incoming tariffs and hopes they can help restore smaller US towns.\nI feel like the way to kick-start investment back into US manufacturing is exactly this. \nIt's a necessary evil. \nUp until the 70s, there were two steel mills [in my area] and then they closed. And up until the last 10 years, the sites have been abandoned\nWe might not get back everything, but even if we recover 30-40% of it, it's quite a bit of money and jobs. \nGloria, who is retired, feels Trump administration officials don't appreciate how tariffs will affect her life.\nI'm on a fixed income. I'm retired, so things are going to go up and I'm worried. It means less money that I'll have coming in.\nWhat I'm trying to do is stock up on food because I think things are going to get really, really bad as far as shipping. Food is the one thing that you can't really cut from your budget. \nIf I can be honest, Trump's got all the money. He doesn't have to [worry about] food. Musk has all the things, so this isn't going to affect them. So they don't know about the pain. \nThey say 'a little pain', but how little is this pain?\nRobin says she's trying to hold out hope, but she worries the economic turmoil will affect her and her family.\nI'm worried. I'm worried about my retirement funds. I'm worried that he's going to make other countries hate us for what he's doing. I just think he's an idiot.\nI have a son and he's 30. He has his own family and he's looking for work and he's struggling. This isn't going to help things. He has two children - 18 months and six.\nI tend to be a glass half-full type of person, but the president and his ideas are just so crazy sometimes. My financial adviser, who I really trust, did say that some of Trump's plans are good and good for the finance market. \nIt gives me a little bit of hope, I guess. But then when you see the stock market plunging, it was like \"oh, maybe not\".",

On the other side is former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp.\n\"Jurgen's preferred option for that summer was Julian Brandt, who was a great player,\" said former Liverpool director of research Ian Graham, who spoke to BBC Sport as part of a documentary released on BBC iPlayer about Liverpool's journey to winning the 2018-19 Champions League.\n\"Jurgen had obviously known him very well, coming from the Bundesliga, and knew the German market very well.\n\"We agreed that Brandt was a very good young player but not a standout in the same way that Mo was. From our data analysis point of view Mo was the best young wide forward in Europe, full stop.\n\"Roma were under pressure to sell because their finances were not in a good place, so we knew he was available for a good price.\n\"He played a forward and wide role that we needed to fill at the time, whereas Brandt was more of an attacking midfielder.\"\nGraham added: \"It's to Jurgen's credit that he engaged in that debate in an honest way with his eyes open to say, 'OK, I'm open to be convinced, show me that Mo is better'.\"\nKlopp didn't need much convincing and Liverpool signed Salah from Roma in June 2017 for \u00a334m.\nThe Reds believed the Egypt international would be a \"future superstar\" and so it has proved.\nSalah, who is yet to agree a new contract with Liverpool beyond this summer, has gone on to become a Liverpool legend. \nHe has scored 243 goals and registered 109 assists for the club in 393 appearances and, under Klopp, helped the Reds win the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and Fifa Club World Cup.\nHow to Win the Champions League\nLiverpool\nGraham was a consultant at Tottenham from 2007-2012 but \"they never really had the ambition to make more\" of data whereas he said \"Liverpool were the first team to have an in-house analytics department\".\nHe was at Liverpool from 2012 to 2023 and was a key part of the 'Moneyball' strategy - the statistical method Major League \u00adBaseball side Oakland Athletics used in the 1990s to recruit players - that Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group (FSG) adopted at the club.\n\"Moneyball is really the concept of, 'can we get more value for money out of our squad? Can we get more performance per pound spent? Because, if we can, that means we can compete with clubs with a higher budget than us',\" said Graham.\n\"We started off with about seven or eight different leagues, by the time I left we were probably taking data from about 60 different leagues so that we really understood what players could do on the pitch.\"\nGraham worked under former Liverpool sporting director Michael Edwards, who left the club in 2022 before returning as FSG's chief executive of football in 2024.\nThe pair were part of a transfer committee who, along with Liverpool's manager, would \"come to a consensus decision on the best players to sign\".\nLiverpool had appointed Klopp as manager in October 2015 and his willingness to engage in the use of data in recruitment was in contrast to his predecessor Brendan Rodgers.\n\"Previously, we had robust debates with Brendan about which players to sign and the two differences were our ideas about which players would improve Liverpool were very different to Brendan's ideas,\" said Graham.\n\"Brendan, understandably, put a big premium on Premier League experience whereas we felt those players were quite often overvalued by the market and players from other markets, like Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino, were undervalued.\"\nGraham explained that Rodgers \"came in with a preconception that the player he wanted to sign was the only solution for that position\" and that \"it was very difficult to persuade him otherwise\".\nIn Klopp, Graham said they had found the \"missing piece\" and, in some cases, \"a manager who seemed to see what the data saw\".\nHe added: \"He [Jurgen] is very happy to thank us for our suggestions to have stopped some of the less sensible signings, which at the time caused big arguments but, in retrospect, he could see this was a good process for signing players.\"\nThis video can not be played\nHow Jurgen Klopp almost didn't sign Salah\nKlopp had managed at Mainz and Borussia Dortmund in Germany, winning the Bundesliga in 2011 and 2012 with the latter.\nHis first trophy at Liverpool was the 2019 Champions League, with data playing \"a big part in signing\" nine of the 11 Liverpool players who started the final against Tottenham - in a game the Reds won 2-0.\n\"The club needed it and, from our point of view, the data approach needed it as well,\" said Graham on that piece of silverware.\n\"Looking back, it is a source of pride and is some validation that data can be of help. It adds to recruitment.\n\"Our data analysis means nothing without the scouts to understand the traditional way of viewing a player, without Jurgen to get the best out of the players, without the ownership to trust in the process and without the sporting director to make decisions based on what the data is telling him.\n\"Jurgen's impact on the Champions League win, it can't really be overstated. His presence at the club attracted some really great players, he got the best out of those players and - by the time of that final - we had a world-class first XI that was quite different to the team that he inherited.\"\nKlopp went on to end the club's 30-year wait for a top-flight title by guiding them to the 2019-20 Premier League crown.\nGraham said: \"Jurgen, coming from the German system, was much more happy to take that compromised approach and it worked out really well for Liverpool.\"\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

The European Union has vowed a united response, and China has threatened countermeasures.\nRatings agencies like Fitch have warned that the mass tariff hikes could result in lower growth, higher inflation and potentially a recession in some parts of the world.\nHow will India - Asia's third largest economy - navigate these global tremors?\nTrump has dealt the most brutal blow to Asian countries, slapping 34% tariffs on China in addition to the 20% previously levied. Vietnam and Cambodia will have to pay 46% and 49% respectively.\nIn relative terms, at 27% India has fared better.\nBut the rate is still steep and will severely affect major \"labour intensive exports\", says Priyanka Kishore of the consultancy Asia Decoded. \"That will likely have a knock-on impact on domestic demand and headline gross domestic product at a time when growth is already stuttering,\" said Ms Kishore.\nBut the new trade realities also throw up opportunities for India.\nIts new tariff differential with Asian peers may potentially lead to some export re-routing. \"We can bring the footwear and garments business from Asian peers if we get our act together,\" says Nilesh Shah, a veteran fund manager.\nThis will take time though.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government will thus have to be strategic in how it navigates the situation.\nForemost, the announcement should \"give the government a greater sense of urgency in wrapping up a trade deal with the US\", says Rahul Ahluwalia, a public policy expert who previously worked for a government department. \"The US is our largest export market, so this is serious stuff.\" \nIndia exports some $91bn (\u00a369bn) in goods to the US, which account for 18% of its overall exports. Hectic trade negotiations have been under way with a fall deadline for conclusion. Ahluwalia says that deadline could now be compressed and brought forward.\nWhile doing that, India must also expand export markets beyond the US and focus on regions where tariffs remain low, such as Europe, Southeast Asia, and Africa,  recommends Indian trade research agency GTRI.\nIn the last couple of years, India has shown a renewed appetite for trade deals, launching free trade agreement (FTA) talks with a range of countries and blocs, including the European Union and the United Kingdom.\nLast year, Delhi signed a $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union.\nExperts say talks with other partners could now be expedited as cracks deepen between the US and many other global economies over Trump's actions.\nBut even as trade negotiations carry on with global partners, the government will need a plan on how it deals with the domestic fallout of Trump's decision.\nImpact on sectors that employ millions of people - like gems and jewellery and textiles - is likely to be significant. The government will need to extend support through means like expanding production-linked subsidies to ensure that India's domestic industry stays globally competitive and can leverage the new opportunities this has thrown up, according to the consultancy, Ernst & Young\nThe tariffs are \"fundamentally reshaping the global trading system\", says Agneshwar Sen, a trade policy expert at Ernst & Young India. This will require a \"fundamental revaluation of trading strategies\" as new supply chains emerge, he adds.\nIndia will also have to be mindful of other risk factors that emerge from this  - such as \"Chinese dumping\", says Mr Shah.\nAs it becomes more difficult for Chinese goods to enter the US, these will have to find other markets. And there are few others that are as large as India.\n\"The global South accounts for more than 20% of global consumption and is where the new middle class is being created. This is where China will attempt to sell,\" according to Akash Prakash of Amansa Capital, an investment management company in Singapore.\nFor the moment there's little clarity and no official word from the government on what its plans are.\nIndia has already reduced tariffs on some goods including high-end motorbikes and bourbon whiskey. Unlike Canada, Mexico or the European Union, Modi's government has adopted a conciliatory approach to Trump and these announcements are unlikely to trigger a retaliation, say experts.\nIndian businesses will now most likely face a period of uncertainty which is unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\"Clearly, the (Trump) administration wants even broader and deeper tariff cuts. The question is what, if anything, will satisfy the Trump administration?\", Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow at Carnegie Endowment told the BBC.\nIt is a million dollar question, for which there are no immediate answers.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

Meh.\nListen to the latest Fantasy 606 podcast on BBC Sounds.\nIf Kieran Trippier can reproduce his form of the past two seasons, he is a great differential defensive pick\nEmi Martinez, Aston Villa, keeper, \u00a35m - Nottingham Forest (h)\nThe Argentine kept just his fourth clean sheet of the season in Wednesday's win at Brighton but he is a differential keeper option for this week and the rest of the season.\nVilla face goal-shy Southampton next week before a double in 33.\nForest are not an easy opponent for Villa but they are definitely not as threatening without injured striker Chris Wood.\nVirgil van Dijk, Liverpool, \u00a36.5m - Fulham (a)\nLiverpool's defence is rolling at the moment, with three clean sheets in their past four including keeping Manchester City and Newcastle out.\nAnd Van Dijk has only scored once so far this season. He has not finished a season with just one goal since 2020-21, so the law of averages means he is due.\nDjed Spence, Spurs, \u00a34.4m - Southampton (h)\nWhile Tottenham's form is nose-diving again, they face a Saints side with just 22 goals in 30 games - the league's lowest total.\nSpence seems to be holding down that right-back spot and, if they do keep a clean sheet, has a great chance of bonus.\nIn Tottenham's recent back-to-back clean sheets, against Brentford and Manchester United, Spence earned the maximum three bonus points.\nKieran Trippier, Newcastle, \u00a35.6m - Leicester (a)\nAm I getting suckered in with memories of prime Trippier from the past two seasons, when he had nine and 10 assists? Possibly.\nIs picking a defender against Leicester each week the most obvious call? Yes.\nThat makes Trippier worth a punt in my opinion, even if he is nursing a potential groin issue.\nHe took three set-pieces, made three crosses and two key passes in Wednesday's win over Brentford, so you're getting a defender who is pretty involved in attacking play.\nDouble up on Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli?\nMohamed Salah (vice-captain), Liverpool, \u00a313.8m - Fulham (a)\nSalah has failed to score in two of his past three games and his expected goal involvement (xGI) of 0.17 against Everton on Wednesday was the Egyptian's lowest all season.\nBut this man has 44 goal involvements in 2024-25 so don't give up on him yet!\nThere could come a time - especially if you are chasing your rivals - where going without Salah makes sense in a few weeks, as Liverpool won't have a double gameweek this season.\nBut not yet.\nJacob Murphy, Newcastle, \u00a35m - Leicester (a)\nFPL players may be looking at Anthony Gordon as the best Newcastle midfield option, with a double gameweek next week for the Magpies.\nBut Murphy, at just \u00a35m, can easily match Gordon.\nHe has nine assists now this season and has started every game since week 14.

Racecards, live text, results & reports on the BBC Sport website and app.\nRunners, riders, trainers and form - all the key details you need to know for Saturday's big race at Aintree.\nNote: Colours and approximate odds may change.\n(Racecard number, horse, trainer, jockey, recent form, age, weight carried [ie 11st 12lb is top weight]. Form: F - Fell, P - Pulled up, U - Unseated rider.)\nVerdict: Lots with chances but Senior Chief could still be improving, while Hewick looks primed to run well.\n1 Senior Chief 2 Hewick 3 Stumptown 4 Iroko\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Paul Townend\nForm: 311-P8 Age: 9 Weight: 11-12\nConvincing victor last year, having won the Irish National 12 months earlier, and could well be in the shake-up again. Pinpointed two months ago by 20-time champion jockey AP McCoy - who advises the owner - as the pick of JP McManus' stellar squad. Would be the first horse carrying top weight to triumph since the legendary Red Rum in the 1970s.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Venetia Williams Jockey: Charlie Deutsch\nForm: F-1P66 Age: 11 Weight:11-9\nThrives in different conditions, at Haydock in the mud \u2013 scene of five of his seven career victories, including back-to-back runnings of the Betfair Chase. Past three runs have been disappointing. Owned by flamboyant former banker Rich Ricci, you might not get rich backing this one although trainer did triumph with 100-1 outsider Mon Mome in 2009.\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 125-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Patrick Mullins\nForm: 73-411 Age: 8 Weight: 11-8\nOwner Stewart Andrew clearly thinks he's a rocket - he eyed Cheltenham Gold Cup, but trainer preferred to go for the National. Would be an emotional winner as Andrew's wife Sadie died in December 2022, five days after watching Nick Rockett in his first race. A winner of the Thyestes Chase then Bobbyjo Chase, where Intense Raffles was runner-up, but that rival better off at the weights here. Jockey rides for trainer father.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Brian Hayes\nForm: 1-P625 Age: 9 Weight: 11-8\nWould be a poignant winner as the last horse bought for owners Cheveley Park Stud by joint boss David Thompson at the end of 2020, just 19 days before his death. Runner-up in Irish Gold Cup to Galopin Des Champs at 66-1 when finishing ahead of subsequent Cheltenham winners Fact To File and Inothewayurthinkin. Drying ground should suit.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: John Joseph Hanlon (IRE) Jockey: Gavin Sheehan\nForm: 232571 Age: 10 Weight: 11-7\nAn \u00a3800 bargain buy who has won big races including the King George VI Chase, Bet365 Gold Cup, Galway Plate and American Grand National. Trainer, nicknamed 'Shark', has taken horse into local pub to celebrate victories, and believes he could be sent off favourite. Well backed in lead-up to race, would be suited by dry spell with good going right up his street.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Henry de Bromhead (IRE) Jockey: Rachael Blackmore\nForm: 443-26 Age: 12 Weight: 11-3\nLooked a potential winner last year in closing stages before finishing third. Triumphed in 2021 Cheltenham Gold Cup for trainer, who won National a month later with stablemate Minella Times as Rachael Blackmore became first female jockey to win the race. Could easily be prominent again for her although would be some effort to become only third horse to complete Gold Cup-National double.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Sean O'Keeffe\nForm: 2-5351 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nShowed bundles of promise when winning the Supreme Novices' Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival four years ago but much of that has been unfulfilled. Won for the first time in two years last time out at Thurles. Not the most obvious victor in trainer's talented team and no guarantee at all that he will appreciate this marathon distance.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Jonathan Burke\nForm: 0-8P43 Age: 9 Weight: 11-2\nWhile powerful trainer has other hopefuls, including last year's winner, don't let this one go under the radar. Third under top weight to Intense Raffles in last year's Irish Grand National before winning Bet365 Gold Cup at Sandown. Breeding and form point to potential for big run. Minella horses take their name from a Tipperary family hotel run by racehorse trader John Nallen.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Jordan Gainford\nForm:  U58708 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nBoasts some decent form including Irish Gold Cup win, when Minella Indo was second, albeit that was three years ago. Has run well at this meeting before, including a good second to Jonbon over shorter distance last year. Trainer seeking fourth victory in race, but suspicion is age, weight and longer trip may be against this one.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Keith Donoghue\nForm: -U1111 Age: 11 Weight: 11-2\nSecured fourth straight victory of the season by winning Cross Country Chase at Cheltenham Festival in fine style last month. That is the same race Tiger Roll won before his 2018 and 2019 National triumphs. Stumptown's trainer went to town at Cheltenham by landing the Gold Cup with Inothewayurthinkin, who was then made hot favourite for this but skips the race.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 8-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Freddie Gingell\nForm: 83-222 Age: 9 Weight: 11-1\nPart-owned by former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, Hitman has been a bit hit and miss. Has a habit of coming second - finishing runner-up in 11 of his 26 races - and this distance is a real unknown. Talented 19-year-old jockey credits much of his success to his mother Kim who died in 2020 from cancer aged 43.\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 150-1\nTrainer: Nigel Twiston-Davies Jockey: Sam Twiston-Davies\nForm: 1P-132 Age: 9 Weight: 11-1\nJockey rides for trainer father, who has landed the race twice before. Winner of Midlands Grand National last year. Owner Bryan Burrough hoping for second success, 42 years after his colours were carried to victory by the Jenny Pitman-trained Corbiere. It's a tough ask but had a convincing victory over fences at Ascot earlier in season and stamina looks assured.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: James Reveley\nForm: 6-2383  Age: 10 Weight: 11-0\nForm has dipped since reaching top of his game two or three years ago. Won jump racing's festive showpiece, the King George VI Chase at Kempton, in 2022 and was second a year later. In between, finished runner-up in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Will take a brave man or woman to pick this one after an 11-race losing run. Stable jockey rides Kandoo Kid.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 50-1\nTrainer: Nicky Henderson Jockey: James Bowen\nForm: 9-5515  Age: 11 Weight: 10-13\nBit of an enigma. Was on a 10-race losing run when won well at Cheltenham on New Year's Day. Maybe he was just in the party mood. Green and gold colours of owner JP McManus look more likely to succeed elsewhere, although there is a breeding positive - Chantry House's sire Yeats was also dad to 2022 National winner Noble Yeats.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Harry Skelton\nForm: 210-32 Age: 10 Weight: 10-12\nNamed after owner Max McNeill's late father and ex-professional golfer Ted, who was three under par through five holes to lead The Open at Royal Portrush in 1951. Will the gelding be above or below par? Fourth in the Scottish National two years ago but well behind Minella Cocooner and Nick Rockett in last season's Bet365 Gold Cup.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Mark Walsh\nForm: 286411  Age: 8 Weight: 10-12\nAnother powerful weapon in the armoury of Cheltenham Gold Cup-winning trainer, who also has Stumptown and Vanillier. A beaten favourite for both the Galway Plate and Kerry National but form of his Leopardstown win in December reads well and now takes a big step up in trip. Named after a 1970s film about a 12th Century knight, could he put his rivals to the sword here?\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 12-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Harry Cobden\nForm: P23-18 Age: 9 Weight: 10-11\nDecent third in Topham Chase over National fences last year. Won Coral Gold Cup, formerly the Hennessy, at Newbury in November. Only one horse, Many Clouds, has gone on to also win the National, though trainer thinks he can do it. He won in 2012 with Neptune Collonges and says the grey Kandoo Kid is the \"ideal horse for the race\".\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 20-1\nTrainer: Oliver Greenall & Josh Guerriero Jockey: Jonjo O'Neill Jr\nForm: 2-2F42  Age: 7 Weight: 10-11\nA Cheltenham Festival winner in 2023. Second at Aintree meeting 12 months ago to subsequent Gold Cup winner Inowthewayurthinkin when nominated by owner JP McManus as his 'National horse for next year'. Joint-trainer Oliver Greenall's father Lord Daresbury is former racecourse chairman who has an Aintree stand named after him. Co-trainer Josh Guerriero won Foxhunters' Chase over National fences as amateur jockey in 2008.\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 9-1\nTrainer: Tom Gibney (IRE) Jockey: JJ Slevin\nForm: 11-902 Age: 7 Weight: 10-10\nSounds like a deadly serious lottery, and has a deadly serious chance. Winner of the Irish Grand National last year. Nearly all of his races have been on soft or heavy ground. The grey runs in the 'double green' colours of owner-breeders Simon Munir and Isaac Souede. Showed his wellbeing when second, despite carrying more weight, to Nick Rockett at Fairyhouse in February.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Henry de Bromhead (IRE) Jockey: Darragh O'Keeffe\nForm: 1P-169 Age: 9 Weight: 10-10\nPulled up in last year's Irish National but marked himself out as a candidate for this race when winning well at Cheltenham in October. Subsequently sixth in the Coral Gold Cup at Newbury when he was staying on, which could be a good sign for the test ahead. Owned by the Lucky In Life Syndicate. Will the horse live up to their name?\nRating: 8/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Richard Phillips Jockey: Harry Bannister\nForm: F03106 Age: 11 Weight: 10-10\nPreviously based in Ireland, where he won the Midlands National last summer at Kilbeggan. Having second run for amiable Gloucestershire trainer, who does a nice line in impressions. He helped buy the horse with John Rosbotham, a friend of 55 years with whom he dreamed in the school playground of having a National runner, and it runs for a syndicate of 12 called the Dozen Dreamers.\nRating: 4/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey:  Sam Ewing\nForm: 212433 Age: 7 Weight: 10-9\nFive of his six wins have come at roughly half the distance of this race. Looks an uphill task on the face of it, but interestingly mentioned as a potential surprise package by the trainer \u2013 who has won three times previously - when weights for the race were announced in February. Would probably benefit from soft ground.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Nigel Twiston-Davies Jockey: Tom Bellamy\nForm: 5-324P Age: 7 Weight: 10-9\nOwner David Proos hoping to go two better after his family silks were carried to third by Rinus in 1990. No forlorn hope based on his second to Kandoo Kid in Coral Gold Cup at Newbury. One for alliteration fans - could Broadway Boy follow Mon Mome, Party Politics and Red Rum as a nifty-sounding National winner for trainer, who has triumphed twice before?\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Jody McGarvey\nForm: U50029 Age: 10 Weight: 10-9\nEleventh in last year's race, when hampered late on, having previously finished eighth and pulled up. Prominent on each occasion before fading. Winner of the Troytown Chase in 2023. Will probably be spotted towards the front again but takes a leap of faith to see him stay there and become only the fourth grey horse to win the National.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Paul O'Brien\nForm: 3PP-P0 Age: 8 Weight: 10-9\nLooked to be heading for big things after winning Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham in 2023 but career over the bigger obstacles has not been straightforward and pulled up on three of his past four runs. Jockey called up for first ride in race after original bookings Bryony Frost (riding in France) then Johnny Burke (on Minella Cocooner instead) were unavailable\nRating: 5/10 Odds: 66-1\nTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Danny Mullins\nForm: 37-008 Age: 8 Weight: 10-7\n'Caught the eye' of last year's winning trainer when the weights were revealed in February. Finished seventh in 2024 when appeared to run out of steam. That could be perceived as a stamina doubt, although might see out the trip better now a year stronger and stable's Hedgehunter won in 2005 after a tired late fall the previous year.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Jonjo & AJ O'Neill Jockey: Nick Scholfield\nForm: 5P-241 Age: 9 Weight: 10-9\nIntriguing contender who finished fourth in the Welsh Grand National before ending a two-year losing run with victory at Uttoxeter. Finished third to subsequent National winner Corach Rambler at Cheltenham Festival two years ago. Formerly owned by Tory peer Michelle Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman before being sold last year to Martin Tedham, who sponsors the trainer's yard.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 33-1\nTrainer: Gavin Cromwell (IRE) Jockey: Sean Flanagan\nForm: -P6913 Age: 10 Weight: 10-6\nThis was my selection in 2023, when he ended up finishing second to Corach Rambler for shrewd trainer. Was 14th last year on softer ground but comfortable Punchestown win in February showcased his credentials. Jockey is qualified aircraft pilot although nearly took wrong route at Cheltenham last month before recovering to finish third in Cross Country Chase. Chance again if the satnav is working.\nRating: 7/10 Odds: 10-1\nTrainer: Michael Keady Jockey: Ciaran Gethings\nForm:  F22999  Age: 8 Weight: 10-6\nRunner-up in the Kerry and Munster Nationals when trained by Willie Mullins but switched stables last month. Now based in the Flat racing capital of Newmarket. Trainer set up on his own five months ago and is looking for first win over jumps in biggest steeplechase of all. Has to be a doubt over whether this contender possesses the same ability and stamina as some of his rivals.\nRating: 4/10 Odds: 100-1\nTrainer: Nicky Henderson Jockey: Nico de Boinville\nForm: 141122 Age: 8 Weight: 10-6\nNovice chaser looking to break duck for trainer, who is one of the greats but has poor record in this race \u2013 with no win from 43 previous runners. Sound jumper who should like the ground. Need an omen? One of the owners, Paul Humphreys, was born on same day as Grand National legend Red Rum. Their syndicate once included the late John Sillett, Coventry City's FA Cup-winning manager.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Philip Hobbs and Johnson White Jockey: Micheal Nolan\nForm: 45U4-1 Age: 13 Weight: 10-6\nThe obstacles should not be an issue, having finished eighth and fourth in the past two runnings of the shorter Topham Chase over the National fences. However, this is a longer and stiffer task. No 13-year-old horse has won the National since Sergeant Murphy 102 years ago and hard to see an equine teenager being celebrated this time around.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 150-1\nTrainer: Gordon Elliott (IRE) Jockey: Sean Bowen\nForm: -33713  Age: 10 Weight: 10-5\nThis race has been the long-term plan, says the trainer, who has been successful three times before. And he has been dealt a nice hand with the horse sneaking in towards the bottom of the weights. Rider is actually allergic to horses, but is on the verge of becoming British champion jockey and steps in for injured Jack Kennedy.\nRating: 6/10 Odds: 25-1\nTrainer: Ben Pauling Jockey:  Beau Morgan\nForm: 5-2P77 Age: 10 Weight: 10-5\nA family affair as 20-year-old jockey rides horse owned by his mother Georgia. The expected sunny conditions should suit as six of his seven wins have come on good ground.

Unlikely too that this grey will prove good enough to triumph despite low weight.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has announced fresh import taxes on goods being imported to America in the latest escalation of the global trade war.\nThe UK has been hit with a 10% tariff on nearly all of its goods being brought into the US, which Trump says is a retaliation to UK tariffs on American goods, but uncertainty remains over the potential impact on British consumers.\nHere's how you and your money could be affected.\nThe tariffs Trump has just announced will be paid for by the businesses which import goods into the US.\nClarissa Hahn, economist at Oxford Economics, says this means that the initial impact of price rises will be on US consumers, as American firms are likely to pass on the extra costs to their customers.\nHowever, she adds people in the UK could subsequently be affected by the measures, which come into effect on 5 April.\nOne way is via the value of the pound and exchange rates, which dictate the cost to  UK businesses importing goods and raw materials from abroad. If import costs go up, these extra costs could be passed on to consumers through higher prices.\nFollowing Trump's speech on Wednesday, exchange rates between the dollar and pound fluctuated. If the value of the dollar strengthens as some economists have predicted, import costs could rise for UK firms importing goods.\nHigher prices in the UK could also \"prompt workers to demand higher wages\", which would further raise costs for businesses, according to Ahmet Ihsan Kaya, principal economist, at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. \nMs Hahn adds if the UK government decides to retaliate with tariffs of its own on US goods entering the UK, there is a risk UK prices could rise if British businesses pass on extra costs to customers.\nHowever, some economists have suggested prices could also initially fall as a result of Trump's decision to impose tariffs.\nSwati Dhingra, economist and member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, has suggested that firms which normally send their goods to the US, may instead send them to countries such as the UK which don't have such steep tariffs, potentially leading to a flood of cheaper goods in the UK.\n\"Tariffs of the proposed magnitude are likely to prompt firms that export to the US to lower their prices to retain demand for their products,\" she suggests.\nBritish companies exporting goods to the US are set to be the hardest hit from the latest measures.\nThe UK exported almost \u00a360bn worth of goods to the US last year, mainly machinery, cars and pharmaceuticals. Other industries, which are big exporters to the US, include fishing and electronics.\nIf US demand for UK products dwindles due to the extra charges importers face, this could hit profit margins and ultimately lead to UK job cuts unless British firms find new customers outside the US.\nAccording to the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank, Jaguar Land Rover and the Mini factory in Cowley, Oxford, appear to be the most exposed to US tariffs on cars.\nIt says more than 25,000 jobs in the UK car manufacturing industry \"could be at risk\" with a 25% tariff coming into effect on Thursday, with one in eight UK-built cars exported to the US.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is also heavily reliant on trade with the US, says Ms Hahn, of Oxford Economics. \nThe US makes up 40% of AstraZeneca's sales and 50% of GSK's. Although both British-headquartered firms have manufacturing facilities in America, raw ingredients for life-saving medicines and vaccines travel between the UK, EU and US. Under tariffs the firms could be hit with multiple tax charges as they cross borders to be developed.\nThere is also the issue of how tariffs work when they collide with pricing caps that both the NHS and other health organisations set for buying drugs in bulk.\nUK interest rates dictate the costs households have to pay to borrow money for things such as mortgages, credit cards and loans. Higher rates also boost returns for savers.\nThey are currently at 4.5%, but economists are predicting two more rate cuts by the end of the year.\nHowever, the Bank of England highlighted US tariffs as a reason why it avoided cutting rates further last month, saying economic and global trade uncertainty had \"intensified\". \nIf prices are pushed up for long enough to affect the rate of inflation - this could mean interest rates stay higher for longer.\nAndrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, said it was Bank's job \"to make sure that inflation stays low and stable\" and that would be \"looking very closely\" at the impact of tariffs.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has announced and imposed a range of tariffs - or import taxes - on billions of dollars worth of goods coming into the US.\nOn Wednesday, Trump declared a national economic emergency and announced tariffs on goods from every country of at least 10%. For countries he has deemed the \"worst offenders\", the rates can go as high as 50%. The 10% tariffs will take effect on 5 April, and the higher ones on 9 April.\nCanada and Mexico are currently exempted from these charges - but they, along with China, were already facing tariffs on some products. And the Trump administration has now expanded existing steel and aluminium tariffs to include beer and empty cans, which could hit both countries hard. \nOn top of that, on Thursday, 25% tariffs on automobiles coming into the US will come into effect. Tariffs on certain car parts are set to start in May or later.\nEconomists have warned these levies - and those introduced in response by other countries - could push prices up for American consumers. \nThat's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, which may choose to pass the cost on to customers, or to reduce imports, meaning fewer products are available.\nSo which things could become more expensive?\nThe US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade.\nMost analysts estimate that the auto tariffs will add thousands of dollars to the prices of new cars in the US, which reached a record average of $49,738 in December, according to Cox Automotive. As competition for used cars increases, so could the prices paid for them.\nEven for cars made in the US, prices will probably rise.\nMany US car companies also have operations in Mexico and Canada, set up under the terms of the longstanding free trade agreement between them.\nComponent parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.\nThe new tariffs on car parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt for now while US customs and border patrol set up a system to assess the duties.\nAnderson Economic Group has estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by roughly $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle.\nExperts say these costs are likely to be passed on to customers, though Trump himself has said he \"couldn't care less\" if that happens as he believes it will encourage Americans to buy American-made cars instead.\nPopular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.\nModelo, and many foreign-made beers, will also be affected by the expanded aluminium tariff which will include canned beers starting on 4 April. Most of the beverage in the US - 64.1% - is poured out of cans, according to the Beer Institute.\nMeanwhile, representatives from the American, Canadian, and Mexican spirit industries argued in a joint statement that drinks like bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila, and Canadian whisky \"can only be produced in their designated countries\".\nSo, given they have to be made in those locations, supplies might be affected, leading to price rises.\nTrump has also threatened a 200% tariff on alcohol from the EU, which could make Spanish wine, French champagne, or German beer more expensive for Americans, though it is not clear if this will be carried out.\nThe US imports about a third of its softwood lumber from Canada each year, and that key building material could be hit by Trump's tariffs. \nTrump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".\nHowever, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.\n\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.\nImports from the rest of the world could also be affected. \nOn 1 March, Trump ordered an investigation into whether the US should place additional tariffs on most lumber and timber imports, regardless of their country of origin, or create incentives to boost domestic production. \nFindings are due towards the end of 2025.\nCanada's billion-dollar maple syrup industry accounts for 75% of global production.\nThe majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.\n\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" said Thomas Sampson from the London School of Economics.\n\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but [which use] inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.\nCanada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil. \nAccording to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November 2024 came from Canada.\nWhile the US has introduced a 25% tariff on most goods imported from Canada, Canadian energy faces a lower rate of 10%. \nThe US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but its refineries are designed to process so-called \"heavier\" - or thicker - crude oil, which mostly comes from Canada, with some from Mexico.\n\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.\nThat means if Canada decided to reduce crude oil exports in retaliation against US tariffs, it could push up fuel prices. \nAvocados thrive in the Mexican climate. \nNearly 90% of the avocados consumed in the US come from Mexico.\nThe US Agriculture Department has warned that tariffs on Mexican fruit and vegetables could increase the cost of avocados.\nRelated dishes like guacamole could also become more expensive. \nAdditional reporting by Lucy Acheson",

        "summary": "As competition for used cars increases, so could the prices paid for them.Even for cars made in the US, prices will probably rise.Many US car companies also have operations in Mexico and Canada, set up under the terms of the longstanding free trade agreement between them.Component parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.The new tariffs on car parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt for now while US customs and border patrol set up a system to assess the duties.Anderson Economic Group has estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by roughly $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle.Experts say these costs are likely to be passed on to customers, though Trump himself has said he \"couldn't care less\" if that happens as he believes it will encourage Americans to buy American-made cars instead.What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?Beer, whisky and tequila Getty ImagesPopular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.Modelo, and many foreign-made beers, will also be affected by the expanded aluminium tariff which will include canned beers starting on 4 April. Nearly 90% of the avocados consumed in the US come from Mexico.The US Agriculture Department has warned that tariffs on Mexican fruit and vegetables could increase the cost of avocados.Related dishes like guacamole could also become more expensive. Most of the beverage in the US - 64.1% - is poured out of cans, according to the Beer Institute.Meanwhile, representatives from the American, Canadian, and Mexican spirit industries argued in a joint statement that drinks like bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila, and Canadian whisky \"can only be produced in their designated countries\".So, given they have to be made in those locations, supplies might be affected, leading to price rises.Trump has also threatened a 200% tariff on alcohol from the EU, which could make Spanish wine, French champagne, or German beer more expensive for Americans, though it is not clear if this will be carried out.HousesThe US imports about a third of its softwood lumber from Canada each year, and that key building material could be hit by Trump's tariffs. \"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but [which use] inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.Fuel prices Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil. Trump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".However, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.",

I will just keep doing what I am doing and hopefully get opportunities.\"\nMcKinney's height is now seen as an advantage, giving him the ability to attack lengths others would have to leave or defend, but it was not always this way.\nA talented footballer, he played for both Durham and Sunderland's academy as a teenager, having joined the Black Cats' ranks aged \"six or seven\".\n\"I was a centre-mid but I was getting a bit too tall for it,\" he says. \"I probably would have been a centre-back by now.\n\"I was always OK but didn't really enjoy it.\"\nMcKinney committed to cricket at the age of 16 \u2013 given confidence by Durham's production line which has overseen the development of Ben Stokes, Mark Wood, Paul Collingwood and Steve Harmison among others.\n\"I remember a phone call my dad had with [Durham's academy manager] John Windows,\" McKinney says.\n\"It went something like 'we have never let a lad fail from where he is now'.\n\"That was a massive confidence boost when you are 15 or 16 years old. That tipped me over the edge. My love was always cricket.\"\nThat love was first formed at Seaham Harbour Cricket Club, where his father Neil was one of the area's leading club cricketers. McKinney Sr also spent hours throwing to his son in the nets.\n\"He was relentless and wouldn't let me leave,\" McKinney says.\n\"Sometimes that might be bad but it definitely set me up for the future. It is amazing to have someone who cares for your success and you improving.\"\nDespite the promise, there has been no contact between McKinney and the England set-up, other than what he has been able to glean from having England skipper Stokes alongside him in the Durham dressing room.\n\"How he practises is something I have never seen before,\" McKinney says. \"He is so particular and there is always purpose.\"\nThe opportunities given to McKinney are no coincidence, however.\nHe was picked to open when warm-up opposition were provided to West Indies and Sri Lanka last summer and returned scores of 22, 46 and 20.\nHe also toured Australia with England Under-19s in 2023 - another relevant point with an Ashes series to come this winter - and hit 12 fours in a 45-ball 70 in England's victory in Brisbane, hinting at a keenness to follow the Bazball mantra from the start.\n\"It's actually the opposite,\" he says. \"My dad is very old fashioned. I used to bat 50 overs for 80. \n\"I used to love batting for time but somehow that flicked a switch, probably at a good time.\n\"There was a period I was probably going too hard but trying to find that balance of soaking up pressure and putting it back on has been the most important thing for my success this winter.\"\nThose words will be likely be a soothing symphony in the ears of England fans.\nTheir faith in England's approach is wobbling at the worst possible time with only a Test against Zimbabwe from 22 May to come before five against both India and Australia over the seven months that follow.\n\"I would love to play all formats but I go back to being 10 years old and watching Alastair Cook opening the batting,\" McKinney says.\n\"I loved the way he did it. It's not the road I have gone down now but the basics behind it, I will be happy keeping him as my role model.\"\nThere are no vacancies in England's top seven but Zak Crawley's poor form, Jacob Bethell's Indian Premier League commitments and the chance for injuries means nothing can be ruled out at this stage.\nMcKinney will get six County Championship matches to push his case further before Zimbabwe arrive, starting with a trip to Nottinghamshire on Friday.",

        "article_text": "The US has been unable to meaningfully respond to the Myanmar earthquake due to the Trump administration's decision to slash foreign aid, according to three former senior US officials.\nOne former US Agency for International Development (USAID) mission director for Myanmar told the BBC that \"America has been on the sidelines\" after the disaster.\n\"The US basically was not there for the rescue-window period,\" said another official. All three suggested the deep cuts to aid probably cost lives.\nA 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck on Friday, leaving at least 2,700 people dead, more than 4,500 injured and hundreds still missing, according to the country's military. Those figures are expected to rise.\nThe former USAID officials said the agency mobilised Disaster Assistance Response Teams (Darts) from the US after previous major earthquakes. Comprised of highly trained rescuers, sniffer dogs and specialist equipment, the teams are immediately made ready then dispatched when the affected country requests them.\nA typical deployment, like that sent to the Turkey-Syria earthquake in 2023, could comprise some 200 people - the majority of them rescue workers. US teams are often the biggest of all foreign assistance groups on the ground.\nThe US Department of State said on Monday a US team based in the region was on its way to Myanmar. It is believed to comprise three people who are advisers, not rescuers. \nThe state department also said it was donating $2m (\u00a31.6m) to humanitarian assistance organisations to support earthquake-affected communities. This figure is significantly smaller than previous US government donations during disasters, according to the former officials.\nPresident Donald Trump's adviser Elon Musk is finalising the shutdown of USAID after weeks spent dismantling the agency and placing staff on administrative leave. Trump targeted foreign assistance on his first day in office, calling it an \"industry\" that was in many cases \"antithetical to American values\".\nOn Friday, after the earthquake struck, the White House attempted to mobilise a Dart team, according to Andrew Natsios, who served as USAID administrator in George W Bush's administration. But, he said, it couldn't because key officials were on administrative leave.\n\"The problem is they fired most of the 500 people that make up the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance, so obviously there are no people [from the bureau] to be on the Dart team to be sent - and the people have to be trained and be familiar with disaster relief operations,\" he said.\nStaff at the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance received letters of termination the day the earthquake struck, said Chris Milligan, who served as USAID Mission Director in Myanmar from 2012 to 2016.\n\"The employees\u2026 were told to go home by one o'clock. Everyone was told. All employees in that building were told to go home at one o'clock, and then they were told later to come back,\" said Mr Milligan.\n\"It shows the lack of management and the confusion that there was an earthquake earlier, and they didn't have the foresight to say 'Okay, let's retain these people'.\"\nTwo of the former USAID officials said the administration couldn't deploy US search and rescue teams, sniffer dogs and specialist equipment to Myanmar because logistics contracts to transport them from Virginia and California had been cancelled as part of the cuts, led by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).\n\"It is the first time that I can think of that the US has simply not responded meaningfully to a major disaster,\" said Jeremy Konyndyk, who ran the USAID Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) from 2013 to 2016.\nHe said for the last few decades, with every disaster on this scale, the US would be the largest and most capable team on the ground.\n\"You've got 75 to 100 people, the dogs and it's a pretty substantial lift [which] you've got to get there, operating and excavating piles, within the first really four days.\"\n\"The US basically was not there for the rescue window, period. And it's too late,\" said Mr Konyndyk.\nIt's unlikely the agency could reactivate logistics contracts in time for a Dart team to Myanmar in time to save lives, he said. \"If you wanted to issue new ones, the people who could issue new contracts and do the tenders for that, they've all been fired,\" explained Mr Konyndak.\nThe US state department rejects the notion that the cuts have impacted disaster relief in Myanmar.\nThe department had partners it worked with \"that may not require us to be physically present\", spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said on Monday.\n\"With the reform that the government is going through with the lead of President Trump\u2026 certain things won't necessarily look the same.  But the success in the work and our impact will still be there,\" she said.\nHowever, Mr Konyndyk described the claim as \"fantasy land\".\n\"You can't pull people out of a building virtually, you can't excavate, you can't do live rescues from a collapsed building without boots on the ground,\" he said.\nChris Milligan, the former USAID mission director for Myanmar, said the rescue capacity available in the United States would double the capacity already on the ground in Myanmar.\n\"This is the new normal. This is what it looks like when the United States sits on the international sidelines, when the United States is a weaker international player, when it cedes the space to other global players like China,\" said Mr Milligan.\nThe state department told the BBC it did not intend to deploy a Dart team to Myanmar, adding it was continuing many existing lifesaving programs and strategic investments that \"strengthen our partners and our own country\".\nA state department spokesperson said: \"USAID has contracts in place with Urban Search and Rescue Teams to assist in responding to disasters.\"\n\"[A] USAID team of humanitarian experts based in the region are traveling to Burma to assess additional needs,\" the spokesperson continued.\n\"A Dart is essentially a coordination mechanism.

Live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app\nMax Verstappen says it \"was not a mistake\" that he liked a comment on social media describing Red Bull's decision to demote Liam Lawson as \"a panic move\" and \"close to bullying\".\nThe remarks were made by Dutch former Formula 1 driver Giedo van der Garde, a friend of the Verstappen family, on Instagram, external after Red Bull moved New Zealander Lawson down to their second team Racing Bulls in a swap with Japan's Yuki Tsunoda just two races into the season.\nRed Bull's Verstappen said: \"I liked the comment, the text, so I guess that speaks for itself, right?\"\nThe four-time champion refused to expand in public on his feelings about the decision, but added: \"Everything has been shared with the team, how I think about everything.\n\"Sometimes it's not necessary, you know, to always share and say everything in public. I think it's better [not to].\"\nFellow F1 drivers Oscar Piastri, Pierre Gasly - himself the victim of a mid-season driver swap by Red Bull - and Nico Hulkenberg also liked the post.\nRed Bull's decision to drop Lawson was a U-turn after they preferred him over Tsunoda last winter when they paid off Sergio Perez two years before the end of his contract.\nThat was despite Lawson having raced in only 11 grands prix over two seasons compared with Tsunoda's four years of experience.\nFerrari driver Lewis Hamilton described the dropping of Lawson as \"pretty harsh\".\nVerstappen said Red Bull had to \"take a good look at ourselves and just keep on working and keep on improving the car\".\nHamilton has 'absolute 100% faith' in Ferrari\nWhat's it like being a replacement F1 driver?\nTsunoda told to be 'as close to Verstappen as possible'\nLawson struggled to come to terms with the wayward handling of the Red Bull car.\nHe qualified 18th for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, and last for both the sprint and main grand prix in China, and failed to make significant progress in any of the races.\nRed Bull demoted him because they felt he was in a spiral from which he could not recover.\nVerstappen explained the characteristics that had led Lawson to struggle.\n\"It's hard because, I mean, for me, this is the only car that I know, right?\" Verstappen said. \n\"But I think from what I see out there, it is a little bit more nervous, a little bit more, I would say, unstable in different corner phases, maybe. Well, maybe [than] some other of my team-mates have been used to before.\n\"Some bits, of course, are clearly faster than where they came from, but to just piece it all together probably is a bit harder.\"\nThis video can not be played\nHorner won't ask me to swap if leading Verstappen - Tsunoda\nTsunoda said he was in the \"best situation ever\" to be making his debut for Red Bull at this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix.\n\"Really looking forward to it,\" he said. \"Can't be crazier than this - first race for Red Bull Racing, but on top of it, home grand prix.\"\nAsked about Red Bull's ruthless handling of Lawson, Tsunoda said: \"For me at least it was brutal enough when they chose Liam over me at the end of last season.\n\"We understand, I'm sure Liam understands, how situations can quickly change within our structure.\"\nTsunoda said he had driven the Red Bull in the simulator and was confident he could make a strong impression.\n\"I felt the car in simulator,\" he said. \"I am sure it doesn't fully correlate but it didn't feel crazy tricky.\"\nTsunoda said he had \"big confidence\" that he could do a good job.\nHe added: \"I am not saying I have confidence to perform straight away like Max, but I have confidence I can do something different from other drivers who have been in that car. \n\"If I did not have confidence, I might as well stay in Racing Bulls. But I want to have a challenge.\"\nThis video can not be played\nSwapped seats & shaky starts: What to know ahead of Japanese Grand Prix\nLawson, meanwhile, said the news he had been relegated was \"tough to hear\" but he is determined to \"prove that I belong here in Formula 1\" now he is back with his former team.\nLawson said that after receiving the call from Red Bull team principal Christian Horner saying he had been demoted he \"had one or two days to think about it\" but since then had been full into preparations with Racing Bulls.\n\"For me the main thing is being in a car,\" he said. \"I want to prove I belong here. In terms of where my future is, I don't know, and the only way I can control that is by driving fast.\"\nLawson suffered from a number of car issues during pre-season testing and in the first race of the season that denied him track time.\nHe said: \"In F1, we have issues, it is part of it. I had maybe hoped that would be taken into consideration more. \n\"That's why it was important to me to come to a track I knew. But it's motorsport and the decision was not mine but I will make the most of this one.\"\nAnd he insisted he felt it was not a mistake to give him the Red Bull drive in the first place.\n\"It doesn't change how I view it,\" he said. \"I felt I was ready.

Live text updates on the BBC Sport website and appMax Verstappen says it \"was not a mistake\" that he liked a comment on social media describing Red Bull's decision to demote Liam Lawson as \"a panic move\" and \"close to bullying\".The remarks were made by Dutch former Formula 1 driver Giedo van der Garde, a friend of the Verstappen family, on Instagram, external after Red Bull moved New Zealander Lawson down to their second team Racing Bulls in a swap with Japan's Yuki Tsunoda just two races into the season.Red Bull's Verstappen said: \"I liked the comment, the text, so I guess that speaks for itself, right?

        "article_text": "Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs - or import taxes - for nearly every country in the world could push prices up on almost all the staples Americans routinely buy, from clothes to coffee.\nAfter declaring a national economic emergency on Wednesday, the US president announced new tariffs on billions of dollars of goods of at least 10%. For countries he has deemed the \"worst offenders\", the rates can go as high as 50%. They start taking effect on 5 April.\nEconomists have warned the new levies - and those that other countries impose in retaliation - could push prices up for Americans across the board, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has said that they will increase inflation.\nThat's because the companies importing the goods may pass the costs of the tariffs on to customers or simply bring fewer products into the country, creating a limited supply.\nHere are six everyday items that could become more expensive for American consumers.\nThe \"worst offenders\" about to be hit with the highest tariffs include the clothing manufacturing hubs of Vietnam, China and Bangladesh. The three - among the top five largest apparel importers to the US - could soon see levies ranging from 34% to 46% charged on their products.\nThat means major US department stores like Target and Walmart, where Americans often turn for affordable clothing, and some familiar apparel brands may feel the pressure.\nThe Gap, an American clothing retailer that also operates Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta, sources about 21% of its clothing from Vietnam, according to an analysis by Prof Sheng Lu at the University of Delaware's Fashion & Apparel Studies department. Another 37% of its clothing comes from India, Indonesia and Bangladesh.\nH&M, known for its inexpensive fashions, manufactures most of its clothing in China and Bangladesh.\nThe tariffs could bring an \"unfair burden to American families, particularly lower-income households\", warned the US Fashion Industry Association in a statement on Wednesday.\nVietnam is open to working out a deal with the administration to avoid the tariffs, Trump has said. China, on the other hand, has retaliated with its own steep levies.\nAlmost all of the coffee consumed in the US comes from outside the country, meaning it could soon become a bigger burden on Americans' wallets.\nThe US mostly sources its coffee from Brazil and Colombia, which are subject to the baseline 10% tariffs. Vietnam is also a key exporter of certain varieties.\nWalter Haas, owner of San Francisco-based coffee roastery Graffeo, told the Washington Post that once tariffs hit, his company will feel it \"immediately\". \nIf they remain in place, those cost increases will be \"permanently baked into the price consumers pay\", he added.\nOther imported foods could similarly rise in price, especially those coming from European Union nations, who will all be hit by a 20% tariff. Prices of shelf staples such as olive oil, which is primarily imported from Italy, Spain and Greece, could rise further.\nShoes and trainers, among the most basic necessities and also one of Americans' biggest splurges, could become more expensive, including the popular Nike Air Force 1 and Adidas Samba trainers. Both sportswear companies rely heavily on Asian factory hubs for their inventories.\nAbout half of Nike and 39% of Adidas trainers are made in Vietnam.\nIn 2024, the US imported more than $27bn of footwear, mostly from China and Vietnam, which was subject to tariffs of about $3bn, according to data by Prof Lu. \nNow, that tax amount could nearly triple.\nUBS analysts told Reuters that, all in all, retailers may not be able to fully swallow the costs, and would need to raise prices by 10% to 12% to offset the levies on Vietnamese manufacturers.\nFrance is one of the biggest foreign suppliers of wine to the US, and its winemakers have expressed anxiety about what the 20% EU tariffs will mean for their business.\nThe Bourgogne Wine Board, which represents producers in the French region of Burgundy, said the US tariffs would deliver \"a serious blow\" to both exporters and American consumers.\n\"The risk with these additional tariffs is that they could push our wines past a psychological price threshold,\" warned Laurent Delaunay, president of the Bourgogne Wine Board - meaning above what buyers feel comfortable paying.\nPrice increases could be seen at restaurants, especially for imported beers or drinks using foreign spirits. Separately, Trump expanded an aluminium tariff to include all canned beer, which could also make it more expensive for those who stay home.\nUBS analysts told Reuters that large alcohol sellers would have to hike prices up to 5% to cover the tariffs if they choose not to absorb the costs themselves.\nCell phones, TVs and video game consoles tend to be big-ticket purchases, and the latest US tariffs could make them even bigger.\nChina, as well as Taiwan and South Korea, are all top exporters of electronics to the US.\nAlmost all iPhones are made in China, although some are also made in India (which, too, is on the \"worst offenders\" list with a 26% tariff). Samsung, meanwhile, has significant production operations in Vietnam.\nIt's still unclear how these major tech companies will respond to the new levies. But Japanese video gaming company Nintendo announced on Friday that it is delaying pre-orders of its Switch 2 console, saying it needs to \"assess the potential impact of tariffs.\"\nAmericans may soon find that loading up fast-fashion hauls from Chinese online retailers like Temu or Shein with a few swipes on their phones has gotten more expensive.\nAlong with imposing the country-level tariffs, Trump has signed an executive order ending an exemption that prevented charging the levies on small-dollar shipments from China. \nThe exemption is referred to as the \"de minimis\" loophole, and it had allowed shipments under $800 (\u00a3620) to enter the US duty-free. Experts say it was a big reason why Temu and Shein were able to keep their costs low.\nThe order means those companies may have to pay taxes for the first time on the clothes they often send directly to customers.\nIt is unclear just how much costs for these goods could rise with the elimination of the loophole, but the White House says small shipments sent to the US through the international postal network could be subject to a tax of \"either 30% of their value, or $25 per item.\"\nThat tax would then increase to $50 per item after 1 June, according to the White House.",

        "article_text": "Deadly Israeli air strikes have been reported in Gaza, as Israel's defence minister said its military would expand its offensive and seize large areas of the Palestinian territory - incorporating them into what he described as \"security zones\".\nIsrael Katz said the expanded operation aimed to \"destroy and clear the area of terrorists and terrorist infrastructure\", and would require a large-scale evacuation of Palestinians.\nLater, at least 19 Palestinians, including nine children, were killed in a strike on a UN clinic sheltering displaced families in the northern town of Jabalia, the nearby Indonesian hospital said.\nThe Israeli military said it targeted \"Hamas terrorists\" hiding there.\nOvernight strikes across Gaza killed at least 20 more people, according to local hospitals.\nThe Civil Defence said its first responders recovered the bodies of 12 people, including children and women, from a home in the southern Khan Younis area.\nRida al-Jabbour said a neighbour and her three-month-old baby were among the dead.\n\"From the moment the strike occurred we have not been able to sit or sleep or anything,\" she told Reuters news agency.\nThe Israeli military said it was looking into the reports.\nThe Civil Defence said the strike in Jabalia later on Wednesday hit two rooms in a clinic run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) which was being used as a shelter.\nVideo verified by the BBC showed dozens of people and ambulances rushing to the building.

        "article_text": "Being Maria, a new film starring Matt Dillon and Anamaria Vartolomei, explores the life of Maria Schneider and the making of one of the most notorious films in cinema history.\nIt may be the most infamous scene in the entire history of cinema. The sexually explicit drama Last Tango in Paris, made by Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci and released in 1972, is the story of an affair between a middle-aged man, Paul, and a young woman, Jeanne, in a Paris apartment. The notorious \"butter scene\" was not in the original script and elements of it were made without 19-year-old actress Maria Schneider's prior consent.\nWarning: This article contains themes of sexual assault that some may find upsetting.\u00a0\nSchneider struggled with drug addiction and her mental health for years after the film's release, but her story, and the making of Last Tango in Paris, is now being told through the film Being Maria. It stars Matt Dillon as Marlon Brando, who played Paul, and Anamaria Vartolomei as Schneider. The film's French director Jessica Palud adapted the story from a 2018 memoir by journalist Vanessa Schneider, Maria's cousin.\n\"I think we have to look at the context of the time of Last Tango in Paris, it's now fifty years since the film was made,\" Matt Dillon tells the BBC. \"That time was a different time, but it's very important to look at it now from a different perspective.\n\"It was really a traumatic experience for her. And not just at the time it happened, but as it continued to follow her and haunt her wherever she went in her life, in so many ways.\"\nBeing Maria explores Schneider's background: she was the product of an affair between a famous French actor, Daniel G\u00e9lin, and a Romanian model. She first met her father as a teenager, and he introduced her to film sets. Last Tango in Paris was her first leading role, and she would later recall in a 2007 interview, then in her fifties, that she was persuaded to take the part instead of starring in a film with French film star Alain Delon, and, at the age of 19, \"didn't understand all of the film's sexual content\". She \"had a bad feeling about it all\", she said, but was told by her agency she couldn't possibly turn down working with Marlon Brando, one of the greatest stars of 20th-Century cinema.\nShe remembered what happened on the day of filming that scene, in which her character is raped by Brando's, using butter as a lubricant. \"That scene wasn't in the original script. The truth is it was Marlon who came up with the idea. They only told me about it before we had to film the scene and I was so angry\u2026 I felt humiliated and to be honest, I felt a little raped, both by Marlon and by Bertolucci. After the scene, Marlon didn't console me or apologise,\" she said. \"Marlon said to me: 'Maria, don't worry, it's just a movie,' but during the scene, even though what Marlon was doing wasn't real, I was crying real tears.\n\"Thankfully, there was just one take.\"\nBertolucci would later talk about why he withheld details of the scene from Schneider, saying: \"I wanted her reaction as a girl, not as an actress. I wanted her to react humiliated.\" He insisted that it was only the use of the butter that had surprised the actress, but Matt Dillon says what happened was \"really wrong\".\n\"It's something that we often do, actors, we won't tell the other actor, or the director will encourage us to not reveal what we're going to do, so we can get a real reaction,\" he says. \"But it was really wrong, with a scene that was so sensitive, to do something like that.\"\u00a0\nJessica Palud tells the BBC that recreating the rape scene \"couldn't be avoided\" in Being Maria, but this time, the audience sees events from Maria Schneider's perspective. \"I couldn't avoid shooting this scene because it was the very moment in which her life completely switches. Everything goes wrong from there,\" Palud says. \"It was important to have the scene from her point of view, in her body, in her gaze, what she went through, and the fact that there were witnesses. Maria was being assaulted in the presence of the whole crew, who were observing and not reacting.\"\nThis time the scene was prepared using an intimacy co-ordinator, which 61-year-old Dillon says was his first time working with one. \"I said to the intimacy co-ordinator, 'do you know what the scene is about?'\" he recalls. \"They said yes, and I said, 'Because you can probably trace back the role of an intimacy co-ordinator to that moment, in that film.'\"\u00a0\nThe use of an intimacy co-ordinator, who acts as a choreographer and a liaison between actors and production during simulated sex and nude scenes, is increasingly standard in the industry since the #MeToo movement. It now makes headlines when they're declined, including by Mikey Madison in Oscar winner Anora, or when Gwyneth Paltrow revealed that she told one to \"step a little bit back\" during her sex scenes with Timoth\u00e9e\u00a0Chalamet in Marty Supreme.\n\"I don't think it's a bad thing, I think it can evolve into being something good,\" Dillon says of using intimacy co-ordinators. \"It seems they're there to prevent people from crossing boundaries, but in fact it's creating boundaries that give opportunities for different ways of approaching these scenes. I hope that's how it evolves rather than people feeling like 'they're here to tell us what we can and can't do.' And Anamaria and I were very comfortable.\"\nAnamaria Vartolomei (who also made Golden Lion winner Happening, featuring scenes of illegal abortion) says that although she felt \"safe, protected and guided\" shooting the rape scene on the Being Maria shoot, she still became upset. \"This scene was really violent,\" she tells the BBC. \"I couldn't imagine what it was for Maria as she felt it for real. I'm just playing her. But this thing really happened to her, and she had no one around her. She just had people looking at her without doing anything. I think the violence of it was double because she didn't have the support I had on set, but I still felt it was really hard.\u00a0\n\"I was so emotional that day. I couldn't stop crying because I feel I accumulated the violence of the scene when I saw it on screen. When I had to play it, all my tears came out. I think it's very brutal. And it's insane to think that somebody could do this.\"\u00a0\nMaria Schneider was not only professionally unsupported on set, but she also lacked the experience to know that Bertolucci couldn't make her to do the scene. \"I should have called my agent or had my lawyer come to the set because you can't force someone to do something that isn't in the script, but at the time, I didn't know that,\" she would say later.\u00a0\nBut it was also the sensation the film Last Tango in Paris caused when it was shown from October 1972 that would undo Schneider. Despite (or helped by) it being banned or restricted in some countries; it made around $36m in the US alone. In France, it was reported audiences were queueing round the block for two hours or more to get a ticket.\nThe disparity between Bertolucci, Brando and Schneider became clear: critical reaction to the film aided Bertolucci's reputation as an international auteur, and both he and Brando were nominated for Oscars for the film. Brando, now doubly legendary for making Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather during the same period, is reported to have made around $3m out of Last Tango, as he took a share of the profits; Schneider recalled she was paid around $4,000. She appeared in full-frontal nudity; Brando never appeared naked in the film.\nThe young woman found the overnight fame increasingly hard to deal with. She told interviewers when the film came out that she had slept with 50 men and 20 women and \"had tried heroin\", because, she later explained, that although this was untrue, she was seen [as] \"that sexy bimbo\". Her erratic behaviour, she said, was down to being afraid. \"To be suddenly famous all over the world was frightening,\" she said. \"I didn't have bodyguards like they do today. People thought I was just like my character, and I would make up stories for the press, but that wasn't me\u2026 It made me go mad. I got into drugs\u2026 it was like an escape from reality. It was the 70s and at that time, it was all going on.\"\nHer cousin, Vanessa Schneider, has said of her that she was also a victim of the double standards of the time: \"For puritanical viewers, she was an easy woman who made pornography. It was brutal for her, especially since it wasn't at all in her nature \u2013 she was pretty modest, reserved and fairly conservative in certain respects.\"\n\"People thought I was like the girl in the movie, but that wasn't me,\" Maria Schneider declared in a 2007 interview. \"I felt very sad because I was treated like a sex symbol, I wanted to be recognised as an actress, and the whole scandal and the aftermath of the film turned me a little crazy and I had a breakdown.\" Schneider also revealed that she tried to take her life during this period.\nLater on, Schneider would get sober, but although she made around 50 films during her career (including the critically acclaimed 1975 film The Passenger, co-starring Jack Nicholson) she remarked that \"Last Tango is still the one everyone asks me about.\" She died in 2011, from cancer.\n\"The unfortunate thing is Maria Schneider gave an incredible performance in that film, and you could see how her career could have taken a different path,\" Matt Dillon says. \"But she already had so many strikes against her. Her family of origin was a very messy situation. She was abandoned by her parents and then abandoned by the people that she worked with. I think this abandonment followed her.\"\nSchneider is not the only female actor of that era who suffered because of the hype around an erotic movie they starred in \u2013 Sylvia Kristel also found it hard to escape the sensation created by 1974's soft porn movie Emmanuelle, in which she had the leading role, and which also featured a rape scene. Nor was it only women who suffered making films with sexual content; Schneider would later say that \"even Brando said he felt raped and manipulated\" during the infamous Last Tango scene.\n\"It was an era of celebrity directors,\" Anna Smith, host of the podcast Girls on Film, tells the BBC. \"And the pattern seems to be mainly domineering male directors exploiting and bullying younger actresses. The entitlement of some of these lauded men enabled them to exert control over women.\"\n\"We had this idea of the creator, the director that has the supreme power,\" says Vartolomei, \"and that they were a sort of guru of directing, and that all the people around him were listening to him as if he was God. I think that was the problem back then. Now we're more protected and our voice is heard, and it is also valued, which [it] wasn't back then.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How Snow White became 2025's most divisive film\n\u2022 10 of the best films to watch in March\n\u2022 Why cult film Emmanuelle is 'extremely problematic' \nBut Being Maria director Jessica Palud points out that one of the more extraordinary aspects of Schneider's character was that long before the era of #MeToo, she was speaking out about what happened on the set of Last Tango in Paris. \"The thing is that what I really found interesting and touching about her is that although it was in the 1970s and at the time, many young actresses would get assaulted or raped, but they kept it inside. Maria was extremely vocal and clear in interviews\u2026 she would speak up, but she wasn't listened to.\"\u00a0\nSchneider's experience on Last Tango was eventually taken seriously in 2016, when footage of Bertolucci's 2013 interview with Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise about the infamous scene and his desire for Schneider's humiliation to be real resurfaced. This time, it caused outrage. Some did not realise that the sex scene was, however traumatic, only simulated by Brando and Schneider. The then 76-year-old director called the furore \"ridiculous\" and reiterated that Schneider knew about the scene beforehand.\nAll three of the main storytellers of Last Tango in Paris \u2013 Bertolucci, Brando and Schneider \u2013 are now dead. Knowing that the horror, shock, upset and fury seen on Maria Schneider's face is real, and deliberately provoked, should the film, as French newspaper Le Monde pondered after the cancellation of a 2024 screening in Paris due to protests, carry some kind of warning?\n\"I have long thought that the perceived canon of cinematic greats needs re-examining \u2013 as it comes from an inherently patriarchal place,\" says Smith. \"I think it's healthy to revisit classics from a modern perspective; I hope our understanding of the damage that can be caused by certain attitudes and practices has evolved.\"\nBeing Maria, Palud says, attempts to show that, but she says that \"I did not want to judge nor condemn, but to show the system and show what needs to change in the system for this younger generation to be protected. There's still a lot to do. But a scene like this wouldn't happen now, thank God.\"\nVartolomei adds: \"I feel this movie is clearing things up for Maria, along with Vanessa Schneider's book. Back then, Maria was considered a victim, but for me she's far from that, as she found the strength to talk, for the story to be heard, even if she decided to talk in a society that wasn't ready to receive her voice. But now I'm just happy that we are finally able to hear her.\"\nBeing Maria has a US-wide release from 4 April.\u00a0\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Mountain gorilla conservation in Rwanda is a global success story, partly due to the significance and value placed on gorillas as part of the nation's culture and heritage, with annual celebrations of baby gorillas being born.\nIn a sunlit spot of mist-cloaked rainforest, a black, hairy mass of muscle descends surprisingly gracefully down a thick mossy vine. The huge silverback stretches out and settles in for a thorough grooming session from a female, totally unfazed by his human admirers. Two teenagers tumble into view, beating their chests and grimacing at each other, a tangle of limbs in mock combat, while an adorable baby gorilla peers shyly from her mother's arms at the unfolding family drama.\nSeeing mountain gorillas in the wild is a magical bucket list experience, but it wasn't always this way. Poachers decimated gorilla numbers in the 1960s and 70s, leaving them at risk of extinction. Then came the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Volcanoes National Park, home to most of Rwanda's mountain gorillas, became a battlefield as the civil war raged across the country, with population numbers struggling to rise above 300.\u00a0\nIt's hard to fathom how Rwanda has managed to tackle the challenges of its traumatic past in such a short space of time, let alone become a beacon of conservation success. Yet today, mountain gorillas are the only great ape whose numbers are not rapidly descending. WWF estimates that mountain gorilla numbers have risen 3% every year since 2010, moving them in the right direction from \"critically endangered\" to \"endangered\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species \u2013 and this success largely comes down to Rwanda's sustained conservation efforts, which include anti-poaching patrols, community engagement and regulated gorilla tourism, all of which have helped to protect habitats and ensure that local people benefit from the survival of these great apes.\nThree hundred and ninety-five baby gorillas have been born since 2005 in Rwanda, and each year since then these new arrivals have been celebrated in a uniquely Rwandan way. Kwita Izina, or \"to give a name\" in the country's national Kinyarwanda language, is Rwanda's huge annual gorilla naming ceremony that honours each gorgeous fuzzy baby born in Volcanoes National Park with a meaningful moniker. The ceremony, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, is inspired by the centuries-old Rwandan tradition where families and communities would gather together to name their newborns. Since Kwita Izina began, it has played a major role in raising awareness of gorilla conservation.\n\"It's a great story of success to mark this progress of a species that was in decline and on the edge,\" says Praveen Moman, founder of Volcanoes Safaris and the first international tour operator to kickstart gorilla tourism in Rwanda after the genocide. \"First it was small and local and symbolic, just for the rangers and those involved in conservation. Now the government has made this an international and recognisable event to highlight conservation success.\"\nRwandans place great significance on a person's name, and so the button-cute babies are given names based on their personality or events surrounding them at the time of their birth. Last year actor Idris Elba named a baby gorilla \"Narame\", meaning \"long life\", because its mother had previously lost two children; and primary school student Elvine Ineza named a female baby \"Nibagwire\", meaning \"multiply\" and chosen to wish the newly formed Sigasirie family continued growth.\nTens of thousands of people, including celebrities, conservationists and local communities, now come together at the foothills of the ancient volcanoes for the annual spectacle held every autumn (the confirmed date for 2025 has yet to be announced by the Rwanda Development Board). As well as the official ceremony, dominated by a house-high bamboo gorilla sculpture, there are hours of music, dances and performances from the warrior-like Intore dancers pounding the ground in time to drums to cultural villages showcasing Rwandan daily life.\nAs well as raising global awareness, Kwita Izina is also a cultural celebration of the country's collective efforts to protect the great apes and a way of saying thank you to the communities and conservationists who protect them. Irene Murerwa, chief tourism officer of the Rwanda Development Board tells the BBC that Kwita Izina serves the purpose of thanking the local community before everything else. \"It's because of the community and it's for them as well,\" she says.\nTiming a visit to Volcanoes National Park during Kwita Izina is highly worthwhile, but the meaning behind it is really what's key, according to Murerwa. \"It's not just the baby gorilla naming ceremony. It's the whole aspect of visiting. Guests can take advantage to understand how communities, tourism and conservation come together here,\" she says.\nA dramatic blend of striking volcanic mountains, ethereal montane forests and neat, terraced hills that roll endlessly across the countryside, Rwanda is tiny but one of the most densely populated countries in Africa. Space is limited, so people living near the gorillas must have incentives to protect them. \"If you want to save the gorillas you need to focus on the people, because these are tiny, fragile habitats, surrounded by some of the most densely populated areas of the world,\" says Moman.\nPlan your trip\nHow to get here:\n Fly into Rwanda's capital Kigali. From Kigali, it takes between two to three hours to drive to Volcanoes National Park's headquarters in Kinigi, Musanze, where the naming ceremony is also held. Lodges usually provide transfers or car hire and taxi services are available.\nWhen to go:\n The long dry season between May and October. Kwita Izina is usually held every autumn.\nWhere to stay\n: \nVirunga Lodge\n, \nWilderness Sabyinyo\n and \nRed Rocks Rwanda.    \nWhat to do:\n Gorillas are the star attraction but golden monkeys are also endemic here (permits are needed for both). If visiting during the week-long Kwita Izina festivities, organise tickets through your lodge or tour operator.\n\"Unless local people see some specific benefit from tourism and conservation, there's no reason why they should support the future of the gorillas, and equally importantly, the future of the habitat. What they need is farmland and bread on the table. From the small number of visitors, you need to make enough of an impact through the income and make sure that some of it is shared with the community.\"\nMore than 1.4 million travellers visited Rwanda in 2023, generating a record US$620m. At $1,500 per permit, watching gorillas is an eye-wateringly expensive experience. Yet, income from gorilla tourism provides vital funding for the continued protection of the park and animals within and, crucially, 10% of the park fee revenue goes to the people who live around the park margins to help build schools and houses, improve infrastructure and sanitation, provide clean water and support health centres. This impactful funding has transformed villages and encourages stewardship of the forests.\nTourism now also provides thousands of people with livelihoods. Greg Bakunzi, founder of Red Rocks Rwanda, a social enterprise integrating tourism, conservation and sustainable community development in and around the Volcanoes National Park, says, \"Kwita Izina helped to mobilise communities and people who were interested in conservation and tourism to be a part of the growing tourism industry.\"\nRed Rocks Rwanda offers safari tent accommodation, gorilla trekking and many immersive activities throughout the year for visitors, and Bakunzi now also hosts the annual Red Rocks Cultural Festival that aligns with the dates of Kwita Izina and features music, poetry, comedy, art, exhibitions and talks about conservation and community empowerment.\n\"I wanted to create a week-long event that could also integrate community conservation when travellers come for the naming ceremony,\" he says. \"The culture of the communities are intricately tied to the natural world surrounding them. They preserve not only the Virungu Mountain environment but also the historical cultures and traditional arts of the region, gaining access to sustainable sources of income from tourism.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Where people go to bars to drink milk\n\u2022 Is there such a thing as guilt-free safari?\n\u2022 The West African nation welcoming the world\nOver at the Gorilla Guardians Village in the small town of Kinigi, which is also home to the park headquarters, former poachers have swapped snares for stories. Visitors can immerse themselves in Rwandan dance, craft and food, make Rwanda's potent banana beer, learn traditional skills like fire-making and archery and hear the tales of the people who used to hunt in the forest. Also in Kinigi, upscale Sabyinyo Silverback Lodge is Rwanda's first community-owned lodge. The pretty stone cottages and access to gorilla trekking provide an income for many local people and also support healthcare, infrastructure and education projects, such as building homes for widows of the Rwandan genocide and new classrooms for children.\nEunice Umumararungu, assistant manager at Sabyinyo, told me, \"Everyone's job is vital to successful conservation. From the porters, trackers and guides to research partners, rangers and those who are involved in the tree planting initiatives \u2013 they are all ensuring future naming ceremonies as the gorilla population grows thanks to conservation efforts. Kwita Izina has helped all Rwandans from various communities to understand the value of gorillas and their contribution to the country's economic prosperity.\"\nCementing the region as a conservation hub is the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, which opened in 2022 just outside the park. As well as being an education and research centre for the next generation of conservation leaders, visitors can take quizzes to find out which gorilla matches their personality, leaf through Fossey's field notes in a highly realistic version of the acclaimed primatologist's research camp and explore 12 acres of beautifully landscaped grounds.\nGorilla families are doing so well now that Volcanoes National Park is being expanded to give them more space. In addition, a Conservation Master Plan, published later this year, will set out guidance for the protection and management of all Rwandan biodiversity. As people are seen as important stewards of conservation in this nation, those who will have to relocate out of the expanded national park will be supported with new livelihood opportunities and improved living conditions.\n\"Kwita Izina has really put our name on the map,\" says Bakunzi. \"It has brought us more global visibility and has shown people why conservation matters.\"\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Outrage is a precious political currency and France's far right has spent this week attempting, furiously and predictably, to capitalise on the perceived injustice of a court's decision to block its totemic leader, Marine Le Pen, from standing in the 2027 presidential election.\nListen to Andrew read this article\nThe airwaves have been throbbing with indignation.\n\"Be outraged,\" said one of Le Pen's key deputies, on French television, in case anyone was in doubt as to what their reaction should be.\nBut it remains unclear whether Le Pen's tough sentence will broaden support for her party, the National Rally (RN), or lead to greater fragmentation of the French far right. Either way, it has created a feverish mood among the nation's politicians.\nLe Pen and her allies have boldly declared that France's institutions, and democracy itself, have been \"executed\", are \"dead\", or \"violated\". The country's justice system has been turned into a \"political\" hit squad, shamelessly intervening in a nation's right to choose its own leaders. And Marine Le Pen has been widely portrayed, with something close to certainty, as France's president-in-waiting, as the nation's most popular politician, cruelly robbed of her near-inevitable procession towards the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\"The system has released a nuclear bomb, and if it is using such a powerful weapon against us, it is obviously because we are about to win the elections,\" Le Pen fumed at a news conference, comparing herself to the poisoned, imprisoned, and now dead Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny.\nAs France assesses its latest political tremors, an uneven pushback has begun.\nNervous about the impact the judgement may have for the country's frail coalition government, the Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou has admitted to feeling \"troubled\" by Le Pen's sentence and worried about a \"shock\" to public opinion.\nBut other centrist politicians have taken a firmer line, stressing the need for a clear gap between the justice system and politics.\nAn early opinion poll appears to show the French public taking a calm line, bursting \u2013 or at least deflating \u2013 the RN's bubble of outrage. The poll, produced within hours of the court's ruling, showed less than a third of the country \u2013 31% - felt the decision to block Le Pen, immediately, from running for public office, was unjust. \nTellingly, that figure was less than the 37% of French people who recently expressed an interest in voting for her as president.\nIn other words, plenty of people who like her as a politician also think it reasonable that her crimes should disqualify her from running for office.\nAnd remember, French presidential elections are still two years away \u2013 an eternity in the current political climate.\nEmmanuel Macron is not entitled to stand for another term and no clear alternative to Le Pen, from the left or centre of French politics, has yet emerged. Le Pen's share of the vote has consistently risen during her previous three failed bids for the top job but it is premature, at best, to consider her a shoo-in for 2027.\nAnyone who followed the court case against her and her party colleagues in an impartial fashion would struggle to conclude that the verdicts in Le Pen's case were unreasonable.\nThe evidence of a massive and coordinated project to defraud the European Parliament and its associated taxpayers included jaw-droppingly incriminating emails suggesting officials knew exactly what they were doing, and the illegality of their actions.\nThat the corruption was for the party, not for personal gain, surely changes nothing. Corruption is corruption. Besides, other parties have also been found guilty of similar offences.\nRegarding the punishments handed out by the court, here it seems fair to argue that Le Pen and her party made a strategic blunder in their approach to the case. \nHad they acknowledged the facts, and their errors, and cooperated in facilitating a swift trial rather than helping to drag the process out for almost a decade, the judges \u2013 as they've now made clear \u2013 might have taken their attitude towards the case into consideration when considering punishments.\n\"Neither during the investigation nor at the trial did [Le Pen] show any awareness of the need for probity as an elected official, nor of the ensuing responsibilities,\" wrote the judges in a document explaining, often indignantly, why they'd delivered such a tough sentence.\nThey berated Le Pen for seeking to delay or avoid justice with \"a defence system that disregards the uncovering of the truth\".\nIt is worth noting, here, the wider hypocrisy demonstrated by elites across France's political spectrum who have recently been muttering their sympathy for Le Pen. It is nine years since MPs voted to toughen up the laws on corruption, introducing the very sanctions - on immediately banning criminals from public office - that were used by the judges in this case.\nThat toughening was welcomed by the public as an antidote to a judicial system stymied by an indulgent culture of successive appeals that enabled \u2013 and sometimes still enables - politicians to dodge accountability for decades.\nLe Pen is now being gleefully taunted by her critics online with the many past instances in which she has called for stricter laws on corruption.\n\"When are we going to learn the lessons and effectively introduce lifelong ineligibility for those who have been convicted of acts committed while in office or during their term of office?\" she asked in 2013.\nReasonable people can reasonably disagree about the court's sentencing decisions in Le Pen's case. But the notion \u2013 enthusiastically endorsed by populist and hard-right politicians across Europe and the US \u2013 that she is a victim of a conspiratorial political plot has clearly not convinced most French people.\nAt least not yet.\nSo where does this verdict \u2013 clearly a seismic moment in French politics \u2013 leave the National Rally and the wider far-right movement?\nThe short answer is that no one knows. There are so many variables involved \u2013 from the fate of Le Pen's fast-tracked appeal, to the RN's succession strategy, to the state of France's precarious finances, to the broader political climate and the see-sawing appetite for populism both within France and globally \u2013 that predictions are an even more dubious game than usual.\nThe most immediate question \u2013 given the slow pace of the legal appeal that Le Pen has vowed to initiate \u2013 is whether the RN will seek prompt revenge in parliament by attempting to bring down the fragile coalition government of Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou.\nThat could lead to new parliamentary elections this summer and the possibility that the RN could capitalise on its victim status to increase its lead in parliament and perhaps, even, to push the country towards a deadlock in which President Macron might \u2013 yet another \"might\" \u2013 feel obliged to step down.\nOne person who will now be facing extra scrutiny is Le Pen's almost but not quite anointed successor, 29-year-old Jordan Bardella, who could be drafted in as a replacement presidential candidate if Le Pen's own \"narrow path\" towards the \u00c9lys\u00e9e remains blocked on appeal.\nIf social-media-savvy Bardella's popularity among French youth is any indication of his prospects, he could well sweep to victory in 2027. He has found a way to tap into the frustrations of people angry about falling living standards and concerns about immigration. \nBut turning youthful support into actual votes is not always straightforward, and other, more experienced and mainstream figures on the right may well be sensing an opportunity too.\nThe Interior Minister, Bruno Retailleau, is widely seen to be emerging as a potential contender. Some even wonder if the provocative television personality, Cyril Hanouna, might become a serious political force on the right of French politics.\nMeanwhile, Bardella, like the RN in general, has been on a highly disciplined mission to detoxify the party's once overtly racist and antisemitic brand. In February, for instance, he abandoned plans to speak at America's far-right CPAC event after Donald Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon made a Nazi salute.\nBut this week's events have revealed that the RN is enthusiastically committed to the distinctly Trump-ian and populist strategy of blaming its misfortunes on a \"swamp\" of unelected officials. Bardella, meanwhile, complained about the recent closure of two right-wing media channels alongside his party's own legal struggles.\n\"There is an extremely serious drift today that does not reflect the idea we have of French democracy,\" he said.\nIt's the sort of language that goes down well with the RN's core constituency, but its broader appeal may be limited in a country that remains, in many ways, deeply attached to its institutions.\nTo frame it another way, will French voters be more motivated by the belief that Le Pen was unfairly punished, or by concern that the judges involved have since been the victims of death threats and other insults?\nAs for Marine Le Pen, she has vowed that she will not be sidelined. But her destiny is not entirely in her own hands now. At the age of 56 she has become a familiar figure, fiery at times, but personally approachable, warm and, in political terms, profoundly influential and disciplined. So what next for her?\nFrance has had one Le Pen or other (Marine's father, Jean-Marie ran four times) on their presidential ballot paper since 1988. Always unsuccessfully.\nHistory may well look back on this week as the moment Marine Le Pen's fate was sealed, in one of three ways: as France's first female and first far-right president, swept to power on a tide of outrage. As the four-time loser of a French presidential election, finally denied power by the taint of corruption. Or as someone whose soaring political career was brought to an early and shuddering halt by her own miscalculations over a serious embezzlement scandal.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

More than $100m (\u00a377m) was spent by the candidates and their allies, including $20m by Musk.\nThe result is expected to have far-reaching implications, potentially even affecting the balance of power in the US Congress.\nThat is because the state's supreme court is expected to play a key role in cases related to congressional redistricting ahead of midterm elections in 2026 and the next presidential election, in 2028.\nWith the majority of ballots tallied, Crawford had won about 54% of the vote, and Schimel had around 45%, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.\nAddressing the fundraising by Musk, Crawford told supporters in her victory speech: \"Wisconsin stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price. Our courts are not for sale.\"\nThe Dane county judge was formerly a private lawyer for Planned Parenthood and she backed abortion rights during her campaign.\nAfter giving his personal backing to Schimel, Tuesday's result was a setback for Trump in a crucial swing state that he won by less than a percentage point during last November's presidential election.\nHowever, he took consolation from fellow Republicans managing to hold on to two congressional seats in Florida elections on Tuesday. \nThe contest was seen as a test of Musk's powerbroking status. The SpaceX and Tesla boss travelled to the state to give out millions of dollars to voters who pledged to support conservative causes. \nIn celebrating Crawford's win, Democrats framed her victory as Musk's defeat. \n\"Wisconsin cannot be bought. Our democracy is not for sale. And when we fight, we win,\" Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote in a post on social media.  \nMusk addressed the defeat of his candidate in a post on his social media site X, writing: \"I expected to lose, but there is value to losing a piece for a positional gain.\"\nIn the city of Milwaukee, which leans Democratic, officials reported a shortage of ballots on Tuesday \"due to unprecedented and historic voter turnout\", the city's election commission said in a statement.\nWisconsin separately voted on Tuesday to enshrine into the state constitution a law requiring voters to show ID to cast their ballots. \nVoters were already required to show ID, but adding it to the state constitution made it harder to change in the future. Crawford had opposed the voter ID constitutional amendment. \nAt an NBA game in Milwaukee on Tuesday, several voters spoke to the BBC about their concerns.\nMilwaukee Bucks fan Mike McClain said he was motivated by a dislike for Musk, who he referred to as \"the real president\".\n\"I don't know how a billionaire, almost a trillionaire, can decide what's going on,\" he said. \"You can't even relate with common people.\"\nCrawford also benefited from large donations by billionaire donors, including financier George Soros, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. But Musk outspent them all.\nA Schimel supporter who did want to give his name said he was supporting the conservative out of loyalty to Trump. \n\"We got to take it back home here and reinforce everything that Donald Trump has done,\" he said.\nMuch of the liberal campaign focused on the role played by Musk in the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), a cost-cutting taskforce that has moved to fire thousands of government workers and slash the federal payroll.\nDuring a rally on Sunday, Musk distributed two $1m cheques to voters at a rally who signed a petition of his against \"activist judges\". \nOthers who signed it received $100 from Musk. \nOn Tuesday, Musk's political action committee added that it would pay $50 to anyone who snapped a picture of a Wisconsin resident standing outside a polling site and holding a photo of Schimel.\nMusk donated more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump to the White House. He held similar $1m giveaways to boost the Republican president's campaign last year.\nWisconsin's supreme court is expected to play a key role in determining the shape of congressional districts if Democrats seek to challenge current district maps as they are widely expected to do.\nRepublicans currently hold six of the state's eight seats in the US House of Representatives.\nAt his rally on Sunday, Musk alluded to the looming fight over congressional districts, saying the judicial race was ultimately about control of the US House of Representatives, where Republicans currently hold a narrow majority.\nThat slender margin was shored up on Tuesday in special congressional elections in Trump's political heartland of Florida. \nRepublican candidates Jimmy Patronis and Randy Fine held on to those ruby-red seats in races that were seen as a barometer of the political landscape ahead of next year's Midterm elections.",

        "article_text": "Jon Hamm excels in Apple TV+'s \"emotionally real but absurdist\" drama about a desperate corporate man who resorts to stealing from his neighbours.\nJon Hamm has his best role since Mad Men and brings all his sharp comic timing and dramatic nuance to it as Andrew Cooper, known as Coop, a hedge-fund manager who loses his job and manoeuvres to maintain his elaborate lifestyle and sense of himself. If you took Don Draper and dropped him into 2025 he might be Coop, a corporate man with a broken marriage and two teenaged children, a decent guy and a charmer with all-around bad judgement. Your Friends and Neighbors is emotionally real and affecting but also absurdist and funny, a rare combination.\nThe show begins with Coop waking up in a pool of blood next to a man's dead body in the foyer of a neighbour's mansion. He cleans up the blood \u2013 a bad move \u2013 and in one of the many mordant voiceovers that run through the series, looks back four months to reflect on \"the swirling hot mess of my life\". His worst choice is replacing his lost income by stealing loot from friends so rich they'll never miss it. The robberies are the comic vein in the story, but also a Trojan horse for its drama. Coop is hurt and distraught over the loss of his marriage, but that theme exists next to the caper-like thefts. The series is edgier and smarter than its entertaining surface suggests, as it deftly takes on issues of family, class privilege, vapid materialism and toxic masculinity.\nLike most series, this could start a bit faster, as it sets up the life Coop is accustomed to in a suburban New York community of huge houses and country clubs, where $200,000 cars and $60,000 donations to charity are ordinary. That was his life until he found his wife Mel (Amanda Peet) in bed with his so-called friend, Nick (Mark Tallman), a former basketball star still in great shape. The divorce has sent Coop out of his expansive home into a smaller rental house nearby.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 11 of the best TV shows to watch this April\n\u2022 A new Hollywood take-down is a must-see\n\u2022 Why on-screen male nudity is still taboo\nBut soon enough the first episode gets to its boldest turn as we see why Coop lost his job. A woman who works at his firm, whom he has never met and who doesn't report to him, comes on to him in a bar. Months later, that consensual hookup leads to his being fired for violating the company's HR rules. Pop culture has at times gingerly dipped a toe into the theme of sexual harassment. On The Morning Show, Steve Carell's character, a toxic predator, was sent off a cliff to die. But there has been nothing as complicated as this. The show doesn't deny Coop's bad judgement but also makes it clear through the woman herself and Coop's ruthless boss that the HR rule was a convenient excuse to get rid of him while keeping his clients. The show doesn't go far beyond that in exploring the issue, but it sets up the series' complex realism about social standards.\u00a0\nA non-compete clause makes Coop unhireable, but he insists on keeping up appearances. His burglaries are treated like adventures, punctuated by mock ads as he describes the luxury items he's lifting, with voiceovers that slyly echo Hamm's in all those Mercedes-Benz commercials. \"The Patek Phillippe Nautilus: sealed 18-carat white gold...\" Coop says, talking about an item no one really needs.\nThe series' real strength, though, is in his relationships, most of them driven by his wounded pride, and the way his identity has been tied to his role as a successful man of the world. Hamm smoothly navigates the shifts in tone, never allowing the humour to flag while letting us see the emotional pain Coop won't reveal to anyone around him. There is a lot of residual affection between Coop and his cheating ex-wife, whom Peet manages to make sympathetic. When Mel worries and asks him what's wrong, he displays a classic alpha-male inability to share feelings. \"I'm fine,\" he tells her when clearly he is not. Olivia Munn has less to do as Sam, a divorced neighbour and Coop's occasional fling. And Lena Hall is brilliant as Coop's sister, Ali. Briefly off her meds, she stalks her ex-fianc\u00e9, sitting on his lawn with her guitar and singing. Hall, who won a Tony for her role in the Broadway revival of Hedwig and the Angry Inch in 2014, sings occasionally through the series \u2013 an asset, not an intrusion. She makes Ali empathetic, funny and warm, and the bond between the brother and sister is touching. After she is back on her meds, her romantic subplot suggests that theirs really is a family full of bad choices.\nA second season of the show has already been ordered, so the question of whether Coop will pay for his crimes will linger. That plot is an effective hook, but his resonant feelings and increasing self-knowledge set the show apart. At a party of male friends hosted by Nick \u2013 why is Coop even there? more bad choices \u2013 he looks around at the men who still have their jobs and money, and sees the person he might have become. \"Their future was already written, and so the quest to stave off the emptiness began,\" he says in voiceover, observing their devotion to \"Scotch and cigars\", to \"custom golf clubs and high-end escorts\". He recognises that there are \"entire industries built to cash in on the quiet desperation of rich middle-aged men\". By even acknowledging that desperation, through a hero who is sympathetic \u2013 however wrong-headed his path to self-awareness \u2013 Your Friends and Neighbors is radically different from any other show around.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nYour Friends and Neighbors is on Apple TV+ from 11 April.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0\nsign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0\nFacebook, \nX and \nInstagram.

        "article_text": "Jonny Bairstow and James Anderson will not face off this season after Yorkshire were promoted and Lancashire relegated\nThe 2025 County Championship begins on Friday - and, remarkably for early April, the weather is set to be glorious.\nBut which county sides will sparkle this season and whose outlook is gloomy?\nThe BBC's local radio county cricket commentators and online journalists - who will be providing ball-by-ball radio and live text commentary throughout the season on the BBC Sport website and app - take a look at each club's prospects... \nCounty Championship preview: Who can stop Surrey?\nJennings 'job' is to win Lancashire silverware\nBears must spread wickets around - Hannon-Dalby\n2024 season - Eighth in Division Two\nDave Fletcher - BBC Radio Derby\nGiven Derbyshire finished bottom of Division Two in 2024, things can surely only improve. \nThey did at least win a game last year, unlike 2023, but it was another bitterly disappointing watch for the County Ground faithful.\nThey were not helped by an opening round washout against Gloucestershire last season which meant they were playing catch-up from the off.\nThat appears unlikely to be repeated so a quick start \u2013 against the same opposition - is essential.\nThey have added Australian opening batter Caleb Jewell to the squad and he will be joined by returning Kiwi quick bowler Blair Tickner, whose spell last season was all too brief.\nThere's a new captain at the helm, too, although it is a familiar figure. Wayne Madsen, who led the side to promotion in 2012, takes over from David Lloyd after his solitary campaign leading the side.\nTickner's return and the presence of experienced bowlers such as Zak Chappell and Pat Brown can only benefit newcomer Harry Moore.\nAlready in the England system, the much talked-about 17-year-old will be starting his first full season in the senior side having already shown he can more than hold his own at that level.\nWinter signings Jack Morley and Martin Andersson will be better for having been with the group last season.\nThe big challenge remains the ability to take 20 wickets a match, something Mickey Arthur's side have to do if they are to repeat the relative riches of his first season in charge in 2022.\nMatthew Potts' Durham appearances this season may be limited by England call-ups\n2024 season - Fifth in Division One\nMartin Emmerson - BBC Radio Newcastle\nDurham finished fifth on their return to Division One last season and in general more than held their own. They might be able to improve on that this year. We'll see.\nThey weren't helped by the loss of their entire opening game - at home to Hampshire in April \u2013 but there was only really Surrey who turned them over.\nThat was towards the end of the season and the week Surrey retained their title - and they beat a weakened Durham side struggling with injuries.\nFrom a batting point of view they have added Emilio Gay to the ranks. He joined towards the end of last season from Northants, while Will Rhodes chose to leave Warwickshire after seven seasons, despite the offer of a new contract. \nThey will help boost a line-up which includes the leading batter in Division One last season, in South African David Bedingham. He scored 1,331 runs, including a club-record 279 against Lancashire in September. He also became the first Durham batter to score centuries in four consecutive innings.\nOpener Michael Jones has left for Lancashire. His outings last season were limited due to selection choices, so he took the decision to head back home.\nBowling is the key issue. They've had no luck with overseas players in recent seasons. Scott Boland lasted part of one game before returning home to Australia in April. Neil Wagner managed just one game too. Veteran Peter Siddle came in and did well in his four games, while West Indian Chemar Holder didn't particularly pull up any trees in his three matches. Keeping their bowlers fit will be key.\nIt remains to be seen how much of a good signing Sam Conners will be. The bowler has joined from Derbyshire. While he boasted 50 championship wickets in 2022, he took 27 the following year, but only played five Championship matches last season. Australian seamer Brendan Doggett will play County Championship matches in April and May. The 30-year-old seamer plays for South Australia and has 157 first-class wickets to his name.\nThen there's the likes of ever-dependable all-rounder Ben Raine. Matthew Potts is important to the team too, when England allow him to be available. Seventeen-year-old James Minto looks a good prospect and fellow bowler Daniel Hogg will be looking to push on after a career-best 7-66 against Notts in Chester-le-Street.\n2024 season - Fourth in Division One\nVictoria Polley - BBC Radio Essex\nThere's been change at the top for Essex over the winter with Chris Silverwood returning to the club as director of cricket. \nEssex won successive titles (Div 2 & 1) in his previous tenure as head coach, including a first County Championship win in 25 years, before England came calling. \nWith his assistant Anthony McGrath taking over from then up until last season, it will hopefully be a more seamless transition than these changes can sometimes be.\nDean Elgar was vital at the top of the order last season but who will open alongside him is the big question? Do Essex give a chance to teenager Charlie Allison who has impressed in the white-ball formats? They have other options in the likes of Nick Browne or Robin Das, or even bumping Paul Walter or Michael Pepper up higher.\nJordan Cox was also key with the bat last season but has had a torrid winter, denied an England Test debut by a thumb injury. International opportunities could affect his availability.\nAn international call-up still eludes bowler Sam Cook but England's loss is very much Essex's gain - alongside Jamie Porter and Simon Harmer, it's a potent bowling attack.\nIt would've been strengthened with the signing of Shardul Thakur but his late involvement in the IPL has ruled him out of a move to Chelmsford, and Essex continue to hunt for a replacement.\nIt's been six years since Essex last won a County Championship title and they continue to punch above their weight in competing at the top end of the table. \nThey might not have the squad size and budgets of other counties but there's still plenty of talent and experience among the Essex ranks. Can Silverwood add more silverware to his Essex collection on his Chelmsford return?\n2024 season - Sixth in Division Two\nNick Webb - BBC Radio Wales Sport\nThe arrival of Richard Dawson as head coach after the unexpected departure of Grant Bradburn is the main change at Sophia Gardens, with the squad looking remarkably similar to last season. \nThe second One-Day Cup triumph in four years put a gloss on an otherwise disappointing 2024 campaign as Glamorgan showed only marginal improvement in the T20 Blast and fell away in the latter stages of the Championship promotion race.\nKey factors in the Championship will be finding a consistent opening partnership to go with the settled top order of Sam Northeast, Kiran Carlson, Colin Ingram and Chris Cooke, as well as getting the most out of a seam attack lacking raw pace. \nEddie Byrom, unlucky with injury in several seasons, is the most likely starter up top but his partner could be one of four or five candidates. \nSri Lankan Asitha Fernando is likely to partner Timm van der Gugten with the new ball in the opening stages of the season, while it will be interesting to see if on-loan England off-spinner Shoaib Bashir makes an impact as cover for Mason Crane early on when pitches usually don't help the twirlers.\nThere is little doubt that young all-rounder Ben Kellaway will become a regular in all formats sooner or later, but being thrown in as a red-ball opener was maybe a step too far. \nHis ambidextrous spin is a unique selling point added to some hard hitting in the middle order. \nOverall the county needs to manage a fair degree of change in the medium term, with a fair few of their stalwarts well past the 30 mark.\nJames Bracey played two Test matches for England in 2021\n2024 season - Seventh in Division Two\nEd Seabourne - BBC Radio Bristol\nGloucestershire approach the 2025 season with a renewed sense of ambition, keen to ensure this campaign isn't looked back on as the previous September's hangover.\nWhilst 2024 will always be remembered for the remarkable run to the county's first T20 Blast trophy, head coach Mark Alleyne made no bones about the fact he was disappointed to have ended so far behind the promotion spots in the County Championship.\nDespite the final positioning, significant strides forward were made on the batting side. \nWicketkeeper James Bracey is following a stellar year that saw him achieve the rare double of 1,000 runs and 50 dismissals, and there is increasing competition for spots in the top order.\nThe signing of Australian all-rounder Cameron Green for five matches will only add to that, and there is even hope he will be allowed to bowl towards the end of his stay.\nThe club possesses a group of promising young pace bowlers, including recent England Lions call-ups Zaman Akhter and Ajeet Singh Dale, and newly appointed Championship skipper Cameron Bancroft has spoken of his excitement in working with them.\nThe departure of Zafar Gohar, however, means the squad is without a proven red-ball spinner, and, especially with the dry spring, the serious question will be whether there is enough variety in the attack in its current form to force wins on a consistent basis.\n2024 season - Second in Division One\nKevan James - BBC Radio Solent\nTrying to improve on their second-place finish in the Championship last season may depend on a dip in form from Surrey, but also how Hampshire cope without being able to call upon two very influential players.\nJames Vince, the captain and leader of the batting line-up, has decided red-ball cricket is no longer for him. Mo Abbas, taker of 180 wickets over the past four seasons, has been moved on.\nVeteran Mark Stoneman looks a shrewd signing to partially or maybe fully offset the hole left by Vince.\nOn the bowling front, exciting prospects Sonny Baker and John Turner will be given more responsibility. They will certainly add pace.\nA disappointing T20 campaign will hopefully be turned around by the addition of two hard-hitting South Africans in Lhaun-dre Pretorius and Dewald Brevis.\nPretorius, 19, was the top run scorer in the recent SA20 competition, while Brevis finished the tournament with the top strike rate of 180.\nBy all accounts Pretorius has the potential to be world class very quickly.\n2024 season - 10th in Division One (relegated)\nMatt Cole - BBC Radio Kent\nThe summer of 2024 was a pretty dismal affair for both club and supporters. In the Championship they found themselves outgunned, particularly in the bowling department, and never really looked like they were escaping the drop from Division One they'd so narrowly avoided the year before.\nPerhaps more worrying was the T20 Blast campaign. The Spitfires - perennial contenders for the knockout stages - won just four of 14 games and finished bottom of the South Group. The One-Day Cup didn't add much encouragement for supporters desperate for something to hope for.\nKent come into the new season though with Adam Hollioake replacing Matt Walker as head coach. It's the former Surrey and England all-rounder's first time in the role for a county side and players and supporters alike have received the appointment with some excitement.\nThe playing ranks have been bolstered by new signings \u2013 Chris Benjamin moving from Warwickshire hoping to reinvigorate his career as an all-formats batter.\nKent's bowling was the major cause for concern last season, both injuries and lack of form making them look toothless at times. A double signing of seamers just before the start of the campaign is looking to address that \u2013 recent Test debutant for Pakistan, Kashif Ali, and experienced South African pace man Keith Dudgeon are in place for the first part of the campaign.\nThey've also added Corey Flintoff \u2013 son of Andrew, brother of Rocky \u2013 to the squad, the fast-bowling all-rounder joining on a rookie contract.\nWith Aussie bowlers Wes Agar and Tom Rogers returning for the T20 Blast, it appears more of an evolution than a revolution at Canterbury this summer.\nBut if Hollioake can get the best out of the squad they could be among the front-runners for promotion back to the top division of the Championship and a return to upsetting the big budget sides in the Blast.\nRocky Flintoff played four County Championship matches for Lancashire last season\n2024 season - Ninth in Division One (relegated)\nScott Read - BBC Radio Lancashire\nSince winning the County Championship title in 2011, Lancashire have been relegated four times. \nOn the previous three occasions they've won promotion straight back to Division One. \nThey'll be expected to continue that trend this season and will start as firm favourites. \nEven without James Anderson for the first month, the Red Rose have a healthy blend of senior professionals and young players making their way in the game. \nThe overseas signings of Marcus Harris and Anderson Phillip look like excellent business. \nPhillip, for the first 11 games, will provide some extra pace, Harris for the entire season to open the batting. \nThe arrival of the Australian opener will also allow Luke Wells to bat at six giving Lancashire some much-needed experience in the middle order. \nLancashire have some fine young players who endured a tough season for the club last year. A year on from that, the likes of Matty Hurst, George Balderson and George Bell should prosper. \nFor Hurst, almost 700 runs at an average of 32 in his debut season for a relegated team was an impressive return. \nThere will also be plenty of opportunities for Tom Aspinwall and Rocky Flintoff, who does not turn 17 until next week.\nAnderson not ruling out playing for three more years\nBancroft's winning experience 'boosts' Gloucestershire\nBairstow named new Yorkshire red-ball captain  \n2024 season - Fifth in Division Two\nRichard Rae - BBC Radio Leicester\nThe return of Peter Handscomb, who made 894 runs in 14 Championship innings at an average of 74.5 last season, the signing of Shan Masood from June onwards, the presence at the top of the order of the talented Rishi Patel and the fact most of the bowlers have legitimate claims to be described as all-rounders, should mean Leicestershire are not short of runs this season. \nNor, if the likes of Patel, Sol Budinger, Rehan Ahmed and Louis Kimber find form, will they score those runs slowly.\nThe big question is whether they have the firepower to bowl teams out twice. \nLast season, Leicestershire took the lowest number of wickets (139) in Division Two by some distance, and some supporters have argued the signing of New Zealand-born Netherlands international Logan van Beek adds to their ranks of bowling all-rounders rather than gives the Foxes the cutting edge they need to break games open.\nTall young left-arm prospect Josh Hull has that potential, but has spent the close season struggling with injury.\nThere is hope in the pre-season performances of the likes of veteran Chris Wright and the promising Tom Scriven, while Ben Green's return from Somerset for the first seven Championship matches adds depth.\n2024 season - Third in Division Two\nKevin Hand - BBC Radio London\nThe signing of New Zealand batter Kane Williamson is something of a coup for a county that are operating under strict financial restrictions imposed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).\nThe rearrangement of the budget for wage allocation within the squad meant a number of players were released last season, including the tough decision to let the popular former England opener Mark Stoneman go.\nWith the evergreen opener Sam Robson aging well and Leus de Plooy a gun player in all formats, Middlesex have a top order to be feared -  probably for the first time since Robson, Nick Gubbins and Nick Compton formed a top three that played a huge part in the 2016 Championship winning side.\nThe mark of the Middlesex team under former director of cricket Angus Fraser, who took charge in 2009, was the regular ability to blast through teams with the ball.\nIn the absence of the retired Tim Murtagh, Middlesex struggled to rattle through the wickets last year and captain Toby Roland-Jones bore a heavy burden on that front. \nIt was refreshing to see the right-armer clear of injury for the season and his team will desperately need that once more if they are to be promoted.\nThe former England international will have his workload eased this year by the arrival of South African seamer Dane Paterson, another crucial addition to the squad that could make a significant difference to a side that looked on course for promotion for most of last season.\nThe signings of Williamson and Paterson to bolster the Championship side are a clear indication that Middlesex want success to return in the shape of promotion this year.\nDarren Lehmann was Australia head coach between 2013 and 2018\n2024 season - Fourth in Division Two\nAndrew Radd - BBC Radio Northamptonshire\nThe arrival of Australian Darren Lehmann as head coach at Wantage Road has triggered a wave of pre-season positivity in a squad left feeling somewhat bruised by the events of the past couple of years.\nAfter being relegated from Division One in 2023 they failed to register a Division Two win in 2024 until September, by which time Lehmann's predecessor John Sadler had lost his job following defeat in the T20 Blast quarter-finals.\nWith opener Emilio Gay and fast bowler Jack White both heading north, to Durham and Yorkshire respectively, there will be opportunities for others to shine. \nYoung batters Krish Patel (who opened his account with five boundaries on first-class debut at Headingley last September) and Aadi Sharma have much to offer, while the seam attack has been bolstered by the signings of Dom Leech, left-armer Liam Guthrie and \u2013 for the four Championship fixtures in May \u2013 Harry Conway from South Australia. \nGeorge Scrimshaw and the hugely promising Raphy Weatherall suffered injuries last season and will be eager to re-establish themselves.\nMuch will depend \u2013 certainly in four-day cricket - on the tried-and-trusted trio of Luke Procter, Ben Sanderson and Rob Keogh. \nIndian leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal had a major impact towards the end of 2024 and returns this year for a longer second-half stint.\nOther key figures across all formats will be Saif Zaib, who \u2013 to the relief of supporters \u2013 agreed a contract extension until at least the end of 2027, plus a couple of upwardly-trending all-rounders in Justin Broad, son of former tennis star Neil and named the county's Media Player of the Year last season, and Gus Miller.\n2024 season - Eighth in Division One\nDave Bracegirdle - BBC Radio Nottinghamshire\nYazz knew what she was on about, didn't she? 'The Only Way Is Up' was not only a catchy hit single but is also a good place to approach Nottinghamshire's hopes for 2025.\nHead coach Peter Moores has emphasised that it's important to learn from what went wrong last year, as well as draw a line underneath it. \nAs a brief reminder, Notts narrowly avoided relegation from Division One of the County Championship, finished bottom of their group in the T20 Blast and barely raised a pulse in the One-Day Cup.\nSo what might be different this time around?\nThe only domestic signing sees Conor McKerr join from Surrey but with Josh Tongue now fully fit, those two bolster a fast-bowling unit that promises untold riches. \nIf Notts can keep Olly Stone healthy, alongside overseas recruits in Australia's Fergus O'Neill and Pakistan's Mohammad Abbas, throw in the evergreen Brett Hutton and the raw pace of Rob Lord, then their resources seem well stocked.\nTeenagers Farhan Ahmed and Freddie McCann both made their county debuts towards the back end of last season and already carry the weight of expectation.\nThe prodigious spinning fingers of 17-year old Ahmed have already marked him out as a generational talent, while 19-year-old team-mate McCann hit two centuries in just seven innings.\nSome astute observers are already wondering if Kyle Verreynne is the best wicketkeeper-batter in the world right now. The county fought off a lot of competition to secure the services of the South African for the whole campaign.\nThat just leaves the top order. While Trent Bridge members may not see too much of England's Ben Duckett once again, there are guaranteed runs from skipper Haseeb Hameed and the gifted Joe Clarke, both as good as any in the county game.\nShoaib Bashir will join Glamorgan on loan for the first three County Championship games of the season\n2024 season - Third in Division One\nAnthony Gibson - BBC Radio Somerset\nWith a strong and settled squad of players shrewdly captained by Lewis Gregory, and terrific team spirit, Somerset go into the new season with every hope of marking the club's 150th anniversary with a first County Championship.\nInjuries permitting, Matt Henry will be back to lead a powerful seam attack, balanced by the spin of Jack Leach, rising star Archie Vaughan and, once he returns from a loan spell at Glamorgan or his England duties are over, Shoaib Bashir. \nAmong the batters, the only real question is who will partner Vaughan at the top of the order, Sean Dickson being the most likely answer. \nThe three Toms - Lammonby, Abell and Banton - will once again make up the engine room of the batting, with James Rew ready to reinforce his reputation as one of the most promising wicketkeeper-batters in the country.\nUnlike the infinitely talented Will Smeed, who is happily returning to the red-ball fold, Tom Kohler-Cadmore will focus on the white ball and the Blast, so that the firepower which has seen Somerset reach Finals Day in each of the past three seasons remains very much intact.\nFor Somerset's team of youngsters to have reached the One-Day Cup Final last year was a surprise, but they can by no means be discounted. James Rew's younger brother, Thomas, will surely come into that side, and what a prospect he is.\nLast year was a case of so near and yet so far - in contention for all three trophies, ending up with none. \nThe team will have learned from that, and if they can graft staying power onto all their other strengths, this could, at last, be Somerset's season.\nTom Lawes is one of a number of exciting all-rounders at Surrey\n2024 season - First in Division One (champions)\nMark Church - BBC Radio London\nThere is no reason Surrey cannot win a fourth Championship title on the spin this summer. \nThey obviously know how to put all the parts together over the course of a season and the squad is much the same. \nThe addition of Matt Fisher is exciting and there will be international call-ups. But the spine of the side is solid and experienced and if someone is missing, the gap gets filled without anybody noticing.\nOne to keep an eye on is Tom Lawes. He has all the talent in the world with both bat and ball, and if he produces consistently, it would not be a surprise if he were representing England soon. He will be aiming for a permanent spot in the Championship XI but as always there is healthy competition for places.\nThere is one certainty. In terms of the Championship, Surrey will want to be better than last season. \nThey are always looking to improve, and they know everybody else is trying to catch them. \nThey will be tested, especially by the likes of Essex and Hampshire but they know how to win the Championship, and they still have all the players that have managed that in the past three years. It is a good recipe to have.\n2024 season - First in Division Two (promoted)\nAdrian Harms - BBC Radio Sussex\nThere's much excitement and anticipation on the south coast, as Sussex return to Division One after almost a decade in Division Two.\nDuring that period they have never mounted a serious promotion bid, and it's taken change at the top, and the subsequent appointment of Paul Farbrace to galvanise the club.\nFarbrace has introduced a winning mentality that had been sadly lacking, and  crucially supplemented a talented group of younger players with, in his words, \"knarled old pros\" who know how to win, and battle when the going gets tough.\nHowever, this is essentially a young Sussex side most with no experience of first division cricket, and therefore the experience of Australian Daniel Hughes, skipper John Simpson and Ollie Robinson will be crucial particularly during the opening weeks of the season.\nBut don't think Sussex will be a soft touch and are back in Division One for the ride.\nProvided the top order can score enough runs, they have a match-winning spinner in Jack Carson and are especially difficult to beat at Hove, where they haven't lost since Farbrace took the helm.\nSussex have taken nine long years to return to Division One, and the feeling around the club is that's where they want to stay.\nJacob Bethell's game time at Edgbaston is likely to be limited this season\n2024 season - Seventh in Division One\nMike Taylor - BBC Radio WM\nA confusing winter followed a confusing summer. \nOften in 2024 it seemed something was going to happen for Warwickshire - they were front-runners in both white-ball tournaments, and frequently built strong early positions in Championship games. \nAnd then nothing happened. No white-ball final, only one four-day win. \nSeveral leading players had outstanding individual seasons - runs for the captain Alex Davies, wickets for Olly Hannon-Dalby, both for Ed Barnard, England calls for Jacob Bethell and Dan Mousley - but the total, somehow, came to less than the sum of the parts. \nA detailed high-performance review had seemed, from the outside, to have also come to no significant conclusion, the exit of performance director Gavin Larsen being unrelated, until head coach Mark Robinson suddenly left seven weeks ago.\nNow, there is both change and continuity. Ian Westwood, a known and trusted leader, is promoted to replace Robinson. \nThe patient, determined approach he showed as an opening bat and captain in testing circumstances should serve him well. \nA collection of overseas players also mixes the familiar and the new. Hasan Ali is already popular at Edgbaston, while Beau Webster has the qualities that should see him thrive mid-summer. \nHopefully all will avoid the bad luck with injuries that has so weighed Warwickshire down in recent years, and has hit Tom Latham before he even arrives.\nEdgbaston is always a busy place, but had become grumpy in the stands by last September, with so much promise unfulfilled. \nHaving seemed at times to be pushing on all fronts at once, they had gone nowhere. The club has a lot of moving parts but no shortage of talent. \nIf Davies and Westwood can steer the team in a clear direction, and maintain a strong challenge at least in one competition, it will be a year of progress.\n2024 season - Sixth in Division One\nGed Scott - BBC Sport online's Pears reporter\nA long, hard, emotional season eventually blossomed into some happiness for Worcestershire in 2024.\nIn between all the trauma of not being able to play their first home game at flood-hit Worcester until 25 May then came the devastating loss of one of their players, Josh Baker, at the tragically early age of just 20.\nBut the spirit the Pears showed in adversity could only be admired.\nThey gave a string of youngsters their chance in an unexpectedly progressive One-Day Cup campaign \u2013 and, either side of the mid-summer County Championship break, they produced three huge red-ball victories on the trot.\nThat not only helped them stay in the top flight, it was enough to catapult them up to sixth - their highest finish since two-division cricket began in 2000. Finishing above both neighbours Warwickshire and also Nottinghamshire, where four of their former players are now based, was a source of particular pride and pleasure.\nBuilding on that and again keeping their place in an always competitive division is now the challenge - although they will have to do so without the retired Joe Leach, as well as Kiwi Nathan Smith, who did well over the first half of last summer but then opted to join champions Surrey.\nBut they have another New Zealand fast bowler Jacob Duffy arriving from the second game onwards. They have three more incomers in Ben Allison from Essex, Nottinghamshire spinner Fateh Singh and Australian seamer Ben Dwarshuis for the T20 Blast.\nThey also still have that same marvellous team spirit to fall back on \u2013 and a real, genuine hunger.\nLong-term doubts remain over their future at New Road - but, in the short term, prospects at Worcester are brighter than people might think.\nJonny Bairstow will captain Yorkshire in the County Championship this season\n2024 season - Second in Division Two (promoted)\nJonathan Doidge - BBC Radio Leeds\nIt is likely to be a very interesting 2025 for Yorkshire.\nWith financial concerns now, apparently, assuaged at the very moment the team has returned to the top flight of the Championship, plus a new coaching staff and new red ball and T20 captains, there should rightly be an air of optimism.\nJonny Bairstow follows in his late father David's footsteps to steer the Championship challenge. He'd love to have a title as captain on his CV but aside from captaincy, his presence alone with the bat will be huge.\nSimilarly, Dawid Malan is going to be back playing more red-ball cricket, a major plus. Add to that potent opening pair of Adam Lyth and Finlay Bean, plus James Wharton, whose career began to blossom last year in particular, and more established batters like George Hill and that end of the team should be capable of setting up games.\nAs we know, that's no good without the ability to take 20 wickets and in that department there's plenty of encouragement. \nThe outstanding Ben Coad will again lead the line. Overseas input comes from, in particular, New Zealand's Ben Sears plus Will Sutherland (two matches) and Jordan Buckingham (four) also chipping in, while there's also George Hill, Jordan Thompson, off-season recruit Jack White, plus Matt Revis and Matt Milnes, who are on the road back from injury.\nDom Bess looks likely to be this coach's first pick among the spinners, though Dan Moriarty and Jafer Chohan will want a say in that.\nWith Bairstow donning the wicketkeeping gloves, Jonathan Tattersall and Harry Duke are going to have to wait for further opportunities, unless required as batters. You'd certainly have to feel for Tattersall after he led the team back up last season - but this is professional sport.\nWith One-Day Cup centurion Will Luxton awaiting another opportunity, there'll be upward pressure with the bat and I'd be backing Ben Cliff to put some serious pressure on the more senior bowlers in the squad. He could really take his own game to the next level as the season unfolds.\nIn summary, there's optimism that head coach Anthony McGrath can take the team to places it hasn't been for quite some time.",

        "article_text": "Ecosystems which have never been seen before are being accidentally created by humans. They offer a stark look into the nature of tomorrow.\nVenture deep into the forests on O'ahu, Hawaii's third largest island, and you'll find yourself threading through a dense understory of richly scented pepper, cinnamon and guava trees.\u00a0\n\"It's beautiful,\" says Corey Tarwater, an ecologist at the University of Wyoming in the US who began researching O'ahu's ecosystems in 2014. Sounds like the \"cheww-chewww\" song of the pale green warbling white-eye and the chattering, almost electrical call of the red-billed leiothrix surround you. \"There's really neat lizards around,\" adds Tarwater. \"There's these highly structured forests with these amazing tropical plant species.\"\nFor hikers setting out on O'ahu's mountain trails, these are thrilling wildernesses within easy reach of Hawaii's capital, Honolulu, says Tarwater. Yet nothing is quite as it might seem, she adds. \"You wouldn't know unless you study them, but if you walk around any forest around Honolulu, there's not going to be one single native plant species there.\"\u00a0\nO'ahu's lowland forests are now almost entirely devoid of the plants and animals that grew here for millions of years before the arrival of humans. Settlers brought extinctions by cutting down trees to make farms and introducing voracious predators and disease-carrying animals. Today, these tropical forests are a tapestry of non-native species introduced from every corner of the planet: Brazilian peppertree, Indonesian cinnamon and roseleaf bramble from the Himalayas and Australia. Most of the animals, including all the birds that Tarwater mentioned earlier, are also alien.\nO'ahu's mountainous terrain \u2013 a filming location that has evoked heroic, untrammelled wildernesses in the Jurassic Park and King Kong films \u2013 is shaped \"at every level\" by human action, says Jef Vizentin-Bugoni, a Brazilian ecologist at Universidade Federal de Pelota who researched the island's birds with Tarwater. He recalls having his expectations upturned when he arrived on the island in 2017, eager to see Hawaii's famous honeycreepers, a set of brightly coloured native bird species that exist nowhere else in the world. Instead, he was first confronted with an unfamiliar flurry of red and white feathers, which turned out to be a red-whiskered bulbul, a bird whose native range spans from India to Southern China.\u00a0\n\"I followed it as it flitted between trees until it stopped to feed on a fruit I immediately recognised \u2013 guava, a plant native to Brazil,\" he says. \"That moment captured the essence of what's happening in Hawaii: a South American plant being eaten by an Asian bird on a remote Pacific island.\"\nMost of these exotic species arrived in the last century or two and were thrown together more or less at random \u2013 some are escaped pets, others relics from abandoned farms. Yet unlike urban environments where foxes and seagulls scratch together a living eating anything they can find, the forests of O'ahu show signs of structure and organisation.\nBirds that have only lived together for the last century have assumed specialist roles, such as distributing the seeds of native plants, that were once performed by now extinct birds. In a 2019 study, Tarwater and Vizentin-Bugoni analysed the eating patterns of birds and seed dispersal on the island to see how they compared to a structured and stable native ecosystem that had evolved together over millennia.\u00a0\n\"If I compare what I'm seeing in O'ahu with what I see in the middle of the Amazon, will the interactions have the same organisation?\" asked Vizentin-Bugoni. \"To our surprise, the answer was yes.\"\nFor the last few decades, ecologists have documented the appearance of \"emerging\" or \"novel ecosystems\" like that on O'ahu. Broadly, novel ecosystems can be defined as \"autonomous, wild ecosystems that deviate from natural baselines because of human activities\", explains ecologist Jens-Christian Svenning, a professor at Aarhus University in Denmark who studies these ecosystems. Novel ecosystems may contain combinations of species never before seen in history: with some native species living alongside other species introduced by humans beyond their historically recorded ranges or driven into new locations by climate change.\nHumans may also alter the environment itself, creating new habitats by reshaping the landscape or altering environmental chemistry. For example, along the coast of the Netherlands, marine ecologist Laura Govers has documented how a system of coastal defences like dams and sea walls, built during the mid-20th Century, has created a series of salty lakes where exotic species have flourished.\nIn Brazil, rainforests cleared for farming have later become freshwater floodplains, known as v\u00e1rzeas, which are home to a new mix of species. Similarly, retired quarries can fill with water to become deep lakes, and even mines have become valued habitats.\nOne former shale oil mine between the Scottish cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow left a mountain made of stone, says Eric Higgs, professor of ecology at the University of Victoria in Canada. Over at least a century piles of stone formed a novel ecosystem through natural assembly processes, says Higgs. It is now a specially protected area that harbours rare plants such as the early purple orchid and the tiny white flowers of the knotted pearlwort.\nUnlike zoos and botanical gardens, which also contain globe-spanning collages of plants and animals, novel ecosystems like those on O'ahu are not dependent on humans to continually plant and maintain them. They now exist as self-sustaining systems, says Svenning. \"These are wild but changed ecosystems,\" he says. They have passed some critical threshold which means they are unlikely to ever go back to how they were before. \"If you removed all people from the planet, Hawaii would be on a different evolutionary ecological trajectory going forward,\" he says.\nSo how much of the planet is already covered by novel ecosystems like these? Some analyses have arrived at startling figures \u2013 in a 2013 book on novel ecosystems, researchers argued that 30-40% of the world's terrestrial ecosystems have already transformed into novel states. A study by Svenning projected that half of the land on the planet would be novel by 2100.\nHowever, these figures \u2013 like much around \"novel ecosystems\" \u2013 remain highly controversial among ecologists. Critics argue that scientists often cannot clearly define when a threshold of novelty has been passed. There are plenty of cases that are \"kind of borderline\", says Svenning. For example, power plants in Florida and Japan are venting warm water that has created tropical microenvironments with an abundance and variety of species not seen in the surrounding cooler waters.\n\"They don't depend on direct active management,\" like zoos, Svenning says. \"But they still rely on ongoing human activity to be there, right?\"\nFor the last decade, says Vizentin-Bugoni, scientists have studied O'ahu as an \"amazing crystal ball\" that offers a glimpse of the future of our planet if humans continue to damage environments and drive species to extinction.\nFor millions of years, the remote location of the Hawaiian archipelago, some 2,000 miles (3,200km) from its nearest neighbour (the US mainland), made it a petri dish for the emergence of unique species. After the islands first emerged from the ocean as lifeless rocks erupting from volcanoes between 30 million and 500,000 years ago, plants and animals arrived there extremely rarely. Migrating birds were the exception, along with the seeds they deposited in their droppings.\u00a0\nHawaii's plants and the birds that remained there therefore evolved largely in isolation from the rest of the world, leading to the evolution of species found nowhere else on the planet, from \"flightless ibises to bird-hunting owls\", writes anthropologist Todd Braje in his 2024 book\u00a0Understanding Imperiled Earth. Without any mammals or large predators of any kind, unique birds evolved to fill diverse niches, like the moa-nalo, (or \"flightless megaducks\", as Braje calls them) that grew to 2ft (0.6m) in height and helped to disperse large seeds and cycle nutrients on the islands.\nOf the 142 species of bird that evolved to live on Hawaii and nowhere else on the planet, 95 are now extinct, including the moa-nalo, according to the American Bird Conservancy. Similar trends among plants and invertebrates have earned it the label of the \"extinction capital of the world\".\nHawaii's islands are a \"microcosm\" of the issues countries worldwide face from exotic species, according to 2020 research led by Liba Pejchar, a conservation scientist at the University of Colorado. The arrival of humans \u2013 first small groups of Polynesian sailors around 1,000 years ago, later Europeans in 1778 \u2013 resulted in forest clearances and the introduction of rats, dogs and cows. For birds, the greatest threat today is the mosquito, which since the 1800s has spread avian malaria that can kill native birds with a single bite.\n\"We like to think of O'ahu as the cautionary tale for all the other Pacific Islands and the Hawaiian Islands,\" says Tarwater. \"It's what you don't want to have happen.\"\nUnsurprisingly, when Tarwater began meticulously tagging Hawaiian birds, non-native species had a bad rap. \"When we first started working out on O'ahu, we were asked by people why we didn't just shoot the [non-native] birds,\" says Tarwater. But by instead observing them, her and Vizentin-Bugoni's team discovered that several of the last native fruiting plants, such as the violet berried uki'uki which clings on in pockets high up the mountains, are wholly dependent on non-native birds to disperse seeds.\n\"It was shocking to us that they were just so embedded into these systems,\" says Tarwater. Still, it's a \"double-edged sword\", she says. \"Unfortunately, they also disperse our non-native plants,\" she says \u2013 which can, in turn, crowd out the endangered natives.\nDuring a decade investigating the rich networks that have self-assembled here, both Tarwater and Vizentin-Bugoni have been amazed to find the extent to which ecosystems have meshed together. In a 2020 paper, Tarwater showed that the traits and bodies of non-native birds have shifted in areas they have invaded \u2013 some, for example, have smaller bills, better for eating O'ahu's smaller fruits. On O'ahu you can now watch mysterious flocks of numerous species take off together in search of fruit. This behaviour is also seen in the Amazon, but in O'ahu the flocks are made up of birds from all around the planet, from the Himalayas to South America.\nFor the profoundly and irreversibly changed environments we see in O'ahu, the most intuitive name might have come not from a scientist at all but from Higgs' young daughter: she has dubbed them \"freakosystems\", he says. Since these strange places began to gain recognition in the late 1990s, the biggest question has been what environmentalists should do about them.\nInvasive species\nDeliberately and accidentally, humans have introduced countless species of animals, plants and other organisms to non-native biomes. While most new additions are innocuous, more than 37,000 species have been found to harm native species, habitats and ecosystems, causing them to be labelled invasive, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).\nGlobally, invasive non-native species are one of the top five drivers of global biodiversity loss, according to IPBES, contributing to 60% of global extinctions and causing damages worth $423bn (\u00a3323bn) per year.\nRestoration ecologists have been on the frontlines of answering this question, says Higgs. Traditionally, these scientists have aimed to recover degraded landscapes towards some reference point \u2013 often, in the Americas, this was set about the time that European colonies began arising in the Americas. The idea was to restore ecosystems to a pre-disturbance or pre-human state.\nBut in many places \u2013 including islands like Hawaii and New Zealand, where so many species of plants and animals have gone extinct and non-native species have spread so far \u2013 turning back the clock was clearly impossible. This idea of \"practical unrestorability\" became the hallmark of what a novel ecosystem is, says Higgs.\u00a0\nFaced with these challenges, ecologists began to question how useful it would be to follow traditional conservation strategies, such as eradicating non-native \"invasive\" species \u2013 typically defined as an introduced species that harms its new environment. But it is not always easy, in much-changed environments, to identify which species these are.\nTake, for example, the packs of feral donkeys or \"burros\" that roam the American South and Australia, the descendants of working animals once used widely in mines and mills that were turned loose decades ago. In places where feral donkeys and horses have competed with native herbivores and overgrazed plants, some local governments have resorted to large-scale culls.\nBut research has shown that donkeys also dig water holes \u2013 known as wells or \"ass holes\" \u2013 in many cases providing the only water source in drylands where temperatures can reach almost 50C (122F). In the Sonoran Desert, which spans the US and Northern Mexico, these holes support more than 50 other species, including birds and large native mammals such as mule deer. Mountain lions have even been observed eating donkeys.\u00a0\nMeanwhile in Australia, introduced megafauna \u2013 from feral horses and donkeys to camels and water buffalo \u2013 often make drylands more functionally similar to the ancient past, when 200kg (440lb) giant wombats dug holes in the country's interior, Svenning's research has shown.\nYet for nature lovers brought up to value pristine environments, and having long ago learned of the destruction wrought by invasive black rats or cane toads, novel ecosystems challenge many of the fundamental values that have driven conservation for decades. In 2011, when the writer Emma Marris published the influential book Rambunctious Garden, which explored novel ecosystems, critics responded that she was giving permission to \"trash nature\". Like Marris, many urban communities have come to love novel environments that have arisen in their local neighbourhoods. Mount Sutro, for example, a forest of non-native eucalyptus, has become a much-loved park in San Francisco, says Higgs.\nAs climate change and nature-loss continue, ecologists are adapting their language to acknowledge that many ecosystems have \"novel elements\" or degrees of \"ecological novelty\". A new map published by researchers in March 2025, tracked how ecosystems across the planet were being changed by climate change, the loss of key animals and native plants being replaced by invasive species. Matthew Kerr, a researcher in Svenning's lab at Aarhus University who made the map, says he found that novel habitats are now truly global, with more than half of the earth's land highly changed: \"This extended out to protected areas,\" he says, including nature parks and marine reserves.\nResponding to these findings, ecologist Anna Walentowitz at the University of Bayreuth in Germany wrote that ecological novelty is now the \"new normal\" for our planet, forcing us to question how we protect nature today.\nO'ahu, at least, is teaching us important lessons that can help protect other environments not yet so degraded, including other islands where native ecosystems remain healthier, says Vizentin-Bugoni. Research has spotlighted certain species that set alarm bells ringing, as they are most likely to do harm to surrounding ecosystems.\n\"For the plants, the ones that are most likely to be a problem are the ones that fruit for a long period and also have small seeds,\" he says. Both these characteristics increase the chance of being eaten by birds and spread around rapidly.\nOn O'ahu itself, research into novel ecosystems is guiding more unconventional conservation strategies. Most land managers are aiming to safeguard the 87% of native plants threatened with extinction by meticulously removing invasive plant species from \"these tiny restoration sites\", explains Tarwater. Although this allows native plants to grow without competition, these denuded areas quickly become bird-free zones, she says. \"There's not enough fruit in those areas to attract them there, which isn't good [for native plants], if those are the only things left to disperse their fruits.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The ancient forest that supports Venice\n\u2022 Hawaii's ancient land management system\n\u2022\u00a0The race to protect Pacific whales\nTo get the birds to spread native plants around, the team in O'ahu instead try to trick them. They use speakers to play the calls of \"birds that we know are really good seed dispersers\" to lure them to restoration sites where native plants remained, Tarwater says. \"Once they're there, they're like: 'Oh, hey, look at that fruit!' and they'll eat it.\" (Read about how scientists coax back species with sound in other parts of the world too.)\nSuch strategies work with non-native birds to help conserve the tiny patches of remaining native plants \u2013 although many roles, such as the moa-nalos' dispersal of large seeds, are still not filled, as no non-native species are big enough.\nIt all makes unravelling what to do with these novel habitats difficult. \"It's complex and depends on the goals of restoration,\" says Tarwater. A conservationist focusing on native plants may eradicate as many non-native competitors as possible, she says. \"But if you're interested in conserving a native snail or some of these other species, that [non-native plant] might be the habitat that they currently rely upon.\"\nWhile novel ecosystems remain controversial, on O'ahu, conservationists and land managers have become less black-and-white about native and non-native species, says Tarwater.\n\"We know that the challenges of the novel ecosystems are going to remain, and likely increase. We know that it's not as simple as them being good or bad.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Jonny Bairstow and James Anderson will not face off this season after Yorkshire were promoted and Lancashire relegated\nThe 2025 County Championship begins on Friday - and, remarkably for early April, the weather is set to be glorious.\nBut which county sides will sparkle this season and whose outlook is gloomy?\nThe BBC's local radio county cricket commentators and online journalists - who will be providing ball-by-ball radio and live text commentary throughout the season on the BBC Sport website and app - take a look at each club's prospects... \nCounty Championship preview: Who can stop Surrey?\nJennings 'job' is to win Lancashire silverware\nBears must spread wickets around - Hannon-Dalby\n2024 season - Eighth in Division Two\nDave Fletcher - BBC Radio Derby\nGiven Derbyshire finished bottom of Division Two in 2024, things can surely only improve. \nThey did at least win a game last year, unlike 2023, but it was another bitterly disappointing watch for the County Ground faithful.\nThey were not helped by an opening round washout against Gloucestershire last season which meant they were playing catch-up from the off.\nThat appears unlikely to be repeated so a quick start \u2013 against the same opposition - is essential.\nThey have added Australian opening batter Caleb Jewell to the squad and he will be joined by returning Kiwi quick bowler Blair Tickner, whose spell last season was all too brief.\nThere's a new captain at the helm, too, although it is a familiar figure. Wayne Madsen, who led the side to promotion in 2012, takes over from David Lloyd after his solitary campaign leading the side.\nTickner's return and the presence of experienced bowlers such as Zak Chappell and Pat Brown can only benefit newcomer Harry Moore.\nAlready in the England system, the much talked-about 17-year-old will be starting his first full season in the senior side having already shown he can more than hold his own at that level.\nWinter signings Jack Morley and Martin Andersson will be better for having been with the group last season.\nThe big challenge remains the ability to take 20 wickets a match, something Mickey Arthur's side have to do if they are to repeat the relative riches of his first season in charge in 2022.\nMatthew Potts' Durham appearances this season may be limited by England call-ups\n2024 season - Fifth in Division One\nMartin Emmerson - BBC Radio Newcastle\nDurham finished fifth on their return to Division One last season and in general more than held their own. They might be able to improve on that this year. We'll see.\nThey weren't helped by the loss of their entire opening game - at home to Hampshire in April \u2013 but there was only really Surrey who turned them over.\nThat was towards the end of the season and the week Surrey retained their title - and they beat a weakened Durham side struggling with injuries.\nFrom a batting point of view they have added Emilio Gay to the ranks. He joined towards the end of last season from Northants, while Will Rhodes chose to leave Warwickshire after seven seasons, despite the offer of a new contract. \nThey will help boost a line-up which includes the leading batter in Division One last season, in South African David Bedingham. He scored 1,331 runs, including a club-record 279 against Lancashire in September. He also became the first Durham batter to score centuries in four consecutive innings.\nOpener Michael Jones has left for Lancashire. His outings last season were limited due to selection choices, so he took the decision to head back home.\nBowling is the key issue. They've had no luck with overseas players in recent seasons. Scott Boland lasted part of one game before returning home to Australia in April. Neil Wagner managed just one game too. Veteran Peter Siddle came in and did well in his four games, while West Indian Chemar Holder didn't particularly pull up any trees in his three matches. Keeping their bowlers fit will be key.\nIt remains to be seen how much of a good signing Sam Conners will be. The bowler has joined from Derbyshire. While he boasted 50 championship wickets in 2022, he took 27 the following year, but only played five Championship matches last season. Australian seamer Brendan Doggett will play County Championship matches in April and May. The 30-year-old seamer plays for South Australia and has 157 first-class wickets to his name.\nThen there's the likes of ever-dependable all-rounder Ben Raine. Matthew Potts is important to the team too, when England allow him to be available. Seventeen-year-old James Minto looks a good prospect and fellow bowler Daniel Hogg will be looking to push on after a career-best 7-66 against Notts in Chester-le-Street.\n2024 season - Fourth in Division One\nVictoria Polley - BBC Radio Essex\nThere's been change at the top for Essex over the winter with Chris Silverwood returning to the club as director of cricket. \nEssex won successive titles (Div 2 & 1) in his previous tenure as head coach, including a first County Championship win in 25 years, before England came calling. \nWith his assistant Anthony McGrath taking over from then up until last season, it will hopefully be a more seamless transition than these changes can sometimes be.\nDean Elgar was vital at the top of the order last season but who will open alongside him is the big question? Do Essex give a chance to teenager Charlie Allison who has impressed in the white-ball formats? They have other options in the likes of Nick Browne or Robin Das, or even bumping Paul Walter or Michael Pepper up higher.\nJordan Cox was also key with the bat last season but has had a torrid winter, denied an England Test debut by a thumb injury. International opportunities could affect his availability.\nAn international call-up still eludes bowler Sam Cook but England's loss is very much Essex's gain - alongside Jamie Porter and Simon Harmer, it's a potent bowling attack.\nIt would've been strengthened with the signing of Shardul Thakur but his late involvement in the IPL has ruled him out of a move to Chelmsford, and Essex continue to hunt for a replacement.\nIt's been six years since Essex last won a County Championship title and they continue to punch above their weight in competing at the top end of the table. \nThey might not have the squad size and budgets of other counties but there's still plenty of talent and experience among the Essex ranks. Can Silverwood add more silverware to his Essex collection on his Chelmsford return?\n2024 season - Sixth in Division Two\nNick Webb - BBC Radio Wales Sport\nThe arrival of Richard Dawson as head coach after the unexpected departure of Grant Bradburn is the main change at Sophia Gardens, with the squad looking remarkably similar to last season. \nThe second One-Day Cup triumph in four years put a gloss on an otherwise disappointing 2024 campaign as Glamorgan showed only marginal improvement in the T20 Blast and fell away in the latter stages of the Championship promotion race.\nKey factors in the Championship will be finding a consistent opening partnership to go with the settled top order of Sam Northeast, Kiran Carlson, Colin Ingram and Chris Cooke, as well as getting the most out of a seam attack lacking raw pace. \nEddie Byrom, unlucky with injury in several seasons, is the most likely starter up top but his partner could be one of four or five candidates. \nSri Lankan Asitha Fernando is likely to partner Timm van der Gugten with the new ball in the opening stages of the season, while it will be interesting to see if on-loan England off-spinner Shoaib Bashir makes an impact as cover for Mason Crane early on when pitches usually don't help the twirlers.\nThere is little doubt that young all-rounder Ben Kellaway will become a regular in all formats sooner or later, but being thrown in as a red-ball opener was maybe a step too far. \nHis ambidextrous spin is a unique selling point added to some hard hitting in the middle order. \nOverall the county needs to manage a fair degree of change in the medium term, with a fair few of their stalwarts well past the 30 mark.\nJames Bracey played two Test matches for England in 2021\n2024 season - Seventh in Division Two\nEd Seabourne - BBC Radio Bristol\nGloucestershire approach the 2025 season with a renewed sense of ambition, keen to ensure this campaign isn't looked back on as the previous September's hangover.\nWhilst 2024 will always be remembered for the remarkable run to the county's first T20 Blast trophy, head coach Mark Alleyne made no bones about the fact he was disappointed to have ended so far behind the promotion spots in the County Championship.\nDespite the final positioning, significant strides forward were made on the batting side. \nWicketkeeper James Bracey is following a stellar year that saw him achieve the rare double of 1,000 runs and 50 dismissals, and there is increasing competition for spots in the top order.\nThe signing of Australian all-rounder Cameron Green for five matches will only add to that, and there is even hope he will be allowed to bowl towards the end of his stay.\nThe club possesses a group of promising young pace bowlers, including recent England Lions call-ups Zaman Akhter and Ajeet Singh Dale, and newly appointed Championship skipper Cameron Bancroft has spoken of his excitement in working with them.\nThe departure of Zafar Gohar, however, means the squad is without a proven red-ball spinner, and, especially with the dry spring, the serious question will be whether there is enough variety in the attack in its current form to force wins on a consistent basis.\n2024 season - Second in Division One\nKevan James - BBC Radio Solent\nTrying to improve on their second-place finish in the Championship last season may depend on a dip in form from Surrey, but also how Hampshire cope without being able to call upon two very influential players.\nJames Vince, the captain and leader of the batting line-up, has decided red-ball cricket is no longer for him. Mo Abbas, taker of 180 wickets over the past four seasons, has been moved on.\nVeteran Mark Stoneman looks a shrewd signing to partially or maybe fully offset the hole left by Vince.\nOn the bowling front, exciting prospects Sonny Baker and John Turner will be given more responsibility. They will certainly add pace.\nA disappointing T20 campaign will hopefully be turned around by the addition of two hard-hitting South Africans in Lhaun-dre Pretorius and Dewald Brevis.\nPretorius, 19, was the top run scorer in the recent SA20 competition, while Brevis finished the tournament with the top strike rate of 180.\nBy all accounts Pretorius has the potential to be world class very quickly.\n2024 season - 10th in Division One (relegated)\nMatt Cole - BBC Radio Kent\nThe summer of 2024 was a pretty dismal affair for both club and supporters. In the Championship they found themselves outgunned, particularly in the bowling department, and never really looked like they were escaping the drop from Division One they'd so narrowly avoided the year before.\nPerhaps more worrying was the T20 Blast campaign. The Spitfires - perennial contenders for the knockout stages - won just four of 14 games and finished bottom of the South Group. The One-Day Cup didn't add much encouragement for supporters desperate for something to hope for.\nKent come into the new season though with Adam Hollioake replacing Matt Walker as head coach. It's the former Surrey and England all-rounder's first time in the role for a county side and players and supporters alike have received the appointment with some excitement.\nThe playing ranks have been bolstered by new signings \u2013 Chris Benjamin moving from Warwickshire hoping to reinvigorate his career as an all-formats batter.\nKent's bowling was the major cause for concern last season, both injuries and lack of form making them look toothless at times. A double signing of seamers just before the start of the campaign is looking to address that \u2013 recent Test debutant for Pakistan, Kashif Ali, and experienced South African pace man Keith Dudgeon are in place for the first part of the campaign.\nThey've also added Corey Flintoff \u2013 son of Andrew, brother of Rocky \u2013 to the squad, the fast-bowling all-rounder joining on a rookie contract.\nWith Aussie bowlers Wes Agar and Tom Rogers returning for the T20 Blast, it appears more of an evolution than a revolution at Canterbury this summer.\nBut if Hollioake can get the best out of the squad they could be among the front-runners for promotion back to the top division of the Championship and a return to upsetting the big budget sides in the Blast.\nRocky Flintoff played four County Championship matches for Lancashire last season\n2024 season - Ninth in Division One (relegated)\nScott Read - BBC Radio Lancashire\nSince winning the County Championship title in 2011, Lancashire have been relegated four times. \nOn the previous three occasions they've won promotion straight back to Division One. \nThey'll be expected to continue that trend this season and will start as firm favourites. \nEven without James Anderson for the first month, the Red Rose have a healthy blend of senior professionals and young players making their way in the game. \nThe overseas signings of Marcus Harris and Anderson Phillip look like excellent business. \nPhillip, for the first 11 games, will provide some extra pace, Harris for the entire season to open the batting. \nThe arrival of the Australian opener will also allow Luke Wells to bat at six giving Lancashire some much-needed experience in the middle order. \nLancashire have some fine young players who endured a tough season for the club last year. A year on from that, the likes of Matty Hurst, George Balderson and George Bell should prosper. \nFor Hurst, almost 700 runs at an average of 32 in his debut season for a relegated team was an impressive return. \nThere will also be plenty of opportunities for Tom Aspinwall and Rocky Flintoff, who does not turn 17 until next week.\nAnderson not ruling out playing for three more years\nBancroft's winning experience 'boosts' Gloucestershire\nBairstow named new Yorkshire red-ball captain  \n2024 season - Fifth in Division Two\nRichard Rae - BBC Radio Leicester\nThe return of Peter Handscomb, who made 894 runs in 14 Championship innings at an average of 74.5 last season, the signing of Shan Masood from June onwards, the presence at the top of the order of the talented Rishi Patel and the fact most of the bowlers have legitimate claims to be described as all-rounders, should mean Leicestershire are not short of runs this season. \nNor, if the likes of Patel, Sol Budinger, Rehan Ahmed and Louis Kimber find form, will they score those runs slowly.\nThe big question is whether they have the firepower to bowl teams out twice. \nLast season, Leicestershire took the lowest number of wickets (139) in Division Two by some distance, and some supporters have argued the signing of New Zealand-born Netherlands international Logan van Beek adds to their ranks of bowling all-rounders rather than gives the Foxes the cutting edge they need to break games open.\nTall young left-arm prospect Josh Hull has that potential, but has spent the close season struggling with injury.\nThere is hope in the pre-season performances of the likes of veteran Chris Wright and the promising Tom Scriven, while Ben Green's return from Somerset for the first seven Championship matches adds depth.\n2024 season - Third in Division Two\nKevin Hand - BBC Radio London\nThe signing of New Zealand batter Kane Williamson is something of a coup for a county that are operating under strict financial restrictions imposed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).\nThe rearrangement of the budget for wage allocation within the squad meant a number of players were released last season, including the tough decision to let the popular former England opener Mark Stoneman go.\nWith the evergreen opener Sam Robson aging well and Leus de Plooy a gun player in all formats, Middlesex have a top order to be feared -  probably for the first time since Robson, Nick Gubbins and Nick Compton formed a top three that played a huge part in the 2016 Championship winning side.\nThe mark of the Middlesex team under former director of cricket Angus Fraser, who took charge in 2009, was the regular ability to blast through teams with the ball.\nIn the absence of the retired Tim Murtagh, Middlesex struggled to rattle through the wickets last year and captain Toby Roland-Jones bore a heavy burden on that front. \nIt was refreshing to see the right-armer clear of injury for the season and his team will desperately need that once more if they are to be promoted.\nThe former England international will have his workload eased this year by the arrival of South African seamer Dane Paterson, another crucial addition to the squad that could make a significant difference to a side that looked on course for promotion for most of last season.\nThe signings of Williamson and Paterson to bolster the Championship side are a clear indication that Middlesex want success to return in the shape of promotion this year.\nDarren Lehmann was Australia head coach between 2013 and 2018\n2024 season - Fourth in Division Two\nAndrew Radd - BBC Radio Northamptonshire\nThe arrival of Australian Darren Lehmann as head coach at Wantage Road has triggered a wave of pre-season positivity in a squad left feeling somewhat bruised by the events of the past couple of years.\nAfter being relegated from Division One in 2023 they failed to register a Division Two win in 2024 until September, by which time Lehmann's predecessor John Sadler had lost his job following defeat in the T20 Blast quarter-finals.\nWith opener Emilio Gay and fast bowler Jack White both heading north, to Durham and Yorkshire respectively, there will be opportunities for others to shine. \nYoung batters Krish Patel (who opened his account with five boundaries on first-class debut at Headingley last September) and Aadi Sharma have much to offer, while the seam attack has been bolstered by the signings of Dom Leech, left-armer Liam Guthrie and \u2013 for the four Championship fixtures in May \u2013 Harry Conway from South Australia. \nGeorge Scrimshaw and the hugely promising Raphy Weatherall suffered injuries last season and will be eager to re-establish themselves.\nMuch will depend \u2013 certainly in four-day cricket - on the tried-and-trusted trio of Luke Procter, Ben Sanderson and Rob Keogh. \nIndian leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal had a major impact towards the end of 2024 and returns this year for a longer second-half stint.\nOther key figures across all formats will be Saif Zaib, who \u2013 to the relief of supporters \u2013 agreed a contract extension until at least the end of 2027, plus a couple of upwardly-trending all-rounders in Justin Broad, son of former tennis star Neil and named the county's Media Player of the Year last season, and Gus Miller.\n2024 season - Eighth in Division One\nDave Bracegirdle - BBC Radio Nottinghamshire\nYazz knew what she was on about, didn't she? 'The Only Way Is Up' was not only a catchy hit single but is also a good place to approach Nottinghamshire's hopes for 2025.\nHead coach Peter Moores has emphasised that it's important to learn from what went wrong last year, as well as draw a line underneath it. \nAs a brief reminder, Notts narrowly avoided relegation from Division One of the County Championship, finished bottom of their group in the T20 Blast and barely raised a pulse in the One-Day Cup.\nSo what might be different this time around?\nThe only domestic signing sees Conor McKerr join from Surrey but with Josh Tongue now fully fit, those two bolster a fast-bowling unit that promises untold riches. \nIf Notts can keep Olly Stone healthy, alongside overseas recruits in Australia's Fergus O'Neill and Pakistan's Mohammad Abbas, throw in the evergreen Brett Hutton and the raw pace of Rob Lord, then their resources seem well stocked.\nTeenagers Farhan Ahmed and Freddie McCann both made their county debuts towards the back end of last season and already carry the weight of expectation.\nThe prodigious spinning fingers of 17-year old Ahmed have already marked him out as a generational talent, while 19-year-old team-mate McCann hit two centuries in just seven innings.\nSome astute observers are already wondering if Kyle Verreynne is the best wicketkeeper-batter in the world right now. The county fought off a lot of competition to secure the services of the South African for the whole campaign.\nThat just leaves the top order. While Trent Bridge members may not see too much of England's Ben Duckett once again, there are guaranteed runs from skipper Haseeb Hameed and the gifted Joe Clarke, both as good as any in the county game.\nShoaib Bashir will join Glamorgan on loan for the first three County Championship games of the season\n2024 season - Third in Division One\nAnthony Gibson - BBC Radio Somerset\nWith a strong and settled squad of players shrewdly captained by Lewis Gregory, and terrific team spirit, Somerset go into the new season with every hope of marking the club's 150th anniversary with a first County Championship.\nInjuries permitting, Matt Henry will be back to lead a powerful seam attack, balanced by the spin of Jack Leach, rising star Archie Vaughan and, once he returns from a loan spell at Glamorgan or his England duties are over, Shoaib Bashir. \nAmong the batters, the only real question is who will partner Vaughan at the top of the order, Sean Dickson being the most likely answer. \nThe three Toms - Lammonby, Abell and Banton - will once again make up the engine room of the batting, with James Rew ready to reinforce his reputation as one of the most promising wicketkeeper-batters in the country.\nUnlike the infinitely talented Will Smeed, who is happily returning to the red-ball fold, Tom Kohler-Cadmore will focus on the white ball and the Blast, so that the firepower which has seen Somerset reach Finals Day in each of the past three seasons remains very much intact.\nFor Somerset's team of youngsters to have reached the One-Day Cup Final last year was a surprise, but they can by no means be discounted. James Rew's younger brother, Thomas, will surely come into that side, and what a prospect he is.\nLast year was a case of so near and yet so far - in contention for all three trophies, ending up with none. \nThe team will have learned from that, and if they can graft staying power onto all their other strengths, this could, at last, be Somerset's season.\nTom Lawes is one of a number of exciting all-rounders at Surrey\n2024 season - First in Division One (champions)\nMark Church - BBC Radio London\nThere is no reason Surrey cannot win a fourth Championship title on the spin this summer. \nThey obviously know how to put all the parts together over the course of a season and the squad is much the same. \nThe addition of Matt Fisher is exciting and there will be international call-ups. But the spine of the side is solid and experienced and if someone is missing, the gap gets filled without anybody noticing.\nOne to keep an eye on is Tom Lawes. He has all the talent in the world with both bat and ball, and if he produces consistently, it would not be a surprise if he were representing England soon. He will be aiming for a permanent spot in the Championship XI but as always there is healthy competition for places.\nThere is one certainty. In terms of the Championship, Surrey will want to be better than last season. \nThey are always looking to improve, and they know everybody else is trying to catch them. \nThey will be tested, especially by the likes of Essex and Hampshire but they know how to win the Championship, and they still have all the players that have managed that in the past three years. It is a good recipe to have.\n2024 season - First in Division Two (promoted)\nAdrian Harms - BBC Radio Sussex\nThere's much excitement and anticipation on the south coast, as Sussex return to Division One after almost a decade in Division Two.\nDuring that period they have never mounted a serious promotion bid, and it's taken change at the top, and the subsequent appointment of Paul Farbrace to galvanise the club.\nFarbrace has introduced a winning mentality that had been sadly lacking, and  crucially supplemented a talented group of younger players with, in his words, \"knarled old pros\" who know how to win, and battle when the going gets tough.\nHowever, this is essentially a young Sussex side most with no experience of first division cricket, and therefore the experience of Australian Daniel Hughes, skipper John Simpson and Ollie Robinson will be crucial particularly during the opening weeks of the season.\nBut don't think Sussex will be a soft touch and are back in Division One for the ride.\nProvided the top order can score enough runs, they have a match-winning spinner in Jack Carson and are especially difficult to beat at Hove, where they haven't lost since Farbrace took the helm.\nSussex have taken nine long years to return to Division One, and the feeling around the club is that's where they want to stay.\nJacob Bethell's game time at Edgbaston is likely to be limited this season\n2024 season - Seventh in Division One\nMike Taylor - BBC Radio WM\nA confusing winter followed a confusing summer. \nOften in 2024 it seemed something was going to happen for Warwickshire - they were front-runners in both white-ball tournaments, and frequently built strong early positions in Championship games. \nAnd then nothing happened. No white-ball final, only one four-day win. \nSeveral leading players had outstanding individual seasons - runs for the captain Alex Davies, wickets for Olly Hannon-Dalby, both for Ed Barnard, England calls for Jacob Bethell and Dan Mousley - but the total, somehow, came to less than the sum of the parts. \nA detailed high-performance review had seemed, from the outside, to have also come to no significant conclusion, the exit of performance director Gavin Larsen being unrelated, until head coach Mark Robinson suddenly left seven weeks ago.\nNow, there is both change and continuity. Ian Westwood, a known and trusted leader, is promoted to replace Robinson. \nThe patient, determined approach he showed as an opening bat and captain in testing circumstances should serve him well. \nA collection of overseas players also mixes the familiar and the new. Hasan Ali is already popular at Edgbaston, while Beau Webster has the qualities that should see him thrive mid-summer. \nHopefully all will avoid the bad luck with injuries that has so weighed Warwickshire down in recent years, and has hit Tom Latham before he even arrives.\nEdgbaston is always a busy place, but had become grumpy in the stands by last September, with so much promise unfulfilled. \nHaving seemed at times to be pushing on all fronts at once, they had gone nowhere. The club has a lot of moving parts but no shortage of talent. \nIf Davies and Westwood can steer the team in a clear direction, and maintain a strong challenge at least in one competition, it will be a year of progress.\n2024 season - Sixth in Division One\nGed Scott - BBC Sport online's Pears reporter\nA long, hard, emotional season eventually blossomed into some happiness for Worcestershire in 2024.\nIn between all the trauma of not being able to play their first home game at flood-hit Worcester until 25 May then came the devastating loss of one of their players, Josh Baker, at the tragically early age of just 20.\nBut the spirit the Pears showed in adversity could only be admired.\nThey gave a string of youngsters their chance in an unexpectedly progressive One-Day Cup campaign \u2013 and, either side of the mid-summer County Championship break, they produced three huge red-ball victories on the trot.\nThat not only helped them stay in the top flight, it was enough to catapult them up to sixth - their highest finish since two-division cricket began in 2000. Finishing above both neighbours Warwickshire and also Nottinghamshire, where four of their former players are now based, was a source of particular pride and pleasure.\nBuilding on that and again keeping their place in an always competitive division is now the challenge - although they will have to do so without the retired Joe Leach, as well as Kiwi Nathan Smith, who did well over the first half of last summer but then opted to join champions Surrey.\nBut they have another New Zealand fast bowler Jacob Duffy arriving from the second game onwards. They have three more incomers in Ben Allison from Essex, Nottinghamshire spinner Fateh Singh and Australian seamer Ben Dwarshuis for the T20 Blast.\nThey also still have that same marvellous team spirit to fall back on \u2013 and a real, genuine hunger.\nLong-term doubts remain over their future at New Road - but, in the short term, prospects at Worcester are brighter than people might think.\nJonny Bairstow will captain Yorkshire in the County Championship this season\n2024 season - Second in Division Two (promoted)\nJonathan Doidge - BBC Radio Leeds\nIt is likely to be a very interesting 2025 for Yorkshire.\nWith financial concerns now, apparently, assuaged at the very moment the team has returned to the top flight of the Championship, plus a new coaching staff and new red ball and T20 captains, there should rightly be an air of optimism.\nJonny Bairstow follows in his late father David's footsteps to steer the Championship challenge. He'd love to have a title as captain on his CV but aside from captaincy, his presence alone with the bat will be huge.\nSimilarly, Dawid Malan is going to be back playing more red-ball cricket, a major plus. Add to that potent opening pair of Adam Lyth and Finlay Bean, plus James Wharton, whose career began to blossom last year in particular, and more established batters like George Hill and that end of the team should be capable of setting up games.\nAs we know, that's no good without the ability to take 20 wickets and in that department there's plenty of encouragement. \nThe outstanding Ben Coad will again lead the line. Overseas input comes from, in particular, New Zealand's Ben Sears plus Will Sutherland (two matches) and Jordan Buckingham (four) also chipping in, while there's also George Hill, Jordan Thompson, off-season recruit Jack White, plus Matt Revis and Matt Milnes, who are on the road back from injury.\nDom Bess looks likely to be this coach's first pick among the spinners, though Dan Moriarty and Jafer Chohan will want a say in that.\nWith Bairstow donning the wicketkeeping gloves, Jonathan Tattersall and Harry Duke are going to have to wait for further opportunities, unless required as batters. You'd certainly have to feel for Tattersall after he led the team back up last season - but this is professional sport.\nWith One-Day Cup centurion Will Luxton awaiting another opportunity, there'll be upward pressure with the bat and I'd be backing Ben Cliff to put some serious pressure on the more senior bowlers in the squad. He could really take his own game to the next level as the season unfolds.\nIn summary, there's optimism that head coach Anthony McGrath can take the team to places it hasn't been for quite some time.",

        "summary": "A double signing of seamers just before the start of the campaign is looking to address that \u2013 recent Test debutant for Pakistan, Kashif Ali, and experienced South African pace man Keith Dudgeon are in place for the first part of the campaign.They've also added Corey Flintoff \u2013 son of Andrew, brother of Rocky \u2013 to the squad, the fast-bowling all-rounder joining on a rookie contract.With Aussie bowlers Wes Agar and Tom Rogers returning for the T20 Blast, it appears more of an evolution than a revolution at Canterbury this summer.But if Hollioake can get the best out of the squad they could be among the front-runners for promotion back to the top division of the Championship and a return to upsetting the big budget sides in the Blast.Lancashire - 'Red Rose favourites for promotion'Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Rocky Flintoff played four County Championship matches for Lancashire last season2024 season - Ninth in Division One (relegated)Scott Read - BBC Radio LancashireSince winning the County Championship title in 2011, Lancashire have been relegated four times. Last season, Leicestershire took the lowest number of wickets (139) in Division Two by some distance, and some supporters have argued the signing of New Zealand-born Netherlands international Logan van Beek adds to their ranks of bowling all-rounders rather than gives the Foxes the cutting edge they need to break games open.Tall young left-arm prospect Josh Hull has that potential, but has spent the close season struggling with injury.There is hope in the pre-season performances of the likes of veteran Chris Wright and the promising Tom Scriven, while Ben Green's return from Somerset for the first seven Championship matches adds depth.Middlesex - 'Williamson signing a coup'2024 season - Third in Division TwoKevin Hand - BBC Radio LondonThe signing of New Zealand batter Kane Williamson is something of a coup for a county that are operating under strict financial restrictions imposed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).The rearrangement of the budget for wage allocation within the squad meant a number of players were released last season, including the tough decision to let the popular former England opener Mark Stoneman go.With the evergreen opener Sam Robson aging well and Leus de Plooy a gun player in all formats, Middlesex have a top order to be feared -  probably for the first time since Robson, Nick Gubbins and Nick Compton formed a top three that played a huge part in the 2016 Championship winning side.The mark of the Middlesex team under former director of cricket Angus Fraser, who took charge in 2009, was the regular ability to blast through teams with the ball.In the absence of the retired Tim Murtagh, Middlesex struggled to rattle through the wickets last year and captain Toby Roland-Jones bore a heavy burden on that front. It is a good recipe to have.Sussex - 'Experienced players will be crucial'2024 season - First in Division Two (promoted)Adrian Harms - BBC Radio SussexThere's much excitement and anticipation on the south coast, as Sussex return to Division One after almost a decade in Division Two.During that period they have never mounted a serious promotion bid, and it's taken change at the top, and the subsequent appointment of Paul Farbrace to galvanise the club.Farbrace has introduced a winning mentality that had been sadly lacking, and  crucially supplemented a talented group of younger players with, in his words, \"knarled old pros\" who know how to win, and battle when the going gets tough.However, this is essentially a young Sussex side most with no experience of first division cricket, and therefore the experience of Australian Daniel Hughes, skipper John Simpson and Ollie Robinson will be crucial particularly during the opening weeks of the season.But don't think Sussex will be a soft touch and are back in Division One for the ride.Provided the top order can score enough runs, they have a match-winning spinner in Jack Carson and are especially difficult to beat at Hove, where they haven't lost since Farbrace took the helm.Sussex have taken nine long years to return to Division One, and the feeling around the club is that's where they want to stay.Warwickshire - 'Bears have no shortage of talent'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jacob Bethell's game time at Edgbaston is likely to be limited this season2024 season - Seventh in Division OneMike Taylor - BBC Radio WMA confusing winter followed a confusing summer. Wayne Madsen, who led the side to promotion in 2012, takes over from David Lloyd after his solitary campaign leading the side.Tickner's return and the presence of experienced bowlers such as Zak Chappell and Pat Brown can only benefit newcomer Harry Moore.Already in the England system, the much talked-about 17-year-old will be starting his first full season in the senior side having already shown he can more than hold his own at that level.Winter signings Jack Morley and Martin Andersson will be better for having been with the group last season.The big challenge remains the ability to take 20 wickets a match, something Mickey Arthur's side have to do if they are to repeat the relative riches of his first season in charge in 2022.Durham - 'Bowling the key issue'Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Matthew Potts' Durham appearances this season may be limited by England call-ups2024 season - Fifth in Division OneMartin Emmerson - BBC Radio NewcastleDurham finished fifth on their return to Division One last season and in general more than held their own. It was refreshing to see the right-armer clear of injury for the season and his team will desperately need that once more if they are to be promoted.The former England international will have his workload eased this year by the arrival of South African seamer Dane Paterson, another crucial addition to the squad that could make a significant difference to a side that looked on course for promotion for most of last season.The signings of Williamson and Paterson to bolster the Championship side are a clear indication that Middlesex want success to return in the shape of promotion this year.Northamptonshire - 'Lehmann arrival brings positivity'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Darren Lehmann was Australia head coach between 2013 and 20182024 season - Fourth in Division TwoAndrew Radd - BBC Radio NorthamptonshireThe arrival of Australian Darren Lehmann as head coach at Wantage Road has triggered a wave of pre-season positivity in a squad left feeling somewhat bruised by the events of the past couple of years.After being relegated from Division One in 2023 they failed to register a Division Two win in 2024 until September, by which time Lehmann's predecessor John Sadler had lost his job following defeat in the T20 Blast quarter-finals.With opener Emilio Gay and fast bowler Jack White both heading north, to Durham and Yorkshire respectively, there will be opportunities for others to shine.",

        "article_text": "Richard Burton was a global icon - famed for his powerful, baritone voice and passionate yet tumultuous relationship with fellow megastar Elizabeth Taylor.\nBut until now, few had ever heard of Philip Burton.\nPhilip was Richard's school teacher who spotted his potential, became his legal guardian, lent him his name and helped propel him to international stardom.\n\"It was a friendship built for the ages, an unlikely friendship,\" said Ed Talfan, a producer on new biopic Mr Burton, which was released in UK cinemas on Friday.\nThe film tells the story of Richard's difficult early life in Port Talbot, south Wales.\nPhilip, played by Toby Jones, is portrayed as a serious and cultured man who, alongside teaching English, writes and produces plays.\nScrappy young schoolboy Richard, played by Harry Lawtey, has ambitions to become an actor, so Philip teaches him to stand up straight and transforms his speaking voice by getting him to round his vowels, pronounce his consonants and project.\nBut in fact the two men's backgrounds were more similar than their demeanours ever suggested - and his role in Richard's life would prove to be transformative.\nPhilip grew up 30 miles (48km) from Richard in Mountain Ash, Rhondda Cynon Taf.\n\"Philip had a rather tragic and lonely childhood,\" said historian and Philip's biographer Prof Angela John, who acted as an informal consultant on the film.\n\"His father was killed in a pit accident when Philip was only 14... he wasn't that close to his mother and he'd been very close to his father.\"\nPhilip was an avid reader and theatre lover who won a scholarship to Cardiff University to read Maths when he was only 16. \n\"In a way he forged a whole new persona,\" said Angela.\n\"He had sort of ironed out his Welsh accent because unfortunately in those days, if you wanted to get on and if you wanted to be taken seriously in England... you had to sadly get rid of your accent.\"\nRichard, born Richard Jenkins in 1925, was twenty years Philip's junior.\nHe would have been one of 13 children, but two died in infancy.\nWhen Richard was two years old, his mother died from septicaemia after giving birth to a younger brother. \n\"He was a working-class young man growing up in, I think it's fair to say, abject poverty,\" said Ed.\nRichard ended up living with his sister, her husband who was a miner, and their two young daughters. \n\"The outlook for him was really, really tough. If you're a betting person, you'd have just said, 'well he's going to end up down the mines or at the steelworks',\" he said. \nAngela, who has written Behind the Scenes: The Dramatic Lives of Philip Burton, said Richard's family was \"large\" and \"caring\".\n\"So even though his father had drink problems and there wasn't that much money around, they gave whatever they could,\" she added.\nRichard and Philip's relationship really began after Richard was forced to leave school at 16 to support his family by getting a job.\nPhilip, who had taught Richard at school, decided to step in.\n\"[Philip] was able, as a result of several key figures in Port Talbot... to get Richard back into school, which is a pretty unusual thing to return to school when you've left,\" said Angela. \nWith conditions somewhat cramped at his sister's home, Richard moved into the house of Ma Smith, where Philip was a lodger.\n\"And then from that point Richard was being trained, in effect daily, by Philip,\" said Angela. \nPhilip became Richard's legal ward, taking full responsibility for him, and then Richard Jenkins changed his name to Richard Burton.\n\"That happened for several reasons,\" explained Angela. \n\"It's an awful thing to say these days, but [Richard] would be in a better position to have a name like Burton, which was seen less as a sort of working-class Welsh name.\n\"Also, in effect Philip was taking responsibility for Richard and was already a well-respected person in the theatre world himself, so it gave Richard again a further opportunity.\"\nIn the film, Richard's biological father, played by Steffan Rhodri, is suspicious of Philip's interest in his son, but happy to take a wad of cash in return for signing papers to hand over legal responsibility.\nPrevious biographies have gone further, suggesting Philip's interest in Richard was sexual. \n\"My take is perhaps rather different,\" said Angela.\n\"There is no evidence or proof whatsoever that there was any problem there or that Richard actually found it a problem. \n\"What I will say is that Philip was gay... much later in life when he lived in America he had one known long-term relationship, so I think in some instances this is people putting two and two together and making 25.\"\nEd was in agreement. \n\"The people I've spoken to and the people the team have spoken to who knew Richard and Philip personally, and from the vast majority of biographies, our takeaway is that Philip's motives were good, honest and pure,\" he said. \nPhilip's connections gave Richard his acting break, according to Angela.\nAfter building a reputation in the theatre, Richard made his screen debut in 1949 in The Last Days of Dolwyn.\nHe went on to be regarded by many as the finest actor ever to emerge from Wales, starring in films including Cleopatra and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\nIn 1960 he won a Tony Award for his performance as King Arthur in Camelot on Broadway. He was nominated seven times for an Oscar but never won.\nRichard was married five times, twice consecutively to Elizabeth Taylor.\nMeanwhile Philip went on to work on almost 200 radio programmes, producing work by Dylan Thomas.\nHe reinvented himself in the mid-1950s, moving to the US where he became the first director of the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in New York.  \nRichard and Philip remained close throughout their lives apart from a two-year period when they were not in contact. \n\"Philip wouldn't talk to Richard because he was so loyal to Sybil, Richard's first wife,\" said Angela.  \nShe said it was Elizabeth Taylor who, despite having not met Philip at this point, reunited the pair. \n\"[Richard] was trying to get his head around the Gielgud production of Hamlet and was having some difficulties with it... so [Elizabeth] phoned [Philip] and asked him if he would come to help Richard,\" Angela said.\nShe said Philip and Elizabeth's friendship continued after Richard's death in 1984 from a cerebral haemorrhage.\n\"When Philip was dying, Elizabeth went to visit him in hospital in Florida and the nurse on the ward said she nearly fell over when she saw who the visitor was,\" said Angela.\nPhilip died in 1995, at the age of 90. \nEd believes the story of their relationship will resonate with many.\n\"It's almost a cliche that everybody remembers a great teacher, but it's cliche for a reason because you only need one in your life and it's transformative,\" he said. \nAngela hopes the film will allow Philip to take his own place in history.\n\"It clearly helps to make Philip better known to the world, which I think he does deserve to be,\" she said. \n\"He deserves to be known in his own right because he actually was a remarkable man.\"\nRichard's daughter, Kate, said it was \"very emotional\" being on set and watching the \"extraordinary\" performances of the actors who portrayed her father and grandfather.\n\"Just seeing those two incredible actors play these two very important men in my life... it was the weirdest, strangest thing,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\"I thought this is looking really wonderful and very authentic. That was the thing that was making me the most happy.\"\nMr Burton, produced by Severn Screen, BBC Wales and Ffilm Cymru Wales, is in UK cinemas from 4 April 2025.",

Wayne Madsen, who led the side to promotion in 2012, takes over from David Lloyd after his solitary campaign leading the side.\nTickner's return and the presence of experienced bowlers such as Zak Chappell and Pat Brown can only benefit newcomer Harry Moore.\nAlready in the England system, the much talked-about 17-year-old will be starting his first full season in the senior side having already shown he can more than hold his own at that level.\nWinter signings Jack Morley and Martin Andersson will be better for having been with the group last season.\nThe big challenge remains the ability to take 20 wickets a match, something Mickey Arthur's side have to do if they are to repeat the relative riches of his first season in charge in 2022.\nMatthew Potts' Durham appearances this season may be limited by England call-ups\n2024 season - Fifth in Division One\nMartin Emmerson - BBC Radio Newcastle\nDurham finished fifth on their return to Division One last season and in general more than held their own. They might be able to improve on that this year. We'll see.\nThey weren't helped by the loss of their entire opening game - at home to Hampshire in April \u2013 but there was only really Surrey who turned them over.\nThat was towards the end of the season and the week Surrey retained their title - and they beat a weakened Durham side struggling with injuries.\nFrom a batting point of view they have added Emilio Gay to the ranks. He joined towards the end of last season from Northants, while Will Rhodes chose to leave Warwickshire after seven seasons, despite the offer of a new contract. \nThey will help boost a line-up which includes the leading batter in Division One last season, in South African David Bedingham. He scored 1,331 runs, including a club-record 279 against Lancashire in September. He also became the first Durham batter to score centuries in four consecutive innings.\nOpener Michael Jones has left for Lancashire. His outings last season were limited due to selection choices, so he took the decision to head back home.\nBowling is the key issue. They've had no luck with overseas players in recent seasons. Scott Boland lasted part of one game before returning home to Australia in April. Neil Wagner managed just one game too. Veteran Peter Siddle came in and did well in his four games, while West Indian Chemar Holder didn't particularly pull up any trees in his three matches. Keeping their bowlers fit will be key.\nIt remains to be seen how much of a good signing Sam Conners will be. The bowler has joined from Derbyshire. While he boasted 50 championship wickets in 2022, he took 27 the following year, but only played five Championship matches last season. Australian seamer Brendan Doggett will play County Championship matches in April and May. The 30-year-old seamer plays for South Australia and has 157 first-class wickets to his name.\nThen there's the likes of ever-dependable all-rounder Ben Raine. Matthew Potts is important to the team too, when England allow him to be available. Seventeen-year-old James Minto looks a good prospect and fellow bowler Daniel Hogg will be looking to push on after a career-best 7-66 against Notts in Chester-le-Street.\n2024 season - Fourth in Division One\nVictoria Polley - BBC Radio Essex\nThere's been change at the top for Essex over the winter with Chris Silverwood returning to the club as director of cricket. \nEssex won successive titles (Div 2 & 1) in his previous tenure as head coach, including a first County Championship win in 25 years, before England came calling. \nWith his assistant Anthony McGrath taking over from then up until last season, it will hopefully be a more seamless transition than these changes can sometimes be.\nDean Elgar was vital at the top of the order last season but who will open alongside him is the big question? Do Essex give a chance to teenager Charlie Allison who has impressed in the white-ball formats? They have other options in the likes of Nick Browne or Robin Das, or even bumping Paul Walter or Michael Pepper up higher.\nJordan Cox was also key with the bat last season but has had a torrid winter, denied an England Test debut by a thumb injury. International opportunities could affect his availability.\nAn international call-up still eludes bowler Sam Cook but England's loss is very much Essex's gain - alongside Jamie Porter and Simon Harmer, it's a potent bowling attack.\nIt would've been strengthened with the signing of Shardul Thakur but his late involvement in the IPL has ruled him out of a move to Chelmsford, and Essex continue to hunt for a replacement.\nIt's been six years since Essex last won a County Championship title and they continue to punch above their weight in competing at the top end of the table. \nThey might not have the squad size and budgets of other counties but there's still plenty of talent and experience among the Essex ranks. Can Silverwood add more silverware to his Essex collection on his Chelmsford return?\n2024 season - Sixth in Division Two\nNick Webb - BBC Radio Wales Sport\nThe arrival of Richard Dawson as head coach after the unexpected departure of Grant Bradburn is the main change at Sophia Gardens, with the squad looking remarkably similar to last season. \nThe second One-Day Cup triumph in four years put a gloss on an otherwise disappointing 2024 campaign as Glamorgan showed only marginal improvement in the T20 Blast and fell away in the latter stages of the Championship promotion race.\nKey factors in the Championship will be finding a consistent opening partnership to go with the settled top order of Sam Northeast, Kiran Carlson, Colin Ingram and Chris Cooke, as well as getting the most out of a seam attack lacking raw pace. \nEddie Byrom, unlucky with injury in several seasons, is the most likely starter up top but his partner could be one of four or five candidates. \nSri Lankan Asitha Fernando is likely to partner Timm van der Gugten with the new ball in the opening stages of the season, while it will be interesting to see if on-loan England off-spinner Shoaib Bashir makes an impact as cover for Mason Crane early on when pitches usually don't help the twirlers.\nThere is little doubt that young all-rounder Ben Kellaway will become a regular in all formats sooner or later, but being thrown in as a red-ball opener was maybe a step too far. \nHis ambidextrous spin is a unique selling point added to some hard hitting in the middle order. \nOverall the county needs to manage a fair degree of change in the medium term, with a fair few of their stalwarts well past the 30 mark.\nJames Bracey played two Test matches for England in 2021\n2024 season - Seventh in Division Two\nEd Seabourne - BBC Radio Bristol\nGloucestershire approach the 2025 season with a renewed sense of ambition, keen to ensure this campaign isn't looked back on as the previous September's hangover.\nWhilst 2024 will always be remembered for the remarkable run to the county's first T20 Blast trophy, head coach Mark Alleyne made no bones about the fact he was disappointed to have ended so far behind the promotion spots in the County Championship.\nDespite the final positioning, significant strides forward were made on the batting side. \nWicketkeeper James Bracey is following a stellar year that saw him achieve the rare double of 1,000 runs and 50 dismissals, and there is increasing competition for spots in the top order.\nThe signing of Australian all-rounder Cameron Green for five matches will only add to that, and there is even hope he will be allowed to bowl towards the end of his stay.\nThe club possesses a group of promising young pace bowlers, including recent England Lions call-ups Zaman Akhter and Ajeet Singh Dale, and newly appointed Championship skipper Cameron Bancroft has spoken of his excitement in working with them.\nThe departure of Zafar Gohar, however, means the squad is without a proven red-ball spinner, and, especially with the dry spring, the serious question will be whether there is enough variety in the attack in its current form to force wins on a consistent basis.\n2024 season - Second in Division One\nKevan James - BBC Radio Solent\nTrying to improve on their second-place finish in the Championship last season may depend on a dip in form from Surrey, but also how Hampshire cope without being able to call upon two very influential players.\nJames Vince, the captain and leader of the batting line-up, has decided red-ball cricket is no longer for him. Mo Abbas, taker of 180 wickets over the past four seasons, has been moved on.\nVeteran Mark Stoneman looks a shrewd signing to partially or maybe fully offset the hole left by Vince.\nOn the bowling front, exciting prospects Sonny Baker and John Turner will be given more responsibility. They will certainly add pace.\nA disappointing T20 campaign will hopefully be turned around by the addition of two hard-hitting South Africans in Lhaun-dre Pretorius and Dewald Brevis.\nPretorius, 19, was the top run scorer in the recent SA20 competition, while Brevis finished the tournament with the top strike rate of 180.\nBy all accounts Pretorius has the potential to be world class very quickly.\n2024 season - 10th in Division One (relegated)\nMatt Cole - BBC Radio Kent\nThe summer of 2024 was a pretty dismal affair for both club and supporters. In the Championship they found themselves outgunned, particularly in the bowling department, and never really looked like they were escaping the drop from Division One they'd so narrowly avoided the year before.\nPerhaps more worrying was the T20 Blast campaign. The Spitfires - perennial contenders for the knockout stages - won just four of 14 games and finished bottom of the South Group. The One-Day Cup didn't add much encouragement for supporters desperate for something to hope for.\nKent come into the new season though with Adam Hollioake replacing Matt Walker as head coach. It's the former Surrey and England all-rounder's first time in the role for a county side and players and supporters alike have received the appointment with some excitement.\nThe playing ranks have been bolstered by new signings \u2013 Chris Benjamin moving from Warwickshire hoping to reinvigorate his career as an all-formats batter.\nKent's bowling was the major cause for concern last season, both injuries and lack of form making them look toothless at times. A double signing of seamers just before the start of the campaign is looking to address that \u2013 recent Test debutant for Pakistan, Kashif Ali, and experienced South African pace man Keith Dudgeon are in place for the first part of the campaign.\nThey've also added Corey Flintoff \u2013 son of Andrew, brother of Rocky \u2013 to the squad, the fast-bowling all-rounder joining on a rookie contract.\nWith Aussie bowlers Wes Agar and Tom Rogers returning for the T20 Blast, it appears more of an evolution than a revolution at Canterbury this summer.\nBut if Hollioake can get the best out of the squad they could be among the front-runners for promotion back to the top division of the Championship and a return to upsetting the big budget sides in the Blast.\nRocky Flintoff played four County Championship matches for Lancashire last season\n2024 season - Ninth in Division One (relegated)\nScott Read - BBC Radio Lancashire\nSince winning the County Championship title in 2011, Lancashire have been relegated four times. \nOn the previous three occasions they've won promotion straight back to Division One. \nThey'll be expected to continue that trend this season and will start as firm favourites. \nEven without James Anderson for the first month, the Red Rose have a healthy blend of senior professionals and young players making their way in the game. \nThe overseas signings of Marcus Harris and Anderson Phillip look like excellent business. \nPhillip, for the first 11 games, will provide some extra pace, Harris for the entire season to open the batting. \nThe arrival of the Australian opener will also allow Luke Wells to bat at six giving Lancashire some much-needed experience in the middle order. \nLancashire have some fine young players who endured a tough season for the club last year. A year on from that, the likes of Matty Hurst, George Balderson and George Bell should prosper. \nFor Hurst, almost 700 runs at an average of 32 in his debut season for a relegated team was an impressive return. \nThere will also be plenty of opportunities for Tom Aspinwall and Rocky Flintoff, who does not turn 17 until next week.\nAnderson not ruling out playing for three more years\nBancroft's winning experience 'boosts' Gloucestershire\nBairstow named new Yorkshire red-ball captain  \n2024 season - Fifth in Division Two\nRichard Rae - BBC Radio Leicester\nThe return of Peter Handscomb, who made 894 runs in 14 Championship innings at an average of 74.5 last season, the signing of Shan Masood from June onwards, the presence at the top of the order of the talented Rishi Patel and the fact most of the bowlers have legitimate claims to be described as all-rounders, should mean Leicestershire are not short of runs this season. \nNor, if the likes of Patel, Sol Budinger, Rehan Ahmed and Louis Kimber find form, will they score those runs slowly.\nThe big question is whether they have the firepower to bowl teams out twice. \nLast season, Leicestershire took the lowest number of wickets (139) in Division Two by some distance, and some supporters have argued the signing of New Zealand-born Netherlands international Logan van Beek adds to their ranks of bowling all-rounders rather than gives the Foxes the cutting edge they need to break games open.\nTall young left-arm prospect Josh Hull has that potential, but has spent the close season struggling with injury.\nThere is hope in the pre-season performances of the likes of veteran Chris Wright and the promising Tom Scriven, while Ben Green's return from Somerset for the first seven Championship matches adds depth.\n2024 season - Third in Division Two\nKevin Hand - BBC Radio London\nThe signing of New Zealand batter Kane Williamson is something of a coup for a county that are operating under strict financial restrictions imposed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).\nThe rearrangement of the budget for wage allocation within the squad meant a number of players were released last season, including the tough decision to let the popular former England opener Mark Stoneman go.\nWith the evergreen opener Sam Robson aging well and Leus de Plooy a gun player in all formats, Middlesex have a top order to be feared -  probably for the first time since Robson, Nick Gubbins and Nick Compton formed a top three that played a huge part in the 2016 Championship winning side.\nThe mark of the Middlesex team under former director of cricket Angus Fraser, who took charge in 2009, was the regular ability to blast through teams with the ball.\nIn the absence of the retired Tim Murtagh, Middlesex struggled to rattle through the wickets last year and captain Toby Roland-Jones bore a heavy burden on that front. \nIt was refreshing to see the right-armer clear of injury for the season and his team will desperately need that once more if they are to be promoted.\nThe former England international will have his workload eased this year by the arrival of South African seamer Dane Paterson, another crucial addition to the squad that could make a significant difference to a side that looked on course for promotion for most of last season.\nThe signings of Williamson and Paterson to bolster the Championship side are a clear indication that Middlesex want success to return in the shape of promotion this year.\nDarren Lehmann was Australia head coach between 2013 and 2018\n2024 season - Fourth in Division Two\nAndrew Radd - BBC Radio Northamptonshire\nThe arrival of Australian Darren Lehmann as head coach at Wantage Road has triggered a wave of pre-season positivity in a squad left feeling somewhat bruised by the events of the past couple of years.\nAfter being relegated from Division One in 2023 they failed to register a Division Two win in 2024 until September, by which time Lehmann's predecessor John Sadler had lost his job following defeat in the T20 Blast quarter-finals.\nWith opener Emilio Gay and fast bowler Jack White both heading north, to Durham and Yorkshire respectively, there will be opportunities for others to shine. \nYoung batters Krish Patel (who opened his account with five boundaries on first-class debut at Headingley last September) and Aadi Sharma have much to offer, while the seam attack has been bolstered by the signings of Dom Leech, left-armer Liam Guthrie and \u2013 for the four Championship fixtures in May \u2013 Harry Conway from South Australia. \nGeorge Scrimshaw and the hugely promising Raphy Weatherall suffered injuries last season and will be eager to re-establish themselves.\nMuch will depend \u2013 certainly in four-day cricket - on the tried-and-trusted trio of Luke Procter, Ben Sanderson and Rob Keogh. \nIndian leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal had a major impact towards the end of 2024 and returns this year for a longer second-half stint.\nOther key figures across all formats will be Saif Zaib, who \u2013 to the relief of supporters \u2013 agreed a contract extension until at least the end of 2027, plus a couple of upwardly-trending all-rounders in Justin Broad, son of former tennis star Neil and named the county's Media Player of the Year last season, and Gus Miller.\n2024 season - Eighth in Division One\nDave Bracegirdle - BBC Radio Nottinghamshire\nYazz knew what she was on about, didn't she? 'The Only Way Is Up' was not only a catchy hit single but is also a good place to approach Nottinghamshire's hopes for 2025.\nHead coach Peter Moores has emphasised that it's important to learn from what went wrong last year, as well as draw a line underneath it. \nAs a brief reminder, Notts narrowly avoided relegation from Division One of the County Championship, finished bottom of their group in the T20 Blast and barely raised a pulse in the One-Day Cup.\nSo what might be different this time around?\nThe only domestic signing sees Conor McKerr join from Surrey but with Josh Tongue now fully fit, those two bolster a fast-bowling unit that promises untold riches. \nIf Notts can keep Olly Stone healthy, alongside overseas recruits in Australia's Fergus O'Neill and Pakistan's Mohammad Abbas, throw in the evergreen Brett Hutton and the raw pace of Rob Lord, then their resources seem well stocked.\nTeenagers Farhan Ahmed and Freddie McCann both made their county debuts towards the back end of last season and already carry the weight of expectation.\nThe prodigious spinning fingers of 17-year old Ahmed have already marked him out as a generational talent, while 19-year-old team-mate McCann hit two centuries in just seven innings.\nSome astute observers are already wondering if Kyle Verreynne is the best wicketkeeper-batter in the world right now. The county fought off a lot of competition to secure the services of the South African for the whole campaign.\nThat just leaves the top order. While Trent Bridge members may not see too much of England's Ben Duckett once again, there are guaranteed runs from skipper Haseeb Hameed and the gifted Joe Clarke, both as good as any in the county game.\nShoaib Bashir will join Glamorgan on loan for the first three County Championship games of the season\n2024 season - Third in Division One\nAnthony Gibson - BBC Radio Somerset\nWith a strong and settled squad of players shrewdly captained by Lewis Gregory, and terrific team spirit, Somerset go into the new season with every hope of marking the club's 150th anniversary with a first County Championship.\nInjuries permitting, Matt Henry will be back to lead a powerful seam attack, balanced by the spin of Jack Leach, rising star Archie Vaughan and, once he returns from a loan spell at Glamorgan or his England duties are over, Shoaib Bashir. \nAmong the batters, the only real question is who will partner Vaughan at the top of the order, Sean Dickson being the most likely answer. \nThe three Toms - Lammonby, Abell and Banton - will once again make up the engine room of the batting, with James Rew ready to reinforce his reputation as one of the most promising wicketkeeper-batters in the country.\nUnlike the infinitely talented Will Smeed, who is happily returning to the red-ball fold, Tom Kohler-Cadmore will focus on the white ball and the Blast, so that the firepower which has seen Somerset reach Finals Day in each of the past three seasons remains very much intact.\nFor Somerset's team of youngsters to have reached the One-Day Cup Final last year was a surprise, but they can by no means be discounted. James Rew's younger brother, Thomas, will surely come into that side, and what a prospect he is.\nLast year was a case of so near and yet so far - in contention for all three trophies, ending up with none. \nThe team will have learned from that, and if they can graft staying power onto all their other strengths, this could, at last, be Somerset's season.\nTom Lawes is one of a number of exciting all-rounders at Surrey\n2024 season - First in Division One (champions)\nMark Church - BBC Radio London\nThere is no reason Surrey cannot win a fourth Championship title on the spin this summer. \nThey obviously know how to put all the parts together over the course of a season and the squad is much the same. \nThe addition of Matt Fisher is exciting and there will be international call-ups. But the spine of the side is solid and experienced and if someone is missing, the gap gets filled without anybody noticing.\nOne to keep an eye on is Tom Lawes. He has all the talent in the world with both bat and ball, and if he produces consistently, it would not be a surprise if he were representing England soon. He will be aiming for a permanent spot in the Championship XI but as always there is healthy competition for places.\nThere is one certainty. In terms of the Championship, Surrey will want to be better than last season. \nThey are always looking to improve, and they know everybody else is trying to catch them. \nThey will be tested, especially by the likes of Essex and Hampshire but they know how to win the Championship, and they still have all the players that have managed that in the past three years. It is a good recipe to have.\n2024 season - First in Division Two (promoted)\nAdrian Harms - BBC Radio Sussex\nThere's much excitement and anticipation on the south coast, as Sussex return to Division One after almost a decade in Division Two.\nDuring that period they have never mounted a serious promotion bid, and it's taken change at the top, and the subsequent appointment of Paul Farbrace to galvanise the club.\nFarbrace has introduced a winning mentality that had been sadly lacking, and  crucially supplemented a talented group of younger players with, in his words, \"knarled old pros\" who know how to win, and battle when the going gets tough.\nHowever, this is essentially a young Sussex side most with no experience of first division cricket, and therefore the experience of Australian Daniel Hughes, skipper John Simpson and Ollie Robinson will be crucial particularly during the opening weeks of the season.\nBut don't think Sussex will be a soft touch and are back in Division One for the ride.\nProvided the top order can score enough runs, they have a match-winning spinner in Jack Carson and are especially difficult to beat at Hove, where they haven't lost since Farbrace took the helm.\nSussex have taken nine long years to return to Division One, and the feeling around the club is that's where they want to stay.\nJacob Bethell's game time at Edgbaston is likely to be limited this season\n2024 season - Seventh in Division One\nMike Taylor - BBC Radio WM\nA confusing winter followed a confusing summer. \nOften in 2024 it seemed something was going to happen for Warwickshire - they were front-runners in both white-ball tournaments, and frequently built strong early positions in Championship games. \nAnd then nothing happened. No white-ball final, only one four-day win. \nSeveral leading players had outstanding individual seasons - runs for the captain Alex Davies, wickets for Olly Hannon-Dalby, both for Ed Barnard, England calls for Jacob Bethell and Dan Mousley - but the total, somehow, came to less than the sum of the parts. \nA detailed high-performance review had seemed, from the outside, to have also come to no significant conclusion, the exit of performance director Gavin Larsen being unrelated, until head coach Mark Robinson suddenly left seven weeks ago.\nNow, there is both change and continuity. Ian Westwood, a known and trusted leader, is promoted to replace Robinson. \nThe patient, determined approach he showed as an opening bat and captain in testing circumstances should serve him well. \nA collection of overseas players also mixes the familiar and the new. Hasan Ali is already popular at Edgbaston, while Beau Webster has the qualities that should see him thrive mid-summer. \nHopefully all will avoid the bad luck with injuries that has so weighed Warwickshire down in recent years, and has hit Tom Latham before he even arrives.\nEdgbaston is always a busy place, but had become grumpy in the stands by last September, with so much promise unfulfilled. \nHaving seemed at times to be pushing on all fronts at once, they had gone nowhere. The club has a lot of moving parts but no shortage of talent. \nIf Davies and Westwood can steer the team in a clear direction, and maintain a strong challenge at least in one competition, it will be a year of progress.\n2024 season - Sixth in Division One\nGed Scott - BBC Sport online's Pears reporter\nA long, hard, emotional season eventually blossomed into some happiness for Worcestershire in 2024.\nIn between all the trauma of not being able to play their first home game at flood-hit Worcester until 25 May then came the devastating loss of one of their players, Josh Baker, at the tragically early age of just 20.\nBut the spirit the Pears showed in adversity could only be admired.\nThey gave a string of youngsters their chance in an unexpectedly progressive One-Day Cup campaign \u2013 and, either side of the mid-summer County Championship break, they produced three huge red-ball victories on the trot.\nThat not only helped them stay in the top flight, it was enough to catapult them up to sixth - their highest finish since two-division cricket began in 2000. Finishing above both neighbours Warwickshire and also Nottinghamshire, where four of their former players are now based, was a source of particular pride and pleasure.\nBuilding on that and again keeping their place in an always competitive division is now the challenge - although they will have to do so without the retired Joe Leach, as well as Kiwi Nathan Smith, who did well over the first half of last summer but then opted to join champions Surrey.\nBut they have another New Zealand fast bowler Jacob Duffy arriving from the second game onwards. They have three more incomers in Ben Allison from Essex, Nottinghamshire spinner Fateh Singh and Australian seamer Ben Dwarshuis for the T20 Blast.\nThey also still have that same marvellous team spirit to fall back on \u2013 and a real, genuine hunger.\nLong-term doubts remain over their future at New Road - but, in the short term, prospects at Worcester are brighter than people might think.\nJonny Bairstow will captain Yorkshire in the County Championship this season\n2024 season - Second in Division Two (promoted)\nJonathan Doidge - BBC Radio Leeds\nIt is likely to be a very interesting 2025 for Yorkshire.\nWith financial concerns now, apparently, assuaged at the very moment the team has returned to the top flight of the Championship, plus a new coaching staff and new red ball and T20 captains, there should rightly be an air of optimism.\nJonny Bairstow follows in his late father David's footsteps to steer the Championship challenge. He'd love to have a title as captain on his CV but aside from captaincy, his presence alone with the bat will be huge.\nSimilarly, Dawid Malan is going to be back playing more red-ball cricket, a major plus. Add to that potent opening pair of Adam Lyth and Finlay Bean, plus James Wharton, whose career began to blossom last year in particular, and more established batters like George Hill and that end of the team should be capable of setting up games.\nAs we know, that's no good without the ability to take 20 wickets and in that department there's plenty of encouragement. \nThe outstanding Ben Coad will again lead the line. Overseas input comes from, in particular, New Zealand's Ben Sears plus Will Sutherland (two matches) and Jordan Buckingham (four) also chipping in, while there's also George Hill, Jordan Thompson, off-season recruit Jack White, plus Matt Revis and Matt Milnes, who are on the road back from injury.\nDom Bess looks likely to be this coach's first pick among the spinners, though Dan Moriarty and Jafer Chohan will want a say in that.\nWith Bairstow donning the wicketkeeping gloves, Jonathan Tattersall and Harry Duke are going to have to wait for further opportunities, unless required as batters. You'd certainly have to feel for Tattersall after he led the team back up last season - but this is professional sport.\nWith One-Day Cup centurion Will Luxton awaiting another opportunity, there'll be upward pressure with the bat and I'd be backing Ben Cliff to put some serious pressure on the more senior bowlers in the squad. He could really take his own game to the next level as the season unfolds.\nIn summary, there's optimism that head coach Anthony McGrath can take the team to places it hasn't been for quite some time.",

Wayne Madsen, who led the side to promotion in 2012, takes over from David Lloyd after his solitary campaign leading the side.Tickner's return and the presence of experienced bowlers such as Zak Chappell and Pat Brown can only benefit newcomer Harry Moore.Already in the England system, the much talked-about 17-year-old will be starting his first full season in the senior side having already shown he can more than hold his own at that level.Winter signings Jack Morley and Martin Andersson will be better for having been with the group last season.The big challenge remains the ability to take 20 wickets a match, something Mickey Arthur's side have to do if they are to repeat the relative riches of his first season in charge in 2022.Durham - 'Bowling the key issue'Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Matthew Potts' Durham appearances this season may be limited by England call-ups2024 season - Fifth in Division OneMartin Emmerson - BBC Radio NewcastleDurham finished fifth on their return to Division One last season and in general more than held their own. It was refreshing to see the right-armer clear of injury for the season and his team will desperately need that once more if they are to be promoted.The former England international will have his workload eased this year by the arrival of South African seamer Dane Paterson, another crucial addition to the squad that could make a significant difference to a side that looked on course for promotion for most of last season.The signings of Williamson and Paterson to bolster the Championship side are a clear indication that Middlesex want success to return in the shape of promotion this year.Northamptonshire - 'Lehmann arrival brings positivity'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Darren Lehmann was Australia head coach between 2013 and 20182024 season - Fourth in Division TwoAndrew Radd - BBC Radio NorthamptonshireThe arrival of Australian Darren Lehmann as head coach at Wantage Road has triggered a wave of pre-season positivity in a squad left feeling somewhat bruised by the events of the past couple of years.After being relegated from Division One in 2023 they failed to register a Division Two win in 2024 until September, by which time Lehmann's predecessor John Sadler had lost his job following defeat in the T20 Blast quarter-finals.With opener Emilio Gay and fast bowler Jack White both heading north, to Durham and Yorkshire respectively, there will be opportunities for others to shine.",

        "article_text": "Yoon Suk Yeol, who was officially removed from office on Friday, follows a line of former South Korean leaders who have had their reputations marred or terms interrupted by scandal. \nAmong them are presidents who have faced indictment, exile and imprisonment.\nYoon, who was South Korea's public prosecutor, in fact led a probe that landed former president Park Geun-hye in prison. \nNow apart from being impeached, Yoon is also being investigated for treason over his botched martial law attempt last December. Some analysts believe that, ironically, the move was driven by his fear of prosecution. \nHere is a list of former South Korean presidents whose political careers ended dramatically.\nBefore he became South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee spent some three decades as a pro-independence activist against Japanese rule. \nBut his presidency was polarising. \nWhile some respect him for having laid the foundations for a modern country after World War Two, critics condemn his authoritarian streak. Shortly after his inauguration in 1948, he implemented laws to curtail political dissent; he has also been blamed for the killing of civilians during the Korean War. \nThe opposition rejected Rhee's re-election in 1960 and accused him of rigging the vote. This escalated into violent student-led protests, which saw some demonstrators shot dead by police, and ultimately forced Rhee to resign. \nRhee left the country for Hawaii in May that year, where he died in 1965.\nBorn to a poor rural family in the early years of the Japanese occupation, Park Chung-hee joined the military and was posted to Manchuria (a historical region of north-eastern China) where he served until the Japanese surrendered.\nPark led a coup in 1961 to overthrow Rhee's successor, Chang Myon, and later became president. Park led the country for 18 years through a period of rapid economic development known as the \"miracle on the Han river\". It was during this time that the government opened doors to foreign investment, while also helping to develop now-famous conglomerates like Hyundai, LG and Samsung.\nHowever, he moved towards greater authoritarianism later in his term. In 1972, he suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly and made himself \"president for life\". \nDespite Park's economic achievements, South Korea in the 1970s was rocked by growing protests against his iron-fisted rule, where dissenters were brutally punished.\nPark was assassinated at a dinner party in October 1979 by his own spy chief and lifelong friend Kim Jae-kyu. \nMilitary commander Chun Doo-hwan gained power in 1980 after yet another coup. He presided over a brutal military crackdown in the south-western city of Gwangju, which at the time was the centre of an uprising against martial law in South Korea. More than 200 pro-democracy demonstrators were either killed or disappeared.\nDuring Chun's term, the country saw growth rates hovering around 10% each year. However, he is mostly remembered as a dictator who was unapologetic till the end. \nIn 1983, Chun survived an assassination attempt orchestrated by North Korea forces, who bombed a ceremony he was at during a state visit to Myanmar. The attack killed 21 people and injured dozens more. \nIn 1988, Chun picked his coup comrade Roh Tae-woo, also a former general, as his successor. \nThe pair were convicted in 1996 of corruption, as well as their roles in the coup and the Gwangju massacre. Defending the coup while on trial, Chun said he \"would take the same action, if the same situation arose\". \nChun was handed a death sentence - which was later commuted to life imprisonment - while Roh was sentenced to 17 years in jail. Both men were pardoned in 1997 after serving just two years in prison.\nBorn to a poor family, Roh Moo-hyun educated himself and passed the bar exam to become a lawyer without having attended law school. He was appointed a judge in 1977 but later left the bench to become a human rights lawyer, where he advocated for student activists accused of being pro-communist.\nIn 2002, Roh won the presidential election as an underdog, with early polls giving him just 2% of the vote. He tried to shape South Korea as a \"middle power\" among other stakeholders in the region, and championed a so-called sunshine policy of engaging North Korea with trade and aid shipments. \nAfter leaving office in 2007, he returned to his hometown in the south-east and ran a duck farm. However, he took his own life 14 months later, as corruption investigators closed in over allegations he accepted $6m in bribes.\nPublic opinion on Roh improved considerably after his death. Polls by Gallup Korea have consistently ranked him the most beloved president in the country's history.\nFormer Hyundai CEO Lee Myung-bak entered politics in 1992 and was elected mayor of Seoul a decade later. He won the election by a landslide in 2007, even though a business scandal from his days at the automobile conglomerate resurfaced in the days leading up to the vote.\nLee led the country through the global financial crisis and won its bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics. His term ended in 2013, and he was succeeded by the country's first female president Park Geun-hye, who is the daughter of assassinated former leader Park Chung-hee. \nThe younger Park drew on her father's reputation as the man who pulled South Korea out of poverty. However, a corruption scandal involving a confidante, Choi Soon-sil - the daughter of a Shamanistic cult leader - led to her impeachment in 2016 and arrest a year later.\nFive years after leaving office, Lee too was charged with bribery and later found guilty of creating slush funds of tens of millions of dollars, and taking bribes from various sources, including Samsung. \nPark was handed a 22-year sentence and Lee 15 years, but both have since been pardoned.

Need a differential for the rest of the season? Confused about chip strategy?\nGet your questions in for Gianni on X using #bbcfootball.\nIn the meantime, here's our week 31 team of the week for some short-term inspiration.\nThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a \u00a3100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.\nManchester City held the team together with captain Omar Marmoush (18 points) and clean sheets for Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias.\nAside from that it was a lot of one and two-pointers for 43 points. Meh.\nListen to the latest Fantasy 606 podcast on BBC Sounds.\nIf Kieran Trippier can reproduce his form of the past two seasons, he is a great differential defensive pick\nEmi Martinez, Aston Villa, keeper, \u00a35m - Nottingham Forest (h)\nThe Argentine kept just his fourth clean sheet of the season in Wednesday's win at Brighton but he is a differential keeper option for this week and the rest of the season.\nVilla face goal-shy Southampton next week before a double in 33.\nForest are not an easy opponent for Villa but they are definitely not as threatening without injured striker Chris Wood.\nVirgil van Dijk, Liverpool, \u00a36.5m - Fulham (a)\nLiverpool's defence is rolling at the moment, with three clean sheets in their past four including keeping Manchester City and Newcastle out.\nAnd Van Dijk has only scored once so far this season. He has not finished a season with just one goal since 2020-21, so the law of averages means he is due.\nDjed Spence, Spurs, \u00a34.4m - Southampton (h)\nWhile Tottenham's form is nose-diving again, they face a Saints side with just 22 goals in 30 games - the league's lowest total.\nSpence seems to be holding down that right-back spot and, if they do keep a clean sheet, has a great chance of bonus.\nIn Tottenham's recent back-to-back clean sheets, against Brentford and Manchester United, Spence earned the maximum three bonus points.\nKieran Trippier, Newcastle, \u00a35.6m - Leicester (a)\nAm I getting suckered in with memories of prime Trippier from the past two seasons, when he had nine and 10 assists? Possibly.\nIs picking a defender against Leicester each week the most obvious call? Yes.\nThat makes Trippier worth a punt in my opinion, even if he is nursing a potential groin issue.\nHe took three set-pieces, made three crosses and two key passes in Wednesday's win over Brentford, so you're getting a defender who is pretty involved in attacking play.\nDouble up on Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli?\nMohamed Salah (vice-captain), Liverpool, \u00a313.8m - Fulham (a)\nSalah has failed to score in two of his past three games and his expected goal involvement (xGI) of 0.17 against Everton on Wednesday was the Egyptian's lowest all season.\nBut this man has 44 goal involvements in 2024-25 so don't give up on him yet!\nThere could come a time - especially if you are chasing your rivals - where going without Salah makes sense in a few weeks, as Liverpool won't have a double gameweek this season.\nBut not yet.\nJacob Murphy, Newcastle, \u00a35m - Leicester (a)\nFPL players may be looking at Anthony Gordon as the best Newcastle midfield option, with a double gameweek next week for the Magpies.\nBut Murphy, at just \u00a35m, can easily match Gordon.\nHe has nine assists now this season and has started every game since week 14. Bargain.\nBukayo Saka, Arsenal, \u00a310.3m - Everton (a)\nSaka has gone from 'player to watch' to essential in this column in the space of three weeks.\nYour only worry is whether, with a Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid coming up, the England man is rested for the odd game having just come back from injury.\nBut a start against Everton seems certain and Saka is still second on the assists chart with 11 this season, despite missing just over three months.\nGabriel Martinelli, Arsenal, \u00a36.5m - Everton (a)\nSaka's return is good for team-mate Martinelli, even though a trip to Everton isn't exactly easy on paper.\nThe pair had a combined 52 goals and assists two seasons ago, getting on the end of each other's crosses, and with a double gameweek in 33 of Palace (h) and Ipswich (a), why not double up on the Arsenal attack?\nAlexander Isak (captain), Newcastle, \u00a39.5m - Leicester (a)\nThe 20-goal striker is a slight injury doubt but you have to go with him against this Championship-bound Leicester side.\nCaptaining Manchester City's Marmoush against Leicester paid off last week so we go again!\nLiam Delap, Ipswich, \u00a35.6m - Wolves (h)\nThis is a must-win game for Ipswich and we're at the stage of the season where form goes out of the window a little.\nPortman Road will be pumped up and if Town do pull off a victory, chances are Delap will be involved in some way.\nThe 11-goal striker has been involved in 43% of Ipswich's goals this season, a statistic bettered only by four strikers who have played more than 10 games - Isak, Erling Haaland, Wolves' Matheus Cunha (who is suspended for this one) and Jamie Vardy.\nDominic Solanke, Spurs, \u00a37.3m - Southampton (h)\nThis is a pure gut-feel pick (you need one in every team right?) as Solanke has no form to speak of. He had an expected goals (xG) of zero in Thursday's defeat at Chelsea.\nBut the England striker was just getting motoring before an injury after gameweek 21 put him out for six matches.

Solanke had three goals and two assists in the six games before that, and has the potential to go off against a doomed Southampton side.Subs benchDean Henderson, Crystal Palace, keeper, \u00a34.6m - Brighton (h)Morgan Rogers, Aston Villa, midfielder, \u00a35.5m - Nottingham Forest (h)Rayan Ait-Nouri, Wolves, defender, \u00a34.8m - Ipswich (a)Aaron Wan-Bissaka, West Ham, defender, \u00a34.5m - Bournemouth (h)Team total cost: \u00a394.5mPlayer to watchImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, William Saliba's new centre-back partner could be Poland's Jakub Kiwior, right Jakub Kiwior, Arsenal, defender, \u00a34.8mAre we about to get a cheap entry into one of the Premier League's best defences, with a double gameweek on the horizon?With Gabriel out for the season, Riccardo Calafiori injured, and Jurrien Timber and Ben White injury doubts, Kiwior could be the next man up.He has performed before when called upon.Team to targetAston Villa - Nottingham Forest (h), Southampton (a), DOUBLE GAMEWEEK - Newcastle (h), Manchester City (a)It's just picking the right Villa player for this run of games - everyone apart from Morgan Rogers seems a bit of a punt, with the usually reliable Ollie Watkins having been benched for two consecutive games in all competitions.With a Champions League quarter-final against Paris St-Germain crammed in between these games as well, it might be prudent to wait until the double before choosing your Villa assets.But both Marcus Rashford (\u00a36.6m) and Marco Asensio (\u00a36.1m) could be amazing differential picks.Related topicsLiverpoolAston VillaPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurArsenalNewcastle UnitedFootballIpswich TownPremier League indexPremier League tablePremier League fixturesMore on this storyFollow your Premier League club and get news, analysis and fan views sent direct to youPublished11 August 2023 Yes.That makes Trippier worth a punt in my opinion, even if he is nursing a potential groin issue.He took three set-pieces, made three crosses and two key passes in Wednesday's win over Brentford, so you're getting a defender who is pretty involved in attacking play.MidfieldersImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Double up on Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli?Mohamed Salah (vice-captain), Liverpool, \u00a313.8m - Fulham (a)Salah has failed to score in two of his past three games and his expected goal involvement (xGI) of 0.17 against Everton on Wednesday was the Egyptian's lowest all season.But this man has 44 goal involvements in 2024-25 so don't give up on him yet!There could come a time - especially if you are chasing your rivals - where going without Salah makes sense in a few weeks, as Liverpool won't have a double gameweek this season.But not yet.Jacob Murphy, Newcastle, \u00a35m - Leicester (a)FPL players may be looking at Anthony Gordon as the best Newcastle midfield option, with a double gameweek next week for the Magpies.But Murphy, at just \u00a35m, can easily match Gordon.He has nine assists now this season and has started every game since week 14. He has not finished a season with just one goal since 2020-21, so the law of averages means he is due.Djed Spence, Spurs, \u00a34.4m - Southampton (h)While Tottenham's form is nose-diving again, they face a Saints side with just 22 goals in 30 games - the league's lowest total.Spence seems to be holding down that right-back spot and, if they do keep a clean sheet, has a great chance of bonus.In Tottenham's recent back-to-back clean sheets, against Brentford and Manchester United, Spence earned the maximum three bonus points.Kieran Trippier, Newcastle, \u00a35.6m - Leicester (a)Am I getting suckered in with memories of prime Trippier from the past two seasons, when he had nine and 10 assists?",

Trump has generally taken a friendlier approach to Russia since his return to the White House.\nHe has made ending the war a priority and a top Russian official is in Washington this week for meetings with his administration, as negotiations continue on a deal.\nLast month, Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on countries buying Russian oil if Russian President Vladimir Putin did not agree to a ceasefire.\nOn Thursday, Russian media also argued that their country was not on the sweeping tariffs list because of existing sanctions.\n\"No tariffs have been imposed on Russia, but that's not because of some special treatment. It's simply because Western sanctions are already in place against our country,\" says state-run Rossiya 24 TV.\nAccording to its sister channel Rossiya 1, Russia is missing from the list \"to the disappointment of many in the West\".\nMany Kremlin-controlled media outlets have specifically referred to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who told Fox News: \"Russia and Belarus, we don't trade with. They're sanctioned.\"\nAccording to the Office of the US Trade Representative, the US imported goods from Russia worth $3.5bn (\u00a32.7bn) in 2024. It mainly consisted of fertilisers, nuclear fuel and some metals, according to Trading Economics and Russian media.\nSome of the Russian coverage has taken a mocking tone, with pro-Kremlin NTV saying Trump treated America's allies in Europe as \"serfs\" who only respond with \"moaning\".\nMany, such as Zvezda TV which is run by Russia's defence ministry, note the inclusion of uninhabited Heard Island and McDonald Islands on the tariffs list.\n\"Looks like it's some penguins who will have to pay the 10% tariff,\" Zvezda said.\nUkraine, meanwhile, is facing a 10% tariff on its exports to the US.\nThe country's first deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said the new US tariff would mostly hit small producers.\nShe also said Ukraine was \"working to secure better terms\".\nIn 2024, Ukraine exported $874m (\u00a3642m) worth of goods to the US and imported $3.4bn from the US, according to the deputy prime minister.\n\"Ukraine has much to offer the United States as a reliable ally and partner,\" she added. \"Fair tariffs benefit both countries.\"\nDespite the small scale of trade, the US has provided significant material support for the war against Russia. Trump has argued that the US has spent $300-$350bn on such aid, while the US Department of Defense said $182.8bn had been \"appropriated\" - a figure that covers US military training in Europe and replenishment of US defence stocks - for Operation Atlantic Resolve.\nThe US has also been attempting to reach a deal for access to Ukrainian minerals as part of negotiations to end the war.

        "article_text": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has dismissed accusations that Washington was left unable to help in the Myanmar earthquake due to the Donald Trump administration's shuttering of its humanitarian aid agency.\nAsked by the BBC why the US had not meaningfully responded, as it routinely has to past such disasters, Rubio said \"we are not the government of the world\".\nEarlier this week, former officials at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) said the US was left unable to send rescuers and dogs due to the agency's dismantling. \nRubio said the US had to balance global humanitarian rescue work with \"other needs\" and \"other priorities\" that were in the US national interests.\n\"There's a lot of other rich countries in the world, they should all be pitching in.\n\"We're going to do our part. We already have people there. We'll have more people there. We'll help as much as we can [but] it's not the easiest place to work\u2026 they have a military junta that doesn't like us,\" Rubio said.\nOn Tuesday, a former USAID official told the BBC the shuttering of the agency, led by the billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk, meant the White House could not send teams from the US to save lives in the immediate aftermath of the 28 March magnitude 7.7 earthquake. \nThe confirmed death toll rose to 3,354 on 4 April, Myanmar's ruling military said.

Other countries need to do so as well. China is a very rich country. India is a rich country. There are a lot of other countries in the world, and everyone should pitch in.\"\nChina and India were among the first to have teams on the ground in Myanmar, according to former American humanitarian officials.\nRubio dismissed the accounts of humanitarian aid experts who said the inability to deploy a large US rescue team was due to the USAID cuts.\n\"These are people that make millions and hundreds of millions of dollars in these NGOs [non-governmental organisations] all over the world that stand up and they get flooded with the US taxpayer money, and then we have to spend 10 [or] 100 million dollars to get 10 million to people. We're not doing that anymore. Okay? We have stopped. We are no longer going to spend 10 million, 100 million dollars to get 10 million to recipients.\n\"We're not going to fund these global NGOs all over the world that are living off of this. We're not doing it.\n\"We are prepared to help and work with governments and appropriate NGOs on the ground that are delivering assistance. We will be there, and we will be helpful [but] there are a lot of other rich countries, they should also pitch in and help\u2026 we are going to do our part,\" Rubio added.\nAs news of the Myanmar earthquake emerged, the White House had reportedly tried to deploy a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) from the US - but could not do so because the Trump administration's cuts had cancelled logistics contracts and fired officials who oversaw such deployments, according to the former officials. \nThe cuts to USAID had been led by Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) after President Trump targeted foreign assistance on his first day in office, calling it an \"industry\" that was in many cases \"antithetical to American values\".",

        "article_text": "On a quick drive around the small Ohio town of Delta, you can spot nearly as many Trump flags as American stars-and-stripes banners.\nAnd at the petrol station near the Ohio Turnpike, the pumps bear relics of the last administration, with slogans slamming Trump's predecessor: \"Whoever voted for Biden owes me gas money!\"\nThis is Trump country - the Republican ticket easily won here in November's presidential election by a margin of almost two-to-one. And while the markets are in turmoil following Trump's unveiling of expansive global tariffs this week, plenty of people in Delta and hundreds of Midwestern towns like it still back the president's plans.\nThose plans, to impose tariffs of between 10% and 50% on almost every country, have upended global trade and led to warnings that prices could soon rise for American consumers. Trump, meanwhile, has said the move will address unfair trade imbalances, boost US industry and raise revenue.\nFor some in Delta, the president's argument about fairness resonates.\n\"I don't want people in other countries to suffer, I really don't,\" said Mary Miller, manager of the Delta Candy Emporium, which sits in the middle of the village's Main Street. \"But we need to have an even playing field.\"\nMiller, a three-time Trump voter, believes other countries haven't played fair on trade. And like many here, she prefers to buy American-made goods.\nAs she watches over her stock of multi-coloured confectionaries, many of them made in the US, and weighs up how they might be impacted by fresh import taxes, she recalls how decades ago she heard that one of her favourite brands was moving its factories abroad. She hasn't bought another pair of Levi's jeans since.\nMiller is unfazed by the possibility of price increases, which many economists say these new tariffs will bring.\n\"Sometimes you have to walk through fire to get to the other side,\" she said.\n\"If tariffs bring companies and business back to hard-working American people like the ones who live here, then it's worth it.\"\nThese sentiments are common in Delta, a village of around 3,300 people less than 100 miles (160km) south of Detroit, even as other Midwestern towns brace for sharp shocks. \nThe automotive industry, with its complicated global supply chains, seems particularly vulnerable to the impact of major new tariffs, with companies in Michigan to the north and Indiana to the west already announcing factory shutdowns and job cuts.\nBut on the outskirts of Delta, there is a cluster of steel businesses that have been here since the 1990s and which may be better placed in a new era of American protectionism.\nOne of these businesses, North Star BlueScope, has urged Trump to expand tariffs on steel and aluminium.\nAt the same time, however, it has asked for an exemption for the raw materials it needs, such as scrap metal.\nNorth Star BlueScope did not respond to interview requests, but in a back room at the nearby Barn Restaurant, a few local steelworkers who had just finished the night shift were drinking beers together early on Friday morning.\nThe workers, who asked not to be named, mostly laughed and shrugged when asked about the sweeping new tariffs that were announced by Trump at the White House on Wednesday.\nIt was a pretty clear indication that this economic news is unlikely to ruin their weekend.\nOutside the restaurant, some Delta locals considered the possible upsides of these import taxes.\n\"Nobody's frantic. We're not going to lose any sleep over it,\" said Gene Burkholder, who has a decades-long career in the agriculture industry.\nAlthough he owns some stocks, Mr Burkholder said they were long-term investments and he was not obsessing over the sharp drops in the two days following the president's announcement.\n\"If you have some spare cash, maybe it's a good time to buy some shares while they're cheap,\" he said.\nA couple of booths over, as she finished eating breakfast with her son Rob, Louise Gilson said - quietly - that she did not really trust the president.\nBut Gilson, along with many people here, said she wanted to see action. She wholeheartedly agreed when another diner commented: \"Trump may be wrong, but at least he's trying.\"\n\"The other people wouldn't have done squat,\" she said, referring to the Democratic Party.\nThe Gilsons agreed that the big local industrial employers have generally been good neighbours, contributing to the local economy, charities and the wider community, even as they have seen some less desirable effects of industrial development and worry about unequal sharing of the economic pie.\nAnd as they recounted Delta's history, they described a gradual erosion in quality of life that they believe has made many people willing to roll the dice even when economists say Trump's tariff plan comes with stark risks.\n\"It was a good little town to grow up in,\" Rob Gilson recalled. But he said it now seemed less safe and friendly than when he was growing up in the 60s and 70s. \n\"It seems like the heart of America is gone,\" he said.\nDelta, Louise Gilson added, \"is the kind of place where 25% or 30% of the people are struggling with their demons\".\nAnd while these issues have little to do with tariffs, the challenges faced by people in towns like Delta may go some way to explaining why many are willing to give President Trump the benefit of the doubt, even as markets plunge on faraway Wall Street.",
