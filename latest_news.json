Since then, Delhi and Washington have been working towards an early conclusion of trade negotiations.\nIn his speech in Jaipur, Vance said that the two countries had finalised the terms of reference for the negotiation.\n\"This is a vital step toward realising President Trump and Prime Minister Modi's vision because it sets a roadmap toward a final deal between our nations,\" Vance said.\nHe also called Modi a \"tough negotiator\" and someone \"who drives a hard bargain\", drawing applause from the audience.\nModi and Trump share a warm personal relationship: the Indian prime minister was among the first global leaders to visit Trump after his second term began. But the US president has repeatedly taken aim at India's high tariffs, branding it a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties.\nEven in the statement issued on Monday after Vance's meeting with Modi, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer highlighted the \"serious lack of reciprocity in the trade relationship with India\".\nIndia has already cut tariffs on a number of goods in the past few months and is reportedly considering more wide-ranging cuts to pacify Trump. But sectors like agriculture - where Washington wants greater access, but India fiercely protects - are still sticking points. \nVance also said in Jaipur that the US is seeking to sell more energy and defence equipment to Delhi. On Monday, in addition to trade, the two leaders had also discussed cooperation in defence, strategic technologies and energy.\nThe Indian prime minister also said after the meeting that he was looking forward to welcoming Trump to India this year. Delhi is hosting the Quad summit later this year and the US president is expected to attend it.\nThe bilateral meeting was followed by delegation-level talks and a dinner hosted by Modi for Vance and his family. \nVance arrived in India on Monday morning, accompanied by his wife Usha and their three children. Usha Vance's parents migrated to the US from the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, and some media reports have said that Vance and his wife are keen to introduce their children to their Indian heritage.\nPhotographs of the three children wearing Indian-style outfits - the two boys in kurta-pyjamas and three-year-old Mirabel wearing a lehenga - on their arrival in India were splashed across Indian newspapers and websites.\nThe rest of Vance's visit is largely personal. After the meeting with Modi, the family visited Jaipur city, where they visited the historic Amer Fort on Tuesday. \nThe family is also set to visit the iconic Taj Mahal in Agra city on Wednesday before flying to the US the next day.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Pope Francis, who has died aged 88, made his final public appearance on Easter Sunday at the Vatican's St Peter's Square. \nAfter wishing the gathered crowd of more than 20,000 a happy Easter, he indicated that Archbishop Diego Ravelli, master of liturgical ceremonies, would read a message he had written.\nHere is the full text of his final public address, as released by the Vatican.\n\n\"Christ is risen, alleluia!\nDear brothers and sisters, Happy Easter!\nToday at last, the singing of the 'alleluia' is heard once more in the Church, passing from mouth to mouth, from heart to heart, and this makes the people of God throughout the world shed tears of joy.\nFrom the empty tomb in Jerusalem, we hear unexpected good news: Jesus, who was crucified, 'is not here, he has risen' (Lk 24:5). Jesus is not in the tomb, he is alive!\nLove has triumphed over hatred, light over darkness and truth over falsehood. Forgiveness has triumphed over revenge. Evil has not disappeared from history; it will remain until the end, but it no longer has the upper hand; it no longer has power over those who accept the grace of this day.\nSisters and brothers, especially those of you experiencing pain and sorrow, your silent cry has been heard and your tears have been counted; not one of them has been lost! \nIn the passion and death of Jesus, God has taken upon himself all the evil in this world and in his infinite mercy has defeated it. He has uprooted the diabolical pride that poisons the human heart and wreaks violence and corruption on every side. The Lamb of God is victorious! That is why, today, we can joyfully cry out: 'Christ, my hope, has risen!' (Easter Sequence). \nThe resurrection of Jesus is indeed the basis of our hope. For in the light of this event, hope is no longer an illusion. Thanks to Christ \u2014 crucified and risen from the dead \u2014 hope does not disappoint! Spes non confundit! (cf. Rom 5:5). That hope is not an evasion, but a challenge; it does not delude, but empowers us.\nAll those who put their hope in God place their feeble hands in his strong and mighty hand; they let themselves be raised up and set out on a journey. Together with the risen Jesus, they become pilgrims of hope, witnesses of the victory of love and of the disarmed power of Life.\nChrist is risen! These words capture the whole meaning of our existence, for we were not made for death but for life. Easter is the celebration of life! God created us for life and wants the human family to rise again! In his eyes, every life is precious! The life of a child in the mother's womb, as well as the lives of the elderly and the sick, who in more and more countries are looked upon as people to be discarded.\nWhat a great thirst for death, for killing, we witness each day in the many conflicts raging in different parts of our world! How much violence we see, often even within families, directed at women and children! How much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalised, and migrants!\nOn this day, I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas! For all of us are children of God!\nI would like us to renew our hope that peace is possible! From the Holy Sepulchre, the Church of the Resurrection, where this year Easter is being celebrated by Catholics and Orthodox on the same day, may the light of peace radiate throughout the Holy Land and the entire world.\nI express my closeness to the sufferings of Christians in Palestine and Israel, and to all the Israeli people and the Palestinian people. The growing climate of anti-Semitism throughout the world is worrisome. Yet at the same time, I think of the people of Gaza, and its Christian community in particular, where the terrible conflict continues to cause death and destruction and to create a dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation.\nI appeal to the warring parties: call a ceasefire, release the hostages and come to the aid of a starving people that aspires to a future of peace!\nLet us pray for the Christian communities in Lebanon and in Syria, presently experiencing a delicate transition in its history. They aspire to stability and to participation in the life of their respective nations. I urge the whole Church to keep the Christians of the beloved Middle East in its thoughts and prayers.\nI also think in particular of the people of Yemen, who are experiencing one of the world's most serious and prolonged humanitarian crises because of war, and I invite all to find solutions through a constructive dialogue.\nMay the risen Christ grant Ukraine, devastated by war, his Easter gift of peace, and encourage all parties involved to pursue efforts aimed at achieving a just and lasting peace.\nOn this festive day, let us remember the South Caucasus and pray that a final peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan will soon be signed and implemented, and lead to long-awaited reconciliation in the region.\nMay the light of Easter inspire efforts to promote harmony in the western Balkans and sustain political leaders in their efforts to allay tensions and crises, and, together with their partner countries in the region, to reject dangerous and destabilising actions.\nMay the risen Christ, our hope, grant peace and consolation to the African peoples who are victims of violence and conflict, especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in Sudan and South Sudan. May he sustain those suffering from the tensions in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes region, as well as those Christians who in many places are not able freely to profess their faith.\nThere can be no peace without freedom of religion, freedom of thought, freedom of expression and respect for the views of others.\nNor is peace possible without true disarmament! The requirement that every people provide for its own defence must not turn into a race to rearmament. \nThe light of Easter impels us to break down the barriers that create division and are fraught with grave political and economic consequences. It impels us to care for one another, to increase our mutual solidarity, and to work for the integral development of each human person.\nDuring this time, let us not fail to assist the people of Myanmar, plagued by long years of armed conflict, who, with courage and patience, are dealing with the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Sagaing, which caused the death of thousands and great suffering for the many survivors, including orphans and the elderly. We pray for the victims and their loved ones, and we heartily thank all the generous volunteers carrying out the relief operations. \nThe announcement of a ceasefire by various actors in the country is a sign of hope for the whole of Myanmar.\nI appeal to all those in positions of political responsibility in our world not to yield to the logic of fear which only leads to isolation from others, but rather to use the resources available to help the needy, to fight hunger and to encourage initiatives that promote development. These are the 'weapons' of peace: weapons that build the future, instead of sowing seeds of death!\nMay the principle of humanity never fail to be the hallmark of our daily actions. In the face of the cruelty of conflicts that involve defenceless civilians and attack schools, hospitals and humanitarian workers, we cannot allow ourselves to forget that it is not targets that are struck, but persons, each possessed of a soul and human dignity.\nIn this Jubilee year, may Easter also be a fitting occasion for the liberation of prisoners of war and political prisoners!\nDear brothers and sisters,\nIn the Lord's Paschal Mystery, death and life contended in a stupendous struggle, but the Lord now lives forever (cf. Easter Sequence). He fills us with the certainty that we too are called to share in the life that knows no end, when the clash of arms and the rumble of death will be heard no more. Let us entrust ourselves to him, for he alone can make all things new (cf. Rev. 21:5)!\nHappy Easter to everyone!\"",

        "article_text": "Who will be the next pope? The decision could have a profound impact on the Catholic Church and the world's 1.4 billion baptised Roman Catholics.\nIt also promises to be a highly unpredictable and open process for a host of reasons.\nThe College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails.\nWith 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, they are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective.\nFor the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European. \nAnd although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively \"progressive\" or \"traditionalist\".\nFor those reasons, it is harder than ever to predict who will be elected the next pope.\nCould the cardinals elect an African or an Asian pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration?\nHere are some of the names being mentioned as Francis's potential successor.\nNationality: Italian\nAge: 70\nSoftly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis \u2013 making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.\nHaving acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.\nHe is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength.\nBut he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favour in the Republic of Ireland \"a defeat for humanity\".\nThe bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: \"He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\"\nSome 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.\nNationality: Filipino\nAge: 67\nCould the next pope come from Asia?\nCardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience \u2013 meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.\nThe Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals \u2013 which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.\nHe is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.\nHe has opposed abortion rights, calling them \"a form of murder\" \u2013 a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.\nBut in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.\nThe cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.\nAsked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke! It's funny.\"\nNationality: Congolese\nAge: 65\nIt's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\nHe has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.\nHe is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".\nThough Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.\nBut in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\"\nSuch comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.\nNationality: Ghanaian\nAge: 76\nIf chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.\nLike Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.\nAsked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".\nHe was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.\nLike Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.\nA guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.\nLike many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.\nIn a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.\nIn 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised.\nNationality: Hungarian\nAge: 72\nA cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016.\nHe is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church.\nThe archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate.\nErdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis's two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict.\nHis conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the \"illiberal democracy\" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said \"death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something\".\nFrancis's words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope.\nNationality: German\nAge: 71\nGermany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too.\nThe Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican.\nHe has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching.\nBut in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis.\nTwo years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.\nNationality: Canadian\nAge: 80\nCardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.\nFor years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.\nAs another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.\nOuellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.\nHe opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that \"Christ is male, the Church is feminine\".\nNationality: American\nAge: 69\nCould the papacy go to an American for the first time?\nChicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.\nTwo years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.\nHe worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.\nPrevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.\nHe is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy.

And although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively \"progressive\" or \"traditionalist\".For those reasons, it is harder than ever to predict who will be elected the next pope.Could the cardinals elect an African or an Asian pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration?Here are some of the names being mentioned as Francis's potential successor.LIVE UPDATES: Follow the latest after the Pope's deathIN PICTURES: Symbolism on show as Pope lies in open coffinEXPLAINER: Key candidates in an unpredictable contest to be the next PopePROFILE: Acting head of the Vatican Cardinal Kevin FarrellPietro ParolinGetty ImagesNationality: ItalianAge: 70Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis \u2013 making him the pope's chief adviser. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. That resignation was rejected by Francis.Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.Marc OuelletReutersNationality: CanadianAge: 80Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that \"Christ is male, the Church is feminine\".Robert PrevostGetty ImagesNationality: AmericanAge: 69Could the papacy go to an American for the first time?Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. He has also spoken against euthanasia.But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke!",

The act has never been used to issue tariffs by any president, congressional research shows.\nLast week, the state of California filed its own lawsuit against the Trump administration over tariffs. That lawsuit also argues that Trump lacks the power under the IEEPA to impose these tariffs. Several other lawsuits have similarly challenged Trump's authority using that law for the levies. \nTrump has implemented tariffs on global trading partners in a stated effort to correct what he believes is a trade deficit between the US and other nations. \nOn 2 April, in an event billed as \"Liberation Day,\" Trump shook the global economy by announcing \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nations across the world. A few days later amid a market backlash, he announced a 90-day pause on the tariffs and lowered the rate to 10% for most countries. \nThat pause didn't extend to China, which Trump said had a \"lack of respect\" and was retaliating. Instead, the US issued a 145% on goods imported from China, which has led to a trade standoff and rattled global markets. \nOn Wednesday, Trump said he hoped to come to a deal with China soon and noted the 145% tariff was \"very high\". \nThe White House has also imposed 25% tariffs on certain goods from it's neighbours, Mexico and Canada.

Every year, thousands of Hawaiians descend on the Big Island to attend the event, while thousands more watch live broadcasts of Hawai'i's 23 best \nh\u0101lau\n (hula groups) compete on TV. Yet, the festival is more than just a hula contest; its dance performances, arts and craft exhibitions, and a royal parade through downtown Hilo is considered the biggest display of Hawaiian culture in the world.\n\"It's the one week out of the year where we celebrate being Hawaiian,\" said K\u016b Kahakalau, a Hawaiian language and culture expert. \"And it's all thanks to the undertakings of King Kal\u0101kaua.\"\nFondly dubbed \"The Merrie Monarch\", King David La'amea Kal\u0101kaua was the last king of Hawai'i. He ruled the Kingdom of Hawai'i from 1874 until his death in 1891, but his ascension to the throne was nothing short of contentious. Shortly after the death of King Kamehameha IV, whose family had ruled the kingdom since 1795, Hawai'i's legislature\u00a0decided to elect a native\u00a0ali'i\u00a0(noble chief) instead of the king's widow. The decision incited a full-blown riot. As the queen's supporters stormed the Honolulu courthouse, British and American sailors stationed at Honolulu harbour were called in to quell the fighting and Kal\u0101kaua took the oath of office the following day.\nBy the time of Kal\u0101kaua's reign, Native Hawaiian heritage was at great risk. Christian missionaries had begun arriving on the islands in 1820, introducing diseases that killed Native Hawaiians, converting islanders away from our traditional polytheistic religion and infiltrating the political system to suppress local culture and beliefs. One of the most significant ways they did this was by banning public performances of the hula, a dance missionaries deemed \"vile heathen chants\".\nKal\u0101kaua sought to restore a unified sense of national pride among Hawaiians, and his reign marked a period of cultural renaissance across the islands. He lived by the motto Ho'oulu L\u0101hui\u00a0(Increase the Nation) and sought to remake Hawai'i for Hawaiians \u2013 all of which resulted in the revival of traditional customs such as language, music, arts and traditional medicines that had long been suppressed during the missionary-influenced era of his predecessors. One of his crowning achievements was preserving the hula. As Kal\u0101kaua famously proclaimed: \"Hula is the language of the heart, and therefore the heartbeat of the Hawaiian people.\"\u00a0\nTo many people around the world, \"hula\" may conjure images of tiki bars, plastic dancers shaking their hips on car dashboards or something that only happens at beachside resorts. But long before hula was commodified and appropriated, it was a sacred dance among Native Hawaiians \u2013 an ancient practice that served as an archive of our stories, beliefs and way of life. Prior to the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, there was no written language in Hawai'i. Instead, ancient Hawaiians used oral tradition and hula to pass on their identity and culture from one generation to the next. Even when practice was prohibited, Hawaiians took hula underground, continuing to teach the forbidden dance in secret in caves and far-flung areas.\nAs part of Kal\u0101kaua's Ho'oulu L\u0101hui\u00a0policy, hula experienced a resurgence. In fact, the king's lavish two-week coronation ceremony was essentially a celebration of Native Hawaiian culture, featuring traditional music, hula and l\u016b'au \u2013\u00a0all of which had previously been banned. To commemorate his 50th birthday three years later, \nho'opa'a \n(chanters) and \n'\u014dlapa \n(dancers) performed in public for the first time in years, while a parade wound its way through downtown Honolulu. Today, the Merrie Monarch Festival pays tribute to the proud sense of Hawaiian identity Kal\u0101kaua revived.\n\"[Kal\u0101kaua] was deeply committed, proud and knowledgeable about his Hawaiian heritage,\" said Kahakalau, noting that the king was also the first person to have the \nKumulipo\n (a creation chant that also includes the genealogy of Hawaiian royalty) written down.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nYet, Kal\u0101kaua wasn't just content to revive Hawaiian customs in Hawai'i; he wanted to share the Kingdom's culture around the world. So, in 1881, the \"Merrie Monarch\" continued the proud Hawaiian tradition of long-distance seafaring by\u00a0spending 281 days circumnavigating the globe, becoming the first head of state to travel around the world.\nDuring Kal\u0101kaua's international diplomacy tour, he was greeted by the Emperor of Japan to the sounds of\u00a0Hawai'i Pono'\u012b\u00a0(the Kingdom's national anthem, which Kal\u0101kaua had written); he proposed immigration policies with Chinese politicians; he toured the Great Sphinx with the Khedive of Egypt; he was blessed by Pope Leo XIII in Rome; he had tea with Queen Victoria of England, and he boarded a train that was struck by a bull in Spain. In New York, Kal\u0101kaua met with Thomas Edison to discuss the possibility of getting electricity to Honolulu. In 1886, the king's wish came true.\u00a0'Iolani Palace\u00a0(which is now a museum and the only royal residence in the United States), became illuminated with electric lights \u2013 five years before the White House did.\n\"He was able to build important relationships, create liaisons, and sign treaties with multiple countries [that benefitted our people],\" said Kenneth \"Aloha\" Victor, a kumu hula (master hula teacher) and designer of Kaulua'e, a made-in-Hawai'i clothing and lifestyle brand. In addition to sending envoys to Europe and Asia, Kal\u0101kaua maintained consulates and legations in more than 130 cities across the globe. The Kingdom had 13 consulates in Great Britain alone.\nBack at home, during an era of increased literacy, Kal\u0101kaua met with traditional na kahuna (priests) and na kapuna (elders) to compile many of the ancient Hawaiian myths and chants that are portrayed through hula and mele and write them in Hawaiian. In 1888, he took things one step further and translated these stories into English for the first time in the book, Legends and Myths of Hawai'i, which he often presented as gifts to foreign dignitaries so they'd get a better understanding of Hawai'i, its culture and its people.\u00a0\nMore like this\n:\n\u2022 The word embodying the spirit of Hawai'i\n\u2022 A lei maker's guide to the real Honolulu\n\u2022 Hawaii's ancient land management system\nKal\u0101kaua's mission to integrate Hawai'i with the rest of the world also resulted in the creation of the Hawaiian Youths Abroad Program, in which the king selected young Hawaiians whom he felt could become future leaders of the Kingdom and sent them abroad to study things like medicine, law, engineering, foreign languages and art.\u00a0More than 100 years later, the programme's legacy still echoes across the islands: Princess Abigail Kaw\u0101nanakoa, the granddaughter of one of the students the king sent abroad, played an instrumental role in restoring 'Iolani Palace and was a staunch supporter of native Hawaiian rights until her death in 2022.\nA multi-hyphenate in every sense of the word, Kal\u0101kaua embraced modernity just as much as he valued Hawaiian culture. He was a voracious inventor, designing blueprints for tornado-proof ships, fish-shaped torpedoes, sealed bottle caps and rangefinder scopes. He even had a telephone installed that connected 'Iolani Palace where he lived and worked to his private boathouse less than a mile away, where he'd often be found hosting royal l\u016b'aus\u00a0for foreign dignitaries and heads of state.\nFor Hawaiians today, Kal\u0101kaua is much more than just a Renaissance man. \"When Kal\u0101kaua travelled [abroad], he promoted and shared our culture with the world,\" said Ana Kon, a Hawaiian cultural specialist based in Hilo. \"It's why, more than a century later, we continue to honour his legacy today at the Merrie Monarch Festival.\"\nFor those unable to snag tickets to the Merrie Monarch Festival's highly coveted hula competitions, there are still plenty of opportunities to participate in the festivities. Hilo's Afook-Chinen Civic Auditorium and Butler Buildings host a vibrant arts and crafts fair featuring the creations of more than 150 local artisans and brands from across Hawai'i. \"Our 'aloha wear' is a celebration of hula,\" said Victor, of his clothing, which he said honours the people, places and movements in Hawaiian culture.\nOf course, Kal\u0101kaua's legacy lives on beyond the festival. In many ways, every hula step, l\u016b'au gathering and Hawaiian-language phrase is a nod back to our last king's efforts to revive our customs at home and introduce them around the world. Visitors can experience this first hand at O'ahu's Polynesian Cultural Center, which hosts a traditional Hawaiian l\u016b'au paying homage to Queen Lili'uokalani (Kal\u0101kaua's sister, who succeeded him until white businessmen\u00a0overthrew the Kingdom in 1893), while the Queen Emma Summer Palace\u00a0in Honolulu offers contemporary hula lessons for adults.\nOn Maui, immersive experiences at the\u00a0Grand Wailea\u00a0include an E Ala E\u00a0oli\u00a0(chant) in the mornings on the beach, while interactive language lessons teach guests how to pronounce words in\u00a0\u02bb\u014clelo Hawai'i\u00a0(Hawaiian). Beachside resorts like\u00a0Outrigger Reef in Waikiki Beach are adopting a regenerative tourism approach at its A'o Cultural Center by allowing guests to meet traditional Hawaiian navigators and canoe builders, teaching them how to use traditional Hawaiian tools and \u2013 yes \u2013 participate in hula lessons.\n\"It all spawns back to [King Kal\u0101kaua's] creed,\" said Victor. \"That hula is the heartbeat of our Hawaiian people.\"\nCORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this story stated that\u00a0US sugar planters overthrew the Kingdom of Hawai'i.

It's a real family affair, with Benn's sisters and cousin also joining him in camp.\nHaving spent 12 years of his childhood in Mallorca, Benn speaks fluent Spanish to the locals in the gym.\nWhen the training session begins, however, the laughter stops. There is noticeable shift in mindset \u2013 a sign of just how serious Benn is approaching this fight.\nHe says he is \"leaving no stone unturned\" as he fights for the family name \u2013 and to prove his own worth - in this bloodline rivalry.\n\"I've got a chip on my shoulder about [people] saying I'm the nepo kid, that I had it easy,\" he adds.\nBut this is no longer about fathers. Benn's reputation amongst boxing fans has been stained.\nAlthough he has been cleared to fight by an anti-doping panel, they feel he should be more transparent about the reasons behind the failed test.\nBenn says he has been \"cleared three times\" and is reluctant to dwell on the past. \nNigel, meanwhile, speaks more openly about the impact it had on them both, saying \u00a31m was spent on the legal battles.\nThe former super-middleweight champion says he is not a drinker but would consume \"half a bottle of red wine every night\" during the period as his mental health issues worsened, while his son turned to therapy to get through the dark times.\n\"I was watching my son really crying in my arms, heartbroken. I just knew [he was innocent],\" Nigel adds.\n\"Because [if he was] I would let the public know, I'd say, 'Mate, yeah, sorry mate, he's done this'. But I know he hasn't and I will stand with my son.\"\nNigel Benn was a two-weight world champion during his boxing career\nBenn taps into modern-day training methods by sporting an oxygen mask during cardio to simulate high-altitude training.\nHe expertly talks about nutrition, saying in the past he was \"eating curries and pop-tarts\" after weigh-ins.\nThere is something quite comical about the way he unintentionally reels his past takeaway order in the style of Smithy from sitcom Gavin and Stacey.\n\"I'd have prawn puri for starters, lamb rogan josh, Bombay potatoes with some saag aloo, peshwari naan, all the poppadoms, pilau rice, saag paneer,\" Benn says.\nThere is no doubt he is now living the life of an elite athlete.\nBut so much has happened outside of the ring that we have forgotten, or perhaps never had the opportunity to truly find out, how good a boxer Benn actually is. \nBefore his ban, he was on a roll with early stoppage victories over past-their-prime Chris Algieri and Chris van Heerden.\nHis two fights in America since the cancelled Eubank bout \u2013 points wins over Rodolfo Orozco and Peter Dobson - have been rather unspectacular.\nBenn is a vastly improved fighter from the novice dropped by French journeyman Cedrick Peynaud in 2017.\nHowever, with around 20 amateur bouts in Australia before he turned pro, how costly has the time out of the ring \u2013 not to mention the mental scars inflicted by the doping scandal \u2013 been on Benn's boxing apprenticeship?\nBenn has been sparring the likes of IBF super-middleweight champion William Scull and undefeated middleweight Bruno Surace.\nNigel raves enthusiastically about a particularly \"mind-blowing\" sparring session against an unnamed top-level fighter which left him too excited to sleep.\n\"I'm 99% sure he will [beat Eubank] within four rounds,\" Nigel predicts.\nIs this a case of rose-tinted dad glasses or an unbiased analysis from one of the best British fighters ever?\nWorld-title challenger Eubank has fought at a significantly higher level. Although a stipulation prevents Eubank from gaining more than 10lb on fight night, he is still the more natural at the weight. \n\"Yes, I am jumping up two weight divisions. Yes, that brings its challenges,\" Benn says.\n\"And yes his CV's better, but the difference between me and him is he's lost every time he stepped up. I haven't.\"\nBenn believes that \"people see this as a 50/50\" contest, even though Eubank is the bookmakers' favourite.\n\"I must be delusional or people just don't know what they're dealing with,\" he says.\n\"Because I see it being a one-sided beatdown.

        "article_text": "A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing. \nChinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened. \nChinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would \"fight to the end\".\nHere's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs.\nChina is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries.  \nWith more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs.  \nBeijing is still fumbling with the keys because Chinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to \"silver trains\" for travelling retirees, that could change. \nAnd Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential.\nThe leadership may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month.\nChina also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders.\nStill, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.\nThe economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.\nThe Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to \"weather storms together\".\nPresident Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: \"The sky will not fall.\"\nChina has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.   \nUnder Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance. \nIt has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI. \nExamples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which was celebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.\nRecently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI.\nUS companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.   \nChinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate.   \nThat unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term.\nEver since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order. \nIt has pumped billions into a contentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.\nThe expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.\nAmerican farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier. \n\"The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once\u2011captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,\" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute. \nThe US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024.\nThat doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner.\nFollowing reports that the White House will use bilateral trade negotiations to isolate China, Beijing has warned countries against \"reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests\".\nThat would be an impossible choice for much of the world\n\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC last week.\nTrump held firm as stocks plummeted following his sweeping tariffs announcement in early April, likening his staggering levies to \"medicine\".\nBut he made a U-turn, pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days after a sharp sell-off in US government bonds. Also known as Treasuries, these have long been seen as a safe investment. But the trade war has shaken confidence in the assets.\nTrump has since hinted at a de-escalation in trade tensions with China, saying that the tariffs on Chinese goods will \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".\nSo, experts point out, Beijing now knows that the bond market can rattle Trump.\nChina also holds $700bn in US government bonds. Japan, a staunch American ally, is the only non-US holder to own more than that.\nSome argue that this gives Beijing leverage: Chinese media has regularly floated the idea of selling or withholding purchases of US bonds as a \"weapon\".\nBut experts warn that China will not emerge unscathed from such a situation.\nRather, it will lead to huge losses for Beijing's investments in the bond market and destabilise the Chinese yuan.\nChina will only be able to exert pressure with US government bonds \"only up to a point\", Dr Zhang says. \"China holds a bargaining chip, not a financial weapon.\"\nWhat China can weaponise, however, is its near monopoly in extracting and refining rare earths, a range of elements important to advanced tech manufacturing.\nChina has huge deposits of these, such as dysprosium, which is used in magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines, and Yttrium, which provides heat-resistant coating for jet engines.\nBeijing has already responded to Trump's latest tariffs by restricting exports of seven rare earths, including some that are essential for making AI chips.\nChina accounts for about 61% of rare earths production and 92% of their refining, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nWhile Australia, Japan and Vietnam have begun mining for rare earths, it will take years before China can be cut out of the supply chain.\nIn 2024, China banned the export of another critical mineral, antimony, that is crucial to various manufacturing processes. Its price more than doubled amid a wave of panic buying and a search for alternative suppliers.\nThe fear is that the same can happen to the rare earths market, which would severely disrupt various industries from electric vehicles to defence.\n\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" Thomas Kruemmer, director of Ginger International Trade and Investment, told the BBC previously. \n\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial.\"",

The curious case of Swiatek's hex against Ostapenko - Second ServePublished21 April 2025, 11:31 BSTIn the latest edition of Second Serve, our new weekly snapshot of the tours, BBC tennis reporter Jonathan Jurejko looks at the key talking points.Usually Iga Swiatek is the one dishing out the bagels.In recent years, the five-time major champion has become known for the ruthless manner of her victories, subjecting many opponents to the ultimate embarrassment of losing a set without winning a game.Now 23-year-old Swiatek finds herself in the position of being on the wrong end of a 6-0 scoreline - having lost to Jelena Ostapenko for the sixth time in a row.Ostapenko extended her flawless head-to-head record against the world number two in the Stuttgart quarter-finals on Saturday.So what's behind the one-sided results?Having won the 2017 French Open, Ostapenko certainly has the pedigree and her explosive ball-bashing - when it works, and the winners outweigh the unforced errors - can have devastating consequences.Swiatek has encountered trouble against aggressive ball-strikers, too, so that adds further weight to the explanation.You also wonder whether there is a mental block against an opponent who a player knows has their number.Swiatek disputed that afterwards, saying her head \"was much more clear\" against Ostapenko in Stuttgart than her previous defeats.While the agony was prolonged, you can't imagine a player of Swiatek's quality will suffer a career-spanning hex.There is a long way to go until Swiatek enters the conversation of being on the receiving end of the most dominant head-to-head record.Gael Monfils has lost all 20 of his matches (so far) against Novak Djokovic, while Richard Gasquet's 18-0 record against Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer's 17-0 against Roger Federer are other notable lopsided match-ups in recent years.In fact, Swiatek could end the chastening run as early as next week, with Ostapenko slated to be a prospective last-16 opponent in Madrid.British number four Harriet Dart caused a stink by telling her French opponent to put on deodorant at the Rouen Open.Rafael Nadal might not be playing the French Open this year - a strange feeling indeed - but the 14-time men's singles champion will be honoured in a ceremony at Roland Garros.Serena Williams claims she would have been treated differently to Jannik Sinner if she had failed two doping tests.The two-year wait is over for Holger Rune.

 \nIt is less than two years since Carlisle had the greatest day in their recent history when they won promotion to League One by beating Stockport County in the League Two play-off final at Wembley.\nIt was unlikely, and unexpected, and further cemented manager Paul Simpson's status as a local hero, back for his second spell in charge and adding a third promotion to the honours list.\nSadly, the jump proved too big for Carlisle, who were competing in the third tier with a budget befitting the bottom half of League Two.\nUnable to compete on or off the pitch, the Blues were relegated with a club-record low of 30 points after winning only seven games in the worst season in the club's history.\nHowever, during that campaign, the Piataks had come in guaranteeing investment and with big future plans, as they got used to the workings of English football.\nSimpson had survived relegation and was given the close season to rebuild, overseeing 12 new arrivals as the owners anticipated an immediate return to League One.\nInside wisdom suggested the man who guided England Under-20s to success in the World Cup in 2017 would be given 10 games to show he could mount a promotion challenge.\nHe managed four. \nThree losses out of those games - including heavy defeats on the road at Gillingham and pertinently at MK Dons - saw him leave his job on 31 August, the day after the transfer window had closed.\nUnder caretaker boss Mark Birch, two more games were lost, but owner Tom Piatak said promotion was still achievable, shortly before announcing Mike Williamson as the new head coach with the club languishing in 22nd.\nThe hierarchy were keen on the team developing a possession-based style and had been impressed by Williamson's MK Dons side in that 3-0 defeat in August.    \nCarlisle won once at Brunton Park between 17 August and 22 March\nThe former Newcastle United defender won his first game in charge at Swindon Town, but it proved to be a false dawn.\nHe failed to win over the Brunton Park crowd, who were not impressed by his switch to three at the back and the team's slow, cat-and-mouse style.\nIn fact, the fans made up their mind during the Boxing Day home loss to bottom club Morecambe and chanted for Williamson's removal.\nInstead, the change was a drastic one to the playing squad, as Williamson, together with newly appointed sporting director Rob Clarkson, brought in 11 players during the January transfer window, confident they would improve the style and the results.\nThe idea was that these players would fit a newly created \"Carlisle way\" that would run through the club and not be dependent on the individual picking the team.\nDuring that busy period in early January, Tom Piatak doubled down on his backing for Williamson.\nBut just over three weeks later, on 3 February, deadline day itself, Williamson was sacked following a shambolic 5-1 home defeat by Swindon, with nine of the 15 players involved January signings.\nHe won just four of 22 league games, while crucially the team failed to score in half of those. \nLooking for a second new boss of the season, Carlisle stunned most when they brought in Wales and Manchester United legend Mark Hughes.\nHe had been out of work for 16 months since leaving Bradford City, but it was a surprise to see him arriving in Cumbria to try to save the bottom club in the EFL from relegation.\nPerformances improved under the 61-year-old, but not at the rate required to pull Carlisle out of trouble.\nHughes criticised the squad's fitness after losing at Harrogate Town in early March, stating he had to make substitutions based on players' ability to last 90 minutes rather than for tactical reasons.\nEven at such a late stage of the campaign, Hughes had to organise bounce games in training in midweek to get people up to match fitness and to assess the huge squad at his disposal.\nVictory over Bromley on 22 March, only a second on their own turf since August, was delivered with only two of the 11 January arrivals starting the game. \nNow Carlisle go into the game at Cheltenham in their best form for two years with 10 points out of a possible 12, as Hughes has found a successful formula, but the feeling is that they have given themselves too much to do. If Tranmere win either of their last two games, whatever the Blues do will be irrelevant.   \nCentre-back and captain Sam Lavelle is joint top scorer with just four goals\nIf the worst happens, Carlisle would have to prepare for their first season in the National League since 2005.\nThat was a brief stay as they climbed back into the EFL at the first time of asking, but this relegation would be a colossal failure.\nA bloated squad will have to be trimmed, regardless of what division the team is in,  and a decision will have to be made on who is in charge.\nWould Hughes want to stay on? Or would the club opt for a manager with National League experience?\nIn recent seasons, Stockport County and Wrexham have shown what can happen in terms of momentum generated from coming up from the National League.\nBut both were marooned in non-league for over a decade before sorting themselves out - that is not a fate Carlisle fans want to contemplate after two seasons of utter misery.     \nPaul Newton, BBC Radio Cumbria sports editor\nOn Saturday 26 April 1975, Carlisle United were saying goodbye to their one and only season in the top flight of English football with a 0-0 draw at champions Derby County.\nFast forward exactly 50 years to Saturday, 26 April 2025 and the Cumbrians are facing the possibility of another relegation \u2013 however, this one would see them saying goodbye to their EFL status. \nThe last and, so far, only time that fate was to befall Carlisle, their opponents were Cheltenham Town in 2004. Carlisle's opponents this Saturday? You guessed it, Cheltenham.\nCarlisle fans don't need history to frame what has been another disastrous campaign. The prospect of back-to-back relegations under the club's American owners, the Piataks, is all too real, and serious questions will be asked about just what has gone so badly wrong.\nFans will point to some highly questionable decision-making \u2013 from the timing of Paul Simpson and Mike Williamson's sackings to four successive disastrous transfer windows despite substantial investment in the playing squad. \nEven if Carlisle do somehow pull off an escape arguably more miraculous than the famous Jimmy Glass one in these remaining two games, Carlisle, on the field, are in a mess.\nWhen the Piataks took over the club in October 2023, their promise was for Carlisle to \"Own The North\". Right now, that reality couldn't feel any further away.\nThis video can not be played\nS2 E44: Optimism Or Realism?",

Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Carlisle won once at Brunton Park between 17 August and 22 March'Williamson-ball' didn't work at allThe former Newcastle United defender won his first game in charge at Swindon Town, but it proved to be a false dawn.He failed to win over the Brunton Park crowd, who were not impressed by his switch to three at the back and the team's slow, cat-and-mouse style.In fact, the fans made up their mind during the Boxing Day home loss to bottom club Morecambe and chanted for Williamson's removal.Instead, the change was a drastic one to the playing squad, as Williamson, together with newly appointed sporting director Rob Clarkson, brought in 11 players during the January transfer window, confident they would improve the style and the results.The idea was that these players would fit a newly created \"Carlisle way\" that would run through the club and not be dependent on the individual picking the team.During that busy period in early January, Tom Piatak doubled down on his backing for Williamson.But just over three weeks later, on 3 February, deadline day itself, Williamson was sacked following a shambolic 5-1 home defeat by Swindon, with nine of the 15 players involved January signings.He won just four of 22 league games, while crucially the team failed to score in half of those. Looking for a second new boss of the season, Carlisle stunned most when they brought in Wales and Manchester United legend Mark Hughes.He had been out of work for 16 months since leaving Bradford City, but it was a surprise to see him arriving in Cumbria to try to save the bottom club in the EFL from relegation.Performances improved under the 61-year-old, but not at the rate required to pull Carlisle out of trouble.Hughes criticised the squad's fitness after losing at Harrogate Town in early March, stating he had to make substitutions based on players' ability to last 90 minutes rather than for tactical reasons.Even at such a late stage of the campaign, Hughes had to organise bounce games in training in midweek to get people up to match fitness and to assess the huge squad at his disposal.Victory over Bromley on 22 March, only a second on their own turf since August, was delivered with only two of the 11 January arrivals starting the game. Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Centre-back and captain Sam Lavelle is joint top scorer with just four goalsHow do Carlisle move forward?If the worst happens, Carlisle would have to prepare for their first season in the National League since 2005.That was a brief stay as they climbed back into the EFL at the first time of asking, but this relegation would be a colossal failure.A bloated squad will have to be trimmed, regardless of what division the team is in,  and a decision will have to be made on who is in charge.Would Hughes want to stay on?",

Everyone is really enjoying being in the environment. \n\"No-one should expect results to happen straight away under a new coach.

It was the first time the backs had scored all of Wales' points since they faced Italy last summer.\n\"Out attack is much more varied now and I'm really enjoying being involved far more,\" said Cox.\n\"In the past we've relied heavily on our forwards to score tries but that's not rugby.

It was the first time the backs had scored all of Wales' points since they faced Italy last summer. \"Out attack is much more varied now and I'm really enjoying being involved far more,\" said Cox. \"In the past we've relied heavily on our forwards to score tries but that's not rugby.",

        "article_text": "On his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring an emergency at the US southern border and directed his top officials to evaluate whether to invoke a rarely used 19th-century law in response to immigration concerns.\nThe Insurrection Act of 1807 allows the president to use active-duty military personnel to perform law-enforcement duties inside the US. \nUS media report that Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem, who were tasked with the assessment, will announce their recommendations later this week.\nSince returning to office, Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a central focus, and border crossings have reached a quarter-century low. But the  statute could further expand the president's powers. \nHere's what to know.\nThe 19th-century law would allow the use of active-duty military personnel to perform law-enforcement duties within the US.\nThis includes the National Guard - a branch of the US armed forces traditionally reserved for domestic emergencies and disasters. \nUS presidents can invoke the law if they determine that \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion\" against the government make it \"impracticable to enforce\" US law \"by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings\". \nOnce invoked, troops could be tasked with a range of duties, from quelling civil unrest and enforcing court orders to arresting and detaining migrants.\nBecause the Insurrection Act was written in broad terms, with little specific guidance on how and when the powers can be used, it gives presidents wide latitude in deciding when to mobilise military personnel for domestic operations.\nThroughout his election campaign, Trump vowed to crackdown on illegal immigration, calling the southern border situation a \"national emergency\" that could be better tamed by invoking the 19th-century statute.\nOn his first day in office in January, he asked for \"recommendations regarding additional actions that may be necessary to obtain complete operational control of the southern border, including whether to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807\".\nThe administration has already rolled out a series of sweeping measures targeting the border. These include a nationwide deportation sweep and the controversial move to transfer alleged Venezuelan gang members to a prison in El Salvador - a decision now facing legal challenges.\nThis comes as US Border Patrol has recorded just 8,300 migrant apprehensions, marking the lowest number of border crossings since 2000.\n\nThe Insurrection Act has been invoked a handful of times in American history. \nAbraham Lincoln used it when the southern states rebelled during the US Civil War, and former President Ulysses S Grant invoked it against a wave of racist violence by the Ku Klux Klan after the war.\nIn the 20th century, former President Dwight D Eisenhower invoked it so the US Army would escort black students into their high school in Little Rock, Arkansas, after the state's governor refused to comply with a federal desegregation order.\nMore recently, it was used in 1992 when massive riots broke out in Los Angeles over the acquittal of four white police officers in the beating of Rodney King, a black man. Then-President George Bush sent in active-duty members of the Marines and Army as well as National Guard troops.\nThe US government has traditionally worked to limit the use of military force on American soil, especially against its own citizens.\nThe Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 was enacted to restrict the military from acting as domestic law enforcement. In times of unrest, states typically deploy the National Guard to help maintain order.\nSince returning to office, Trump has expanded his authority by declaring national emergencies - a move that grants the presidency access to powers and resources that are normally restricted. He has used this authority to impose tariffs and, more controversially, to take action on immigration.\nIn March, following his emergency declaration at the border, Trump invoked the rarely used Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport migrants he alleged were gang members.  Earlier this month, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked that effort.\nIf Trump chooses to invoke the Insurrection Act, it remains unclear what legal challenges he might face.",

        "article_text": "A record-breaking tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany, which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia's links with the rest of Europe.\nRunning for 18km (11 miles), the Fehmarnbelt will be the world's longest pre-fabricated road and rail tunnel.\nIt's also a remarkable feat of engineering, that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor, and then joined together.\nThe project's main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel, on the coast of Lolland island in the south east of Denmark.\nThe facility spans more than 500 hectares (1,235 acres), and includes a harbour and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections, which are called \"elements\".\n\"It's a huge facility here,\" says Henrik Vincentsen, chief executive of Femern, the state-owned Danish company that is building the tunnel.\nTo make each 217m (712ft) long and 42m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete. \nMost underwater tunnels - including the 50km Channel Tunnel between the UK and France \u2013 burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor. Here instead, 90 individual elements will be linked up, piece by piece, like Lego bricks.\n\"We are breaking records with this project,\" says Mr Vincentsen. \"Immersed tunnels have been built before, but never on this scale.\"\nWith a price-tag around \u20ac7.4bn ($8.1bn; \u00a36.3bn) the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark, with \u20ac1.3bn from the European Commission.\nIt's among the region's largest-ever infrastructure projects, and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying.\nOnce completed, the journey between R\u00f8dbyhavn in southern Denmark and Puttgarten in northern Germany, will take just 10 minutes by car, or seven minutes by train, replacing a 45-minute ferry voyage.\nBypassing western Denmark, the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and Hamburg from five to 2.5 hours, and provide a \"greener\" shortcut for freight and passengers.\n\"It's not only linking Denmark to Germany, it's linking Scandinavia to central Europe,\" states Mr Vincentsen. \"Everybody's a winner,\" he claims. \"And by travelling 160km less, you'll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport.\"\nTowered over by cranes, the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead.\n\"So now we are in the first part of the tunnel,\" announces senior construction manager Anders Gert Wede, as we walk inside the future highway. It's one of five parallel tubes in each element.\nThere are two for railway lines, two for roads (which have two lanes in each direction), and a maintenance and emergency corridor.\nAt the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea. \"As you can hear, it's quite thick,\" he says tapping on the metal.  \"When we have a finished element  at the harbour, it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here.\"\nNot only are these elements long, they're enormously heavy, weighing over 73,000 tonnes. Yet incredibly, sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks, gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats.\nNext it's a painstakingly complex procedure, lowering the elements 40 metres down into a trench dug out on the seafloor, using underwater cameras and GPS-guided equipment, to line it up with 15mm precision.\n\"We have to be very, very careful,\" emphasises Mr Wede. \"We have a system called 'pin and catch' where you have a V-shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element, dragging it slowly into place.\"\nDenmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic, on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes.\nWith layers of clay and bedrock of chalk, the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel, said Per Goltermann, a professor in concrete and structures at the Technical University of Denmark.\nA bridge was initially considered, but strong winds might disrupt traffic, and security was another important consideration.\n\"There was the risk of ships crashing into bridges. We can build the bridge so they can withstand it,\" he adds. \"But this is rather deep water, and the biggest ships can sail there.\"\nSo, adds Mr Goltermann, it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel. \"They looked at it and said, \"Okay, what is the cheapest? The tunnel. What is the safest? The tunnel.\"\nDenmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in 2008, but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact.\nOne such environmental group, Nabu (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union), argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbour porpoises, which are sensitive to underwater noise.\nHowever in 2020 their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany, which green-lighted construction to go ahead.\n\"We have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible,\" says Mr Vincentsen, pointing to a 300-hectare wetland nature and recreational area that's planned on reclaimed land, which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock.\nWhen the tunnel opens in 2029, Femern estimates that more than 100 trains and 12,000 cars will use it each day.\nAccording to plans, revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state-backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction, and Mr Vincentsen calculates that will take around four decades.  \"Ultimately, the users are going to pay,\" he says.\nIt's also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs, business and tourism in Lolland, which is one of Denmark's poorest regions.\n\"The locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years,\" said Mr Wede, who grew up nearby. \"They're looking forward to businesses coming to the area.\"",

        "article_text": "I recently saw a statistic that surprised me: in February of 2025, Americans used their television sets to watch YouTube more than anything else. More than Disney. More than HBO. Even more than Netflix.\nI often think of YouTube as a service for young people \u2013 specifically, young people using their phones. But that's all changing. A recent report by research firm Moffett Nathanson projects that by the end of this year, YouTube's revenue will eclipse that of the entire Walt Disney Company (movies, theme parks and all). That report put it bluntly, dubbing YouTube the \"king of all media\".\nBut what does it mean for the rest of the entertainment industry when YouTube is more popular than anything else and YouTube stars seem just as likely to receive big Hollywood deals as A-list actors?\nI spoke about all of this with Lucas Shaw, a reporter and editor for Bloomberg and the author of the Screentime newsletter. It was a fun conversation \u2013 you can watch or read more of it here:\nBelow are excerpts from our conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity:\nKatty Kay: Lucas, people who became famous on YouTube \u2013 Mr. Beast, Cocomelon, etc \u2013 are now getting their own shows on streaming platforms. Is that the direction that we're going to see this going, where increasingly YouTube becomes the incubator for shows that then go onto streaming?\nLucas Shaw: Hollywood studios and TV networks have tried to make programming with social media talent \u2013 especially YouTube stars \u2013 for at least a decade now. Lilly Singh was a big YouTuber who got a late-night talk show; it didn't quite work. Grace Helbig was a big YouTuber who got a talk show. There were some movies that cast talent. We're now seeing a second or third attempt at it.\nI think part of the reason is that these stars have gotten so big that there is now greater confidence that they can deliver. And part of it is that Hollywood companies have learned that they can't force some of this talent into their formats. They have to sort of empower them to continue doing what they're doing. So, the Mr. Beast show for Amazon is just like a maximal version of what he does on his YouTube channel. And with Cocomelon, they're basically licensing YouTube videos and then paying them to make slightly longer and more expensive versions of it. We'll continue to see more of that.\u00a0\nKK: So, there's a difference in what it takes to be successful on YouTube compared to what it takes to be successful on traditional television and streaming platforms?\nLS: Yeah, I think so. I think what people want on YouTube is different from what they want from Netflix, at least for now. People come to like a creator for doing a specific thing.\nThere was a point in time at which this Swedish gaming creator PewDiePie was the biggest YouTube star in the world and YouTube funded an original program with him as part of this original programming initiative that they had. And it didn't resonate in the same way that his channel did, because it wasn't what people came to watch. People liked watching him speak off the cuff while playing games. There was an intimacy to that, but there was also a rawness and it felt sort of less sanitised and manicured. And so, then seeing him being a star of a more traditional TV show, even though it's already on YouTube, I just don't think it appealed to those people in the same way.\nKK: Lucas, you just came back from a trip around Asia. Is there no global competitor \u2013 or even an American competitor \u2013 who looks like it's going to knock YouTube off its perch of such huge dominance?\u00a0\nLS: There was definitely a moment where TikTok appeared to be that \u2013 and YouTube was intimidated because a lot of emerging and independent creators were posting to TikTok first. One of YouTube's great strengths historically was that it lowered the barrier to entry for anyone who wanted to make a video. And that barrier started to feel higher to some, because YouTube had gotten so big and there were established players. So, going from zero to 100 got much harder and they saw creators going to TikTok instead. TikTok is still a big competitor, but there just isn't anything that operates in as many different categories as YouTube. Spotify is competing with YouTube in music and in podcasting and in some video.\nNetflix obviously competes with YouTube globally; I'd say it's one of the biggest competitors in terms of entertainment. But YouTube and Netflix just play different roles, because YouTube is free. For instance, YouTube has hundreds of millions of users in India. Netflix has about 15 million. It's just much easier for YouTube to penetrate some of these poorer markets. Now, there's not as much money there, but from a just \"reach as many people as possible\" standpoint, there really isn't a direct comparison. Maybe Instagram.\nKK: I had a conversation recently with Jonathan Haidt and we were talking about kids and screen time and it occurred to me that so many of the social media companies \u2013 TikTok, Instagram, and others \u2013 have been hauled up before Congress to justify what they're doing. And YouTube seems to have escaped some of that scrutiny. How has it done that and do you think it'll carry on doing that?\nLS: I think it comes back to this idea that people don't know how to categorise YouTube. It is in some ways a social network, right? And I think some people initially saw it that way because it came from Silicon Valley, because there were comments, because people were uploading their own videos. But it is also an entertainment platform. But also, at its core \u2013 because it's part of Google \u2013 it's a search engine. That's in a lot of ways how Google views it. It's a video search engine. And so, I think the difficulty of categorising it has just made it so that people aren't quite sure how to approach it.\u00a0\nBut you're right that they haven't received the same scrutiny from a regulatory perspective, certainly not as much as Meta or TikTok, and it's a little bit baffling. You know, speaking from an American perspective, it is so funny to me that the government would not allow one company to own two domestic broadcast television networks, but it's fine that Meta owns both Facebook and Instagram, both of which reach way more people than any broadcast network. Or it's fine that Alphabet owns both Google and YouTube, both of which reach way more people than any broadcast TV network. So, I think part of this is also that our regulatory behavior is pretty antiquated.\nEditorial Note:\nThis conversation took place before the Federal Trade Commission and Mark Zuckerberg's\u00a0antitrust hearing\u00a0regarding Meta, Facebook and Instagram's parent company.\nKK:\u00a0What are the big changes that you see coming to the platform in the next year or two?\u00a0\nLS:\u00a0I'd say, in aggregate, the big change is that as more advertising dollars flow to YouTube creators and channels will have more money to invest in their programming. There's a pretty widely held belief that you'll continue to see the caliber and cost of some of the top YouTube shows go up and more closely resemble television. You may see some more expensive unscripted shows. Mr. Beast is one example, right? The average cost of one of his videos is $3m three or four million dollars, which is comparable to what you'd see on television, but not comparable to almost anything else you'd see on YouTube.\nAnother big area that I'm actually in the middle of writing a story about now is the growth of scripted programming. It's still pretty small on YouTube, partially because it is more complicated and more expensive. I think another part of it is that YouTube as a platform is just more hospitable to unscripted programming. But as it becomes possible to make more money on YouTube and as it becomes clearer to top writers and actors that there's a much bigger audience on YouTube than some of these other places, I think you'll see more and more people try scripted.\nKK:\u00a0Is YouTube the straw that broke the camel's back of monoculture? I grew up in an era where there were still just a few channels on television. Everybody watched the same thing. But now, it seems that it is really broken. And I wonder whether people will start hankering for that again, for a common experience in this very fragmented, polarised, divided world that we live in.\nLS:\u00a0I don't know the answer to that. I think we like the idea of there being a monoculture, right? It's fun when you have a moment like when\u00a0Barbie\u00a0came out and it seemed like everyone was talking about the movie or the\u00a0Taylor Swift tour\u00a0happens and everyone is talking about this tour. We are social creatures, and so we enjoy these moments where everyone is bonded by the same idea or interested in the same topic. But it certainly doesn't feel like we're on the precipice of returning to that in any way.\nIf you think about how Netflix and YouTube work, which are the two dominant entertainment platforms right now, they are tailored to your individual tastes. People don't watch shows and videos at the same time. There are things that go viral, but that virality is fairly short-lived.\u00a0\nI guess\u00a0Adolescence\u00a0in some ways feels like a monoculture moment, right? Everyone is watching and talking about this show. But unlike in the past, when that might last for the 10 or 20 or 30 weeks that it's on, it lasts for a week or two. And then, we're on to the next one. That pattern feels like it will only continue and accelerate. I don't see us reverting to some world in which we are all watching the same thing, unless there's a fundamental shift in the distribution mechanism.\u00a0\nKK:\u00a0Yeah, it's been described to me as a moment where we're living in a \"me culture\" with short attention spans.\nLS:\u00a0Yeah, because it's all about YouTube, Instagram, Netflix. Everything feels like they are serving you specifically, as opposed to serving all of us collectively.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

Guardiola was not among them. He shook his head, ranted at his coaches on the bench, then launched a tirade towards the nearby fourth official.\nGuardiola was booked for his emotive reaction but he felt wronged. He was still shaking his head forcefully, his face set like stone, as the replay was shown on the big screen at the exact moment he returned to his seat after half-time.\nThen there was a demand for more noise, gesturing to all parts of the ground for City's fans to turn up the volume, and a familiar sink to the knees as James McAtee's delicate lob dropped just the wrong side of the post.\nFinally there was the tension release of Matheus Nunes' injury-time winner. Guardiola reacted as though he had scored himself, acknowledging the noise from the fans he wanted more from earlier.\nThere was a storming of the pitch as the whistle blew, a hug - tight - for Nunes, a laugh and a joke with Kevin de Bruyne, who at the weekend revealed his manager had not even made an offer for him to stay at the end of the season.\nMake no mistake, this win was big.\n\"You don't have to be a scientist to realise that we were playing against Aston Villa, one of the best teams, as you saw against Newcastle and PSG,\" said Guardiola.\n\"They are an extraordinary team but we performed as we did in the past with the commitment.\n\"Qualification for the Champions League is important, of course, but sometimes we have to be calm.

Against Villa it would be Nunes, signed from Wolves for \u00a353m in September 2023 when a plan to bring in Lucas Paqueta from West Ham had to be aborted, who turned into a right-back rather than his central midfield scheming role.\n\"If you told me at the beginning of the season that at the end of it we would be fighting for the FA Cup final or to qualify for the Champions League with Nico and Matheus at full-back, I'd say: 'What are you talking about?'\" said Guardiola.\n\"Matheus is a person that is incredibly loved.

International journalists including the BBC are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently so are unable to independently verify figures.\nSpeaking to Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 , Kneecap's manager said: \"If somebody is hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by, but it's really important to speak truth.\"\nDaniel Lambert added: \"Thankfully the lads are not afraid to do that.\"\nHe also said the band had received death threats following their performance at Coachella and described the threats as \"too severe to get into\".\nIn a statement to BBC News NI, the US State Department said when considering revocations, they look at information that \"may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under US immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted\".\nThe band are set to play a number of shows in the US and Canada in coming months.\nOn Tuesday, Osbourne claimed on social media the band's actions included \"projections of anti-Israel messages and hate speech\".\n\"This band openly support terrorist organizations,\" she added.\nMs Osbourne was also critical of the organisers of the festival, Goldenvoice, a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG).\n\"Reports indicate that Goldenvoice was unaware of Kneecap's political intentions when they were booked,\" Osbourne said.\n\"However, after witnessing their performance during the first weekend, allowing them to perform again the following weekend suggests support of their rhetoric and a lack of due diligence,\" she continued.\n\"This behaviour raises concerns about the appropriateness of their participation in such a festival and further shows they are booked to play in the USA,\" Osbourne said.\n\"I know for a fact that certain people in the industry had written to Goldenvoice, airing their concerns around the booking of Kneecap,\" she said.\nOsbourne is the wife of Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne, and a former judge of TV talent shows The X-Factor and America's Got Talent.\nShe also managed her husband's solo career.\nOsbourne finished her post by saying: \"As someone of both Irish Catholic on my mother's side and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage on her father's side and extensive experience in the music industry, I understand the complexities involved.\n\"I urge you to join me in advocating for the revocation of Kneecap's work visa.\" \nThe festival organisers have been approached for comment.\nWarning: This article features language that some readers may find offensive\nAt the end of their set at the second weekend of Coachella, which was not streamed on the festival's official YouTube page, Kneecap projected three screens of text.\nThe first message said: \"Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,\" followed by: \"It is being enabled by the US government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes,\" and a final screen added: \"[Expletive] Israel.

I was having to play a different game that I didn't enjoy and it didn't feel like I could express myself, so it got really tough.\"\nRonnie O'Sullivan has won the World Snooker Championship seven times and is aiming to become the first man in the modern era to gain eight titles\nAsked if there were times in the past week where he thought he had made a mistake about returning to snooker, O'Sullivan said: \"Yeah, totally. \n\"I thought 'what am I doing coming here, exposing myself, [potentially] imploding out there, having a meltdown?' All that went through my head. I told [sports psychiatrist] Steve Peters that and he said 'I'm coming - I will get you through the first match'.\n\"I was quite a bit scared coming and playing. It's a daunting venue to play at anyway but it's about getting on the bike again and playing and I'm really proud that I've done that.\n\"Even if I had lost, it didn't really matter. I made that breakthrough. There's still a lot of work to do.\"\nO'Sullivan scored 504 points in five frames on Wednesday, compared with just 43 for Ali Carter\nIn Tuesday's first session against two-time Crucible finalist Carter, neither player was at their best, with it seemingly finely balanced at 5-4 to O'Sullivan.\nBut on Wednesday, 'The Rocket' was in sensational form, winning all five frames and not letting Carter score a point in four of them.\nO'Sullivan made breaks of 59, 117, 74, 123 and 131, but in the post-match news conference stressed he was trying to \"rebuild\" his technique after losing faith in his ability.\nHe said: \"I couldn't even watch myself play as I could see what was wrong. I just couldn't correct it and every time you make a change you think 'this is terrible'.\n\"I've changed my alignment, changed certain things. I had lost all connection with the cue, the timing had gone, the touch had gone, feeling had gone. Years and years of that mounted up and it got to the point where I couldn't play and it got too much.\n\"It got to the point where I couldn't pull the cue forwards and backwards, which was quite scary.\"\nO'Sullivan beat Carter in the Crucible finals in 2008 and 2012\nFour seeded players, including world champions Kyren Wilson and Neil Robertson and last year's runner-up Jak Jones have been eliminated from O'Sullivan's half of the draw.\nChinese qualifier Pang Junxu is his opponent in the second round, although O'Sullivan said he enjoyed his Crucible return because he had not placed any expectations on himself. \n\"This game can humble you so many times,\" said O'Sullivan. \"To play one good session. It was a nice feeling and I did enjoy being out there.\n\"I didn't feel too nervous because my expectation levels were maybe just to get a few frames and see where we go. I didn't feel pressure and normally when I come here with a half-decent game I feel pressure more as it is a chance to go deep [into the draw], but on this occasion I wasn't expecting to do much.\n\"I'm going to give myself two years. No more exhibitions, no more distractions off the table. It might take one month, six months, a year and give it a good go. I owe it to snooker and to myself. I just have to put everything into this tournament.\"\nCarter felt O'Sullivan would claim an eighth world title if he could maintain the form he showed on Wednesday.\n\"No question, no-one can live with that,\" said the world number 18. \"He could've had 10 years off and still come here. He is a freak natural, that's why you love to watch him - he played fabulously well.\n\"When the opponent is potting all the balls every mistake is highlighted and you just have to sit and watch and hope. He looks like he is in a good place and he is the man to beat.\"\nJohn Parrott, the 1991 world champion, speaking on BBC Two, added: \"There should be a sign in the foyer which should say 'Quiet please, genius at work'.\n\"We use the word 'genius' in sport with people like Lionel Messi and players like Tiger Woods in his pomp. This boy is in that [bracket]. It's been over an extended period as well, and when he plays the cue ball sings.\n\"O'Sullivan seems in a very good place. He was born to play snooker, and when he's out there he's at peace with it.\"\nRuthless O'Sullivan cruises into Crucible last 16\nWatch: World Snooker Championship - Trump leads Zhou, Selby v Woollaston\nWorld Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coverage",

The attack has been claimed by an al-Qaeda-linked group - Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen, (Jnim), which is based in Mali but has in recent years expanded its operations to neighbouring countries.The jihadist group had said it killed 70 soldiers in raids on two military posts in the north, according to intelligence group SITE.Jnim is one of several jihadist groups operating in West Africa's Sahel region, especially Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, where the military governments are struggling to contain the insurgency.Benin and Togo have seen a rise in jihadist activity in recent years, as groups linked to Islamic State and al-Qaeda spread to the south. \"We won't give in... \"Heavy losses for the nation,\" wrote presidential spokesman Serge Nonvignon in a Facebook post on Wednesday.Another government spokesperson, Wilfried Leandre Houngbedji, said that Benin was determined to continue the fight against the jihadists. The authorities had previously said that only eight soldiers were killed.",

While Tierney, he says, could play further infield, his strengths are more using his pace and dribbling ability to get behind defences and put crosses into the box.\nThose different strengths are why the Celtic manager sees them \"dovetailing perfectly\".\nBut it's not just about ability, but personality as well.

He's in tune with what being a Celtic player is about. You look at James [Forrest], Callum [McGregor], they live with the expectation, the feeling and what the demands are of this club and Greg lives that feeling as well.\"\nAll that said, no player is perfect. Taylor's lack of height and pace does leave him vulnerable when stepping up to Champions League level.\nComparing his defensive output to that of Celtic's right-back Alistair Johnston in European games this season suggests this.\nThe Canadian's duel success rate is 54% compared to Taylor's 46%, while the difference in tackle success is 14% in Johnston's favour, while naturally he was more effective at winning aerial duels too given his height advantage.\nWith less time and space, Taylor's impact in the middle of the pitch is also reduced.\nMichael Olise's goal for Bayern at Celtic Park was an example of Taylor being undone by a ball in behind due to a lack of pace and poor judgment, and he was dropped for Crystal Palace loanee Jeffrey Schlupp for the return leg.\nAnd while any player is capable of being undone at Champions League level and Taylor still played his part in the successes in Europe, one of the big appeals of bringing Tierney back are his physical attributes - when fit - and dogged one-on-one defending.\nRodgers has often mentioned a lack of running power and athleticism as reasons why Celtic struggled in the Champions League for so long, something a fit Tierney will help solve.\nThe question for Celtic, though, is not whether they should keep Taylor but, at what point does it become too expensive to?\nA player of Tierney's pedigree will not come cheaply in wages, and so paying two essentially 'first choice' left-backs would be a big call, and not something Celtic would usually do.\nThe other option is to bring in a younger, cheaper understudy to play the minutes Tierney will miss, with the hope they develop and grow in ability and value.\nThose are the solutions Celtic will be considering.

        "article_text": "The relationship between William Shakespeare and his wife Anne Hathaway may have been happier than previously thought, according to new research.\nFor more than 200 years it has been believed that Shakespeare left his wife in Stratford-upon-Avon when he travelled to London and that a decision to leave her almost nothing in his will meant he probably felt bitterness towards her.\nHowever, examination of a fragment of a letter, which is addressed to \"good Mrs Shakespeare\", appears to show they did live together in central London between 1600-1610.\nThe research was carried out by Prof Matthew Steggle from the University of Bristol's Department of English.\nIn the letter, which was preserved by accident in the binding of a book in Hereford, it is alleged that Shakespeare is withholding money from an orphan boy named John Butts, with the letter asking Mrs Shakespeare for money instead.\nProf Steggle said: \"First discovered in 1978, the letter's been known for a while, but no-one could identify the names or places involved or see any reason to think that the Mr Shakespeare in the letter was necessarily William rather than anyone else of the same name in the general period.\n\"So, it's a story about the Shakespeares' marriage, really, as well as about Shakespeare's London contacts.  \n\"And if the writing on the back of the letter is a reply, then it's also a story about the first ever bit of writing which can be attributed to Anne Hathaway.\"\nThe letter refers to the boy being a fatherless apprentice and through his research Prof Steggle says there was only one person in London called John Butts who fits that criterion.\nThe letter also refers to a Trinity Lane and of the four married couples called Shakspaire (spelling of the time) known to be in London in that period, only William and Anne are likely to have lived in that area.\n\"It at least doubles the number of letters known to be addressed to or sent from Shakespeare and his family,\" Prof Steggle said.\n\"Currently, there's only one known. It also shows a side of Shakespeare's London life that's not been known before, giving him a new address in Trinity Lane and a whole new sphere of activity for him.\"\nProf Steggle said it \"opens the door\" to the idea Shakespeare's wife did indeed spend \"significant\" time with her husband in London.\n\"It's not a complete slam dunk,\" he told the BBC.\n\"It's a possibility that seems difficult to avoid, rather than a certainty.\"\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, author Maggie O'Farrell, whose book Hamnet is a fictionalised account of the marriage between Shakespeare and his wife as they deal with the loss of their son, called the discovery \"thrilling\" and \"wonderful\". \n\"There have been very respected scholars who've said that she was ugly, that Shakespeare hated her, that she trapped him into marriage, that she was illiterate, that she was stupid,\" Ms O'Farrell said.\n\"There is absolutely not one shred of evidence for any of that and it's always baffled me as to why she attracts all this vilification and all this misogyny.\n\"And it's so wonderful to find this tiny fragment of a letter which was discovered in the binding of a book that was published in 1608, that proves of course that they did love each other and probably lived together for some time in London.\"\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "summary": "Letter reveals Shakespeare did not abandon his wife23 hours agoShareSaveJames DiamondBBC News, BristolShareSavePA MediaNew research suggests Shakespeare's relationship with his wife was stronger than previously thoughtThe relationship between William Shakespeare and his wife Anne Hathaway may have been happier than previously thought, according to new research.For more than 200 years it has been believed that Shakespeare left his wife in Stratford-upon-Avon when he travelled to London and that a decision to leave her almost nothing in his will meant he probably felt bitterness towards her.However, examination of a fragment of a letter, which is addressed to \"good Mrs Shakespeare\", appears to show they did live together in central London between 1600-1610.The research was carried out by Prof Matthew Steggle from the University of Bristol's Department of English.In the letter, which was preserved by accident in the binding of a book in Hereford, it is alleged that Shakespeare is withholding money from an orphan boy named John Butts, with the letter asking Mrs Shakespeare for money instead.Prof Steggle said: \"First discovered in 1978, the letter's been known for a while, but no-one could identify the names or places involved or see any reason to think that the Mr Shakespeare in the letter was necessarily William rather than anyone else of the same name in the general period. \"Hereford Cathedral and Hereford Mappa Mundi TrustThe early 17th Century letter was found within the binding of a bookThe letter refers to the boy being a fatherless apprentice and through his research Prof Steggle says there was only one person in London called John Butts who fits that criterion.The letter also refers to a Trinity Lane and of the four married couples called Shakspaire (spelling of the time) known to be in London in that period, only William and Anne are likely to have lived in that area. \"'They did love each other'Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, author Maggie O'Farrell, whose book Hamnet is a fictionalised account of the marriage between Shakespeare and his wife as they deal with the loss of their son, called the discovery \"thrilling\" and \"wonderful\". \"Prof Steggle said it \"opens the door\" to the idea Shakespeare's wife did indeed spend \"significant\" time with her husband in London. \"It at least doubles the number of letters known to be addressed to or sent from Shakespeare and his family,\" Prof Steggle said.",

        "article_text": "In India, you can face criminal charges for tethering an animal on the street, flying a kite in a manner that causes alarm, skipping a school attendance order or handing a feeding bottle to a mother who can't breastfeed.\nOf the 882 federal laws on the books, 370 contain criminal provisions - together criminalising 7,305 acts and omissions. These range from the absurd to the serious: failing to give a month's notice before quitting your job or not walking your dog enough, to offences like illegal arms possession, murder and sexual assault.\nDelhi-based think-tank Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy calls it \"India's crisis of over-criminalisation\".\nIn a new report, The State of the System: Understanding the Scale of Crime and Punishment in India, the think-tank has produced the country's first comprehensive database of crimes, mapping the extent of criminalisation across 370 federal laws.\nThe report flags India's habit of reaching for criminal law to solve just about everything - even the mundane. It notes that many laws criminalise \"routine, everyday actions\". \nYou could, for instance, be charged for tethering your goat on a public street, fixing a leaky tap without a licence or not naming the owner of a building when asked. \nThen there are the truly obscure offences - like a parent ignoring a school attendance order, applying for a driver's licence when banned or littering in a zoo. Basically, there's a criminal penalty waiting around every corner of daily life.\nLet your pigs wander on to a field or road and you could be fined 10 rupees (12 cents). Disturb an animal or litter in a zoo? Six months in jail or a 2,000-rupee fine. And failing to exercise your dog can cost you up to 100 rupees and three months in jail.\nPromoting infant milk substitutes or feeding bottles to pregnant women or mothers can lead to up to three years in jail or a 5,000-rupee fine. (This was meant to curb aggressive marketing by formula food companies, but the law also applies to individuals, which makes it controversial.)\nJail is the go-to punishment in India - 73% of crimes carry prison terms ranging from a single day to 20 years.\nMore than 250 offences across 117 laws penalise delays in filing documents - everything from wealth and property tax returns to gift declarations, the report finds. \nSome 124 crimes across 80 laws criminalise obstructing a public officer, often without clearly defining what causes \"obstruction\". \nEven the death penalty isn't off the table - not just for murder or mutiny, but for damaging an oil or gas pipeline or a sentry caught sleeping on duty. In all, a staggering 301 offences in India can legally cost you your life.\nOut of 7,305 offences under central laws, nearly 80% come with fines - from as low as two rupees to a staggering 50m rupees. \nTo be fair, many of these provisions are rarely used - India's crime records bureau tracks around 50 laws, even though 370 carry criminal penalties.\n\"They're not heavily enforced, but they create ample opportunities for rent-seeking,\" Naveed Mehmood Ahmad, co-author of the study at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, told me.\n\"There's enough in the books to jail almost anyone for some technical non-compliance. It's less about actual use and more about the potential for misuse.\"  \nThis \"excessive use of criminal law not only disrupts the daily lives of ordinary citizens but also creates significant barriers for business operations\", the report says. \nBusinesses in India face a maze of regulations, but using criminal law as the default for non-compliance is excessive, disproportionate and often counter-productive, experts say.\nThe report also talks about some glaring inconsistencies in crime and punishment.\nRioting - the use of force or violence by an unlawful assembly - is punishable with up to two years of imprisonment. Meanwhile, falsely reporting a birth or death for official records can lead to three years of imprisonment. \nThe irony? Violence in public gets a lighter sentence than a lie on paper.\nEven more striking: crimes of vastly different severity carry the same penalty - like practicing homoeopathy without a licence, jumping a red light, or forcing someone into labour - all punishable with a one-year sentence.\nThe sheer number of crimes tied to everyday life and business shows how heavily the state leans on criminalisation to enforce compliance, the report says.\n\"This over-reliance has significant costs, not just for citizens and businesses, but also for state machinery.\"\nOver 34 million criminal cases are pending in India's courts, with 72% stuck for more than a year. Prisons are overcrowded, running at 131% capacity, while courts and police forces continue to grapple with chronic staff shortages\nEven the law-and-order machinery is stretched. As of 1 January 2023, India had just 154 police personnel per 100,000 people - well below the sanctioned 195. Nationwide, there are 581,000 vacancies against an approved strength of 2.72 million.\n\"Even then, we continue to rely on this overburdened system to combat minor infractions, including those that attract nominal fines,\" the report says.\nIt says that criminal law should be limited to acts that threaten core societal values - like public safety, national security, life, liberty, property and social harmony.\nAuthorities say they plan to scrap criminal penalties in more than 100 legal provisions - on top of the 180 already axed in 2023. It's not just legal clean-up; it's a chance to rethink how the law treats people. Less fear, more trust. Less suspect, more citizen.  ",

        "article_text": "Shannon Sharpe, a Superbowl champion and host of a popular podcast, has been accused of sexual assault in a Nevada lawsuit. \nThe lawsuit was brought by a woman who alleges Mr Sharpe used his fame to \"manipulate, control, subjugate and violate women\". \nThe accuser, who was 19 at the time she met Mr Sharpe in 2023, says in a legal filing that the pair had a nearly two-year relationship, during which time Mr Sharpe was \"aggressive\" and allegedly raped her.  \nMr Sharpe has denied the allegations and said he is the target of a \"shakedown\". \nThe suit seeks more than $50 million (\u00a337.6 million) in compensatory and punitive damages. \nThe accuser is the only person suing, and she does not provide details on her accusation that Mr Sharpe hurt more than herself.\nAccording to the suit, the woman met Mr Sharpe, currently aged 56, in a Los Angeles gym and had a \"rocky consensual relationship\". \n\"After many months of manipulating and controlling Plaintiff \u2014 a woman more than thirty years younger than he \u2014 and repeatedly threatening to brutally choke and violently slap her, Sharpe refused to accept the answer no and raped Plaintiff, despite her sobbing and repeated screams of 'no,'\" the complaint alleges.\nThe woman alleges that Mr Sharpe raped her as recently as January.\nIn addition, she alleges in the suit  that Mr Sharpe insisted on recording some of the sexual encounters, sometimes without her consent or knowledge, shared the videos with his \" friends and associates\". \nMr Sharpe has 4 million subscribers to his Club Shay Shay podcast, and is reportedly in negotiations on a $100m deal for his network of shows.\n\"This is a shakedown,\" he said in a video posted to Instagram late Tuesday, addressing the lawsuit. \"I'm going to be open, transparent and defend myself, because this isn't right.\"\n Mr Sharpe then accused the woman's lawyer, Tony Buzbee, of filing a fraudulent lawsuit and threatened to sue for defamation.\nMr Buzbee represented a plaintiff who accused rapper Jay-z of misconduct and ultimately rescinded her allegation. He also worked with several female massage therapists who accused NFL star Deshaun Watson of sexual assault. \n\"I believe he's going to release a 30-second clip of a sex tape that tries to make me look guilty and play into every stereotype you could possibly imagine,\" Sharpe said. \"That video should actually be 10 minutes or so. Hey, Tony, instead of releasing your edit, put the whole video out. I don't have it, or I would myself.\"\nLast year, Mr Sharpe livestreamed audio of an intimate encounter with his millions of followers on Instagram, and later apologised, saying he had mistakenly turned on the app's \"Live\" feature.\nMr Sharpe played in the NFL for 14 years and won three Super Bowls. He went on to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and has had a long sports broadcasting career.",

O'Sullivan charges into last 16\nRonnie O'Sullivan has said he was \"worried\" about returning to snooker, fearing he would \"implode\" and \"have a meltdown\" in his first competitive match since January.\nO'Sullivan, 49, beat Ali Carter 10-4 on Wednesday in the first round of the World Championship, a competition he has won seven times.\nHowever, his participation in the tournament was only confirmed late last week after he went three months without playing competitively following an incident at the Championship League in January in which he snapped his cue and threw it in a bin.\n\"I lost the buzz for playing because I wasn't able to execute shots,\" said O'Sullivan. \"I was bailing out of shots. I was having to play a different game that I didn't enjoy and it didn't feel like I could express myself, so it got really tough.\"\nRonnie O'Sullivan has won the World Snooker Championship seven times and is aiming to become the first man in the modern era to gain eight titles\nAsked if there were times in the past week where he thought he had made a mistake about returning to snooker, O'Sullivan said: \"Yeah, totally. \n\"I thought 'what am I doing coming here, exposing myself, [potentially] imploding out there, having a meltdown?' All that went through my head. I told [sports psychiatrist] Steve Peters that and he said 'I'm coming - I will get you through the first match'.\n\"I was quite a bit scared coming and playing. It's a daunting venue to play at anyway but it's about getting on the bike again and playing and I'm really proud that I've done that.\n\"Even if I had lost, it didn't really matter. I made that breakthrough. There's still a lot of work to do.\"\nO'Sullivan scored 583 points in five frames on Wednesday, compared with just 43 for Ali Carter\nIn Tuesday's first session against two-time Crucible finalist Carter, neither player was at their best, with it seemingly finely balanced at 5-4 to O'Sullivan.\nBut on Wednesday, 'The Rocket' was in sensational form, winning all five frames and not letting Carter score a point in four of them.\nO'Sullivan made breaks of 59, 117, 74, 123 and 131, but in the post-match news conference stressed he was trying to \"rebuild\" his technique after losing faith in his ability.\nHe said: \"I couldn't even watch myself play as I could see what was wrong. I just couldn't correct it and every time you make a change you think 'this is terrible'.\n\"I've changed my alignment, changed certain things. I had lost all connection with the cue, the timing had gone, the touch had gone, feeling had gone. Years and years of that mounted up and it got to the point where I couldn't play and it got too much.\n\"It got to the point where I couldn't pull the cue forwards and backwards, which was quite scary.\"\nO'Sullivan beat Carter in the Crucible finals in 2008 and 2012\nFour seeded players, including world champions Kyren Wilson and Neil Robertson and last year's runner-up Jak Jones have been eliminated from O'Sullivan's half of the draw.\nChinese qualifier Pang Junxu is his opponent in the second round, although O'Sullivan said he enjoyed his Crucible return because he had not placed any expectations on himself. \n\"This game can humble you so many times,\" said O'Sullivan. \"To play one good session. It was a nice feeling and I did enjoy being out there.\n\"I didn't feel too nervous because my expectation levels were maybe just to get a few frames and see where we go. I didn't feel pressure and normally when I come here with a half-decent game I feel pressure more as it is a chance to go deep [into the draw], but on this occasion I wasn't expecting to do much.\n\"I'm going to give myself two years. No more exhibitions, no more distractions off the table. It might take one month, six months, a year and give it a good go. I owe it to snooker and to myself. I just have to put everything into this tournament.\"\nCarter felt O'Sullivan would claim an eighth world title if he could maintain the form he showed on Wednesday.\n\"No question, no-one can live with that,\" said the world number 18. \"He could've had 10 years off and still come here. He is a freak natural, that's why you love to watch him - he played fabulously well.\n\"When the opponent is potting all the balls every mistake is highlighted and you just have to sit and watch and hope. He looks like he is in a good place and he is the man to beat.\"\nJohn Parrott, the 1991 world champion, speaking on BBC Two, added: \"There should be a sign in the foyer which should say 'Quiet please, genius at work'.\n\"We use the word 'genius' in sport with people like Lionel Messi and players like Tiger Woods in his pomp. This boy is in that [bracket]. It's been over an extended period as well, and when he plays the cue ball sings.\n\"O'Sullivan seems in a very good place. He was born to play snooker, and when he's out there he's at peace with it.\"\nRuthless O'Sullivan cruises into Crucible last 16\nWatch: World Snooker Championship - Trump leads Zhou, Selby v Woollaston\nWorld Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coverage",

International journalists including the BBC are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently so are unable to independently verify figures.\nSpeaking to Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 , Kneecap's manager said: \"If somebody is hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by, but it's really important to speak truth.\"\nDaniel Lambert added: \"Thankfully the lads are not afraid to do that.\"\nHe also said the band had received death threats following their performance at Coachella and described the threats as \"too severe to get into\".\nIn a statement to BBC News NI, the US State Department said when considering revocations, they look at information that \"may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under US immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted\".\nThe band are set to play a number of shows in the US and Canada in coming months.\nOn Tuesday, Osbourne claimed on social media the band's actions included \"projections of anti-Israel messages and hate speech\".\n\"This band openly support terrorist organizations,\" she added.\nMs Osbourne was also critical of the organisers of the festival, Goldenvoice, a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG).\n\"Reports indicate that Goldenvoice was unaware of Kneecap's political intentions when they were booked,\" Osbourne said.\n\"However, after witnessing their performance during the first weekend, allowing them to perform again the following weekend suggests support of their rhetoric and a lack of due diligence,\" she continued.\n\"This behaviour raises concerns about the appropriateness of their participation in such a festival and further shows they are booked to play in the USA,\" Osbourne said.\n\"I know for a fact that certain people in the industry had written to Goldenvoice, airing their concerns around the booking of Kneecap,\" she said.\nOsbourne is the wife of Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne, and a former judge of TV talent shows The X-Factor and America's Got Talent.\nShe also managed her husband's solo career.\nOsbourne finished her post by saying: \"As someone of both Irish Catholic on my mother's side and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage on her father's side and extensive experience in the music industry, I understand the complexities involved.\n\"I urge you to join me in advocating for the revocation of Kneecap's work visa.\" \nThe festival organisers have been approached for comment.\nWarning: This article features language that some readers may find offensive\nAt the end of their set at the second weekend of Coachella, which was not streamed on the festival's official YouTube page, Kneecap projected three screens of text.\nThe first message said: \"Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,\" followed by: \"It is being enabled by the US government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes,\" and a final screen added: \"[Expletive] Israel.

        "article_text": "Andrew Flintoff has given his first account of the car crash he was in while filming Top Gear, saying he thought he \"was dead\" in the immediate aftermath.\nThe England cricketer-turned-TV presenter sustained serious facial and rib injuries when the three-wheeler car he was driving for the BBC motoring programme rolled over in 2022.\nSpeaking in a new Disney+ documentary, 'Freddie' Flintoff said that despite the trauma, he \"remembers everything about it\".\n\"I thought I was dead, because I was conscious but I couldn't see anything,\" he recalled.\n\"I was thinking, is that it? Is that it? You know what I mean? Just black for the rest of my days?\n\"My hat came over my eyes - so I pulled my hat up and I thought, no I'm not [dead], I'm on the Top Gear track, this is not heaven.\"\nFlintoff then looked down to see blood, and said his \"biggest fear\" was that he no longer had a face left.\n\"I thought my face had come off. I was frightened to death.\"\nHe recalled being in \"agony\" for between half an hour and 40 minutes until an air ambulance arrived and he was taken to hospital.\nThe incident took place on 13 December 2022 at Top Gear's test track at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome in Surrey.\nHe was driving an open-topped Morgan Super 3 when it flipped and slid, dragging him along the track during filming.\nSpeaking in the documentary, he described how time seemed to slow down as the car rolled over, and how his quick reactions as a cricketer allowed him to move his head in an attempt to avoid even worse injuries.\n\"As it started going over, I looked at the ground and I knew, if I get hit here on the side [of the head] then I'll break my neck, or if I get hit on the temple I'm dead. The best chance is to go face down.\n\"And then I remember hitting [the ground] and my head got hit,\" he added. \"But then I got dragged out, and the car went over, and I went over the back of the car, and then [I got] pulled face down on the runway about 50m underneath the car. And then I hit the grass and then [it] flipped back.\"\nSurgeon Jahrad Haq, who treated Flintoff, told the documentary the injuries were \"very complex\" - a mixture of hard and soft tissue injuries, broken teeth, lost teeth and elements of the upper jaw bone that were also fractured and displaced.\nHe \"lost a really significant portion of his upper lip - the skin and some of the underlying muscle - and also his lower lip,\" he said.\nMr Haq said the injuries were in the \"top five\" in terms of severity of those he had seen during his career.\nReflecting on the recovery, Flintoff said he \"didn't think I had it in me to get through\" the ordeal.\n\"This sounds awful. Part of me wishes I'd been killed. Part of me thinks I wish I'd died,\" he added.\n\"I didn't want to kill myself. I don't want to mistake the two things. I was not wishing, but thinking, this would have been so much easier...\n\"Now I try to take the attitude, you know what, the sun will come up tomorrow, and then my kids will still give me a hug, and I'm probably in a better place now.\"\nOne of England's most successful cricketers, Flintoff previously said he is \"loving\" his return to the sport coaching England Lions - the development squad underneath England Men's cricket team.\nFlintoff's wife Rachael told the documentary his return to the sport was crucial on the road to recovery. \n\"When Andrew needed it most, cricket was there for him,\" she said. \"It sounds a bit weird saying it, a bit over the top to say, but I do think cricket saved him. It gave him a reason for being, again.\"\nThe 47-year-old also returned to television last year with a second series of his BBC programme Freddie Flintoff's Field of Dreams, which saw him take a team of young cricketers from his hometown of Preston on a tour of India, a year after his crash.\nThe acclaimed series is up for a Bafta Television Award in the factual series category next month.\nHe also hosted a reboot of darts game show Bullseye over Christmas, which will return for a full series later this year.\nIn 2023, the BBC \"rested\" Top Gear for the foreseeable future. A financial settlement was also reached with Flintoff.\nThe documentary, titled Flintoff, is on Disney+ from Friday, 25 April.",

        "article_text": "Russia's ceasefire in Ukraine lasted only 30 hours, and even then it appears to have been very limited in scope, with accusations of violations on both sides.\nKyiv said there had been no \"air raids alerts\" on Sunday during Vladimir Putin's \"Easter truce\" and President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested this could be the \"easiest\" format to extend for 30 days and possibly more.\nThe US had tried to organise a 30-day ceasefire but that never took hold, and this latest chapter underscores the difficulty in achieving even a brief pause in fighting,\nRussia insisted on a number of conditions, including a halt to Ukraine re-arming and recruiting new fighters as well as \"underlying causes of the conflict\".\nOne major factor hampering the talks' progress is the long history of broken ceasefire deals, resulting in deep mistrust between the two neighbours.\nDuring his tempestuous meeting with Donald Trump in February, Zelensky accused Russia of violating 25 ceasefire agreements since 2014, and argued that no such deal would hold without security guarantees.\nIn turn, Russia accuses the Ukrainian president of being \"incapable\" of implementing any such agreements.\nIndependent experts say Russia bears the brunt of the blame for broken truces, even though Ukraine bears some responsibility, too.\nStatements by current and former Russian officials also indicate that Moscow would be prepared to cease hostilities, only if its original objectives are achieved - namely a demilitarised, neutral and non-nuclear Ukraine.\nBy invading Ukraine in 2014, Russia violated the Agreement on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership between the two countries signed in 1997. Article 2 said the sides \"respect each other's territorial integrity and confirm the inviolability of existing borders between them\".\nThe war has been rife with accusations of treachery from the very beginning. \nGen Viktor Muzhenko, the chief of Ukraine's General Staff at the time, accuses Russia of going back on agreements allowing Ukrainian troops to pull out from the eastern town of Ilovaysk in August 2014. \nAs a result, withdrawing convoys came under fire, and at least 366 Ukrainian fighters were killed.\nThe first major ceasefire agreement, signed on 5 September 2014 in Minsk, was broken within hours of being signed, with Ukrainian sources reporting attacks by Russian proxy forces on Donetsk airport. Attacks on other Ukrainian towns in the region, such as Debaltseve, continued, too.\nThis prompted the second attempted truce, known as Minsk-2, but it was even shorter. \nWithin minutes of it going into effect on 15 February 2015, observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reported mortar and artillery fire in Donetsk. They were deployed to the war zone at Ukraine's request to monitor the security situation including any ceasefire violations, but they did not explicitly say who committed them.\nWhat followed was a string of other failed ceasefire attempts. Again, some were broken within minutes of coming into force.\nThey included Easter truces in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the \"school ceasefires\" of 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 which were meant to allow schoolchildren near the frontline to go back to school in September, Christmas and New Year ceasefires in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and the \"bread ceasefires\" of 2017, 2018 and 2019 to allow the harvesting of grain, and others.\nA \"comprehensive ceasefire\" that went into effect on 27 July 2020 only lasted 20 minutes, according to Kyiv. Still, it had an effect on the fighting, halving the number of fatalities among Ukrainian soldiers in the following year.\nMatthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, argues that Russia has never entered ceasefire talks in good faith.\n\"Russia has never been sincere about removing or ending the risk of the use of force in seeking its objectives,\" he says.\nBecause of various ceasefire agreements between Ukraine and Russia, \"the level of fighting has ebbed and flowed, and Ukraine bears some responsibility for part of that\", he tells the BBC. \n\"But the underlying challenge has been that there has always been a Russian or Russian-backed military threat, and that informs things.\"\nJohn Herbst, a former US ambassador to Kyiv who now works for the Washington-based think-tank Atlantic Council, argues that Russia, not Ukraine was the \"serial violator\" of the Minsk ceasefire accords, the first and still one of the most comprehensive attempts to broker a truce in Ukraine.\nVerifying claims of ceasefire violations is not easy because almost all independent journalists are banned from Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine.\nBBC journalist Olga Ivshina, who was on the ground in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region reporting about the earlier stages of the war, says there were reports of Ukraine retaking villages in 2016-19, a successful Ukrainian offensive outside Mariupol, and Ukrainian tanks were spotted too close to the frontline, where they should not have been under the ceasefire deals.\n\"All of these were proclaimed as violations by Moscow. But of course they forgot to mention that their capture of Debaltseve in 2015 was the biggest violation of all,\" Ivshina says. \nDespite the Minsk accords, Russian-controlled forces launched an offensive against the town of Debaltseve, claiming that it was not covered by the ceasefire deal.\nZelensky has described the Minsk accords as a \"trap\" for Ukraine which allowed Russia to prepare for the full-scale invasion. \nPutin says neither Ukraine nor its Western backers had intended to implement the Minsk deals. Their fate was sealed when Russia declared the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk \"people's republics\" - separatist entities it had helped to set up - as independent states.\nPutin's \"Easter truce\" was never more than a lull, but President Trump said \"hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week\".\nSo far there has been no indication that the Kremlin will accept the US call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, agreed to by Ukraine. \nTrump has already warned that if either party makes ceasefire talks difficult, \"we're just gonna take a pass\" and walk away.\nRussia's demand for \"the underlying causes of the conflict\" to be resolved suggest it has not moved from its original objective of undermining Ukraine's sovereignty - through negotiations as well as military means.\nVladislav Surkov, a former close adviser to Vladimir Putin who was known as the \"grey cardinal\" of Russian politics, celebrates the Minsk accords last year as a way of \"legitimising\" Ukraine's initial partition.\nThe very idea of peace, he said, wass \"nothing but a continuation of war by other means\".",

        "article_text": "McLaren's Oscar Piastri leads the 2025 drivers' championship after victory in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\nAfter the first triple header of the season, there is a week's break before Formula 1 heads to Miami from 2-4 May.\nBefore that, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions following the race in Jeddah.\nWill Max Verstappen modify his driving as a result of the decision to give him a five-second penalty in Saudi Arabia? - Kate\nMax Verstappen was given a five-second penalty in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because the stewards adjudged him to have gained an advantage by leaving the track while contesting the lead with McLaren's Oscar Piastri at the first corner.\nThe stewards pointed to the driving standards guidelines in making their decision, reporting that \"Car 81 (Piastri) had its front axle at least alongside the mirror of Car One (Verstappen) prior to and at the apex of corner one when trying to overtake Car One on the inside.\n\"In fact, Car 81 was alongside Car One at the apex. Based on the drivers' standards guidelines, it was therefore Car 81's corner and he was entitled to be given room.\"\nVerstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".\nThe guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option. \nBut Verstappen races hard, and pushes the limit of the rules. In critical situations such as this, he will do everything he can to keep position, and then force the stewards to make a decision.\nThis is understandable on two levels: first, the advantage of being in front and running in clean air is significant, as the race subsequently showed, and if he ends up being allowed to keep the position, it can win him the race; second, in the past, the stewards have often chosen not to punish him.\nHowever, the guidelines have changed this year, after significant pressure from the other drivers, exactly because of the way Verstappen races.\nThis was the first time the new rules have been tested with Verstappen, and this time his approach did not work. But he has had a lifetime of racing this way, so it would be quite a switch for him to change his approach.\nHaving said that, he is smart as well as tough. It would be a surprise if he did not learn from this incident in some ways for next time.\nFrom Piastri's side, he has now laid down a marker to Verstappen. He is a decisive, clinical racer who is not to be intimidated.\nVerstappen and Piastri go into the first corner side by side in Saudi Arabia\nDoes Lando Norris need to go sit down with Nico Rosberg to understand how he changed his mentality in his championship year? \u2013 Gary\nIn 2016, Nico Rosberg won the championship by pushing himself to the limit to be able to compete with an essentially faster team-mate in Lewis Hamilton, ensuring he was his best self all the time and hoping that would be enough.\nRosberg was handed a significant advantage with the comparative reliability of the two Mercedes at the start of the season, and even then Hamilton would have clawed the advantage back had he not had an engine failure while leading in Malaysia late in the season.\nThe situation at McLaren this year feels different. In 2024, Norris was decisively the faster and more convincing McLaren driver over the season. In 2025 so far, that has been Piastri.\nNorris is struggling to adapt to certain characteristics of the McLaren - particularly its lack of front grip at certain phases of the corner with his driving style.\nBut he is aware of what he needs to do. As he put it in Jeddah on Sunday: \"It's my qualifying, my Saturdays, which are not good enough at the minute. That's because I am struggling a little bit with the car.\n\"Yesterday was not the car, it was just me trying to take too many risks.\n\"So I just have to peg it back. I've got the pace. It's all in there. It's just sometimes I ask for a bit too much and sometimes I get a bit too 'ego' probably and try to put the perfect lap together. I just need to chill out a little bit.\"\nOf course when the margins are so tight - pole is being decided by hundredths of a second at each race - it's one thing to say that, and another to do it without coming off second best.\nDuring the race in Saudi Arabia, Liam Lawson picked up a 10-second penalty for completing his pass on Jack Doohan off-track, so gained an advantage. Max Verstappen only got five seconds for his off-track advantage. What's the difference between these two? - James\nAs the stewards explained in the verdict on Verstappen: \"Ordinarily, the baseline penalty for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage is 10 seconds.\n\"However, given that this was lap one and a turn one incident, we considered that to be a mitigating circumstance and imposed a five-second time penalty instead.\"\nSo Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.\nWhy can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. drive-through etc) rather than at a pit stop or after the race is completed? \u2013 Neil\nAfter the controversy of the title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi in 2021, it was decided that teams should no longer be able to talk directly to the race director during a grand prix.\nHowever, they can still talk to his assistants in race control and discuss incidents. So when a driver does a manoeuvre that looks borderline, teams have three options.\nThey can choose proactively to give the place back - as McLaren did with Lando Norris against Lewis Hamilton in Bahrain.\nThey can get in touch with race control and ask for an opinion on the move, and then make a decision as to what to do about it.\nOr they can plough on and hope for the best, as Red Bull did in Jeddah.\nThe FIA stewards will then make their decision as to how to handle it. They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.\nOf course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.\nThis is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.\nSome people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. But it is where the sport has landed for now.\nSaudi 'horrible' & 2025 looking 'painful' - Hamilton\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix review\nWilliams have already beaten their 2024 full season points total. What has made them so much better? \u2013 Stewart\nWilliams' progress this season is a direct result of the investment put in by owners Dorilton since they took over in 2020 and the changes to the team made under new boss James Vowles.\nInto last year, the introduction of new factory processes caused a difficult winter, the car barely made the first test and it was overweight for the first chunk of the season.\nThe difference this year was dramatic - their launch was held at Silverstone in public view in mid-February, and they ran the car for the first time there.\nWilliams are very much focused on 2026 and the new rules being introduced then, but as Vowles put it at the launch: \"What I can demonstrate is very clear progress that's taken place in manufacture, process, technology kicking in.\n\"We are moving into a new building this year, a benchmark driver in-the-loop simulator, that was started in 2023. The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it. But I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nBeing on the weight limit sounds like a small detail but is actually a big deal. Last year, it was costing them not far off 0.5 seconds a lap early in the year. Add that to this year's performance, and instead of being the fifth quickest car on average, as they are now, they would be eighth fastest, ahead of only Haas and Sauber.\nOn top of that, Williams now has two world-class drivers rather than just one. And they are not crashing like they were last year.\nAlex Albon ran with the car's improved performance and scored good points in the first three races, while both he and Carlos Sainz were in the top 10 in Saudi Arabia.\nSo, in a nutshell, the team has made progress, they have a better driver line-up and you're seeing it in the performance of the car.\n\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson",

        "article_text": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he will step back from his role with the Trump administration's cost-cutting team known as Doge. \nThose at the White House, including the president, have said it has long been the plan that Musk would soon step away, but the news came as the billionaire's car business saw earnings plunge. \nMusk's announcement left many unanswered questions, including when he will  actually leave the administration and what will happen to Doge, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency.\nWhen asked by the BBC on Wednesday, President Donald Trump reinforced the message that the administration was preparing for Musk's departure. \n\"We have to, at some point, let him go and do that. We expected to be doing it about this time. I'll talk to Elon about it,\" Trump said at the White House.\nThe president also said Tesla will \"be taken care of\" once Musk returns and alleged that Musk was being \"treated very unfairly, I guess, by some of the public\".\n\"He's a great patriot, and [that] should have never happened to him,\" Trump added.\nHowever, under government rules, spending fewer days at Doge could actually prolong Musk's stint in government.\nMusk has been designated a \"special government employee\" (SGE) \u2013 a label that allows him to work at a paid or unpaid government job for 130 days each year.\nAccording to a 2007 Department of Justice memo, cited in an October 2024 guidance document from the Office of Government Ethics, any day on which an SGE performs any work for the government counts as a full day towards that limit.\nMeasured from Trump's inauguration on 20 January, the 130-day limit - assuming Musk, who brags about working weekends, clocks roughly five days a week at Doge - would run out toward the end of May.\nBut scaling back would extend that timeframe. Additionally, the 130-day limit would reset in January 2026.\nMusk has not given details on his intended schedule. He made the announcement on Tuesday, after Tesla reported financial troubles including a 71% drop in profits. \nThe drop came after repeated \"Tesla takedown\" protests across the globe and calls for boycotts against the car manufacturer amid Musk's government role. While organisers have said most protests have been peaceful, some have been destructive with fires set at Tesla showrooms or at charging stations. \nThe company warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying \"changing political sentiment\" could meaningfully hurt demand for the vehicles. \nMusk told investors on an earnings call that the time he allocates to Doge \"will drop significantly\" and that he would be \"allocating far more of my time to Tesla\". \nAfter the comments, Tesla's languishing stock price rose.\nIt's also unclear how many days Musk has already worked for the government, whether the government is keeping a tally, and how the limit would be enforced. \nThere has been criticism that the Trump administration may have flouted government rules in creating Musk's unprecedented role, and concerns that he may not follow the time limit.\nUnder rules for SGEs, Musk would have to undergo ethics training, provide a confidential financial disclosure statement, and avoid conflicts of interest. \nHis corporate empire includes large companies that do business with the US government and foreign governments, including SpaceX, which has $22 billion in US government contracts, according to the company's chief executive.\nThe rules also prohibit special government employees from partisan activities, including wearing clothing with political slogans, while in government offices or carrying out official duties. Musk has been pictured wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat in the Oval Office.\nStill, in February, an anonymous White House official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that Musk would file a confidential financial disclosure at some point, and had been given an ethics briefing.\nThe following month, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the BBC: \"Elon Musk is selflessly serving President Trump's administration as a special government employee, and he has abided by all applicable federal laws.\"\nFor now, Musk appears to serve at Trump's behest, with no clear oversight other than the president himself.\nIn a report released last week, progressive think-tank Public Citizen criticised the Trump administration and said the White House was \"wildly abusing\" the SGE rules.\n\"Right now, the public has no way to know whether SGEs like Musk who don't file public financial disclosure reports or are permitted to oversee themselves are putting the people's interests ahead of their own,\" said report author Jon Golinger.\nThe BBC has contacted Musk and the Office of Personnel Management - the agency overseeing special government employees, and one where Doge employees have reportedly taken over several functions - for comment.\nOn Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that around 100 Doge employees would remain in various government departments after Musk departs this year. \nMusk and Trump set a deadline for Doge to finish its work, which corresponds to the 250th anniversary of the signing of the US Declaration of Independence.\nThe executive order setting up Doge, signed by Trump on Inauguration Day in January, mentioned 4 July 2026 as the ending date.\nEarlier, in December, Musk responded to a tweet that also said Doge would finish entirely on that date.\n\"The final step of DOGE is to delete itself,\" he wrote.",

        "article_text": "US stocks and the dollar plunged again as President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on the US central bank boss calling him \"a major loser\" for not lowering interest rates.\nIn a social media post, Trump called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates \"pre-emptively\" to help boost the economy, saying Powell had been consistently too slow to respond to economic developments. \n\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote.\nTrump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy comes as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. \nThe president's intensifying clash with Powell, whom he named to lead the Fed during his first term, has added to the market turmoil.\nThe S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest US companies, fell roughly 2.4% on Monday. It has lost roughly 12% of its value since the start of the year. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4% and has dropped about 10% so far this year, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.5% and is down roughly 18% since January.\nHowever, on Tuesday, trading on most major stock indexes in the Asia-Pacific region was subdued. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed around 0.1% lower, and the ASX 200 in Sydney closed around 0.3% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher.\nIn European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax was down around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%.\nThough the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence. \nThe dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022.\nInterest rates on US government debt also continued to rise on Tuesday, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries.\nMeanwhile, the price of gold hit a new all-time record high, breaking the $3,500 (\u00a32,613) per ounce mark as investors seek out so-called \"safe haven\" assets.\nThe precious metal is viewed as a safer place to put money during times of economic uncertainty.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said as well as tariffs, gold's appeal had also increased due there being \"no long-term resolution in sight for conflicts around the world, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza\".\n\"There are also concerns about the risk that geo-political tensions escalate as opportunities in the Arctic are eyed by the US and Russia,\" she added.\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs.\nThe latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy.\nTrump last week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\"\nSuch a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank.\nPowell last year told reporters he did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him. \nBut one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.\n\nTrump's latest comments come as top economic policymakers are gathering in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\nChristopher Meissner, a professor of economics at University of California, Davis, and who formerly worked with the IMF, told the BBC's Today programme that before the 1970s there was \"significant\" political pressure on the Federal Reserve from time to time.\n\"However, the past 30 or 40 years what we've learned is that central bank independence is the key to financial stability and low inflation. And I think this is a major reversal and we have to watch out for it,\" he added.\n\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" added Ms Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThe IMF will publish its latest growth forecasts for individual countries later, and last week it said these projections would include \"notable markdowns\".\nMr Meissner said: \"They used to say 'When the US sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold'. It'll be really curious to see if that continues.\n\"However, I think people are expecting a pretty significant downturn in the US in the coming months... and that can't be good for the rest of the world.\"\nMs Streeter said that Trump's policies had damaged the reputation of the US, which is \"no longer being seen as a calmer port in a storm\".\n\"Yields on 10\u2013year US Treasuries have held onto their recent rise above 4.4%. It's another sign of unease about the direction of the US economy, amid worries that policies playing out could keep inflation higher and slow growth, and flags the anxiety rattling through the markets right now,\" she added.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

It has lost roughly 12% of its value since the start of the year. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4% and has dropped about 10% so far this year, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.5% and is down roughly 18% since January.\nHowever, on Tuesday, trading on most major stock indexes in the Asia-Pacific region was subdued. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed around 0.1% lower, and the ASX 200 in Sydney closed around 0.3% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher.\nIn European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax was down around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%.\nThough the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence. \nThe dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022.\nInterest rates on US government debt also continued to rise on Tuesday, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries.\nMeanwhile, the price of gold hit a new all-time record high, breaking the $3,500 (\u00a32,613) per ounce mark as investors seek out so-called \"safe haven\" assets.\nThe precious metal is viewed as a safer place to put money during times of economic uncertainty.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said as well as tariffs, gold's appeal had also increased due there being \"no long-term resolution in sight for conflicts around the world, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza\".\n\"There are also concerns about the risk that geo-political tensions escalate as opportunities in the Arctic are eyed by the US and Russia,\" she added.\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs.\nThe latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy.\nTrump last week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\"\nSuch a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank.\nPowell last year told reporters he did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him. \nBut one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.\n\nTrump's latest comments come as top economic policymakers are gathering in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\nChristopher Meissner, a professor of economics at University of California, Davis, and who formerly worked with the IMF, told the BBC's Today programme that before the 1970s there was \"significant\" political pressure on the Federal Reserve from time to time.\n\"However, the past 30 or 40 years what we've learned is that central bank independence is the key to financial stability and low inflation. And I think this is a major reversal and we have to watch out for it,\" he added.\n\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" added Ms Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThe IMF will publish its latest growth forecasts for individual countries later, and last week it said these projections would include \"notable markdowns\".\nMr Meissner said: \"They used to say 'When the US sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold'. It'll be really curious to see if that continues.\n\"However, I think people are expecting a pretty significant downturn in the US in the coming months... and that can't be good for the rest of the world.\"\nMs Streeter said that Trump's policies had damaged the reputation of the US, which is \"no longer being seen as a calmer port in a storm\".\n\"Yields on 10\u2013year US Treasuries have held onto their recent rise above 4.4%. It's another sign of unease about the direction of the US economy, amid worries that policies playing out could keep inflation higher and slow growth, and flags the anxiety rattling through the markets right now,\" she added.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "The cover of a book held at a Suffolk museum was recently found to be made from the skin of a man hanged for a notorious murder almost 200 years ago.\nWilliam Corder was convicted of killing a woman in 1827, which shocked Georgian Britain and became known as the Red Barn Murder.\nCurators at Moyse's Hall Museum in Bury St Edmunds realised the book, which was on a bookshelf in an office, had been overlooked but it has now gone on display.\nIt had been donated decades ago by a family with close connections to the surgeon who anatomised Corder's body.\nSo what do we know of William Corder and the murder, which fascinates to this day?\nWilliam was from a middle-class family of tenant farmers in the village of Polstead, between Ipswich and Sudbury, at the turn of the 19th Century. \nAt the age of 22, when he and Maria Marten became lovers, he was the head of the Corder family and had a reputation as a ladies' man. Maria, who was 24 and lived at home with her mole-catcher father, a stepmother, sister, and her young son, may have seen young William as a means of escape.\nIn 1827, William came up with a plan to elope, telling Maria to meet him at the Red Barn on the Corder's farm, then run off to Ipswich to get the banns for their wedding. \nMaria was not seen again and William disappeared.\nWilliam eventually left Suffolk and wrote to the Marten family to say he had eloped with Maria to the Isle of Wight.\nIn reality, he was holed up just outside London and Maria was buried at the lovers' rendezvous, having been shot in the neck.\nAlmost a year later, legend states, Ann Marten had a dream her stepdaughter was dead and at the Red Barn. Maria's father dug with his \"mole spud\" spade and found his daughter's remains.\nAs a manhunt ensued, a newspaper editor flagged that he knew of a William Corder.\n\"He is effectively on the run, and the theory is he's lonely, and puts an advert in the newspaper asking for a new wife,\" says Dan Clarke, a heritage officer at Moyse's Hall Museum. It holds many Red Barn Murder artefacts, including two books covered in Corder's skin.\nThe authorities traced Corder, who denies any knowledge of Maria, but has a letter from Polstead telling him her body has been found.\nCorder was brought to Bury St Edmunds on 10 counts of murder, each based on a different theory about Maria's demise and to strengthen the chance of a conviction.\nIn his defence he claimed Maria had killed herself, thereby accusing the dead woman of a capital crime. He was found guilty after a two-day trial, and in a final confession said he had accidentally shot Maria during an argument.\nIt is estimated 7,000 to 10,000 people came to see him hanged outside the prison at the stroke of noon on 11 August 1828. Later that day, people queued to file past his body at the town's Shire Hall. \n\"There were so many people, the story goes they couldn't get him outside the prison, so they had to hit a hole in the side of the building and create a temporary scaffold,\" said Mr Clarke.\n\"There would have been singing and dancing, you would have been able  to buy a section of the rope afterwards.\"\nPolstead became a tourist attraction, the Red Barn and even Maria's gravestone chipped away by souvenir-hunters.\nPublic intrigue in the Red Barn Murder sparked books, plays and music, and it permeates the true crime culture to this day.\nAt a distance of two centuries, it has become a ripping yarn, the true story clouded in legend.\nIt is probably fuelled, in part, by being able to stand face-to-face with Corder's image, his eyes shut and his nostrils flared. His death mask is held at Moyse Hall and Norwich Castle.\nFor many years, until it eventually began to fall apart, his skeleton was used to teach medical students at West Suffolk Hospital.\nDisturbingly, two books were covered in his skin and part of the man's scalp, with ear included, was kept as a gruesome ornament. All are at Moyse Hall.\nTerry Deary, who created Horrible Histories, believes Corder has been \"maligned\" with Maria incorrectly portrayed as an innocent young maiden.\nMoyse's Hall said it would redress the focus on Corder with a future exhibition which will shine a light on woman victims in Suffolk history, including Maria. \nHeritage assistant Abbie Smith said 80% of its visitors were \"desperate\" to know about the Red Barn Murder.\n\"How it ended is a big factor, it was such a spectacle and people are going to be drawn to it.\n\"It's a gory, grotty one, so people seem to like that - rather worryingly.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

On-the-day \"Promming\" tickets are \u00a38 including booking fees, and seated tickets start from \u00a310 plus booking fees.\nThe all-nighter, on 8 August, is being planned by organist Anna Lapwood, who said the idea had been several years in the making.\n\"I spend a lot of time at the Albert Hall in the middle of the night, practicing, and I find it fascinating that the building is still just running overnight,\" she says. \n\"There are always people there - cleaners and security guards - a bit like A Night At The Museum. \n\"So we talked about how fun it would be to be able to invite people into that space, both physically, but also the abstract space of being in an iconic building in the middle of the night.\"\nHer programme will include YouTube pianist Hayato Sumino, Russian cellist Anastasia Kobekina and Norwegian ensemble Barroksolistene, whose \"Alehouse sessions\" aim to recreate the atmosphere of a 17th Century English tavern.\nLapwood says the artists are all connected by an enthusiasm for \"messing around\" with music, citing Sumino's viral video of the \"seven degrees of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star\". \n\"There are various moments where we're hoping to do some collaborations,\" she reveals. \"But the logistics of this are all very, very complicated, not least trying to figure out everyone's sleep schedules!\"\nThis summer's season is the first since the departure of Proms director David Pickard. He has been replaced by Hannah Donat who, as director of artistic planning, had shaped the festival alongside the controller of BBC Radio 3, Sam Jackson. \n\"I think of the Proms as the classical music equivalent of Wimbledon,\" she says. \n\"Everyone likes to go to Wimbledon, even if they don't watch tennis for the rest of the year; and everyone likes to go to a Prom, even if they're not going to concerts for the rest of the season.\"\n\"It gives the concerts a warmth and an informal atmosphere. \n\"People don't worry too much about knowing the repertoire inside out - there's just something spectacular about the Albert Hall and seeing the orchestra onstage.\"\n\nAmong the concerts to watch out for are:\n19 July: The Great American Songbook and Beyond with Samara Joy. Fresh from winning best jazz album at this year's Grammys, US singer Samara Joy teams up with the BBC Concert Orchestra for a night of standards by Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holliday.\n20 July: Ravel's Piano Concerto for the Left Hand. The world's only professional one-handed concert pianist, Nicholas McCarthy, makes his Proms debut, playing a concerto originally written for Paul Wittgenstein, after he lost his right arm during World War One.\n26 July: The Traitors. \"I've asked for a cloak and an owl,\" says Claudia Winkelman, ahead of this one-off concert, featuring classical pieces \"with betrayal at their heart\" alongside the gothic re-workings of pop songs heard in the TV reality show.\n2 August: Mahler's Resurrection Symphony. Canadian mezzo-soprano Emily D'Angelo, whose voice has been called \"a thing of wonder\", makes her Proms debut with Norwegian soprano Mari Eriksmoen and the Hall\u00e9 orchestra.\n8 August: 100 Years of the Shipping Forecast. The subtle magic of the Shipping Forecast is celebrated in a special concert, in Belfast's Ulster Hall, featuring Radio 4's continuity announcers and a new work by poet laureate Simon Armitage. \n9 August: The Planets and Star Wars. The National Youth Orchestra play two of the world's most recognisable pieces of orchestral music, with an intergalactic theme.\n10 August: Edward Gardner Conducts the LPO. Taking a journey through icy waters and cascading waterfalls, the London Philharmonic present a quartet of pieces, including Debussy's La Mer and Sibelius's Oceanides - with an aquatic theme. Electrifying mezzo-soprano Aigul Akhmetshina joins in, for her Proms debut.\n14 August: Joe Hisaishi and Steve Reich. Legendary Studio Ghibli composer Joe Hisaishi makes his Proms debut conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in two large-scale works exploring themes of destruction and loss - including his piece The End of the World, reflecting the \"anxiety and chaos\" after the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York.\n23 August: M\u00e4kel\u00e4 conducts Mahler's Fifth. Finnish conductor Klaus M\u00e4kel\u00e4 isn't yet 30, but his electrifying performances have already made headlines around the world. He comes to the Proms with the Dutch Concertgebouw Orchestra, to play Mahler's leonine fifth symphony.\n7 September: Angelique Kidjo - African Symphony. \"I want to show the world the richness and beauty of African culture,\" says the Beninese-French music icon Angelique Kidjo of her return to the Proms.

        "article_text": "Swathes of scientific data deletions are sweeping across US government websites \u2013 with decades of health, climate change and extreme weather research at risk. Now, scientists are racing to save their work before it's lost.\nSome of them are in the US. Others are scattered around the world. There are hundreds, many even thousands of people involved across multiple networks. And they keep a damn close eye on their phones.\nNo one knows when the next alert or request to save a chunk of US government-held climate data will come in. Such data, long available online, keeps getting taken down by US President Donald Trump's administration. For the last six months or so, Cathy Richards has been entrenched in the response. She works for one of several organisations bent on downloading and archiving public data before it disappears.\n\"You get a message at 11 o'clock at night saying, 'This is going down tomorrow',\" she says. \"You try to enjoy your day and then everything goes wrong. You just spend the night downloading data.\"\nRichards is a data and inclusion specialist, and civic science fellow at the Open Environmental Data Project (OEDP), a non-profit based in Hudson, New York. Her organisation is a founding member of the Public Environmental Data Project (PEDP), which emerged in 2024 to safeguard data under the Trump administration.\nSome of the messages are \"heart-breaking\", says Richards. Scientists sometimes get in touch, desperate to know that data they have spent their professional lives collecting will be rescued. \"You hear the urgency,\" she says. \"You understand that this is someone's X amount of years of research and this is their baby. That's probably why we snap into action.\"\nIn recent weeks, Richards and her colleagues have archived datasets packed with information on US flood hazards, greenhouse gas emissions, energy production and environmental justice, among other subjects. Other researchers have recreated a tool that forecasts the risk of future climate hazards around the US.\nThis rush to safeguard vital environmental data is part of a broader movement to rescue all kinds of scientific data published online by the US government. Biomedical and health researchers working with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for example, have been frantically searching for ways to back up important data following executive orders issued by Trump about what information on gender and diversity may be published by federal bodies.\nScientists have expressed fears about a wide range of resources that might go next \u2013 from historical weather records to data gathered by Nasa satellites. On 16 April, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) announced that a list of datasets regarding ocean monitoring were now scheduled to be removed in early May.\nMultiple organisations including the Internet Archive, a non-profit, Safeguarding Research and Culture,\u00a0and the Data Rescue Project, are now engaged in activities alongside the OEDP to rescue this data from oblivion. Many of the individuals involved in these efforts have pitched in voluntarily. \"It's our library,\" says Richards. \"You gotta save the books, you have to keep it for the future.\"\nShortly after President Trump's inauguration on 25 January 2025, his administration announced sweeping changes to federal departments and agencies, in a bid to reduce what it called \"waste\" and \"inefficiencies\". But many of the programmes and resources currently disappearing are critically important, scientists say. Climate researchers who spoke to the BBC pointed out that some deleted datasets have supported important research on climate change and life-threatening weather extremes, for example.\nWhile government officials also removed information during Trump's first term, meaning scientists had expected similar deletions during his second term, the scale and scope of recent deletions has taken researchers by surprise. One scientist rushed to their university with a plea: \"I said, 'I need disk space, I need it fast, I can't really go through the normal processes [of getting] a grant',\" they recall. Their university quietly made 20 terabytes of storage available, the researcher told the BBC.\nThe scramble to rescue at-risk data before it's too late continues apace. Richards says her organisation has received messages from around 400 would-be volunteers and they are currently \"on-boarding\" around 100 of them. Their work could help preserve data on everything from air quality to coral reefs.\nAmong the tools that the PEDP has replicated on its website is EJScreen, an environmental justice mapping service that reveals communities in the US that may be at heightened risk from environmental hazards such as air pollution. It was removed from the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) website in early February.\nClimate data is often particularly challenging to work with given the huge size of certain datasets \u2013 vast stores of information about our planet that underpin climate models, or weather forecasting systems, for example. But this doesn't deter Richards. \"This is taxpayer-funded research that was already paid for,\" she says. The BBC contacted the White House for a comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.\nWatching all of this unfold \u2013 in many cases in disbelief \u2013 are the scientists who worked to collect this data in the first place.\n\"I have never seen anything like this in nearly 40 years of doing science,\" says Paul Bierman, a geomorphologist at the University of Vermont. \"I think it's an unmitigated disaster.\" Bierman studies landscape change and human interaction with landscapes. He has researched the history of the Greenland ice sheet, showing, for example, that during the Pleistocene epoch 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago, Greenland was covered in tundra and vegetation, rather than a thick ice sheet. It suggests that the ice in Greenland is more vulnerable to a changing climate than we previously understood.\nBierman explains that all of the data that he and his colleagues have collected on National Science Foundation-funded studies gets submitted to data repositories supported by that same US government agency. \"Now I'm wondering, 'Is that the safest place for my data?',\" he says.\nScientists are also worried that efforts to gather new climate data will fall by the wayside. A government report in March suggested that the Trump administration was considering cancelling the lease of the support office for a major carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring research station in Hawaii. The Mauna Loa observatory has been tracking atmospheric CO2 concentrations since 1958 and just last year recorded the largest jump in such levels since records began.\n\"Climate science is only possible because of long-term datasets,\" says Lilian Dove, a US Noaa climate and global change research fellow at Brown University. \"Without continuing to collect that data, preserve that data, our field is in really big trouble.\"\nBoth Bierman and Dove say they have made multiple copies of their scientific data, including in offline stores, as a precaution \u2013 to ensure its survival.\nEric Nost, a geographer at the University of Guelph in Canada, says that the data deletions have far exceeded the many revisions of US government-published information that occurred during Trump's first term, from early 2017 to early 2021. \"We saw the removal of many [web] pages,\" he says. \"We didn't really see datasets removed.\"\nRachel Santarsiero, director of the Climate Change Transparency Project at the National Security Archive, a non-governmental and non-profit organisation, agrees. She adds that, during that first term, mentions of \"climate change\" were often deleted from government websites but scientific data generally remained intact and accessible.\nSantarsiero also notes, however, that \u2013 in principle \u2013 the removal of environmental data resources from public-facing government websites is neither new nor exclusive to the Trump administration. The EPA announced plans to remove its online archive in 2022 while President Joe Biden was in power, for instance. \"Their rationale was it was too costly to keep the archive,\" says Santarsiero.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 'Biological reality': What genetics has taught us about race\n\u2022 How America fell in love with China's memes\n\u2022 Can the Internet Archive save our digital history?\nAnother organisation that is currently working to gather and archive US government data, including climate data, is Safegaur.de. It is run largely by researchers outside the US. William Waites, a computer scientist at the University of Southampton in the UK, is among them. The pace of data deletions in recent months and weeks has been frantic, he says, with some \"scares\" over datasets that were rumoured to be earmarked for removal.\nIn March, word went round that information published by Noaa would disappear within days. Waites and his colleagues swung into action and started downloading multiple terabytes of data. But the rumoured deadline for the deletion came and went. Waites describes the episode as \"a good exercise for getting used to doing this\" and adds: \"It's getting a little bit easier, though, as we become more established and known for doing this \u2013 and have contacts in various organisations\".\nA raft of Noaa programmes are currently at risk as the Trump administration is reportedly considering cutting the agency's funding by 25%. This would remove all funding for research on the impact of climate change on weather, for example.\nThe Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, which captures screenshots of web pages to record what they looked like in the past, is also working to cache government data. This is part of the End of Term Archive project, which records the state of US government websites at the end of presidential administrations. Mark Graham, director of the Wayback Machine, highlights a live public spreadsheet that his colleagues are using to log such captures. The content ranges from information about LGBTQ+ equality matters to geopolitics. Plus, references to vaccines and sexually transmitted diseases were also removed from federal websites shortly after Trump's inauguration.\nMany of the preserved web pages feature climate or environmental information. \"We've seen, by scope and scale, an increase in the material removed from US government websites that is without precedent,\" says Graham.\nDownloading and archiving data in private or non-governmental repositories is something of a double-edged sword, however. On the one hand, it allows archivists to make multiple copies of that data. \"That limits its potential for being destroyed,\" says Lourdes Vera, a sociologist at the University at Buffalo. But Vera, who was arrested in 2020 for stealing and vandalising Trump campaign signs, points out that saving such data on platforms owned by US-based tech companies could be risky, if those companies are later compelled by the government to delete the data.\nMultiple people involved in archiving initiatives expressed a motivation to store the most important information outside of the US. Though many were hesitant to discuss details. When asked whether this is something the Internet Archive is doing, for example, Graham only says: \"The Internet Archive is always looking for responsible ways to help ensure the integrity of data\".\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2.

When data goes missing from centralised \u2013 and well-known \u2013 government web pages, it's not always obvious to casual internet users that there are organisations out there working to republish it.\n\"You kind of have to know what you're looking for now whereas, in the past, you would have been able to more easily come by [that data] by navigating centralised data systems,\" says Nost.\nIt means an increasing burden not just in terms of safeguarding climate data \u2013 but also in ensuring that the public knows it is still there. And that it matters.\nGiven the relatively small window that humans have to act on climate change, in order to prevent its worst effects, Bierman finds the present situation incomprehensible.\n\"It's stunning to me that, at a time when we're seeing more intense hurricanes, greater rainfall extremities, more drought, more wildfires \u2013 why at that point would we ever imagine cutting the science that is key to addressing those issues, and keeping people safe?\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing. \nChinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened. \nChinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would \"fight to the end\".\nHere's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs.\nChina is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries.  \nWith more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs.  \nBeijing is still fumbling with the keys because Chinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to \"silver trains\" for travelling retirees, that could change. \nAnd Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential.\nThe leadership may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month.\nChina also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders.\nStill, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.\nThe economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.\nThe Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to \"weather storms together\".\nPresident Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: \"The sky will not fall.\"\nChina has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.   \nUnder Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance. \nIt has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI. \nExamples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which was celebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.\nRecently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI.\nUS companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.   \nChinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate.   \nThat unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term.\nEver since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order. \nIt has pumped billions into a contentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.\nThe expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.\nAmerican farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier. \n\"The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once\u2011captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,\" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute. \nThe US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024.\nThat doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner.\nFollowing reports that the White House will use bilateral trade negotiations to isolate China, Beijing has warned countries against \"reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests\".\nThat would be an impossible choice for much of the world\n\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC last week.\nTrump held firm as stocks plummeted following his sweeping tariffs announcement in early April, likening his staggering levies to \"medicine\".\nBut he made a U-turn, pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days after a sharp sell-off in US government bonds. Also known as Treasuries, these have long been seen as a safe investment. But the trade war has shaken confidence in the assets.\nTrump has since hinted at a de-escalation in trade tensions with China, saying that the tariffs on Chinese goods will \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".\nSo, experts point out, Beijing now knows that the bond market can rattle Trump.\nChina also holds $700bn in US government bonds. Japan, a staunch American ally, is the only non-US holder to own more than that.\nSome argue that this gives Beijing leverage: Chinese media has regularly floated the idea of selling or withholding purchases of US bonds as a \"weapon\".\nBut experts warn that China will not emerge unscathed from such a situation.\nRather, it will lead to huge losses for Beijing's investments in the bond market and destabilise the Chinese yuan.\nChina will only be able to exert pressure with US government bonds \"only up to a point\", Dr Zhang says. \"China holds a bargaining chip, not a financial weapon.\"\nWhat China can weaponise, however, is its near monopoly in extracting and refining rare earths, a range of elements important to advanced tech manufacturing.\nChina has huge deposits of these, such as dysprosium, which is used in magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines, and Yttrium, which provides heat-resistant coating for jet engines.\nBeijing has already responded to Trump's latest tariffs by restricting exports of seven rare earths, including some that are essential for making AI chips.\nChina accounts for about 61% of rare earths production and 92% of their refining, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nWhile Australia, Japan and Vietnam have begun mining for rare earths, it will take years before China can be cut out of the supply chain.\nIn 2024, China banned the export of another critical mineral, antimony, that is crucial to various manufacturing processes. Its price more than doubled amid a wave of panic buying and a search for alternative suppliers.\nThe fear is that the same can happen to the rare earths market, which would severely disrupt various industries from electric vehicles to defence.\n\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" Thomas Kruemmer, director of Ginger International Trade and Investment, told the BBC previously. \n\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial.\"",

The footage also showed several other vehicles, including an ambulance, passed by in the hour or so between the first and second Israeli attack, without being shot at. \nIsraeli officials said this proved troops in Gaza did not open fire on medical vehicles unless they felt threatened.\nA UN official in Gaza suggested the IDF investigation did not go far enough. \"A lack of real accountability undermines international law and makes the world a more dangerous place,\" said Jonathan Whittall. \n\"Without accountability, we risk continuing to watch atrocities unfolding, and the norms designed to protect us all, eroding.\"\nIsrael originally claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached \"suspiciously\" in darkness without headlights or flashing lights. It said movement of the vehicles had not been previously co-ordinated or agreed with the army.\nBut it later said that account was \"mistaken\" after a video found on the mobile phone of a medic who was killed showed the vehicles with their lights on and their emergency signals flashing.\nThe footage shows the vehicles pulling up on the road when shooting begins just before dawn.\nThe video continues for more than five minutes, with the paramedic saying his last prayers before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching the vehicles.\nIt also shows the vehicles were clearly marked and the paramedics wearing reflective hi-vis uniform.\nThe bodies of the 15 dead workers were buried in sand. They were not uncovered until a week after the incident because international agencies, including the UN, could not organise safe passage to the area or locate the spot.\nThe IDF also confirmed it was holding a PRCS medic it had detained following the incident. They did not confirm his name, but the International Committee of the Red Cross has previously named him as Assad al-Nassasra. \nThe Red Crescent and several other international organisations have previously called for an independent investigation into the incident.\nThe IDF's decision to fire a commander and discipline another senior officer is not unheard of - the military dismissed two officers and took action against others after seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen were killed in April of last year.\nIsrael launched its first major operation in Rafah in May 2024, leaving large parts of it in ruins. Tens of thousands of people returned to what was left of their homes in the city during a recent two-month-long ceasefire.\nIsrael renewed its offensive in Gaza on 18 March after the first phase of the ceasefire deal came to an end and negotiations on a second phase of the deal stalled.\nIsrael launched its campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 51,201 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.\nThat indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.\nAnd it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster. \nThe crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.\nResolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be.\n\"These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,\" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.\n\"But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,\" he argued.\nGraphics by Erwan Rivault",

        "article_text": "Andrew Flintoff has given his first account of the car crash he was in while filming Top Gear, saying he thought he \"was dead\" in the immediate aftermath.\nThe England cricketer-turned-TV presenter sustained serious facial and rib injuries when the three-wheeler car he was driving for the BBC motoring programme rolled over in 2022.\nSpeaking in a new Disney+ documentary, 'Freddie' Flintoff said that despite the trauma, he \"remembers everything about it\".\n\"I thought I was dead, because I was conscious but I couldn't see anything,\" he recalled.\n\"I was thinking, is that it? Is that it? You know what I mean? Just black for the rest of my days?\n\"My hat came over my eyes - so I pulled my hat up and I thought, no I'm not [dead], I'm on the Top Gear track, this is not heaven.\"\nFlintoff then looked down to see blood, and said his \"biggest fear\" was that he no longer had a face left.\n\"I thought my face had come off. I was frightened to death.\"\nHe recalled being in \"agony\" for between half an hour and 40 minutes until an air ambulance arrived and he was taken to hospital.\nThe incident took place on 13 December 2022 at Top Gear's test track at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome in Surrey.\nHe was driving an open-topped Morgan Super 3 when it flipped and slid, dragging him along the track during filming.\nSpeaking in the documentary, he described how time seemed to slow down as the car rolled over, and how his quick reactions as a cricketer allowed him to move his head in an attempt to avoid even worse injuries.\n\"As it started going over, I looked at the ground and I knew, if I get hit here on the side [of the head] then I'll break my neck, or if I get hit on the temple I'm dead. The best chance is to go face down.\n\"And then I remember hitting [the ground] and my head got hit,\" he added. \"But then I got dragged out, and the car went over, and I went over the back of the car, and then [I got] pulled face down on the runway about 50m underneath the car. And then I hit the grass and then [it] flipped back.\"\nSurgeon Jahrad Haq, who treated Flintoff, told the documentary the injuries were \"very complex\" - a mixture of hard and soft tissue injuries, broken teeth, lost teeth and elements of the upper jaw bone that were also fractured and displaced.\nHe \"lost a really significant portion of his upper lip - the skin and some of the underlying muscle - and also his lower lip,\" he said.\nMr Haq said the injuries were in the \"top five\" in terms of severity of those he had seen during his career.\nReflecting on the recovery, Flintoff said he \"didn't think I had it in me to get through\" the ordeal.\n\"This sounds awful. Part of me wishes I'd been killed. Part of me thinks I wish I'd died,\" he added.\n\"I didn't want to kill myself. I don't want to mistake the two things. I was not wishing, but thinking, this would have been so much easier...\n\"Now I try to take the attitude, you know what, the sun will come up tomorrow, and then my kids will still give me a hug, and I'm probably in a better place now.\"\nOne of England's most successful cricketers, Flintoff previously said he is \"loving\" his return to the sport coaching England Lions - the development squad underneath England Men's cricket team.\nFlintoff's wife Rachael told the documentary his return to the sport was crucial on the road to recovery. \n\"When Andrew needed it most, cricket was there for him,\" she said. \"It sounds a bit weird saying it, a bit over the top to say, but I do think cricket saved him. It gave him a reason for being, again.\"\nThe 47-year-old also returned to television last year with a second series of his BBC programme Freddie Flintoff's Field of Dreams, which saw him take a team of young cricketers from his hometown of Preston on a tour of India, a year after his crash.\nThe acclaimed series is up for a Bafta Television Award in the factual series category next month.\nHe also hosted a reboot of darts game show Bullseye over Christmas, which will return for a full series later this year.\nIn 2023, the BBC \"rested\" Top Gear for the foreseeable future. A financial settlement was also reached with Flintoff.\nThe documentary, titled Flintoff, is on Disney+ from Friday, 25 April.",

That's the way I'm seeing it. I wanted to go in with an open mind and come out the other side as a better runner - but also better holistically.\n\"It's been really interesting to learn from so many people and feel like a novice again.\"\nYee is part of a stellar elite men's field featuring 10 athletes who have run the marathon in under two hours and five minutes, including one of his sporting idols in four-time winner Eliud Kipchoge.\nThere is also Olympic champion Tamirat Tola, defending champion Alexander Mutiso Munyao, and debutant Jacob Kiplimo - who in February became the first person to run a half marathon in under 57 minutes. \nYee's target? Enjoy the experience - and go through halfway in 64 minutes and 30 seconds. \nThat would give him the chance to become only the 10th British man to run under 2:09, while only 22 have broken 2:10.\nRunning is Yee's strongest discipline and he has competed for Great Britain on the track and in cross-country, while his 5km best of 13:26 is the third-fastest ever by a British man.\n\"It would be a massive honour to, hopefully, be in that ballpark of people who have achieved amazing things,\" says Yee.\n\"I think it's going to be an amazing day for the Brits but also a historic day at the front.

It sounded silly at the time, but after unfortunately seeing people forced to pull out, it's probably the strongest piece of advice of all,\" says Yee.\nThey are likely to have much to discuss. \nBoth are passionate about using the power of sport to inspire, with Yee now keen to utilise his platform as Olympic champion.\nHe intends to provide opportunities to school children through the launch of his own foundation, initially in the south London area he grew up in.\nYee also hopes documenting his marathon journey on YouTube can demonstrate that elite athletes are not \"superhuman\", before he stars on the other side of the barriers he used to watch behind. \n\"The more we share our story I feel like people realise that we're just like anyone else, and there's no reason why they can't dream to achieve what I have - or even so much more,\" says Yee.\n\"You start to feel this urgency with the fortunate position I'm in, being an Olympic champion, that I can and I want to make a difference. \n\"I'm not expecting to leave this big legacy behind.

        "article_text": "McLaren's Oscar Piastri leads the 2025 drivers' championship after victory in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\nAfter the first triple header of the season, there is a week's break before Formula 1 heads to Miami from 2-4 May.\nBefore that, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions following the race in Jeddah.\nWill Max Verstappen modify his driving as a result of the decision to give him a five-second penalty in Saudi Arabia? - Kate\nMax Verstappen was given a five-second penalty in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because the stewards adjudged him to have gained an advantage by leaving the track while contesting the lead with McLaren's Oscar Piastri at the first corner.\nThe stewards pointed to the driving standards guidelines in making their decision, reporting that \"Car 81 (Piastri) had its front axle at least alongside the mirror of Car One (Verstappen) prior to and at the apex of corner one when trying to overtake Car One on the inside.\n\"In fact, Car 81 was alongside Car One at the apex. Based on the drivers' standards guidelines, it was therefore Car 81's corner and he was entitled to be given room.\"\nVerstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".\nThe guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option. \nBut Verstappen races hard, and pushes the limit of the rules. In critical situations such as this, he will do everything he can to keep position, and then force the stewards to make a decision.\nThis is understandable on two levels: first, the advantage of being in front and running in clean air is significant, as the race subsequently showed, and if he ends up being allowed to keep the position, it can win him the race; second, in the past, the stewards have often chosen not to punish him.\nHowever, the guidelines have changed this year, after significant pressure from the other drivers, exactly because of the way Verstappen races.\nThis was the first time the new rules have been tested with Verstappen, and this time his approach did not work. But he has had a lifetime of racing this way, so it would be quite a switch for him to change his approach.\nHaving said that, he is smart as well as tough. It would be a surprise if he did not learn from this incident in some ways for next time.\nFrom Piastri's side, he has now laid down a marker to Verstappen. He is a decisive, clinical racer who is not to be intimidated.\nVerstappen and Piastri go into the first corner side by side in Saudi Arabia\nDoes Lando Norris need to go sit down with Nico Rosberg to understand how he changed his mentality in his championship year? \u2013 Gary\nIn 2016, Nico Rosberg won the championship by pushing himself to the limit to be able to compete with an essentially faster team-mate in Lewis Hamilton, ensuring he was his best self all the time and hoping that would be enough.\nRosberg was handed a significant advantage with the comparative reliability of the two Mercedes at the start of the season, and even then Hamilton would have clawed the advantage back had he not had an engine failure while leading in Malaysia late in the season.\nThe situation at McLaren this year feels different. In 2024, Norris was decisively the faster and more convincing McLaren driver over the season. In 2025 so far, that has been Piastri.\nNorris is struggling to adapt to certain characteristics of the McLaren - particularly its lack of front grip at certain phases of the corner with his driving style.\nBut he is aware of what he needs to do. As he put it in Jeddah on Sunday: \"It's my qualifying, my Saturdays, which are not good enough at the minute. That's because I am struggling a little bit with the car.\n\"Yesterday was not the car, it was just me trying to take too many risks.\n\"So I just have to peg it back. I've got the pace. It's all in there. It's just sometimes I ask for a bit too much and sometimes I get a bit too 'ego' probably and try to put the perfect lap together. I just need to chill out a little bit.\"\nOf course when the margins are so tight - pole is being decided by hundredths of a second at each race - it's one thing to say that, and another to do it without coming off second best.\nDuring the race in Saudi Arabia, Liam Lawson picked up a 10-second penalty for completing his pass on Jack Doohan off-track, so gained an advantage. Max Verstappen only got five seconds for his off-track advantage. What's the difference between these two? - James\nAs the stewards explained in the verdict on Verstappen: \"Ordinarily, the baseline penalty for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage is 10 seconds.\n\"However, given that this was lap one and a turn one incident, we considered that to be a mitigating circumstance and imposed a five-second time penalty instead.\"\nSo Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.\nWhy can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. drive-through etc) rather than at a pit stop or after the race is completed? \u2013 Neil\nAfter the controversy of the title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi in 2021, it was decided that teams should no longer be able to talk directly to the race director during a grand prix.\nHowever, they can still talk to his assistants in race control and discuss incidents. So when a driver does a manoeuvre that looks borderline, teams have three options.\nThey can choose proactively to give the place back - as McLaren did with Lando Norris against Lewis Hamilton in Bahrain.\nThey can get in touch with race control and ask for an opinion on the move, and then make a decision as to what to do about it.\nOr they can plough on and hope for the best, as Red Bull did in Jeddah.\nThe FIA stewards will then make their decision as to how to handle it. They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.\nOf course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.\nThis is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.\nSome people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. But it is where the sport has landed for now.\nSaudi 'horrible' & 2025 looking 'painful' - Hamilton\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix review\nWilliams have already beaten their 2024 full season points total. What has made them so much better? \u2013 Stewart\nWilliams' progress this season is a direct result of the investment put in by owners Dorilton since they took over in 2020 and the changes to the team made under new boss James Vowles.\nInto last year, the introduction of new factory processes caused a difficult winter, the car barely made the first test and it was overweight for the first chunk of the season.\nThe difference this year was dramatic - their launch was held at Silverstone in public view in mid-February, and they ran the car for the first time there.\nWilliams are very much focused on 2026 and the new rules being introduced then, but as Vowles put it at the launch: \"What I can demonstrate is very clear progress that's taken place in manufacture, process, technology kicking in.\n\"We are moving into a new building this year, a benchmark driver in-the-loop simulator, that was started in 2023. The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it. But I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nBeing on the weight limit sounds like a small detail but is actually a big deal. Last year, it was costing them not far off 0.5 seconds a lap early in the year. Add that to this year's performance, and instead of being the fifth quickest car on average, as they are now, they would be eighth fastest, ahead of only Haas and Sauber.\nOn top of that, Williams now has two world-class drivers rather than just one. And they are not crashing like they were last year.\nAlex Albon ran with the car's improved performance and scored good points in the first three races, while both he and Carlos Sainz were in the top 10 in Saudi Arabia.\nSo, in a nutshell, the team has made progress, they have a better driver line-up and you're seeing it in the performance of the car.\n\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson",

        "summary": "- KateMax Verstappen was given a five-second penalty in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because the stewards adjudged him to have gained an advantage by leaving the track while contesting the lead with McLaren's Oscar Piastri at the first corner.The stewards pointed to the driving standards guidelines in making their decision, reporting that \"Car 81 (Piastri) had its front axle at least alongside the mirror of Car One (Verstappen) prior to and at the apex of corner one when trying to overtake Car One on the inside. In critical situations such as this, he will do everything he can to keep position, and then force the stewards to make a decision.This is understandable on two levels: first, the advantage of being in front and running in clean air is significant, as the race subsequently showed, and if he ends up being allowed to keep the position, it can win him the race; second, in the past, the stewards have often chosen not to punish him.However, the guidelines have changed this year, after significant pressure from the other drivers, exactly because of the way Verstappen races.This was the first time the new rules have been tested with Verstappen, and this time his approach did not work. They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.Of course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.This is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.Some people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. \"So Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.Why can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. \"Verstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".The guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option.",

        "article_text": "Tesla boss Elon Musk has pledged to \"significantly\" cut back his role in Doge, the body tasked with reducing US government spending and cutting jobs.\nThe Department of Government Efficiency has faced legal challenges over the scope of its work, and Musk and his team have been been criticised for a lack of transparency. \nHowever, polling suggests its cost-cutting agenda has widespread support. \nDespite its full name, Doge is not an official government department, which can only be established by an act of Congress.\nInstead the advisory body was created by an executive order signed by US President Donald Trump. \nPart of Doge's mission, according to the order, relates to IT upgrades aimed at boosting efficiency. It must finish its work by July 2026.\nMany Doge staff appear to be young people with tech backgrounds and limited or no government experience. \nYes. Musk initially said he would perform his role as an outside volunteer but the White House later confirmed he would operate as an unpaid special government employee.\nThat designation covers those working for the government for no more than 130 days in a year.\nSupporters argued that the body's outsider status - and somewhat vague mandate - would increase its effectiveness.\n\"They're a little more untethered to the bureaucracy itself and to the systems that slow processes down around here,\" Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told the BBC. \n\"I think the lack of parameters is part of what will make them effective.\"\nIn an unexpected appearance at the White House in February, Musk denied leading a \"hostile takeover\" of the US government, and defended his approach. \n\"The people voted for major government reform and that's what the people are going to get,\" he said. \"That's what democracy is all about.\"\nHe also made a number of exaggerated and unsupported claims during the event. \nMusk said his \"time allocation to Doge\" would \"drop significantly\" from May to one to two days per week, after accusations he had taken his focus off Tesla.\nHis political involvement has sparked global protests and boycotts against the company's cars. \nIn April, the firm said sales had fallen to their lowest level in three years and warned investors that \"changing political sentiment\" could continue to hurt demand.\nMusk was already due to reach his 130-day limit on government work in late May, but it is not clear whether he will step down completely.\nHe pledged to stay on \"as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it's useful\".\nMusk said Doge's mission was to end the \"tyranny of the bureaucracy\", save taxpayers' money and reduce US national debt, which stands at $36tn (\u00a328.9tn). \nInitially he said he hoped to save as much as $2tn a year, but later tempered this estimate.\nIt is not clear how much money Doge has managed to save so far, although its X account gives regular, celebratory updates about its activities.\nThese have included shuttering government agencies, defunding programmes and mass layoffs:\nPolling in February by the BBC's US partner CBS News suggested that Doge had popular appeal. It indicated that a majority of Americans - especially Republican voters - backed its work.\nDavid Ditch, a senior analyst at the Economic Policy Innovation Center, a conservative think tank, insists Doge's work is necessary:\n\"They're shining a very bright spotlight on various parts of the federal government and they're asking -  whether it's the American public, whether it's moderate members of the Republican caucus - is this how you want America's tax dollars to be used?\"\nBut even some of those who support Doge's work appear to dislike Musk himself.\nIn February, Pew Research found that 54% of Americans had an unfavourable view of him, including 37% who said their view was \"very unfavourable\".\nPolitical opponents and government watchdogs have criticised Doge for acting without transparency and spreading misinformation about government spending - and accuse Musk of overstepping his authority as an unelected official.\nThey highlight potential conflicts of interest, given Musk's businesses hold contracts with the US government worth billions. Trump and Musk deny that any conflicts have arisen.\nDemocrats accuse them of tampering with funding approved by Congress that is outside the president's scope. The White House denies that the work has broken any laws.\nMultiple groups including unions and state attorneys general have sued Doge and the wider Trump administration over their plans. \nOn several occasions the courts have stepped in to halt the cost-cutting moves, at least once blocking Doge directly when a judge stopping the agency from accessing personal data held within US Treasury records. \nMany analysts remain sceptical about whether Doge can deliver on its bold pledges.\nElaine Kamark from the Brookings Institution said government spending could be streamlined, highlighting her own work for President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.\nBut she described Musk's goal to slash a third of government spending as \"ridiculous\", since so much of the budget was mandatory, including popular programmes like Social Security and Medicare.",

        "article_text": "A record-breaking tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany, which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia's links with the rest of Europe.\nRunning for 18km (11 miles), the Fehmarnbelt will be the world's longest pre-fabricated road and rail tunnel.\nIt's also a remarkable feat of engineering, that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor, and then joined together.\nThe project's main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel, on the coast of Lolland island in the south east of Denmark.\nThe facility spans more than 500 hectares (1,235 acres), and includes a harbour and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections, which are called \"elements\".\n\"It's a huge facility here,\" says Henrik Vincentsen, chief executive of Femern, the state-owned Danish company that is building the tunnel.\nTo make each 217m (712ft) long and 42m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete. \nMost underwater tunnels - including the 50km Channel Tunnel between the UK and France \u2013 burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor. Here instead, 90 individual elements will be linked up, piece by piece, like Lego bricks.\n\"We are breaking records with this project,\" says Mr Vincentsen. \"Immersed tunnels have been built before, but never on this scale.\"\nWith a price-tag around \u20ac7.4bn ($8.1bn; \u00a36.3bn) the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark, with \u20ac1.3bn from the European Commission.\nIt's among the region's largest-ever infrastructure projects, and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying.\nOnce completed, the journey between R\u00f8dbyhavn in southern Denmark and Puttgarten in northern Germany, will take just 10 minutes by car, or seven minutes by train, replacing a 45-minute ferry voyage.\nBypassing western Denmark, the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and Hamburg from five to 2.5 hours, and provide a \"greener\" shortcut for freight and passengers.\n\"It's not only linking Denmark to Germany, it's linking Scandinavia to central Europe,\" states Mr Vincentsen. \"Everybody's a winner,\" he claims. \"And by travelling 160km less, you'll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport.\"\nTowered over by cranes, the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead.\n\"So now we are in the first part of the tunnel,\" announces senior construction manager Anders Gert Wede, as we walk inside the future highway. It's one of five parallel tubes in each element.\nThere are two for railway lines, two for roads (which have two lanes in each direction), and a maintenance and emergency corridor.\nAt the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea. \"As you can hear, it's quite thick,\" he says tapping on the metal.  \"When we have a finished element  at the harbour, it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here.\"\nNot only are these elements long, they're enormously heavy, weighing over 73,000 tonnes. Yet incredibly, sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks, gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats.\nNext it's a painstakingly complex procedure, lowering the elements 40 metres down into a trench dug out on the seafloor, using underwater cameras and GPS-guided equipment, to line it up with 15mm precision.\n\"We have to be very, very careful,\" emphasises Mr Wede. \"We have a system called 'pin and catch' where you have a V-shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element, dragging it slowly into place.\"\nDenmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic, on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes.\nWith layers of clay and bedrock of chalk, the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel, said Per Goltermann, a professor in concrete and structures at the Technical University of Denmark.\nA bridge was initially considered, but strong winds might disrupt traffic, and security was another important consideration.\n\"There was the risk of ships crashing into bridges. We can build the bridge so they can withstand it,\" he adds. \"But this is rather deep water, and the biggest ships can sail there.\"\nSo, adds Mr Goltermann, it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel. \"They looked at it and said, \"Okay, what is the cheapest? The tunnel. What is the safest? The tunnel.\"\nDenmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in 2008, but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact.\nOne such environmental group, Nabu (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union), argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbour porpoises, which are sensitive to underwater noise.\nHowever in 2020 their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany, which green-lighted construction to go ahead.\n\"We have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible,\" says Mr Vincentsen, pointing to a 300-hectare wetland nature and recreational area that's planned on reclaimed land, which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock.\nWhen the tunnel opens in 2029, Femern estimates that more than 100 trains and 12,000 cars will use it each day.\nAccording to plans, revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state-backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction, and Mr Vincentsen calculates that will take around four decades.  \"Ultimately, the users are going to pay,\" he says.\nIt's also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs, business and tourism in Lolland, which is one of Denmark's poorest regions.\n\"The locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years,\" said Mr Wede, who grew up nearby. \"They're looking forward to businesses coming to the area.\"",

        "article_text": "A medieval cemetery unearthed near Cardiff Airport is continuing to confound archaeologists, as the mysteries surrounding it are multiplying.  \nThe discovery of the site, dating to the 6th or 7th Century, was announced last year, with dozens of skeletons found lying in unusual positions with unexpected artefacts.\nNow researchers have learned nearly all of those buried in the cemetery are women, and while their bones show signs of wear and tear - indicating they carried out heavy manual work - there are also surprising signs of wealth and luxury.\nAnother unexpected find has been a woman tossed in a ditch, in stark contrast to all  the other people who were buried with great care.\n\"Every time we think we understand something, something else crops up and the picture gets more intriguing,\" said Andy Seaman from Cardiff University, who is leading the project.\nAbout half the site, which lies in an unremarkable field in the grounds of Fonmon Castle, has now been excavated.\nSo far researchers have found 39 adult skeletons lying in graves carved out of the thick limestone bedrock. A full analysis is still ongoing, but it's thought that all apart from one are female.\n\"I'm not entirely sure what it means just yet,\" said Dr Seaman.\n\"It could be that it's something particular about this community, or it could be that this is perhaps just one cemetery within a broader kind of landscape or it might be that there's more men in another part of the cemetery.\" \nThe skeletons of two children have also been found - a surprisingly small number given the high infant mortality of the time. Their burials also have some intriguing features.\n\"The earth that's been used to backfill the grave looks slightly different to that in the adults' graves,\" explained Dr Marion Shiner, an archaeologist from Cardiff University.\n\"It's darker and seems more organic, so potentially some time had elapsed between the burial of the adults and the burial of these two children - it's more mystery.\"\nArtefacts at the site are also adding to the puzzle of who these people were.\nShards of pottery and fine, etched glass unearthed in the graves were most likely brought to the cemetery by people feasting while they visited the dead.\n\"Glass is rare, and where it is found these are sites of quite significant status,\" said Dr Seaman.\n\"It was probably made in the Levant - the Egypt area - and then was manufactured into vessels, we think, in southern France, and probably arrived here alongside wine in barrels.\"\nThe presence of these items suggest this was no ordinary community. And each person here has been buried with painstaking care, some laid flat, others crouching, all facing from east to west.\nThe team don't yet know why the woman flung into the ditch was treated so differently, but believe she could have been an outcast or a criminal.\nThey have taken her bones to the lab at Cardiff University to try to find out more about her.\nOsteologist Dr Katie Faillace says she thinks the woman was in her late 30s or early 40s. \nHer skeleton shows a healed fracture to her arm, while her tooth was infected and had an abscess, which exposed the roots and must have been painful.\n\nTen of the skeletons are also now undergoing more detailed analysis.\nThe results show the people buried in the cemetery aren't all from the immediate area - they come from all over Wales and possibly from the south-west of England too.\nFurther DNA analysis will also reveal whether any of them were related.\nThe team are particularly interested in the skeletons' teeth.\nBecause of the way teeth grow, they provide a unique record of everything someone has eaten from the time they are weaned right through to their death.\n\"They've been eating a very consistent diet based on lots of carbs - but not a lot of meat,\" said Dr Faillace. \"And that's true from their childhood into their adulthood, and that's something we're seeing across the population.\n\"But there was no fish whatsoever. As soon as the Romans leave, we see an absence of fish signals in the diet. It's one of the big mysteries.\"\nThe dig is continuing this summer and the archaeologists will start to unearth the other half of the cemetery.\nAndy Seaman is hoping to be able to answer the questions the site has thrown up.\n\"We're hoping to tell the story of the individuals within the cemetery, but also the broader community,\" he said.\n\"We know a lot about the lives of kings and queens, but much less about everyday people. And never before really have we been able to explore a single community in so much detail and all the interesting inter-relationships.\"\nBut for the moment there are still many contradictions that remain unsolved.\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

This is a pillar of his economic agenda - as is a cut in interest rates, aimed at reducing the cost of borrowing for Americans.\nTrump has ratcheted the rate on Chinese goods up to 145% - sparking reciprocal measures from Beijing and warnings from economists about the global impact of a trade war.\nIn his comments to reporters on Tuesday, Trump said he would be \"very nice\" in negotiations with Beijing - in the hope of securing a trade deal. \nEarlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly said he expected a de-escalation of the trade war, which he said was unsustainable. Responding to comments from China, he said the current situation was \"not a joke\".\nThe trade war has led to turbulence in financial markets around the world - to which Trump's comments on Powell have also contributed. \nThe Fed has not cut rates so far this year, after lowering them by a percentage point late last year, a stance Trump has heavily criticised.\nLast week, the president intensified his attacks on the Fed chief, calling him \"a major loser\". The comments sparked a selloff of stocks, bonds and the US dollar - though markets have since been recovering from those losses. \nNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on Friday that Trump was looking into whether it would be possible to sack Powell - who he first nominated to lead the central bank in 2017. Powell was then renewed in 2021 by Joe Biden.\nIt is unclear whether Trump has the authority to fire the Fed chair. No other US president has tried to do so.\nMost major Asian stock markets were higher on Wednesday as investors appeared to welcome the latest remarks.\nJapan's Nikkei 225 index rose about 1.9%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed by around 2.2%, while mainland China's Shanghai Composite was down less than 0.1%.\nThat came after US shares made gains on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 ending Tuesday's session up 2.5% and the Nasdaq rose 2.7%. \nUS futures were also trading higher overnight. Futures markets give an indication of how financial markets will perform when they open for trading.\nInvestors feared that pressure on Powell to lower interest rates could cause prices to rise at a time when trade tariffs are already seen boosting inflation.\nTrade tensions between the world's biggest economies, as well as US tariffs on other countries around the world, have triggered uncertainty about the global economy. Those concerns triggered turmoil in financial markets in recent weeks.\nOn Tuesday, the forecast for US economic growth for this year was given the biggest downgrade among advanced economies by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) due to uncertainty caused by tariffs.\nThe sharp increase in tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a \"significant slowdown\" in global growth, the Fund predicted.\nTrump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are now facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July.\nHis administration said last week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nChina has hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US and vowed to \"fight to the end\".\nThe Chinese government has not yet officially responded to the latest statements from the Trump administration.\nHowever, an article in the state-controlled Global Times on Wednesday quoted commentators who said the remarks showed that the US is beginning to realise the tariffs do more harm than good to America's economy.",

But this isn't just any ordinary cherry blossom tree grove; it's also the domain of 97-year-old T\u014demon Sano: Japan's most renowned sakuramori (cherry blossom guardian).\nFor more than a millennium, Japanese people have admired the delicate sakura petals as a symbol of transience and beauty. Today, this national pastime has blossomed into an international obsession, with millions of tourists from across the world descending on Japan to sip seasonal sakura-themed Starbucks drinks and participate in hanami (cherry blossom viewing) picnics and festivals from March to May. But while the world waits with bated breath for the cotton candy-coloured blossoms to burst each spring, one of the most important and least understood roles in the trees' maintenance lies with their behind-the-scenes caretakers.\nAccording to Naoko Abe, cherry blossom expert and author of The Sakura Obsession, skilled sakura arborists have existed in Japan since time immemorial. But thanks to the popularity of the 1970s novel Sakuramori about a sakura-infatuated tree expert, communities began bestowing this title to deserving specialists in the years that followed. Typically a professional gardener or tree surgeon, a sakuramori is a combination of Lorax, botanist and spiritual guide dedicated to studying sakura and promoting their preservation.\nAs Asada Nobuyuki, the secretary general of the Japan Sakura Association, explained, there are roughly 100 sakuramori in Japan today, but one stands out. \"It can be said that T\u014demon Sano is most deserving of the title sakuramori,\" said Nobuyuki, crediting the breadth of Sano's long, productive career and his family's generational wisdom.\nOn a Friday morning earlier this month, I crunched through gravel at this historic sanctuary to meet Sano himself. He is the 16th generation in a distinguished line of farmers who began cultivating the nearby land (known for its late-blooming dwarf cherry trees) in the mid-1600s. When his father died in 1981, he assumed the first name T\u014demon, per family tradition, and took the reins of Uet\u014d Z\u014den, the landscaping firm his family started in 1832 that is headquartered in the garden.\nFor more than 80 years,Sano has utilised his specialised knowledge to steward the survival of sakura trees in gardens throughout Japan and the world \u2013 including at the Isamu Noguchi-designed Japanese garden at the Unesco headquarters in Paris. Sakura Taikan, his most famous book, is the definitive tome on the trees and the culmination of research begun by his grandfather during the\u00a0Taish\u014d period (1912\u20131926).\nBut just before our visit, the nonagenarian became ill and was rushed to hospital. Still, he arranged for me to meet his son, Shinichi Sano, who oversees operations at Uet\u014d Z\u014den and who will one day succeed his father and carry on the family legacy as the next T\u014demon and sakuramori.\nAs we strolled through the garden, Shinichi paused at an umbrella-like shidarezakura (weeping cherry), its swooping branches covered in geisha-blush blossoms. Shinichi said this 40-year-old tree was grown from the seeds of the most iconic sakura in Kyoto: the dramatic weeping cherry tree in Maruyama Park, which was originally grown in the Sano family garden and replanted in its current public spot by T\u014demon's father, the 15th T\u014demon Sano.\nThough sakura have attracted hanami lovers for generations, Shinichi said a major threat now looms over them: climate change. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, cherry blossoms have started to bloom 1.2 days earlier per decade since 1953. A recent study found that the peak bloom of Kyoto's cherry blossoms in 2020, 2021 and 2023 were the earliest in more than 1,200 years.\n\"If global warming continues at this rate, I believe there will eventually be regions in Japan where cherry trees no longer bloom,\" Shinichi said, noting that winters with elevated temperatures could nip blooms in the bud entirely, as trees require a sustained chill to initiate the blossoming process. If this happens, a major part of Japan's springtime tourism appeal would be jeopardised \u2013 as well as an integral part of the nation's cultural identity.\n\"The reason Japanese people are fond of cherry blossoms is because, after enduring a harsh winter, the vivid flowers bloom in the monochrome landscape as if to herald the long-awaited arrival of spring. This quiet presence is what draws people in and resonates deeply in our hearts,\" T\u014demon later told me over email after being released from hospital. \"Out of 365 days a year, the cherry blossoms endure wind and snow for 360 days, only to bloom gloriously for five days before gracefully scattering. I believe this fleeting yet dignified cycle reflects the Japanese perspective on life. There may be a sense of personification in the way we view the cherry blossom, as if it embodies a spiritual or moral belief that, through patience and perseverance, one will eventually bloom.\"\u00a0\nCherry blossoms are integral to the Japanese psyche and soul. In ancient Japan, kami (deities) were said to reside in the trees. Beginning in the 800s, Emperor Saga (whose former residence is up the road from the Sano family garden at Daikaku-ji) ushered in the practice of hanami with official cherry blossom viewing parties. For samurai during the Kamakura period (1185-1333), sakura became a unifying military symbol for the warriors to fall with dignity and grace \u2013 a message echoed during World War Two for kamikaze pilots. In light of this national importance, protecting sakura and ensuring their sustainability is something Japan takes seriously.\nToday, according to Abe, many of the most famous places travellers go to see sakura in Japan, such as Mount Yoshino in Nara and Matsumae Park in Hokkaido, each have a dedicated sakuramori. Interestingly, T\u014demon and his family's unbroken line of Japanese gardeners may not have risen to the level of sakuramori were it not for a British botanist.\nIn 1902, English naturalist Collingwood \"Cherry\" Ingram became fascinated by Japanese cherry trees during his first visit to the nation, but he lamented how industrialisation and cloning had led to a decline in their diversity. In an effort to protect them, he sent 50 endangered varieties back to England and planted them in his garden. When he eventually tried to propagate the varieties back in Japan come the 1930s, including the rare Taihaku cherry that had ceased to be cultivated in Japan, the trees didn't survive long.\nGiven the Sano family's generational expertise, Ingram sought out T\u014demon's grandfather, who developed a way to transport the trees successfully so they wouldn't sprout before arriving in Japan. From that little shipment of Taihaku trees, it is thought that tens of thousands of Tahihaku now flourish across Japan and were saved from national extinction.\nWhere to see T\u014demon Sano's sakura in Kyoto:\nIn addition to admiring T\u014demon's carefully cultivated sakura at Maruyama Park, the Ruriko-in estate, the Katsura and Shugauin imperial villas and the Ninna-ji Temple, visitors can also explore the Sano family garden year-round from 09:00 to 16:00 (best to call ahead at +81 75-871-4202).\nT\u014demon's grandfather became something of a Johnny Appleseed for sakura \u2013 taking grafts and growing saplings, venturing to far-flung places like the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin before he died in 1934. T\u014demon's father then took up the mantle while training his son to continue the family legacy.\nToday, travellers enjoying the mesmerising weeping cherry in Maruyama Park have T\u014demon to thank, as the city asks him to care for the tree throughout the year. Visitors can also admire T\u014demon's work at the Ruriko-in estate, where sakura stand in stunning harmony on the property close to the Golden Pavilion of Kinkakuji; the Katsura Imperial Villa; the Shukaguin Imperial Villa; Ninna-ji Temple garden; and, of course, at the nearby Sano family property.\nEven at 97,\u00a0T\u014demon still collects information on different types of sakura and makes detailed drawings of the blossoms' anatomy from the stamen and pistils to the bracts and peduncles \u2013 all to better understand how to help sakura flourish.\n\"My feelings toward cherry blossoms are something that has been ingrained in my daily life,\" T\u014demon said. \"My daily life follows the old Japanese way of life seik\u014d-udoku, 'working in the fields when it's sunny and reading when it rains'\u2026 If I am asked to preserve rare cherry blossoms, I respond by grafting or sowing seeds.\"\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The 96-year-old painter who saved a village\u00a0\n\u2022 The 89-year-old woman who is still travelling the world solo\n\u2022 Japan's unusual way to view the world\nTo that end, he has successfully propagated cherry trees in the atomic bomb-ravaged soil of Hiroshima and saved a 150-year-old Oshima cherry tree in Yokohama that was destined to be cut down. In that instance, when the local community enlisted him to relocate the storied sakura 100m away to preserve an iconic view of Mt Fuji, he took careful stock of the three layers of soil surrounding the tree. Before digging, T\u014demon ceremonially placed sake and rice crackers in the dirt as an apology for the disruption, added charcoal and provided an octopus offering. Also known to hug trees, T\u014demon embraced the trunk tightly upon its successful replanting.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs I toured the Sano family garden, falling\u00a0cherry petals fluttered to the ground like snowflakes, a phenomenon called sakura fubuki. In addition to kami, the souls of ancestors are also said to reside in the flowering cherry blossoms, connecting\u00a0the Sano family to their forebearers and representing the fleeting nature of each generation.\u00a0Amid this transient beauty, the Japanese concept of\u00a0\"mono no aware\" (the wistful recognition of life's ephemerality and the beauty in that impermanence) feels especially present.\u00a0\n\"Cherry blossoms reflect the way of life of the samurai in the old days: beautiful in the way they fall with grace and dignity,\" Shinichi said. Shinichi's 38-year-old son, Tomoaki, who has started to take over day-to-day responsibilities in the family business, has one child \u2013 a daughter. It would then be possible to have the first female sakuramori in this line.\n\"It will depend on her decision,\" Shinichi said.\nFor now, though, the family is allowing the 16th T\u014demon Sano to focus his attentions on what he does best.\n\"While my father is healthy, he will be the one to take care of the sakura,\" Shinichi said. I then asked if he felt he would one day be ready to assume the role of T\u014demon Sano and sakuramori.\u00a0\n\"I won't really know until I actually become the 17th generation,\" Shinichi said. \"I think I will truly feel the responsibility for the first time when I actually inherit the name\u2026 I'll do what I'm asked to.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

They competed in different divisions, though, so there was no clear collision path until a lucrative fight - courtesy of the public's nostalgia-fuelled demands - was agreed for October 2022.\nDespite some low-level trash talk, neither boxer overstepped the line during media events. They even shared a cordial handshake in one face-off interview.\n\"I could even say I liked him because there's no other person on the planet that's experiencing this journey and can relate to what I've gone through. There was 100% respect there,\" Eubank says.\nHowever, that respect disappeared when news that Benn had returned an adverse finding for women's fertility drug clomifene was leaked on the Wednesday of fight week.\nThe British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) decided not to sanction the fight, and the cancellation was confirmed a day later. Benn was smuggled out of the hotel before the assembled media was told.\nIt was a black eye for boxing without a punch being thrown and it dragged Benn into one of British boxing's biggest doping stories.\nThis video can not be played\nRelive the epic Eubank v Benn world title fight in 1990\nBenn admitted to two failed tests but insisted he was innocent of intentional doping and suggested it may have been because of contamination.\nHe was provisionally suspended from fighting in March 2023. After a lengthy saga, during which the ban was lifted then reintroduced following appeals by UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) and the BBBofC, Benn was finally cleared to fight in the UK in November 2024.\nBefore that, he twice competed in the United States, earning unspectacular points wins over Rodolfo Orozco in September 2023 and Peter Dobson in February 2024.\nBut his reputation - back home, in particular - took a pounding.\nBenn sent a 270-page dossier to the WBC that he believed proved no wrongdoing. \nHe was mocked by boxing followers when the WBC concluded the failed tests might have been caused by a \"highly elevated consumption\" of eggs.\nA well-known restaurant even posted an image of a regular pizza topped with boiled eggs, alongside the caption 'Conor Benn special'.\nBenn limited his media interviews, but came close to tears while talking about a \"vendetta\" against him when speaking to Piers Morgan.\nThe reason for the failed tests remain inconclusive and we may never find out why or how clomifene entered Benn's body. \nBenn - who says he has spent \u00a31m in legal costs - feels vindicated and does not see the need to release the dossier or the findings of his legal battle.\nYet his promoter Eddie Hearn says he expects his fighter to be jeered during his ringwalk, with some of the boxing public remaining unconvinced. \nBenn (right) stormed the ring to face off with Eubank after his most recent win in October\nWhile Benn dealt with failed doping tests, Eubank turned his attention elsewhere.\nHe was one half of one of the most compelling rivalries of recent years, suffering a shock loss to Liverpudlian Liam Smith two months after his cancelled fight with Benn.\nEubank avenged that defeat with a dominant win inside the distance eight months later.\nHe had been in the running for a lucrative shot at undisputed super-middleweight champion Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez, but the shadow of Benn was never far away - sometimes literally.\nBenn travelled to Saudi Arabia in October, pushing Eubank at a media event as his rival prepared to fight Kamil Szeremeta.\nAfter Eubank secured a routine stoppage win, Benn stormed the ring.\nSuperstar Brazil footballer Neymar looked bemused, caught in the middle of a face-off as the pair hurled abuse at each other.\nAfter months of arguing over purse splits, it took wealthy Saudi Arabia to get the fighters to agree terms.\nEubank says he is simply giving the public what they want.\n\"Why not exact my revenge on this man for the things he said about me, for the things he put me through over the last few years?\" he says.\nBenn says there was \"no other fight\" for him, claiming he turned down a world title opportunity.\nThis video can not be played\nBenn v Eubank face-off ends with egg slap\nThe magnitude of the fight has gradually increased over the past two and a half years.\nAny doubts it would not sell out the 62,000-capacity Tottenham Hotspur Stadium were quickly put to bed during the first media blitz.\nThe boxers squabbled like petulant schoolchildren at a news conference in February, with Eubank holding court, taking aim at everyone in his eyeline, including Benn and Hearn.\nThen came the viral moment.\nDuring their first face-off, Eubank took one of 16 eggs nestled in his pocket and slapped it across Benn's cheek, a nod to the aforementioned WBC report.\nEubank coughed up a hefty \u00a3100,000 fine.

        "article_text": "Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z are one of the world's most famous power couples.\nAnd they now have an equally famous family, with daughter Blue Ivy, 13, and seven-year-old twins, Rumi and Sir.\nBut Beyonc\u00e9's mother, businesswoman and fashion designer Tina Knowles, tells me she \"worries about the fame\" impacting her grandchildren.\n\"If I had my first choice, they would not have to deal with the things that they have to deal with as kids,\" she says.\nKnowles, 71, says for now, the children are not too exposed to it.\n\"But one day they'll read the ignorance that people put out there about them, the lies and all of that,\" she says. \"And I do worry about that.\"\nDespite those pressures, she says Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z - who are notoriously private about their home life - are doing an \"amazing\" job as parents.\n\"The truth is they spend abnormal amount of time with their children and they have great relationships with their kids,\" she says.\n\"And they're just great parents. I don't think you could ask for better parents.\"\nKnowles is speaking to BBC News ahead of the publication of her new memoir, Matriarch.\nIt covers her childhood in Texas, her daughters' rise to fame and her later years, as a grandmother.\nKnowles now has four grandchildren, including Julez Smith, the son of her younger daughter, singer-songwriter Solange. She also considers herself a grandmother to former Destiny's Child singer Kelly Rowland's children.\nShe says that she sees all her grandchildren regularly, describing them as \"one of the biggest joys in my life\".\n\"[Blue Ivy and I] have a very close bond,\" she says of her eldest granddaughter.\n\"I'm so happy that she feels like she can talk to me,\" she says, adding that Blue Ivy is always giving her advice about taking care of herself.\n\"She's my beauty guru. She's my manager,\" she says.\nI'm intrigued by this, and ask why she calls the 13-year-old her manager.\n\"Well, I don't call her my manager. Everybody else calls her my manager, because she's bossy. She's a little Capricorn like me. So we have that bond.\"\nKnowles grew up in 50s and 60s Galveston, the youngest of seven.\nIn her book, she talks about the harassment her family faced, including from the police.\n\"There was a lot of racial tension,\" she tells me. \"And I think some things have changed, but I still think that black people are more susceptible to police brutality [and] being stopped.\"\nShe met her now ex-husband, Mathew Knowles, in Houston and the pair went on to have two daughters, Beyonc\u00e9 in 1981 and Solange five years later.\nBeyonc\u00e9, she writes, was \"not an easy baby\". Nursery rhymes did not cut it (\"she cried louder\" to drown out Mary Had A Little Lamb), but jazz music would soothe her.\nAs a child, Solange was a \u201csocial butterfly\u201d but Beyonc\u00e9 was shy. \"She walked into every classroom trying to be invisible,\" Knowles writes.\nShe says at the time, her daughters - and all little black girls - were being \"bombarded\" by messages from mainstream culture that they were \"less than\".\nBut Beyonc\u00e9 was always singing, and Solange's talent emerged early on too.\n\"I knew Beyonc\u00e9 had a very beautiful voice, but I didn't know how talented she was until she was seven,\" Knowles tells me.\n\"And Solange probably four, because she just grew up around nothing but music and performances. So she was a lot earlier.\"\nKnowles is adamant that she didn't push her daughters into the music industry.\n\"Absolutely not. This was not my first choice for my girls. They just lived and breathed music,\" she says.\n\"It is their decision. They were born to be entertainers.\"\nNone of them - including Kelly Rowland, who moved in with the family - were very rebellious, she says. All they wanted to do was sing, dance and perform.\n\"I wanted them to have that experience of teenage life and going out to parties and having fun, but I had to force them to do that,\" she says.\nIn the 1990s, the girl group Destiny's Child was formed. It originally comprised Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett, but the final line-up was a trio - Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, and Michelle Williams.\nThe band achieved worldwide fame with mega hits such as Bills, Bills, Bills, Say My Name and Jumpin', Jumpin'.\nKnowles, who ran a hair salon Headliners and had learned dressmaking, made costumes for the group, while Mathew Knowles quit his job to manage them.\nTheir daughters have gone on to forge hugely successful solo careers.\nSolange won a Grammy Award for Cranes in the Sky, while Beyonc\u00e9 has had countless hits including Single Ladies, Crazy in Love, Halo and Irreplaceable.\nShe finally won best album at this year's Grammy Awards - correcting what was widely seen as an historic wrong.\nThe star was recognised for her eighth album, Cowboy Carter, which celebrates and contextualises the black roots of country music.\nIn an Instagram post ahead of her album launch, Beyonc\u00e9 said Cowboy Carter was \"born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcome\" that prompted her to take \"a deeper dive into the history of country\".\nMany interpreted that as a reference to her treatment at the 2016 Country Music Awards, where her performance of Daddy Lessons with The Chicks led to a barrage of criticism - and racism - online.\nKnowles says Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s childhood, growing up in Texas and spending time in Louisiana, influenced her music.\n\"She was very influenced by [Zydeco, a music genre from Louisiana], and that culture and cowboy culture,\" she says.\nShe added it was \"interesting\" to hear some saying Beyonc\u00e9 is \"not country Western\" and shouldn't be making that kind of music.\n\"It is in her. It\u2019s in her right to make whatever music she feels like making.\"\nAs her daughters rose to international fame, they have had to deal with media pressure and trolling - including, Knowles writes, the speculation that Beyonc\u00e9 was faking her pregnancy with Blue Ivy.\nThere was also an infamous argument between Solange and her brother-in-law Jay-Z in an elevator in 2014, which was leaked by celebrity site TMZ.\nKnowles refuses to be drawn on the lift incident.\nBut when asked how she protects her daughters from comments and trolling online, she says it's actually them who protect her.\n\u201cThey are very astute at blocking out the bull and the lies. And do they hurt them? Sure, but they don't even focus on that,\" she says.\n\"While the world is creating lies and mess, my girls are somewhere in the studio or with their kids minding their business and living their best life.\"\nShe refuses to take credit for keeping her daughters grounded.\n\"I didn't keep them on the straight and narrow. They are just very sensible people with balance in their life,\" she says.\nKnowles also opens up in her book about being diagnosed with Stage 1 breast cancer in her left breast, after doctors discovered two tumours.\nShe is now cancer free.\n\"My daughters and my faith carried me through,\" she writes.\nSo what's next for this family of superstars?\nKnowles is optimistic, saying \"the sky's the limit\" when it comes to what her daughters might do next.\nAs for her grandchildren, she says they are being nurtured in \"anything that they want for themselves... but definitely not pushed in the show business\".\nAt just 13, Blue Ivy has already made strides in her career. Last year, she voiced the character of Kiara in The Lion King prequel Mufasa: The Lion King, and she also performed alongside her mother on her Renaissance tour.\nBut Knowles says that's something Blue Ivy had to \"work for\".\n\"Because her mum was like, no, you got time. You got to make sure that, you know, a lot comes with that.\n\"And so if anything, they're being nurtured to be the best human beings they can be. That's first priority.\"\nAs for whether we can expect Matriarch to be adapted into a reality series, Knowles is reticent.\n\"Oh, not a reality series, but you know, I have been talking to people about the movie rights to it and I would love to see a film made,\" she says.\n\"One of my favourite films is the Jacksons' story. Me and my kids watched it so many times and I just think that it'd be great to see that on film.\"\nMatriarch: A Memoir by Tina Knowles is out now.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'I loved being out there!' O'Sullivan charges into last 16\nRonnie O'Sullivan has said he was \"worried\" about returning to snooker, fearing he would \"implode\" and \"have a meltdown\" in his first competitive match since January.\nO'Sullivan, 49, beat Ali Carter 10-4 on Wednesday in the first round of the World Championship, a competition he has won seven times.\nHowever, his participation in the tournament was only confirmed late last week after he went three months without playing competitively following an incident at the Championship League in January in which he snapped his cue and threw it in a bin.\n\"I lost the buzz for playing because I wasn't able to execute shots,\" said O'Sullivan. \"I was bailing out of shots. I was having to play a different game that I didn't enjoy and it didn't feel like I could express myself, so it got really tough.\"\nRonnie O'Sullivan has won the World Snooker Championship seven times and is aiming to become the first man in the modern era to gain eight titles\nAsked if there were times in the past week where he thought he had made a mistake about returning to snooker, O'Sullivan said: \"Yeah, totally. \n\"I thought 'what am I doing coming here, exposing myself, [potentially] imploding out there, having a meltdown?' All that went through my head. I told [sports psychiatrist] Steve Peters that and he said 'I'm coming - I will get you through the first match'.\n\"I was quite a bit scared coming and playing. It's a daunting venue to play at anyway but it's about getting on the bike again and playing and I'm really proud that I've done that.\n\"Even if I had lost, it didn't really matter. I made that breakthrough. There's still a lot of work to do.\"\nO'Sullivan scored 583 points in five frames on Wednesday, compared with just 43 for Ali Carter\nIn Tuesday's first session against two-time Crucible finalist Carter, neither player was at their best, with it seemingly finely balanced at 5-4 to O'Sullivan.\nBut on Wednesday, 'The Rocket' was in sensational form, winning all five frames and not letting Carter score a point in four of them.\nO'Sullivan made breaks of 59, 117, 74, 123 and 131, but in the post-match news conference stressed he was trying to \"rebuild\" his technique after losing faith in his ability.\nHe said: \"I couldn't even watch myself play as I could see what was wrong. I just couldn't correct it and every time you make a change you think 'this is terrible'.\n\"I've changed my alignment, changed certain things. I had lost all connection with the cue, the timing had gone, the touch had gone, feeling had gone. Years and years of that mounted up and it got to the point where I couldn't play and it got too much.\n\"It got to the point where I couldn't pull the cue forwards and backwards, which was quite scary.\"\nO'Sullivan beat Carter in the Crucible finals in 2008 and 2012\nFour seeded players, including world champions Kyren Wilson and Neil Robertson and last year's runner-up Jak Jones have been eliminated from O'Sullivan's half of the draw.\nChinese qualifier Pang Junxu is his opponent in the second round, although O'Sullivan said he enjoyed his Crucible return because he had not placed any expectations on himself. \n\"This game can humble you so many times,\" said O'Sullivan. \"To play one good session. It was a nice feeling and I did enjoy being out there.\n\"I didn't feel too nervous because my expectation levels were maybe just to get a few frames and see where we go. I didn't feel pressure and normally when I come here with a half-decent game I feel pressure more as it is a chance to go deep [into the draw], but on this occasion I wasn't expecting to do much.\n\"I'm going to give myself two years. No more exhibitions, no more distractions off the table. It might take one month, six months, a year and give it a good go. I owe it to snooker and to myself. I just have to put everything into this tournament.\"\nCarter felt O'Sullivan would claim an eighth world title if he could maintain the form he showed on Wednesday.\n\"No question, no-one can live with that,\" said the world number 18. \"He could've had 10 years off and still come here. He is a freak natural, that's why you love to watch him - he played fabulously well.\n\"When the opponent is potting all the balls every mistake is highlighted and you just have to sit and watch and hope. He looks like he is in a good place and he is the man to beat.\"\nJohn Parrott, the 1991 world champion, speaking on BBC Two, added: \"There should be a sign in the foyer which should say 'Quiet please, genius at work'.\n\"We use the word 'genius' in sport with people like Lionel Messi and players like Tiger Woods in his pomp. This boy is in that [bracket]. It's been over an extended period as well, and when he plays the cue ball sings.\n\"O'Sullivan seems in a very good place. He was born to play snooker, and when he's out there he's at peace with it.\"\nRuthless O'Sullivan cruises into Crucible last 16\nWatch: World Snooker Championship - Trump leads Zhou, Selby v Woollaston\nWorld Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coverage",

        "article_text": "Sister Midnight, Santosh and All We Imagine as Light are part of a new wave of female-centred Indian films challenging the roles of traditional Bollywood heroines.\nThey're unpredictable, sometimes humorous, sometimes sexually adventurous, and they're all leading characters, rather than orbiting a man. The heroines of films including Sister Midnight, Santosh, Girls Will Be Girls, All We Imagine as Light and Shadowbox are giving international audiences a chance to see female characters from India who differ from most traditional Bollywood heroines. But do Indian audiences want to watch them \u2013 or will they even be able to?\nA feral bride in an arranged marriage that neither she nor the groom particularly want, Uma is the protagonist of Karan Kandhari's spiky comedy Sister Midnight, which premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for a Bafta. Well-known Bollywood actress Radhika Apte, who plays her, is shown struggling with household chores. \"Men are dim,\" her neighbour tells her. \"They'll eat anything. Just add chilli and salt.\" Uma informs her awkward groom, who has gone on a week-long drinking binge, that he \"stinks\" and tells her employers sarcastically when they offer her a cleaning job that she's \"a domestic goddess\".\u00a0\nTold through offbeat dialogue, physical comedy and a punkish soundtrack that includes Iggy Pop, Sister Midnight presents a heroine unlike anything else filmed in India, according to Apte. \"I'd never read anything like it before and I couldn't put it down,\" she tells the BBC. \"I was completely taken by Uma, she was this crazy creature, and I didn't know why I resonated with her, but I just did. It was going to be a very thin line playing her between it being really cool and it going wrong. And that excited and challenged me. I also like how unapologetic Uma is and the more she accepts herself, the freer and stronger she becomes.\" \u00a0\nUma is the latest character that offers a different kind of female protagonist to Indian viewers, one who differs markedly from the traditional Bollywood heroine. \"Bollywood\", the name for Hindi-language studio cinema, has historically dominated the Indian box office, making around $1.36bn last year. But it's also been accused of being \"sexist and regressive\" in its attitude towards women. In 2023, a landmark study in India examined some of the country's biggest hits in terms of gender representation and sexual stereotyping, and found what they described as a \"formula\" to many of Bollywood's female characters.\u00a0\n\"The female lead has to be thin and beautiful. She has to be coy and demure who expresses consent through gestures rather than words, but [she] wears sexually revealing clothing and has to be somewhat modern to allow for her to be in a pre-marital relationship which is a transgression,\" Professor Lakshmi Lingam, the project lead for the study, told the BBC at the time. \"There's very little attempt to do something different.\"\nThe depiction of both male and female characters on screen is important, she added, because \"in India, where families and schools rarely teach about sex education and consent, all our responses are influenced by books and cinema\".\nBy contrast, the male stars of the biggest Bollywood films of 2023 were described as \"led by alpha male protagonists with rippling muscles and blazing guns brandished on screen as they went on a bone-crunching rampage to vanquish their enemies\". The hit films included Shah Rukh Khan's Pathaan and Jawan, in which he plays a spy and vigilante, as well as the much-criticised, hyper-violent Animal, starring Ranbir Kapoor, a film accused of misogyny and objectifying women. It was made by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, whose previous film Kabir Singh showed the male lead openly stalking and harassing a woman and was the second biggest Bollywood movie of 2019.\u00a0\nThere have been hit films showing women in roles of authority, including female rocket scientists in Mission Mangal, also one of the most successful Bollywood films of 2019, and films praised for a modern perspective on gender roles, such as Karan Johar's Rocky aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani (Rocky and Rani's Love Story). But nevertheless\u00a0Shubhra Gupta, the film critic for daily newspaper The Indian Express, laments the lack of \"wriggle room\" India's leading ladies generally have in their roles.\n\"These heroines' overriding principle is demureness,\" she tells the BBC. \"You can have flashes of spirit, or you may speak your mind, but you'd also be just right in terms of beauty, and you'd be very clearly subservient to the leading man and whatever he is doing. You are pretty much always bringing up the rear, with a few scenes in which you get to shine.\"\nIn Sandhya Suri's recent drama Santosh, however, a Dalit woman (from the lowest caste in Indian society) is as a police officer, with the authority that brings. Santosh inherits her husband's police officer job when he dies in service, something that's possible on compassionate grounds for government employees in India. Santosh, played by Shahana Goswami, is an enigmatic character who finds corruption in her local police force when a young girl is raped and murdered. She has a female boss, played by film and TV actress Sunita Rajwar, who has learned to compromise to stay at the top.\nSuri, previously a documentary maker, says she was influenced in making it by the real-life gang rape and murder in 2012 of a young woman on a bus in Delhi, which made worldwide headlines and led to new laws to safeguard women. (Despite that, sexual violence against women and girls remains high in India, and a 2022 report found that cruelty by a husband or his relatives remained the biggest crime against Indian women.)\n\"There were big protests at the time [of the rape and murder], and I saw the photo of a female cop being confronted by some very angry female protestors. I saw that image and I saw the expression on the cop's face, and it was so enigmatic that I was just very, very taken by it. It was so interesting. She was at both ends of power. There was the possibility of violence against her, but [it was] also possible for her to mete out violence as well with that uniform,\" Suri tells the BBC.\n\"I wanted to know if you took somebody like Santosh, shut up in the kitchen of her house, and you put her in that place, what's her response to that?\" she explains. \"I wanted to ask if there was a way to be a woman that's not about being a man, and not about being oppressed. Is there some other way in her society in which she can be, and that there may be a line she steps over?\"\nSantosh, which was made in Hindi, was the UK's Oscar entry for best international film in 2025 \u2013 one attribute both Sister Midnight and Santosh share is that, though they were filmed in India, they're made by British Indian film-makers. Sister Midnight's makers hope to release it in India in 2025, but Suri tells the BBC that Santosh will almost certainly not get a cinema release there.\n\"We screened it at the Mumbai International Film Festival and had a great response, and I was moved by just how real the film felt to a local audience,\" she says. \"But it looks like the film won't release in India, sadly, as it was admitted to the censor board (CBFC) and there were so many cuts, I couldn't maintain some semblance of a film.\"\nIndian censorship decisions have frequently caused controversy: in 2017, the decision to ban the feminist Indian movie Lipstick Under My Burkha for being \"too lady oriented\" caused an outcry, and was later overturned after negative publicity. But many homegrown blockbusters are self-censoring, especially when it comes to sex and sexuality.\u00a0\nThe 2021 Telugu-language hit Pushpa: The Rise, the story of a smuggler, removed a scene where the hero Pushpa (played by Allu Arjun) touches the chest of the heroine, Srivalli, because of complaints from the audience. In 2024, Pushpa 2: The Rule again caused controversy in India, according to Shubhra Gupta, because of an insinuation that Srivalli (played by Rashmika Mandanna) might want to be sexually intimate with her husband.\n\"The [female] character acts very cute, she comes on to the hero and is very playful when she wants a little assignation,\" Gupta says of it. \"The rest of the film she's serving the hero. She wants her husband not to have sex with anyone else. But in fact, it became a real talking point in India because it's not something heroes or leading ladies in the movies are supposed to have conversations about.\n\"And our mainstream film experience is still very much that if a woman has a sexual experience outside marriage, there will be some castigation attached to it,\" she adds. \"She won't be 'pure' anymore, she'll be known as 'bold' which means she's been around.\"\u00a0\nIt makes Payal Kapadia's acclaimed film All We Imagine as Light seem more audacious in terms of its exploration of sex. The first ever Indian winner of the Cannes Film Festival's Grand Prix is the story of a nurse, Prabha, who's been abandoned in her arranged marriage. Meanwhile, her younger flatmate Anu, a Hindu, wants to get intimate with her Muslim boyfriend, itself another taboo. There's no talk of marriage in advance.\n\"The film's about the preoccupations I've had for some time,\" Kapadia tells the BBC. \"Women in India can be financially independent, but there is still not a lot of autonomy with what you choose to do with your personal life. It's infantilising women. You could be 25 years old, making your own money, providing for your family back home. But you can't decide who to be with or who to marry.\"\nDespite the accolades, All We Imagine as Light was not chosen as India's 2025 Oscar entry (the deciding jury called it \"a European film taking place in India\".) But it wasn't the only film by an Indian female director in 2024 that put a young woman's sexual awakening on screen \u2013 the English and Hindi language movie Girls Will Be Girls, by Shuchi Talati, won the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival. Set in a boarding school in the Himalayas, it's the story of an 18-year-old girl who falls in love with a boy for the first time, but whose romance is disrupted by her mother.\nBut Indian films breaking societal \"norms\" have found international recognition before, from Mira Nair's Monsoon Wedding (2001), to Lipstick Under My Burkha (2016), and 2014's LGBTQ+ teenage love story, Margarita with a Straw. Shubhra Gupta says there's still a vast gap between what an international audience react to and what mainstream Indian audiences will pay to see, given the high ticket prices in cinemas.\n\"These films we're talking about are part of independent Indian film, which is really where all the exciting things happen, and that's pretty much true of all world cinema,\" she says. \"Payal Kapadia has had a fabulous journey with All We Imagine as Light, and it did get a cinema release here. But I'm not sure how much box office it made in India.\" She adds that many viewers in India would react in \"disbelief\" to heroines such as Sister Midnight's Uma and Santosh were they able to watch the movies, as they are so unconventional.\n\"They wouldn't be able to suspend disbelief that in Santosh, a Dalit woman from the lower caste, would be made into the lead, that she's driving the narrative. It would be such a hard sell here,\" she says. \"And Radhika Apte's character Uma is a wife, but she is not submissive. She goes out there and does all these mad things. They are excellent films that might do well on a streaming platform, or they will find a discerning audience\u00a0\u2013 but a discerning audience doesn't really make up the numbers that a big budget Bollywood film will.\"\u00a0\nBut Indian film-makers still have to try to break stereotypes for audiences, according to Tanushree Das and Saumyananda Sahi, the directors behind Bengali-language film Shadowbox. The film, shown at this year's Berlin International Film Festival, is the story of Maya, (played by Tillotama Shome) who holds down several jobs and battles to keep her family going because her husband, a former soldier, struggles with his mental health and is frequently humiliated by the community because of it.\n\"When we're talking about working class underprivileged women, the term 'from the margins' tends to crop up,\" Das tells the BBC. \"But the 'margin' represents a huge majority of our population. Where are their stories, then? It's high time we broke stereotypes, and to do this more women need to tell their own stories. I feel producers and distributors of film underestimate how large a viewership women represent, and their appetite to see stories where their lives are mirrored rather than projected in a tokenistic way.\"\nIf cinema itself is not an option, the rise of the international streamers and OTT platforms (which allow viewers to watch content directly on their TV or through a phone app) during the Covid-19 pandemic has provided a place for recent, more audacious, female-focused film-making. The Great Indian Kitchen in 2021 by Jeo Baby, a Malayalam language film, became a hit on the app Neestream, and versions of the story were also made in Tamil and Hindi. It's the story of an arranged marriage, and the film shows, from a female viewpoint, household drudgery, unpleasant in-laws and monotonous and painful sex with an uncaring husband, with one female critic saying of it that \"the film rips through patriarchy, the bedrock of the institutions of family and religion.\"\nLaapataa Ladies, by Kiran Rao (which did become India's Oscar entry this year) also deals with an unwanted arranged marriage and was released on Netflix, as was 2020's Gunjan Saxena, which told the story of India's first ever female fighter pilot.\n\"But people are not actually buying a ticket for these,\" Gupta says. \"It's mostly 15-to 35-year-olds who are going to the movies, and often they happen to be young men. And the film industry is still a boy's club to a large extent.\"\u00a0\nFor more nuanced female characters to be seen in big-budget cinema films, ultimately Bollywood's lack of profits last year might be an impetus. After its bumper 2023, last year Bollywood only achieved 40% of the overall Indian box office profits, and Gupta says its \"formulaic films\" are part of the problem. \"People are hungry for something different,\" she says. \"But the problem is, if you take them too far out of their comfort zone, I'm not sure whether they're going to come to the cinema. So unfortunately, we've ended up maintaining this equilibrium so that people will come to the movies not expecting to see women who are feminists, or women who do not ascribe to the idea of what a good woman should be.\"\nHowever, she adds, it's not just female characters who have to be written differently in order for change to come. \"I would say that if you want your women characters to be different, you also have to write your men differently too,\" says Gupta. \"There needs to be a cosmic shift across the board.\"\nSantosh and Sister Midnight are currently on release in the UK. Sister Midnight will be released in the US on 16 May 2025.\n--\nIf you liked this story\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X, and\u00a0Instagram",

The film, shown at this year's Berlin International Film Festival, is the story of Maya, (played by Tillotama Shome) who holds down several jobs and battles to keep her family going because her husband, a former soldier, struggles with his mental health and is frequently humiliated by the community because of it.It's high time we broke stereotypes, and to do this more women need to tell their own stories \u2013 Tanushree Das\"When we're talking about working class underprivileged women, the term 'from the margins' tends to crop up,\" Das tells the BBC.",

        "article_text": "Andrew Flintoff has given his first account of the car crash he was in while filming Top Gear, saying he thought he \"was dead\" in the immediate aftermath.\nThe England cricketer-turned-TV presenter sustained serious facial and rib injuries when the three-wheeler car he was driving for the BBC motoring programme rolled over in 2022.\nSpeaking in a new Disney+ documentary, 'Freddie' Flintoff said that despite the trauma, he \"remembers everything about it\".\n\"I thought I was dead, because I was conscious but I couldn't see anything,\" he recalled.\n\"I was thinking, is that it? Is that it? You know what I mean? Just black for the rest of my days?\n\"My hat came over my eyes - so I pulled my hat up and I thought, no I'm not [dead], I'm on the Top Gear track, this is not heaven.\"\nFlintoff then looked down to see blood, and said his \"biggest fear\" was that he no longer had a face left.\n\"I thought my face had come off. I was frightened to death.\"\nHe recalled being in \"agony\" for between half an hour and 40 minutes until an air ambulance arrived and he was taken to hospital.\nThe incident took place on 13 December 2022 at Top Gear's test track at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome in Surrey.\nHe was driving an open-topped Morgan Super 3 when it flipped and slid, dragging him along the track during filming.\nSpeaking in the documentary, he described how time seemed to slow down as the car rolled over, and how his quick reactions as a cricketer allowed him to move his head in an attempt to avoid even worse injuries.\n\"As it started going over, I looked at the ground and I knew, if I get hit here on the side [of the head] then I'll break my neck, or if I get hit on the temple I'm dead. The best chance is to go face down.\n\"And then I remember hitting [the ground] and my head got hit,\" he added. \"But then I got dragged out, and the car went over, and I went over the back of the car, and then [I got] pulled face down on the runway about 50m underneath the car. And then I hit the grass and then [it] flipped back.\"\nSurgeon Jahrad Haq, who treated Flintoff, told the documentary the injuries were \"very complex\" - a mixture of hard and soft tissue injuries, broken teeth, lost teeth and elements of the upper jaw bone that were also fractured and displaced.\nHe \"lost a really significant portion of his upper lip - the skin and some of the underlying muscle - and also his lower lip,\" he said.\nMr Haq said the injuries were in the \"top five\" in terms of severity of those he had seen during his career.\nReflecting on the recovery, Flintoff said he \"didn't think I had it in me to get through\" the ordeal.\n\"This sounds awful. Part of me wishes I'd been killed. Part of me thinks I wish I'd died,\" he added.\n\"I didn't want to kill myself. I don't want to mistake the two things. I was not wishing, but thinking, this would have been so much easier...\n\"Now I try to take the attitude, you know what, the sun will come up tomorrow, and then my kids will still give me a hug, and I'm probably in a better place now.\"\nOne of England's most successful cricketers, Flintoff previously said he is \"loving\" his return to the sport coaching England Lions - the development squad underneath England Men's cricket team.\nFlintoff's wife Rachael told the documentary his return to the sport was crucial on the road to recovery. \n\"When Andrew needed it most, cricket was there for him,\" she said. \"It sounds a bit weird saying it, a bit over the top to say, but I do think cricket saved him. It gave him a reason for being, again.\"\nThe 47-year-old also returned to television last year with a second series of his BBC programme Freddie Flintoff's Field of Dreams, which saw him take a team of young cricketers from his hometown of Preston on a tour of India, a year after his crash.\nThe acclaimed series is up for a Bafta Television Award in the factual series category next month.\nHe also hosted a reboot of darts game show Bullseye over Christmas, which will return for a full series later this year.\nIn 2023, the BBC \"rested\" Top Gear for the foreseeable future. A financial settlement was also reached with Flintoff.\nThe documentary, titled Flintoff, is on Disney+ from Friday, 25 April.",

It's going to be be tough for everyone because people have grown up watching him. It will take some getting used to not having him around the club.\"\nVardy has scored 198 times in 496 appearances for the Foxes since his \u00a31m move from Fleetwood in 2012, showing the quality that led to appearances at Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup. \nEven before their memorable and miraculous title achievement, though, he helped Leicester to their 'Great Escape' in the 2014-15 campaign where they won seven of their last nine games to avoid relegation under Nigel Pearson. \nVardy scored goals in the Champions League and Europa League, and won the Premier League's Golden Boot in 2019-20 after scoring 23 times - the oldest to win the prize at the age of 33.\nHe also beat current Foxes boss Ruud van Nistelrooy's record of scoring in consecutive Premier League games when he netted in his 11th straight match against Manchester United in 2015.\nVardy was Leicester's leading light and the influential figure they turned to, and could rely on, in times of need.\nAfter relegation in 2023, he scored 20 times in all competitions last season as they won the Championship and, amid Leicester's troubles in this campaign, he is their top scorer with eight goals.\nIt's no surprise he was on target when they last scored at home in the league on 8 December against Brighton. They have since failed to do so in nine successive matches at the King Power, setting an unwanted top-flight record and a major reason why they are second bottom in the table and 18 points adrift of safety.\nWinger Albrighton played with Vardy for 10 years after he moved to Leicester from Aston Villa on a free transfer in 2014, and they formed a tight bond on and off the pitch.\nThere is a view of Vardy, especially from opposition fans, as a wind-up merchant who takes delight in responding to abuse and gestures aplenty.\nA central figure in the dressing room too, players also have a pre-conceived opinion of him.\nBut that changes once they meet him as Albrighton, 35, revealed: \"He's a very unique character, very unique. There's nobody who came into the dressing room that was anything like him. I had a great relationship with him so he's always been fantastic with me. \n\"The way he is with everybody in the dressing room was incredible. New signings would come in with a perception of him and they'd quickly find out the true character behind his personality. \n\"He is a down-to-earth person, very, very humble, just normal. People make out he is some sort of a superstar, but he's just normal. \n\"He likes the normal things, the simple things in life, he's a family man and is just an all-round good person, he'll do anything for you.\"\nThis video can not be played\nWhen Vardy broke Van Nistelrooy's Premier League record\nAs the last player still left at the club, Vardy is also the remaining link to Leicester's title-winning squad and his departure will signal a new era.\nThe Foxes need a reset after relegation, with Van Nistelrooy's future in doubt after 17 defeats in 22 games during his five months in charge.\nVardy, and goalkeepers Daniel Iversen and Danny Ward, are the only players out of contract in the summer, meaning Leicester will need to work to move others on. \nThe forward's reported \u00a3140,000-a-week wages would have dropped to around \u00a3100,000-a-week in the Championship, so it will free up much-needed money.\nMore changes are expected off the pitch too, with fans demanding the dismissal of director of football Jon Rudkin.\nBut the club's future is uncertain, with the possibility of sanctions from the EFL following the club's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) breach in the three years up to the 2022-23 campaign. \nLeicester escaped a points deduction after successfully arguing they were not a top-flight club at the time of the charge, but the EFL could move, once they are officially a Championship club and transfer their Premier League share to one of the promoted sides.\nLeicester's financial situation could also have been a consideration on whether to extend Vardy's contract.\nJamie Vardy had a good relationship with boss Dean Smith at Leicester\nVardy, who will turn 39 next January, wants to keep on playing and there will be no shortage of takers at home or abroad.\nHe said: \"This isn't retirement. I want to keep playing and doing what I enjoy doing most, scoring goals. Hopefully there's one or two more for Leicester between now and the end of the season and many more in the future.\n\"I may be 38 but I've still got the desire and ambition to achieve so much more.\"\nHis wages are likely to be out of reach for any Championship club, even those with the deepest pockets, so he will need to take a significant cut.\nWrexham had already been mentioned as a possible destination before the announcement and their rise, from the National League to within two wins of a Championship place, is similar to Vardy's own personal journey.\nHe will surely have interest from Major League Soccer and enjoyed a strong relationship with Charlotte FC boss Dean Smith during his time in charge of the Foxes two years ago.\nSmith tried to sign Vardy last summer and could well reignite that interest.\nCharlotte are top of the Eastern Conference, while Vardy's former team-mate and fellow title winner Christian Fuchs is also one of Smith's assistants.\nSmith said in August: \"I did text him and see if he wanted to come over to America, but I knew that was going to be hard once he took Leicester back to the Premier League.\"\nThere could also be interest from Saudi Arabia, but his family will be a factor in any future destination as Vardy and wife Rebekah share five children.\nBut, as the Foxes icon looks to script another chapter in his career and life, football may never see a story like his and Leicester's again.",

        "article_text": "US stocks and the dollar plunged again as President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on the US central bank boss calling him \"a major loser\" for not lowering interest rates.\nIn a social media post, Trump called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates \"pre-emptively\" to help boost the economy, saying Powell had been consistently too slow to respond to economic developments. \n\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote.\nTrump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy comes as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. \nThe president's intensifying clash with Powell, whom he named to lead the Fed during his first term, has added to the market turmoil.\nThe S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest US companies, fell roughly 2.4% on Monday. It has lost roughly 12% of its value since the start of the year. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4% and has dropped about 10% so far this year, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.5% and is down roughly 18% since January.\nHowever, on Tuesday, trading on most major stock indexes in the Asia-Pacific region was subdued. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed around 0.1% lower, and the ASX 200 in Sydney closed around 0.3% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher.\nIn European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax was down around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%.\nThough the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence. \nThe dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022.\nInterest rates on US government debt also continued to rise on Tuesday, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries.\nMeanwhile, the price of gold hit a new all-time record high, breaking the $3,500 (\u00a32,613) per ounce mark as investors seek out so-called \"safe haven\" assets.\nThe precious metal is viewed as a safer place to put money during times of economic uncertainty.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said as well as tariffs, gold's appeal had also increased due there being \"no long-term resolution in sight for conflicts around the world, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza\".\n\"There are also concerns about the risk that geo-political tensions escalate as opportunities in the Arctic are eyed by the US and Russia,\" she added.\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs.\nThe latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy.\nTrump last week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\"\nSuch a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank.\nPowell last year told reporters he did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him. \nBut one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.\n\nTrump's latest comments come as top economic policymakers are gathering in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\nChristopher Meissner, a professor of economics at University of California, Davis, and who formerly worked with the IMF, told the BBC's Today programme that before the 1970s there was \"significant\" political pressure on the Federal Reserve from time to time.\n\"However, the past 30 or 40 years what we've learned is that central bank independence is the key to financial stability and low inflation. And I think this is a major reversal and we have to watch out for it,\" he added.\n\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" added Ms Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThe IMF will publish its latest growth forecasts for individual countries later, and last week it said these projections would include \"notable markdowns\".\nMr Meissner said: \"They used to say 'When the US sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold'. It'll be really curious to see if that continues.\n\"However, I think people are expecting a pretty significant downturn in the US in the coming months... and that can't be good for the rest of the world.\"\nMs Streeter said that Trump's policies had damaged the reputation of the US, which is \"no longer being seen as a calmer port in a storm\".\n\"Yields on 10\u2013year US Treasuries have held onto their recent rise above 4.4%. It's another sign of unease about the direction of the US economy, amid worries that policies playing out could keep inflation higher and slow growth, and flags the anxiety rattling through the markets right now,\" she added.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "\"Out! Out! Out!\"\nThe voice in the Telegram video is insistent. Loud. Sometimes musical.\nAnd the message unambiguous.\n\"All of Hamas, out!\"\nOn the streets of Gaza, more and more Palestinians are expressing open defiance against the armed group that's ruled the strip for almost 20 years.\nMany hold Hamas responsible for plunging the tiny, impoverished territory into the worst crisis faced by Palestinians in more than 70 years.\n\"Deliver the message,\" another crowd chants, as it surges through Gaza's devastated streets: \"Hamas is garbage.\"\n\"The world is deceived by the situation in the Gaza Strip,\" says Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza lawyer and former organiser of the 2019 anti-Hamas \"We Want to Live\" movement. \nAl-Natour spoke to us from the shattered remains of his city, the flimsy canvas side of the tent which now forms part of his house billowing behind him.\n\"The world thinks that Gaza is Hamas and Hamas is Gaza,\" he said. \"We didn't choose Hamas and now Hamas is determined to rule Gaza and tie our fate to its own. Hamas must retreat. \"\nSpeaking out is dangerous. Hamas has never tolerated dissent. Al-Natour seems undaunted, writing a furious column for the Washington Post at the end of March.\n\"To support Hamas is to be for Palestinian death,\" he wrote, \"not Palestinian freedom\".\nWasn't it dangerous to speak out in this way, I asked him.\n\"We need to take a risk and speak out,\" he replied without hesitation.\n\"I'm 30 years old. When Hamas took over, I was 11. What have I done with my life? My life has been wasted between war and escalating violence for nothing.\"\nSince Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 by violently ousting political rivals, a year after winning national elections, there have been three major wars with Israel and two smaller conflicts.\n\"Humanity demands that we raise our voices,\" al-Natour said, \"despite suppression by Hamas\".\nHamas may be busy fighting Israel, but it's not afraid to punish its critics.\nAt the end of March, 22-year old Oday al-Rubai was abducted by armed gunmen from a refugee shelter in Gaza City.\nHours later, his body was found covered in horrific wounds.\nThe Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights said Oday had been tortured, calling his death \"a grave violation of the right to life and an extrajudicial killing\".\nAl-Rubai had participated in recent anti-Hamas protests. His family blamed Hamas for his death and demanded justice.\nDays earlier, a frightened al-Rubai posted a dark, grainy video on social media in which he expressed his fear that Hamas militants were coming for him.\n\"Gaza has become a city of ghosts,\" he said, glancing over his shoulder.\n\"I'm stranded in the street, not knowing where to go. I don't know why they're after me. They destroyed us and brought ruin to us.\"\nAt his funeral, a small crowd demanded revenge and repeated demands for Hamas to get out of Gaza.\nLast summer, Amin Abed almost suffered the same fate, following his decision to speak out against Hamas.\nMasked militants beat him senseless, broke bones all over his body and damaged his kidneys. Abed survived but had to seek medical treatment abroad.\nNow living in Dubai, he's still involved in the protest movement, and believes that Hamas' authority is diminished.\n\"Hamas' power has begun to fade,\" he told me.\n\"It targets activists and civilians, beats and kills them to scare people. But it's not how it was before.\"\nBefore the ceasefire collapsed last month, Hamas fighters seemed intent on highly visible displays of power.\nBut now, with Israel once again attacking relentlessly, the same gunmen have retreated underground and Gaza's civilians have been plunged back into the misery of war.\nSome of the more recent protests suggest that civilians, driven to the edge of madness by a year and a half of Israeli bombardment, are losing their fear of Hamas.\nBeit Lahiya, at the northern end of the Gaza Strip, has seen some of the most vociferous opposition.\nIn a series of voice notes, an eyewitness \u2013 who asked not to be named \u2013 described several recent incidents in which local residents prevented Hamas fighters from carrying out military actions from inside their community.\nOn 13 April, he said, Hamas gunmen tried to force their way into the house of an elderly man, Jamal al-Maznan.\n\"They wanted to launch rockets and pipes [a derogatory term used for some of Hamas' home-made projectiles] from inside his house,\" the eyewitness told us.\n\"But he refused.\"\nThe incident soon escalated, with relatives and neighbours all coming to al-Maznan's defence. The gunmen opened fire, injuring several people, but eventually were driven out.\n\"They were not intimidated by the bullets,\" the eyewitness said of the protesters.\n\"They advanced and told [the gunmen] to take their things and flee. We don't want you in this place. We don't want your weapons that have brought us destruction, devastation and death.\"\nElsewhere in Gaza, protesters have told militants to stay away from hospitals and schools, to avoid situations in which civilians are caught up in Israeli air strikes.\nBut such defiance is still risky. In Gaza City, Hamas shot one such protester dead.\nWith little to lose and hopes of an end to the war dashed once more, some Gazans direct their fury equally at Israel and Hamas.\nAsked which side he blamed most for Gaza's catastrophe, Amin Abed said it was \"a choice between cholera and the plague\".\nThe protest movement of recent weeks is not yet a rebellion, but after almost 20 years of rule Hamas' iron grip on Gaza is slowly slipping.",

Doctors believed she may have had a stroke. \nShe had only been due to remain there for four days for tests, but came out two years later completely paralysed. Unable to walk, talk or open her eyes, she was told she would never move again. \nMegan was diagnosed with Functional Neurological Disorder (FND), which meant there was a problem with how her brain received and sent information to the rest of the body.\nHaving stayed in a neurological care home in Peterborough, she is now preparing to move into her own home with the hope of becoming a nail technician. \nMegan said at the age of 18, when she moved to Eagle Wood Neurological Care Centre, she was \"still just a baby\". \nShe had never been on her own before and had to move away from her family near Bath to receive the care she needed. \n\"It was not easy. I think it was a lot harder for my mum and dad to have to leave me there on my own, but I couldn't do anything for myself. I was paralysed from the neck down,\" she told the BBC.\n\"I couldn't see, I couldn't talk. I hate the word, but I was very vulnerable at the time.\n\"I started feeling poorly when I was 13. It started off very slowly, very gradually and then in 2021, things just declined rapidly.\n\"I was taken into hospital because they were concerned I had had a stroke, or something, because I lost the ability to talk.\n\"I was taken for four days of tests and came out of hospital two years later.\" \nHer illness was eventually diagnosed as FND.\n\"It stops the functioning of signals from the brain to your body from working properly and causes all sorts of neurological symptoms,\" she said. \n\"I couldn't do anything for myself, I lost the ability to talk.\n\"I couldn't see, so I wasn't able to open my eyes. My brain couldn't register the difference between eyes closed and eyes being open.\"\nShe also lost the ability to swallow and was fed by a feeding tube in her mouth, which has been replaced by one straight into her stomach.\nAt her worst, she had 50 seizures a day, but that has now reduced to between 10 and 15.\nAfter 18 months of extensive therapy, her life is completely different. \nShe said: \"I can move everything now.

        "article_text": "For 16 generations, master gardeners in this one family have dedicated their lives to preserving one of the nation's most cherished \u2013 and highly sought-out \u2013 symbols.\nEach spring during sakura (cherry blossom) season, the Ninna-ji and Daikaku-ji temples in Kyoto's leafy Ukyo ward are overwhelmed by busloads of tourists who come to snap photos of the temples' blooming cherry trees. But little do they know that only a few kilometres away, there's a secret sakura garden hiding in plain sight.\nThis 1.5-hectare public plot, known as the Sano family garden, is an oasis of calm; found just off an unassuming street near traditional wooden machiya townhouses. But this isn't just any ordinary cherry blossom tree grove; it's also the domain of 97-year-old T\u014demon Sano: Japan's most renowned sakuramori (cherry blossom guardian).\nFor more than a millennium, Japanese people have admired the delicate sakura petals as a symbol of transience and beauty. Today, this national pastime has blossomed into an international obsession, with millions of tourists from across the world descending on Japan to sip seasonal sakura-themed Starbucks drinks and participate in hanami (cherry blossom viewing) picnics and festivals from March to May. But while the world waits with bated breath for the cotton candy-coloured blossoms to burst each spring, one of the most important and least understood roles in the trees' maintenance lies with their behind-the-scenes caretakers.\nAccording to Naoko Abe, cherry blossom expert and author of The Sakura Obsession, skilled sakura arborists have existed in Japan since time immemorial. But thanks to the popularity of the 1970s novel Sakuramori about a sakura-infatuated tree expert, communities began bestowing this title to deserving specialists in the years that followed. Typically a professional gardener or tree surgeon, a sakuramori is a combination of Lorax, botanist and spiritual guide dedicated to studying sakura and promoting their preservation.\nAs Asada Nobuyuki, the secretary general of the Japan Sakura Association, explained, there are roughly 100 sakuramori in Japan today, but one stands out. \"It can be said that T\u014demon Sano is most deserving of the title sakuramori,\" said Nobuyuki, crediting the breadth of Sano's long, productive career and his family's generational wisdom.\nOn a Friday morning earlier this month, I crunched through gravel at this historic sanctuary to meet Sano himself. He is the 16th generation in a distinguished line of farmers who began cultivating the nearby land (known for its late-blooming dwarf cherry trees) in the mid-1600s. When his father died in 1981, he assumed the first name T\u014demon, per family tradition, and took the reins of Uet\u014d Z\u014den, the landscaping firm his family started in 1832 that is headquartered in the garden.\nFor more than 80 years,Sano has utilised his specialised knowledge to steward the survival of sakura trees in gardens throughout Japan and the world \u2013 including at the Isamu Noguchi-designed Japanese garden at the Unesco headquarters in Paris. Sakura Taikan, his most famous book, is the definitive tome on the trees and the culmination of research begun by his grandfather during the\u00a0Taish\u014d period (1912\u20131926).\nBut just before our visit, the nonagenarian became ill and was rushed to hospital. Still, he arranged for me to meet his son, Shinichi Sano, who oversees operations at Uet\u014d Z\u014den and who will one day succeed his father and carry on the family legacy as the next T\u014demon and sakuramori.\nAs we strolled through the garden, Shinichi paused at an umbrella-like shidarezakura (weeping cherry), its swooping branches covered in geisha-blush blossoms. Shinichi said this 40-year-old tree was grown from the seeds of the most iconic sakura in Kyoto: the dramatic weeping cherry tree in Maruyama Park, which was originally grown in the Sano family garden and replanted in its current public spot by T\u014demon's father, the 15th T\u014demon Sano.\nThough sakura have attracted hanami lovers for generations, Shinichi said a major threat now looms over them: climate change. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, cherry blossoms have started to bloom 1.2 days earlier per decade since 1953. A recent study found that the peak bloom of Kyoto's cherry blossoms in 2020, 2021 and 2023 were the earliest in more than 1,200 years.\n\"If global warming continues at this rate, I believe there will eventually be regions in Japan where cherry trees no longer bloom,\" Shinichi said, noting that winters with elevated temperatures could nip blooms in the bud entirely, as trees require a sustained chill to initiate the blossoming process. If this happens, a major part of Japan's springtime tourism appeal would be jeopardised \u2013 as well as an integral part of the nation's cultural identity.\n\"The reason Japanese people are fond of cherry blossoms is because, after enduring a harsh winter, the vivid flowers bloom in the monochrome landscape as if to herald the long-awaited arrival of spring. This quiet presence is what draws people in and resonates deeply in our hearts,\" T\u014demon later told me over email after being released from hospital. \"Out of 365 days a year, the cherry blossoms endure wind and snow for 360 days, only to bloom gloriously for five days before gracefully scattering. I believe this fleeting yet dignified cycle reflects the Japanese perspective on life. There may be a sense of personification in the way we view the cherry blossom, as if it embodies a spiritual or moral belief that, through patience and perseverance, one will eventually bloom.\"\u00a0\nCherry blossoms are integral to the Japanese psyche and soul. In ancient Japan, kami (deities) were said to reside in the trees. Beginning in the 800s, Emperor Saga (whose former residence is up the road from the Sano family garden at Daikaku-ji) ushered in the practice of hanami with official cherry blossom viewing parties. For samurai during the Kamakura period (1185-1333), sakura became a unifying military symbol for the warriors to fall with dignity and grace \u2013 a message echoed during World War Two for kamikaze pilots. In light of this national importance, protecting sakura and ensuring their sustainability is something Japan takes seriously.\nToday, according to Abe, many of the most famous places travellers go to see sakura in Japan, such as Mount Yoshino in Nara and Matsumae Park in Hokkaido, each have a dedicated sakuramori. Interestingly, T\u014demon and his family's unbroken line of Japanese gardeners may not have risen to the level of sakuramori were it not for a British botanist.\nIn 1902, English naturalist Collingwood \"Cherry\" Ingram became fascinated by Japanese cherry trees during his first visit to the nation, but he lamented how industrialisation and cloning had led to a decline in their diversity. In an effort to protect them, he sent 50 endangered varieties back to England and planted them in his garden. When he eventually tried to propagate the varieties back in Japan come the 1930s, including the rare Taihaku cherry that had ceased to be cultivated in Japan, the trees didn't survive long.\nGiven the Sano family's generational expertise, Ingram sought out T\u014demon's grandfather, who developed a way to transport the trees successfully so they wouldn't sprout before arriving in Japan. From that little shipment of Taihaku trees, it is thought that tens of thousands of Tahihaku now flourish across Japan and were saved from national extinction.\nWhere to see T\u014demon Sano's sakura in Kyoto:\nIn addition to admiring T\u014demon's carefully cultivated sakura at Maruyama Park, the Ruriko-in estate, the Katsura and Shugauin imperial villas and the Ninna-ji Temple, visitors can also explore the Sano family garden year-round from 09:00 to 16:00 (best to call ahead at +81 75-871-4202).\nT\u014demon's grandfather became something of a Johnny Appleseed for sakura \u2013 taking grafts and growing saplings, venturing to far-flung places like the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin before he died in 1934. T\u014demon's father then took up the mantle while training his son to continue the family legacy.\nToday, travellers enjoying the mesmerising weeping cherry in Maruyama Park have T\u014demon to thank, as the city asks him to care for the tree throughout the year. Visitors can also admire T\u014demon's work at the Ruriko-in estate, where sakura stand in stunning harmony on the property close to the Golden Pavilion of Kinkakuji; the Katsura Imperial Villa; the Shukaguin Imperial Villa; Ninna-ji Temple garden; and, of course, at the nearby Sano family property.\nEven at 97,\u00a0T\u014demon still collects information on different types of sakura and makes detailed drawings of the blossoms' anatomy from the stamen and pistils to the bracts and peduncles \u2013 all to better understand how to help sakura flourish.\n\"My feelings toward cherry blossoms are something that has been ingrained in my daily life,\" T\u014demon said. \"My daily life follows the old Japanese way of life seik\u014d-udoku, 'working in the fields when it's sunny and reading when it rains'\u2026 If I am asked to preserve rare cherry blossoms, I respond by grafting or sowing seeds.\"\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The 96-year-old painter who saved a village\u00a0\n\u2022 The 89-year-old woman who is still travelling the world solo\n\u2022 Japan's unusual way to view the world\nTo that end, he has successfully propagated cherry trees in the atomic bomb-ravaged soil of Hiroshima and saved a 150-year-old Oshima cherry tree in Yokohama that was destined to be cut down. In that instance, when the local community enlisted him to relocate the storied sakura 100m away to preserve an iconic view of Mt Fuji, he took careful stock of the three layers of soil surrounding the tree. Before digging, T\u014demon ceremonially placed sake and rice crackers in the dirt as an apology for the disruption, added charcoal and provided an octopus offering. Also known to hug trees, T\u014demon embraced the trunk tightly upon its successful replanting.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs I toured the Sano family garden, falling\u00a0cherry petals fluttered to the ground like snowflakes, a phenomenon called sakura fubuki. In addition to kami, the souls of ancestors are also said to reside in the flowering cherry blossoms, connecting\u00a0the Sano family to their forebearers and representing the fleeting nature of each generation.\u00a0Amid this transient beauty, the Japanese concept of\u00a0\"mono no aware\" (the wistful recognition of life's ephemerality and the beauty in that impermanence) feels especially present.\u00a0\n\"Cherry blossoms reflect the way of life of the samurai in the old days: beautiful in the way they fall with grace and dignity,\" Shinichi said. Shinichi's 38-year-old son, Tomoaki, who has started to take over day-to-day responsibilities in the family business, has one child \u2013 a daughter. It would then be possible to have the first female sakuramori in this line.\n\"It will depend on her decision,\" Shinichi said.\nFor now, though, the family is allowing the 16th T\u014demon Sano to focus his attentions on what he does best.\n\"While my father is healthy, he will be the one to take care of the sakura,\" Shinichi said. I then asked if he felt he would one day be ready to assume the role of T\u014demon Sano and sakuramori.\u00a0\n\"I won't really know until I actually become the 17th generation,\" Shinichi said. \"I think I will truly feel the responsibility for the first time when I actually inherit the name\u2026 I'll do what I'm asked to.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has backed US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth after reports that military attack details were shared in a group chat that included Hegseth's wife, brother, and personal lawyer.\nThe controversy comes a month after a journalist was added to a Signal group chat in which US cabinet officials, including Hegseth, discussed plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nIn the second Signal chat, Hegseth shared information about air strikes against Yemen, the BBC's US news partner CBS confirmed, citing sources familiar with the messages.\n\"Pete's doing a great job,\" Trump told reporters on Monday. \"Everybody's happy with him.\"\nWhite House officials have played down reports of military plans being shared in a second Signal group chat, but have not denied it.\nTrump told reporters he has \"great confidence\" in his defence secretary.\n\"Are you bringing up Signal again? I thought they gave that up two weeks ago. It's the same old stuff from the media,\" he said. \"Try finding something new,\" he said. \nTrump said the source of the story \"sounds like disgruntled employees\", an idea  also floated by Hegseth earlier on Monday when he claimed the news media was \"full of hoaxsters\" who \"try to slash and burn people\".\nHegseth did not directly respond to reports of a second Signal chat, which were initially covered by the New York Times.\nIn a statement to the newspaper, the White House said no classified information was shared.\nThe messages in the second chat, sent on 15 March, included flight schedules for American F/A-18 Hornets carrying out strikes on Houthi targets. \nHegseth's wife, Jennifer Rauchet, is a former Fox News producer and holds no official position within the Pentagon. Hegseth has previously been criticised for reportedly including his wife in meetings with foreign leaders.\nHis brother, Phil, and personal lawyer, Tim Parlatore, both hold positions at the Department of Defense. But it is not clear why any of the three would require advanced warnings of sensitive US strike plans.\nUnlike the first Signal group, the second one - called \"Defense | Team Huddle\" - was created by Hegseth, according to the New York Times. But it too appeared to share details of military operations against Yemen.\nThe existence of the earlier Signal group was revealed by Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of the Atlantic magazine, who was accidentally included in it by Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser. \nAlthough the White House has also denied that classified information was discussed in the first group, Hegseth's critics - including former US defence officials -  have said such discussions could jeopardise US military personnel.\nSignal uses end-to-end encryption, meaning only a message's sender and recipients can view its contents. Despite this high level of security, experts say there are still ways for the information to be viewed or shared with the wrong people, which is why classified communications normally take place in secure, government-controlled locations rather than on private devices.\nThe second Signal chat surfaced as controversy swirls around the head of the Pentagon, who this year is controlling a budget of $892bn (\u00a3670bn).\nHegseth last week fired three top officials for an \"unauthorised disclosure\" - an accusation the officials said was \"baseless\".\nIn a testy exchange outside the White House ahead of an annual Easter event, Hegseth appeared to attribute the latest story to the officials he fired.\n\"What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out,\" he said. \nHegseth criticised the media and denounced the reports. He also said he has spoken to the president and that they were \"on the same page all the way\".\nIn an op-ed for Politico magazine published on Sunday, John Ullyot, the top Pentagon spokesperson who resigned last week, wrote that the department was in \"total chaos\".\nHe added: \"The dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president - who deserves better from his senior leadership.\"\nUllyot said it was not true that the three fired officials were leaking information and wrote: \"Unfortunately, Hegseth's team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door.\"\nHowever, in a statement on X, Sean Parnell, current chief spokesman for the Pentagon, said the \"Trump-hating media\" was  \"destroying anyone committed to President Trump's agenda\".\nHe echoed the White House by saying that \"there was no classified information in any Signal chat\".\nWashington says its strikes in Yemen are punishment for Houthi attacks on cargo vessels transiting through the Red Sea, a critical waterway for international trade.\nSince November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, saying they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza . They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.\nUS air strikes on an oil terminal in north-western Yemen this week killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others, according to the Houthi-run health ministry.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has appeared to soften his recent comments on China and the head of the US Federal Reserve after recent clashes as he pursues his economic agenda.\nHe said he has \"no intention of firing\" Jerome Powell after repeatedly criticising the head of the central bank, but he added that he would like Powell to be \"a little more active\" on cutting interest rates.\nSpeaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump also said he was optimistic about improving trade relations with China. \nHe said the level of tariffs - or import taxes - that he had imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\". \nThe president's tariffs are an effort to encourage factories and jobs to return to the US. This is a pillar of his economic agenda - as is a cut in interest rates, aimed at reducing the cost of borrowing for Americans.\nTrump has ratcheted the rate on Chinese goods up to 145% - sparking reciprocal measures from Beijing and warnings from economists about the global impact of a trade war.\nIn his comments to reporters on Tuesday, Trump said he would be \"very nice\" in negotiations with Beijing - in the hope of securing a trade deal. \nEarlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly said he expected a de-escalation of the trade war, which he said was unsustainable. Responding to comments from China, he said the current situation was \"not a joke\".\nThe trade war has led to turbulence in financial markets around the world - to which Trump's comments on Powell have also contributed. \nThe Fed has not cut rates so far this year, after lowering them by a percentage point late last year, a stance Trump has heavily criticised.\nLast week, the president intensified his attacks on the Fed chief, calling him \"a major loser\". The comments sparked a selloff of stocks, bonds and the US dollar - though markets have since been recovering from those losses. \nNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on Friday that Trump was looking into whether it would be possible to sack Powell - who he first nominated to lead the central bank in 2017. Powell was then renewed in 2021 by Joe Biden.\nIt is unclear whether Trump has the authority to fire the Fed chair. No other US president has tried to do so.\nMost major Asian stock markets were higher on Wednesday as investors appeared to welcome the latest remarks.\nJapan's Nikkei 225 index rose about 1.9%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed by around 2.2%, while mainland China's Shanghai Composite was down less than 0.1%.\nThat came after US shares made gains on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 ending Tuesday's session up 2.5% and the Nasdaq rose 2.7%. \nUS futures were also trading higher overnight. Futures markets give an indication of how financial markets will perform when they open for trading.\nInvestors feared that pressure on Powell to lower interest rates could cause prices to rise at a time when trade tariffs are already seen boosting inflation.\nTrade tensions between the world's biggest economies, as well as US tariffs on other countries around the world, have triggered uncertainty about the global economy. Those concerns triggered turmoil in financial markets in recent weeks.\nOn Tuesday, the forecast for US economic growth for this year was given the biggest downgrade among advanced economies by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) due to uncertainty caused by tariffs.\nThe sharp increase in tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a \"significant slowdown\" in global growth, the Fund predicted.\nTrump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are now facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July.\nHis administration said last week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nChina has hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US and vowed to \"fight to the end\".\nThe Chinese government has not yet officially responded to the latest statements from the Trump administration.\nHowever, an article in the state-controlled Global Times on Wednesday quoted commentators who said the remarks showed that the US is beginning to realise the tariffs do more harm than good to America's economy.",

        "article_text": "The \"Blue Marble\" was the first photograph of the whole Earth and the only one ever taken by a human. Fifty years on, new images of the planet reveal visible changes to the Earth's surface.\n\"I'll tell you,\" said astronaut Harrison Schmitt as the Apollo 17 hurtled towards the Moon, \"if there ever was a fragile-appearing piece of blue in space, it's the Earth right now\".\nIt was Thursday 7 December 1972, that humanity got its first look at our planet as a whole. In that moment, the photograph \"The Blue Marble\" was taken \u2013 one which changed the way we saw our world.\n\"I can see the lights of southern California, Bob,\" said Schmitt to ground control about one and a half hours into the flight. \"Man's field of stars on the Earth is competing with the heavens.\"\nThe crew of the Apollo 17 \u2013 commander Eugene Cernan, command module pilot Ronald Evans and lunar module pilot Harrison \"Jack\" Schmitt \u2013 were watching their home recede into the distance as they journeyed into space for the last manned mission to the Moon.\nLooking back towards the Earth, Cernan commented: \"the clouds seem to be very artistic, very picturesque. Some in clockwise rotating fashion\u2026 but appear to be\u2026 very thin where you can\u2026 see through those clouds to the blue water below.\"\nIt is an enduring image of the beauty but also the vulnerability of our planet \u2013 adrift as it is in the vastness of the Universe, which hosts no other signs of life that we have been able to detect to date. But ours is also a planet of great change. The tectonic movements that shift the landmasses move too slow for our eyes to notice. Yet another force \u2013 humanity itself \u2013 has been reshaping our planet at a pace that we can see. Urbanisation, deforestation, pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are altering the way the Earth looks. So how, over the 50 years since that iconic image was taken, has the Blue Marble changed?\nThose first images of the Blue Marble were taken by the crew, who passed the onboard camera \u2013 a hand-held analogue Hasselblad 500 EL loaded with 70mm Kodak film \u2013 between them, captivated by the sight of the Earth from space.\n\"All the images captured with Hasselblads are spectacularly clear and bright,\" says Jennifer Levasseur, curator at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC.\u00a0\nThe camera was specially modified for use in space, she adds. Glues, lubricants, moving parts and batteries could all cause problems or fail when exposed to the extremes of hot and cold in space. It was also given a large square shutter-release button so the crew could use it while wearing their cumbersome spacesuits.\n\"The other major modification, was the removal of the viewing screen \u2013 because it's extra glass,\" Levasseur says, The astronauts, \"had to learn how to take pictures without being able to see anything\", she says. \"Without a viewfinder, you can't see what you're taking.\"\nTaking photos, says Levasseur, was planned meticulously and written into the mission plan. \"They had known previous launches wouldn't give them whole Earth, but on this one the whole Earth would be entirely illuminated by the light of the Sun.\"\u00a0\nIt was around five hours and 20 minutes into the flight that the crew got their first glimpse of the entire planet. The crew were starting to get ready for bed, zipping into their sleeping bags. It was their first moment of downtime since the launch.\u00a0\n\"I suppose we're seeing as 100% full Earth as we'll ever see,\" said Cernan. \"Bob, it's these kind of views that stick with you forever\u2026 There's no strings holding it up either. It's out there all by itself.\"\u00a0\nThe Blue Marble image was captured at around\u00a029,000km (18,000 miles)\u00a0from Earth, as the Sun lit up the globe from behind the Apollo 17.\nAlmost six hours into the flight, Schmitt laughed. \"The problem with looking at the Earth, particularly Antarctica, is it's too bright,\" he said, \"And so I'm using my sunglasses through the monocular\".\nBack home, it was nearing 05:00 at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and ground control was quiet. \"I'm not keeping you awake, am I, Bob?\" asked Schmitt. \"Just keep talking. We're listening,\" came the voice from the capsule communicator. And so the conversation continued long into the flight, the crew describing the clouds drifting over the ocean and the continents of home.\nPrevious Apollo missions had snapped the Earth partly hidden by shadow. The hugely influential, Earthrise, for instance,\u00a0shows the planet as it rises behind the Moon. Up until this point, our view of home had been fragmented, with no real way to visualise the planet in its entirety. (Read more about how Earthrise sparked an environmental movement.)\nSuddenly, glowing in the light of the Sun, the Earth was revealed as a beautiful shining blue orb, full of life and alone in the vastness of space. As a result, the Blue Marble is thought to have had more influence on humanity than any other photograph in history.\u00a0\n\"If you can't see something, it's hard to visualise that it exists,\" says Nick Pepin, a climate scientist at the University of Portsmouth in the UK. \"I think all of us who have been brought up with that [image] from a young age probably find it difficult to imagine a time when we didn't know what the Earth looked like. This was the first time that we could actually look back from space and see our home \u2013 and people suddenly realised it was an amazing thing, but also a fixed system that we live on.\"\u00a0\nThe image offers a view of the Earth from the Mediterranean Sea area to the Antarctica South polar ice cap. Heavy cloud hangs over the Southern Hemisphere, and almost the entire coastline of Africa can be seen.\nNasa officially credits the image to the entire crew. We may never know which of them actually took it but today it is reported to be one of the most reproduced images of all time.\nAt 07.39 GMT on 7 December 2022 \u2013 50 years later to the minute since the original was taken \u2013 a new \"Blue Marble\" was\u00a0captured by a satellite orbiting a million miles away. This time, a set of 12 images taken 15 minutes apart, reveal noticeable changes to our planet's surface, the result of 50 years of global warming.\nIn the 50 years that separates these two snapshots in time, one of the most striking differences is the visible reduction in the size of the Antarctic ice sheet. \"You can see the shrinking cryosphere \u2013 the shrinking ice sheet and the loss of the snow,\" says Pepin says. This, he says, is a major indicator of climate change.\nThe Sahara Desert has also grown while the rainforest \"is retreating further south\", he adds. Research has shown that tree cover in the vast Sahel region that borders the Sahara Desert has been in significant decline. \"The dominant thing that you can see on the [new] image is deforestation and the loss of vegetation\", as the Earth's land cover switches from greenery to desert.\nThe pictures were taken by Nasa's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera\u00a0(Epic), which has been imaging the sunlit side of Earth between 13 and 22 times a day since 2015. The satellite sits at the first Lagrange point, a point of equilibrium between the Sun and Earth, a million miles from Earth.\nFrom mid-April to mid-October, one photograph is taken of the Earth roughly every hour, and for the rest of the year it takes an image every two hours, says Alexander Marshak, deputy project scientist for Nasa's Deep Space Climate Observatory (Dscovr) satellite mission, which the camera is carried aboard.\u00a0\n\"With respect to the Blue Marble, on the 50th anniversary, we decided to take the same images at 15 minute intervals. So, in 15\u00a0minutes [the Earth] rotates around maybe 100km (62 miles),\" says Marshak. And, thanks to advances in technology, he adds, \"we can see the same images, but with much better quality\", even from a million miles away.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 'Earthrise': The photo that sparked an environmental movement\n\u2022 Out of this world: 11 spacewalks that made history\n\u2022 What the planets aligning really means \n\"And we can see much more than that,\" Marshak adds. \"We take images in 10 wavelengths, from UV [ultraviolet] to near infrared. From these images we can retrieve the property of ozone, of clouds, of water. The height of clouds, the location of clouds. We can look at the property of aerosols, the size of particles, the amount of particles. We retrieve even the shape of ice crystals [in the clouds], using the Sun's glint. We can [see] whether they're horizontally or randomly oriented.\"\n\"We retrieve [data on] the amount of leaves on Earth, and not only that but also the amount of leaves that are directly illuminated by the Sun,\" says Marshak. This data, combined with observations of ocean surface colour, can allow researchers to determine the rate of all photosynthetic activity on Earth.\nThe Dscovr programme hasn't been running long enough to draw any definitive conclusions, says Marshak, but they are starting to gather data that will provide new insights into how the world is changing \u2013 such as changes in cloud cover and height, reflectivity, and vegetation cover.\nAmong the other changes that have occurred since that first image of the entire Earth 50 years ago is the amount of human development and activity on our planet's surface. Although not visible in these images of the daylight side of the Earth, other satellites monitor for lights visible on the dark side of our planet. These show dramatic expansions in the urban sprawl across the continents alongside the activity of shipping on the Earth's oceans. Wildfires also glow across large swathes of the land at night, doubling in frequency in just the past 20 years.\nBack in 1972, the Blue Marble prompted a mass-reconsideration of our place in the Universe. Astronauts viewing Earth from space have reported a profound feeling of awe, a sense of interconnectedness and environmental awareness, and of self-transcendence. This is called the \"overview effect\".\u00a0\nIn the utter vastness of space, the beauty of Earth can be overwhelming. This feeling of intense awe has been found to elicit a fundamental change in thinking, a kind of cognitive realignment also called the \"need for accommodation\", as the person attempts to this process new perceptual information.\n\"Gobsmackingly \u2013 just \u2013 wow\" is how Helen Sharman, the UK's first astronaut, described her first view of the Earth from space. It was 1991 and the 27-year-old chemist had just launched from Kazakhstan, to begin her journey to the Soviet Mir space station.\n\"We had two windows on the Soyuz spacecraft,\" she says. \"The commander, who sits in the middle, doesn't get a window. But the research cosmonaut, which was my job, and the flight engineer \u2013 we both had one. I had the right seat and flight engineer had the left seat. As we were launching, the spacecraft tipped my side very slightly towards the Earth. Immediately, the light streamed through that window.\"\nSharman describes her view of the curvature of the Earth, the \"gorgeous blue seas\", white clouds, and black space above. The Earth, she says, appeared as if it had its own glow. \"The Sun was at quite a low angle, so it would reflect off the sea, and then back up to the clouds \u2013 and off the clouds underneath to the Earth. Then [the light] came up so it felt as though the Earth had its own light source.\"\nShe compares the colour to the \"ultramarine of renaissance paintings\". \"It's quite unlike the rest of nature. It's that brightness against the blackness of space, you just see the Earth as this great big gorgeous blue dot.\"\u00a0\nThen, as her eyes began to adjust to the darkness of space, the stars appeared in their billions. \"We know there are probably billions of stars just in one small section of the Milky Way, maybe even trillions. And we think maybe there could be up to a couple of trillion galaxies in the Universe. That [makes you] realise the insignificance of Earth.\"\nSharman experienced these conflicting thoughts all at once. \"Our atmosphere is so thin. How easily that whole top layer, where most of life is, could just be wiped away.\" But, conversely, she adds, \"Earth is not the focal point of the Universe.\"\nTo this day Sharman dreams of \"floating along inside one of the modules and stopping by a window, looking out with the other crew\". The experience of\u00a0viewing the Earth from space, she says, \"definitely changed my life's priorities\". \"The most important thing is the people. And of course, the environment and ecology that's required to keep this Earth going.\"\nThe overview effect, say experts, is long-lasting and more powerful than other instances of awe. For the first time, the Blue Marble gave all of humanity the chance to experience the phenomenon to some degree. In fact, research shows that you can experience the overview effect with both feet firmly on the ground.\nLike Earthrise, the Blue Marble image became an emblem of the environmental movement. It showed a planet requiring stewardship at the global scale.\nThe Blue Marble was used to illustrate the\u00a0Gaia hypothesis, developed in the 1960s and '70s, which proposes that Earth and its biological systems act as a huge single entity, that exists in a delicate state of balance. And, although controversial among scientists, the theory kickstarted a holistic approach to Earth Science.\nThe image became a symbol of unity, too, as for the first time we could see the Earth without any human-imagined boundaries that divide us as they do on maps. The Blue Marble was\u00a0adopted\u00a0by activist groups like Friends of the Earth and events like Earth Day. Prior to this, environmental campaign images had often focused on pollution or endangered species.\u00a0\nThe photograph appeared on\u00a0postage stamps, and in the opening sequence of former US vice president Al Gore's documentary,\u00a0An Inconvenient Truth, and inspired research into Earth systems with the establishment of climate research institutions such as the Max-Planck Institut, based in Munich, Germany.\nLooking at the 1972 and 2022 Blue Marble images side-by-side, Pepin describes the Earth's \"restless atmosphere\". Visible in both images, are clouds formed above the green areas of rainforest, demonstrating the inextricable link between the forests and the rain. \"If you look at [central] Africa, you can see that most of the cloud, particularly on the earlier [image] is quite spotty, that indicates thunderstorms. Whereas if you go further north, and look at the Sahara desert, you can see there are no clouds.\n\"When you look from above you see all the connections, the overall relationships between areas,\" says Pepin. \"For example, Kilimanjaro rises from grassland, with snow on top. If you lived on the slopes you might not know there was snow on top and the importance of the connection between those areas.\"\nLooking at the Earth from space like this, he says, \"makes you appreciate the interlinkages between different parts of the ecosystems\". \"If you can only see your bit, you might think that environmental problems are only happening somewhere else and assume that 'it's not my problem',\" says Pepin.\u00a0\nHowever, the limitation, he says, is scale. \"You lose the detail. You need both. You need ground truthing [validating the information in the field] too.\"\nThere is a \"huge fundamental difference\" between these two images though, says Levasseur. \"One is captured by a human \u2013 and one is not. It doesn't have the same impact. And that's really because of the fact that there's no person there.\"\nLevasseur is looking forward to the photographs that will be brought home from the next manned mission to go as far as the Moon: Artemis II, planned for 2026. \"There's not going to be another whole Earth image in the way I think of it until humans go out away from Earth again. I wasn't alive in 1972. This is going to be a huge moment to know that people are looking at us from that far away.\"\n\"As much as we like to think of satellites as sort of our surrogates,\" she says, \"I know that there is a person behind that camera, so there is something different about it, and there always will be.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has backed US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth after reports that military attack details were shared in a group chat that included Hegseth's wife, brother, and personal lawyer.\nThe controversy comes a month after a journalist was added to a Signal group chat in which US cabinet officials, including Hegseth, discussed plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nIn the second Signal chat, Hegseth shared information about air strikes against Yemen, the BBC's US news partner CBS confirmed, citing sources familiar with the messages.\n\"Pete's doing a great job,\" Trump told reporters on Monday. \"Everybody's happy with him.\"\nWhite House officials have played down reports of military plans being shared in a second Signal group chat, but have not denied it.\nTrump told reporters he has \"great confidence\" in his defence secretary.\n\"Are you bringing up Signal again?

Hegseth has previously been criticised for reportedly including his wife in meetings with foreign leaders.\nHis brother, Phil, and personal lawyer, Tim Parlatore, both hold positions at the Department of Defense. But it is not clear why any of the three would require advanced warnings of sensitive US strike plans.\nUnlike the first Signal group, the second one - called \"Defense | Team Huddle\" - was created by Hegseth, according to the New York Times. But it too appeared to share details of military operations against Yemen.\nThe existence of the earlier Signal group was revealed by Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of the Atlantic magazine, who was accidentally included in it by Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser. \nAlthough the White House has also denied that classified information was discussed in the first group, Hegseth's critics - including former US defence officials -  have said such discussions could jeopardise US military personnel.\nSignal uses end-to-end encryption, meaning only a message's sender and recipients can view its contents. Despite this high level of security, experts say there are still ways for the information to be viewed or shared with the wrong people, which is why classified communications normally take place in secure, government-controlled locations rather than on private devices.\nThe second Signal chat surfaced as controversy swirls around the head of the Pentagon, who this year is controlling a budget of $892bn (\u00a3670bn).\nHegseth last week fired three top officials for an \"unauthorised disclosure\" - an accusation the officials said was \"baseless\".\nIn a testy exchange outside the White House ahead of an annual Easter event, Hegseth appeared to attribute the latest story to the officials he fired.\n\"What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out,\" he said. \nHegseth criticised the media and denounced the reports. He also said he has spoken to the president and that they were \"on the same page all the way\".\nIn an op-ed for Politico magazine published on Sunday, John Ullyot, the top Pentagon spokesperson who resigned last week, wrote that the department was in \"total chaos\".\nHe added: \"The dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president - who deserves better from his senior leadership.\"\nUllyot said it was not true that the three fired officials were leaking information and wrote: \"Unfortunately, Hegseth's team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door.\"\nHowever, in a statement on X, Sean Parnell, current chief spokesman for the Pentagon, said the \"Trump-hating media\" was  \"destroying anyone committed to President Trump's agenda\".\nHe echoed the White House by saying that \"there was no classified information in any Signal chat\".\nWashington says its strikes in Yemen are punishment for Houthi attacks on cargo vessels transiting through the Red Sea, a critical waterway for international trade.\nSince November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, saying they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza . They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.\nUS air strikes on an oil terminal in north-western Yemen this week killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others, according to the Houthi-run health ministry.",

While all retailers use the exemption, those who sell fast-fashion and cheap goods have seen their sales soar.\nIt has fuelled the rise of Chinese retailers, such as online giants Shein and Temu, which ship low-value packages to the UK and other countries to reach millions of customers.\nSpeaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Paphitis said retailers had been lobbying government \"for a very, very long time\", arguing the rule had had devastating impact \"on our retail landscape and our high streets\".\nHe joined the bosses of Sainsbury's, Currys and the British Retail Consortium in welcoming the government's consultation on the rule.\nUK businesses bringing in larger shipments have to pay taxes, and they also argue that cheaper goods might fail to meet the same environmental and ethical standards that they keep to.\nAside from concerns over unfair competition with domestic retailers, it has also been raised that governments could be missing out on potential tax income.\nThe so called \"de mimimis\" rule has received renewed interest after US president Donald Trump scrapped a similar measure in America amid his escalating trade war with China. \nGoods worth less than $800 into the US will soon be subject to charges, where they were previously exempt. The move has already prompted Chinese retailers to raise their prices.\nIn the UK, there are further concerns that China will dump goods here to avoid the tariffs which Trump has imposed on Chinese goods.\nEarlier this month, the boss of Currys told the Financial Times that the \"single biggest area where lots of stock is likely to land in the UK... is from the likes of Shein, Temu, Alibaba, TikTok shop and, most of all, Amazon marketplace\".\nOn Thursday, Alex Baldock told the BBC he was pleased the government was \"reviewing the low-value shipment loophole, and that they're committed to levelling the playing field between British and overseas retailers\".\nBut the Federation of Small Businesses urged the government to proceed with caution in its de minimis consultation, suggesting that scrapping it might \"ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers\".\n\"With 16% of goods moved by small firms sitting below the \u00a3135 threshold, a decision to scrap it impacts on trading and inflation,\" said Tina McKenzie, chair of the FSB.\n\"It's right to be concerned about potential future dumping of goods, as escalating tariffs applied by bigger global blocs against each other may mean a surge in goods arriving in markets like our own,\" she added.\n\nMr Paphitis told the BBC it was \"absolute nonsense\" that the measure kept inflation and prices down, arguing it led to a loss of jobs and tax revenue for the UK, due to businesses being unable to compete with cheaper foreign rivals.\nHelen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, the trade body for retailers, said the review was \"more critical now\" due to a \"rise in the number of potentially non-compliant products entering the UK market\".\nThe British Independent Retailers Association said small packages having no tax or charges was a key concern. It called on ministers to act to \"deter import surges\" in order to \"protect independent retailers\".\nWhen Sainsbury's announced their latest financial results earlier this month, boss Simon Roberts called on the government to act as soon as possible.\n\"Everyone should pay their tax... so if there's a loophole here which means that's not happening then that needs to be closed so it's a level playing field for everybody,\" he said.",

China has hit back with a 125% tax on US products.\nThe move has rattled the world economy, sparking turmoil on global financial markets.\nPrices are expected to rise for consumers in the US as a result of the tariffs, due to the companies importing goods passing on higher costs.\nThe IMF has cut its global growth forecast because of the uncertainty caused by tariffs, and says it expects US growth to be hit the hardest.\nOn Wednesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the UK must take the risk of trade wars hitting global economic growth \"very seriously\".\nHowever, Reeves said: \"I do understand the concerns the US has about countries around the world that run large and persistent trade surpluses with the US.\"\nShe said the UK \"is not one of those countries\" so \"there is a deal there to be done between the UK and the US\".\nShe added that she understood \"the need to rebalance the global economy\".\nThis, in part, is why the UK announced on Wednesday a review of low-value imports coming into the UK which are \"undercutting the British High Street and British retailers\" she said.\nThis mirrors a US action, with the White House set to clamp down on deliveries under $800 - specifically those sent from China and Hong Kong - on 2 May.\nIt is set to close a loophole allowing low-value packages to enter the US without incurring any duties.\nThe removal of the so-called \"de minimis\" rule will hit companies including fast-fashion firm Shein and Temu, the low-cost retail giant.\nShein and Temu have both warned that they will increase prices \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\".\nThe UK government said that the UK Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) would be putting more resources into helping firms report unfair trade practices as part of its review.",

        "article_text": "Nearly 50,000 people queued in less than 24 hours to pay their respects to Pope Francis, whose body is being displayed in an open coffin at St Peter's Basilica, the Vatican says. \nEntry to the church in Vatican City was due to stop at midnight local time (22:00 GMT) on Wednesday, but opening hours were extended to accommodate large crowds gathered outside. \nPublic viewing continued on Thursday.\nThe Argentine pontiff died on Monday at the age of 88 after suffering a stroke. He had spent five weeks in hospital earlier this year receiving treatment for double pneumonia.\nPope Francis was the first Latin American leader of the Catholic Church and held the role for 12 years.\nRed-robed cardinals and white-clad priests escorted the Pope's coffin from his residence to the basilica on Wednesday. \nBells tolled during the 40-minute procession, while the crowd broke into applause - a traditional Italian sign of respect.\nSwiss Guards, who are responsible for the Pope's safety, escorted his coffin to the church's altar.\nPublic viewing began at 11:00 local time on Wednesday. \nSoon after, the queue was already eight hours long, according to Italian media. By mid-afternoon, tens of thousands of people were lining the square.\nAt midnight, when the church was supposed to close for the night, there was still a very long queue of people wanting to pay their respects.\nPolice in the Vatican had told the BBC that St Peter's Basilica would stay open all night so that a large crowd gathered on the square could file past the coffin.\nViewing continued until 05:30 on Thursday, then closed for an hour and a half, before reopening at 07:00. \nThe Pope's body will lie in state in the church until Friday evening, when his coffin will be sealed during a liturgical rite at 20:00, the Vatican said.\nThe ceremony will be overseen by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who is the Pope's \"camerlengo\" or chamberlain and runs the Vatican until a new Pope is chosen. \nLuis and Macarena, from Mexico, had come to Rome for their honeymoon and hoped to see the Pope, who gives a special blessing to newlyweds. Luis told the BBC seeing the Pope's final resting place would allow them to feel a connection.\n\"Pope Francis is a saint and he will bless us from heaven,\" Luis said.\nMary Ellen, an American who lives in Italy, said she had come to the Vatican on an overnight train to \"say goodbye\".\n\"I love Papa Francesco,\" she said. \"Because he's humble, kind, he loves immigrants. I know he's put up with a lot of difficult things in the Vatican. He's fought against power and the power of the Vatican to be a true Christian, true Catholic.\"\nShe said when she passes the coffin, she will be praying and will ask Pope Francis for help with her own work with immigrants.\nInside St Peter's, under the watchful marble eye of popes and saints, a steady stream of people made their way to the Pope's casket to pay their respects.\nSome kneeled while others prayed and crossed themselves, before slowly moving on.\nMany lingered to admire the staggering beauty of the basilica. The atmosphere was quiet and solemn despite the thousands of people present.\nTwo women who waited for five hours to see the Pope said they had arrived at the basilica's queue at 09:00.\nOne told the BBC it was important to her to say goodbye to the pontiff.\n\"All these years I followed all he did and it's as if I travelled all over the world with him, even if I was just at home.

He had arranged for a benefactor to pay for it all.\nUnlike the vast majority of his predecessors, he will not be buried in St Peter's, but in a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary in central Rome, beneath a tombstone inscribed only with his name.\nBefore being moved to St Peter's, Pope Francis had been lying in an open coffin in the chapel of his home, flanked by Swiss Guards and cardinals in prayer.\nHis last public appearance was on Easter Sunday, during which he delivered brief remarks to the masses gathered in St Peter's Square from a wheelchair. \nHe then greeted worshippers and blessed babies as he was driven in a car through the crowds.\nHis Papal apartments have been sealed, marking the start of the period known as the Sede Vacante - or empty seat \u2013  which continues until a new head of the church is elected.\n\nAdditional reporting by Jorge Perez",

        "article_text": "He had tea with the Queen, was blessed by the Pope and spread Hawaiian culture across the globe. More than a century later, a festival dubbed the \"Olympics of hula\" honours his legacy.\nSilence engulfed the audience at Edith Kanaka'ole Stadium in Hilo, Hawai'i, as a group of hula dancers appeared on stage. They moved gracefully in unison, rhythmically depicting a scene of an ancient Hawaiian myth as they bellowed \nmele\n (chants). The hula performance, which was part of the annual \nMerrie Monarch Festival\n, wasn't a mere spectacle; it was a powerful celebration of Hawaiian culture \u2013 and for years, it was banned.\nThe week-long Merrie Monarch Festival (which takes place 20-26 April 2025 and is celebrating its 62nd anniversary) has been called the \"\nOlympics of hula\n\" and perpetuates the sacred, centuries-old practice of dancing and chanting that preserves and portrays our native Hawaiian language, history, religion and culture. Every year, thousands of Hawaiians descend on the Big Island to attend the event, while thousands more watch live broadcasts of Hawai'i's 23 best \nh\u0101lau\n (hula groups) compete on TV. Yet, the festival is more than just a hula contest; its dance performances, arts and craft exhibitions, and a royal parade through downtown Hilo is considered the biggest display of Hawaiian culture in the world.\n\"It's the one week out of the year where we celebrate being Hawaiian,\" said K\u016b Kahakalau, a Hawaiian language and culture expert. \"And it's all thanks to the undertakings of King Kal\u0101kaua.\"\nFondly dubbed \"The Merrie Monarch\", King David La'amea Kal\u0101kaua was the last king of Hawai'i. He ruled the Kingdom of Hawai'i from 1874 until his death in 1891, but his ascension to the throne was nothing short of contentious. Shortly after the death of King Kamehameha IV, whose family had ruled the kingdom since 1795, Hawai'i's legislature\u00a0decided to elect a native\u00a0ali'i\u00a0(noble chief) instead of the king's widow. The decision incited a full-blown riot. As the queen's supporters stormed the Honolulu courthouse, British and American sailors stationed at Honolulu harbour were called in to quell the fighting and Kal\u0101kaua took the oath of office the following day.\nBy the time of Kal\u0101kaua's reign, Native Hawaiian heritage was at great risk. Christian missionaries had begun arriving on the islands in 1820, introducing diseases that killed Native Hawaiians, converting islanders away from our traditional polytheistic religion and infiltrating the political system to suppress local culture and beliefs. One of the most significant ways they did this was by banning public performances of the hula, a dance missionaries deemed \"vile heathen chants\".\nKal\u0101kaua sought to restore a unified sense of national pride among Hawaiians, and his reign marked a period of cultural renaissance across the islands. He lived by the motto Ho'oulu L\u0101hui\u00a0(Increase the Nation) and sought to remake Hawai'i for Hawaiians \u2013 all of which resulted in the revival of traditional customs such as language, music, arts and traditional medicines that had long been suppressed during the missionary-influenced era of his predecessors. One of his crowning achievements was preserving the hula. As Kal\u0101kaua famously proclaimed: \"Hula is the language of the heart, and therefore the heartbeat of the Hawaiian people.\"\u00a0\nTo many people around the world, \"hula\" may conjure images of tiki bars, plastic dancers shaking their hips on car dashboards or something that only happens at beachside resorts. But long before hula was commodified and appropriated, it was a sacred dance among Native Hawaiians \u2013 an ancient practice that served as an archive of our stories, beliefs and way of life. Prior to the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, there was no written language in Hawai'i. Instead, ancient Hawaiians used oral tradition and hula to pass on their identity and culture from one generation to the next. Even when practice was prohibited, Hawaiians took hula underground, continuing to teach the forbidden dance in secret in caves and far-flung areas.\nAs part of Kal\u0101kaua's Ho'oulu L\u0101hui\u00a0policy, hula experienced a resurgence. In fact, the king's lavish two-week coronation ceremony was essentially a celebration of Native Hawaiian culture, featuring traditional music, hula and l\u016b'au \u2013\u00a0all of which had previously been banned. To commemorate his 50th birthday three years later, \nho'opa'a \n(chanters) and \n'\u014dlapa \n(dancers) performed in public for the first time in years, while a parade wound its way through downtown Honolulu. Today, the Merrie Monarch Festival pays tribute to the proud sense of Hawaiian identity Kal\u0101kaua revived.\n\"[Kal\u0101kaua] was deeply committed, proud and knowledgeable about his Hawaiian heritage,\" said Kahakalau, noting that the king was also the first person to have the \nKumulipo\n (a creation chant that also includes the genealogy of Hawaiian royalty) written down.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nYet, Kal\u0101kaua wasn't just content to revive Hawaiian customs in Hawai'i; he wanted to share the Kingdom's culture around the world. So, in 1881, the \"Merrie Monarch\" continued the proud Hawaiian tradition of long-distance seafaring by\u00a0spending 281 days circumnavigating the globe, becoming the first head of state to travel around the world.\nDuring Kal\u0101kaua's international diplomacy tour, he was greeted by the Emperor of Japan to the sounds of\u00a0Hawai'i Pono'\u012b\u00a0(the Kingdom's national anthem, which Kal\u0101kaua had written); he proposed immigration policies with Chinese politicians; he toured the Great Sphinx with the Khedive of Egypt; he was blessed by Pope Leo XIII in Rome; he had tea with Queen Victoria of England, and he boarded a train that was struck by a bull in Spain. In New York, Kal\u0101kaua met with Thomas Edison to discuss the possibility of getting electricity to Honolulu. In 1886, the king's wish came true.\u00a0'Iolani Palace\u00a0(which is now a museum and the only royal residence in the United States), became illuminated with electric lights \u2013 five years before the White House did.\n\"He was able to build important relationships, create liaisons, and sign treaties with multiple countries [that benefitted our people],\" said Kenneth \"Aloha\" Victor, a kumu hula (master hula teacher) and designer of Kaulua'e, a made-in-Hawai'i clothing and lifestyle brand. In addition to sending envoys to Europe and Asia, Kal\u0101kaua maintained consulates and legations in more than 130 cities across the globe. The Kingdom had 13 consulates in Great Britain alone.\nBack at home, during an era of increased literacy, Kal\u0101kaua met with traditional na kahuna (priests) and na kapuna (elders) to compile many of the ancient Hawaiian myths and chants that are portrayed through hula and mele and write them in Hawaiian. In 1888, he took things one step further and translated these stories into English for the first time in the book, Legends and Myths of Hawai'i, which he often presented as gifts to foreign dignitaries so they'd get a better understanding of Hawai'i, its culture and its people.\u00a0\nMore like this\n:\n\u2022 The word embodying the spirit of Hawai'i\n\u2022 A lei maker's guide to the real Honolulu\n\u2022 Hawaii's ancient land management system\nKal\u0101kaua's mission to integrate Hawai'i with the rest of the world also resulted in the creation of the Hawaiian Youths Abroad Program, in which the king selected young Hawaiians whom he felt could become future leaders of the Kingdom and sent them abroad to study things like medicine, law, engineering, foreign languages and art.\u00a0More than 100 years later, the programme's legacy still echoes across the islands: Princess Abigail Kaw\u0101nanakoa, the granddaughter of one of the students the king sent abroad, played an instrumental role in restoring 'Iolani Palace and was a staunch supporter of native Hawaiian rights until her death in 2022.\nA multi-hyphenate in every sense of the word, Kal\u0101kaua embraced modernity just as much as he valued Hawaiian culture. He was a voracious inventor, designing blueprints for tornado-proof ships, fish-shaped torpedoes, sealed bottle caps and rangefinder scopes. He even had a telephone installed that connected 'Iolani Palace where he lived and worked to his private boathouse less than a mile away, where he'd often be found hosting royal l\u016b'aus\u00a0for foreign dignitaries and heads of state.\nFor Hawaiians today, Kal\u0101kaua is much more than just a Renaissance man. \"When Kal\u0101kaua travelled [abroad], he promoted and shared our culture with the world,\" said Ana Kon, a Hawaiian cultural specialist based in Hilo. \"It's why, more than a century later, we continue to honour his legacy today at the Merrie Monarch Festival.\"\nFor those unable to snag tickets to the Merrie Monarch Festival's highly coveted hula competitions, there are still plenty of opportunities to participate in the festivities. Hilo's Afook-Chinen Civic Auditorium and Butler Buildings host a vibrant arts and crafts fair featuring the creations of more than 150 local artisans and brands from across Hawai'i. \"Our 'aloha wear' is a celebration of hula,\" said Victor, of his clothing, which he said honours the people, places and movements in Hawaiian culture.\nOf course, Kal\u0101kaua's legacy lives on beyond the festival. In many ways, every hula step, l\u016b'au gathering and Hawaiian-language phrase is a nod back to our last king's efforts to revive our customs at home and introduce them around the world. Visitors can experience this first hand at O'ahu's Polynesian Cultural Center, which hosts a traditional Hawaiian l\u016b'au paying homage to Queen Lili'uokalani (Kal\u0101kaua's sister, who succeeded him until white businessmen\u00a0overthrew the Kingdom in 1893), while the Queen Emma Summer Palace\u00a0in Honolulu offers contemporary hula lessons for adults.\nOn Maui, immersive experiences at the\u00a0Grand Wailea\u00a0include an E Ala E\u00a0oli\u00a0(chant) in the mornings on the beach, while interactive language lessons teach guests how to pronounce words in\u00a0\u02bb\u014clelo Hawai'i\u00a0(Hawaiian). Beachside resorts like\u00a0Outrigger Reef in Waikiki Beach are adopting a regenerative tourism approach at its A'o Cultural Center by allowing guests to meet traditional Hawaiian navigators and canoe builders, teaching them how to use traditional Hawaiian tools and \u2013 yes \u2013 participate in hula lessons.\n\"It all spawns back to [King Kal\u0101kaua's] creed,\" said Victor. \"That hula is the heartbeat of our Hawaiian people.\"\nCORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this story stated that\u00a0US sugar planters overthrew the Kingdom of Hawai'i.

        "article_text": "Attorneys delivered opening statements on Wednesday in the New York retrial of Harvey Weinstein, with prosecutors accusing the disgraced film producer of using his immense power in Hollywood to sexually harass and abuse three women. \n\"The defendant wanted their bodies, and the more they resisted, the more forceful he got,\" Assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey told jurors on Wednesday. \nIn his third trial in five years, Weinstein is accused of sexually abusing a former television production assistant, an aspiring actress and a model. \nThe former film mogul has pleaded not guilty, and in court his lawyer sought to cast doubt on the women's claims and credibility.\nAttorney Arthur Aidala told the jury the prosecution case would \"fall flat on its face\" after they heard all the evidence.\n\"They're going to ask you to make sense of things that just don't make sense,\" he said.\nA court of appeals overturned Weinstein's previous conviction for sex crimes in New York last April, before he was indicted on new sexual assault charges in the state in September.\nLast week, 12 jurors - seven women and five men - were chosen to weigh Weinstein's fate. \nOn Wednesday, Ms Lucey spent an hour delivering an opening statement, telling jurors that three women had fallen victim to the abuse of a \"Hollywood gatekeeper\" who held \"unfettered power for over 30 years in that industry\".\nThe retrial in New York is centred on two women who brought allegations against Weinstein for his 2020 trial, actress Jessica Mann and former TV production assistant Miriam Haley. This time, the trial also includes allegations from former Polish model and actress Kaja Sokola, who has accused Weinstein of assaulting her when she was 16. \nOn Wednesday, Ms Lucey recounted the three women's stories of assault and harassment, sparing few details. The alleged encounters often involved Weinstein bringing women to his room under the guise of a business meeting, before he allegedly forced himself onto them. \nVictims \"kept their shame and their pain to themselves\" for years because of Weistein's role as a man who \"defined the field\" of acting and film, Ms Lucey said. \nDuring his hour of opening statements that followed, Weinstein's attorney took a combative approach, accusing the women of having \"mutually beneficial\" sexual relationships with Weinstein and being motivated by money. \n\"These women are addicted to that fame,\" Mr Aidala said. \"They want to be heroes.\" \nMr Aidala argued that Weinstein could not have assaulted the women because they kept in contact with him and sent him friendly messages after the encounters. \nLast April, a court of appeals said Weinstein, now 73, did not receive a fair trial in New York in 2020 because the judge overseeing his case allowed testimony from women who made allegations against him for conduct he was never charged over. \nWeinstein had been serving a 23-year sentence in a New York prison after being convicted.\nHe was also found guilty of rape in a separate trial in California in 2022 and was sentenced to 16 years in that case.\nWeinstein has several medical conditions, including cancer and diabetes. In September, he was taken to hospital for heart surgery and has been held in a secure hospital unit. \nA judge has approved a request from Weinstein's lawyers to let him stay at the Bellevue hospital in Manhattan when he is not in court. \nHis lawyers had complained that he was receiving poor medical treatment in unhygienic conditions at the infamous Rikers Island prison facility - which officials have long said they plan to close - though the move has been delayed. \nIn total, Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault and rape by more than 100 women. \nHe is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison, as he has yet to begin serving his 16-year California sentence. \nThe decision by his accusers to come forward, and his subsequent conviction in New York, galvanised the #MeToo movement against sex abuse by powerful men.\nSpeaking to jurors on Wednesday, Ms Lucey said the movement had allowed the three women to come forward in the criminal case against Weinstein after they \"suddenly realized they were not alone\".\nBefore the allegations against him emerged, Weinstein and his brother Bob were among Hollywood's ultimate power players.\nWeinstein co-founded Miramax film studio, whose hits included Shakespeare in Love, which won best picture at the Academy Awards, and Pulp Fiction.\nHis films have received more than 300 Oscar nominations and 81 wins.\nThe former film mogul has also faced a number of civil lawsuits, including from a group of women who accused him of sexual harassment and rape and reached a $19m (\u00a314.2) settlement with him in 2020.

The decision by his accusers to come forward, and his subsequent conviction in New York, galvanised the #MeToo movement against sex abuse by powerful men.Speaking to jurors on Wednesday, Ms Lucey said the movement had allowed the three women to come forward in the criminal case against Weinstein after they \"suddenly realized they were not alone\".Before the allegations against him emerged, Weinstein and his brother Bob were among Hollywood's ultimate power players.Weinstein co-founded Miramax film studio, whose hits included Shakespeare in Love, which won best picture at the Academy Awards, and Pulp Fiction.His films have received more than 300 Oscar nominations and 81 wins.The former film mogul has also faced a number of civil lawsuits, including from a group of women who accused him of sexual harassment and rape and reached a $19m (\u00a314.2) settlement with him in 2020. Weinstein used 'unfettered power' to sexually abuse women, rape retrial hears10 hours agoShareSaveMadeline HalpertBBC News, New YorkReporting fromIn courtShareSaveGetty ImagesWeinstein is being retried in the state of New York after a previous conviction was overturnedAttorneys delivered opening statements on Wednesday in the New York retrial of Harvey Weinstein, with prosecutors accusing the disgraced film producer of using his immense power in Hollywood to sexually harass and abuse three women. Weinstein had been serving a 23-year sentence in a New York prison after being convicted.He was also found guilty of rape in a separate trial in California in 2022 and was sentenced to 16 years in that case.Weinstein has several medical conditions, including cancer and diabetes. Last April, a court of appeals said Weinstein, now 73, did not receive a fair trial in New York in 2020 because the judge overseeing his case allowed testimony from women who made allegations against him for conduct he was never charged over.",

        "article_text": "China has executed a man for fatally stabbing a 10-year-old Japanese boy last September, the Japanese embassy in China has told the BBC. \nZhong Changchun was sentenced to death in January for attacking the boy, who had been walking to a Japanese school in south-eastern Chinese city of Shenzhen.\nThe case had sent shockwaves through both countries and fuelled diplomatic tensions amid allegations of it being a xenophobic attack.\n\"The Government of Japan considers the murder of a completely innocent child to be an unforgivable crime, and we take this execution with the utmost solemnity,\" the Japanese embassy said in its statement to the BBC.\n\"In light of this incident, the Japanese government will continue to take all possible safety measures and strongly urge the Chinese side to ensure the safety of Japanese nationals in China.\"\nIt said that it had been informed of the execution by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nThe incident heightened fears among Japanese living in China and prompted Japanese companies including Toyota to ask their staff to take precautions.  Others, like Panasonic, offered employees free flights home.\nThe verdict on Zhong's case made no mention of Japan, Japanese officials previously said. Kenji Kanasugi, Japan's ambassador to China said Zhong had requested to speak to the victim's family, but did not say if he had been targeting Japanese nationals.\nThe incident has also shone a light on the unchecked nationalism on Chinese social media, which has fuelled anti-foreigner sentiment in recent years.\nOnline commentators noted that the schoolboy's killing had happened on a politically sensitive date - 18 September, the anniversary of an incident that led to the Japanese occupation of Manchuria in China in the early 1930s.\nHistorical grievances have long overshadowed political tensions between China and Japan. China has long demanded an apology from Japan for its colonial and wartime aggression in the early and mid 20 Century. It has also accused Japan of glossing over its brutal military actions in China in its history textbooks. \nThe stabbing also came amid a spate of high-profile attacks on foreigners in China, including the stabbing of four American teachers in Jilin.\nLast June, a man attacked a Japanese mother and her child at a bus stop in Suzhou but ended up killing a Chinese woman trying to protect them. The man has also been executed, Japanese officials said last week.",

With this coaching certificate, I want to be able to get a job.\"\nListen to Africa Daily: Can football help women prisoners get back on their feet?\nAbout 80 women and their children are currently housed at the Freetown Female Correctional Centre according to AdvocAid, a non-governmental organisation in the West African country.\nBut it is not just prisoners in Sierra Leone who have benefited from the Caf course.\nIt has also been held in Ghana, is under way in Liberia and there are plans to extend the scheme to other parts of the continent.\nIsha Johansen, former president of the Sierra Leone Football Association (SLFA), pioneered the project after a visit to the correctional facility in Freetown.\n\"I saw very young girls there, an inmate with a baby on her lap and another pregnant,\" she told the BBC.\n\"90% of those inmates were in there because of poverty or petty crimes. They had no business being there.\n\"They are spending five, six or eight years doing nothing.\n\"I had to make a change. I was compelled to do something and football was a massive tool I had at my disposal.\"\nInmates received their coaching qualifications at the end of the course - but their anonymity was ensured by Sierra Leonean prison authorities\nWith few facilities at Freetown's correctional centre, the first course was run on the Astroturf pitch at the SLFA academy in the city.\nThe country's governing body also provided the inmates with equipment and jerseys.\nHowever, Johansen said the prison will now be investing in its own football pitch \"in the next few months\".\nFor those not keen on issuing instructions on the touchline, the Caf programme also offers other ways for inmates to get involved.\nSome are now sewing jerseys and training bibs for clubs across the country.\n\"What I'd like to see is when these girls go back into society, they don't end up back in prison,\" Johansen said.\n\"When they come out, they've got skills. They can go to the football federation to look for a job and they can coach in schools.\"\nMeanwhile, inmates in Nsawam - the largest female prison in Ghana with a population of 115 - also took to the football pitch in February.\nThe facility, located just to the north of the capital Accra, houses just over half of the country's female convicts.\nFormer Uganda international Majidah Nantanda offered instruction to inmates in Sierra Leone\n\"Being in prison here is very complicated for us,\" said one prisoner involved in the scheme in Nsawam.\n\"We are controlled on everything. It gives us a headache.\n\"But coaching is my passion, so when we heard about the course I was so happy to be part of it.\n\"We have learnt a lot of skills, like dribbling techniques.\"\nFormer Ghana international Mercy Tagoe, who represented her country at the 1999 Women's World Cup and has also coached the Black Queens, was among the instructors when the Caf course was run in Nsawam.\nShe stresses how it can help inmates back into society.\n\"They can do something with this license. Once they leave prison they can start with the grassroots within their local area,\" Tagoe said.\n\"They go to prison to be reformed. So this course can help them move on with their lives.\"\nBack in Freetown, Johansen is working with Caf and world governing body Fifa to see how the scheme can be implemented in other African countries - but also further afield in Asia and South America.\nFootball, she believes, has the power the change the lives of young women in similar circumstances across the globe.\n\"It's about using football for positive social change,\" Johansen said.\n\"Football is so much more than just 90 minutes on the pitch. This is an example of that.\"",

        "article_text": "Scotland's creative industries will suffer a \"massive blow\" unless the BBC reverses a decision to cancel soap opera River City, stars of the show have claimed.\nA number of actors from the programme were at the Scottish Parliament to hear a motion to save the show, which is due to end next year.\nStephen Purdon, who has played Bob (previously 'Shellsuit Bob') in the show since it began, told BBC Scotland News the programme served as a pipeline for talent who could otherwise be lost to the industry.\nBBC Scotland announced the decision to axe the soap last month, citing changes in audience behaviour away from long-running series.  \nPast and present cast members - including Frank Gallagher, who played crime boss Lenny Murdoch, and Gary: Tank Commander star Scott Fletcher - held placards up outside Holyrood protesting the cancellation, before sitting in the parliament to listen to the motion, brought by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. \nPurdon, the only remaining original cast member from its 2002 launch, said the show was important for off-screen talent it nurtured as well as those on screen, emphasising the programme's training academy - which teaches participants through classes and workshops.\nHe said: \"It's the only Scottish show that is constant throughout the year, and it's not just on screen. \n\"It's what goes on behind the scenes, like the training academy \u2013 it's a pathway into the industry for people who maybe don't otherwise have connections.\"\nA BBC spokesperson said training opportunities with River City would remain active until April 2026.\nBBC Scotland previously said it would increase total investment in drama over the next three years with a focus on \"world-class productions\" that can be sold internationally. \nHowever Purdon said short-term productions would not be able to replicate the consistency of River City, and it would be a \"massive blow to the industry\" if the cancellation went ahead. \nHe added: \"A six-part drama isn't going to constantly be there. \n\"It might be great for a short period of time, but for longevity, a show like River City is a conveyer belt [for talent].\"\nTom Urie, who was in the soap for four years from 2010 to 2014, told the BBC's Scotcast podcast the show was now \"embedded into Scottish culture\".\nHe said: \"As an actor living in Scotland, it's an accessible ambition to have. \n\"If you look at something like Vigil, how would I ever get in that? But you look at River City, and you go maybe one day I'll get into River City because they'll want to do a story about a big guy trying to lose weight.\n\"It doesn't feel like something that'll be here for four months and then go away.\"    \nThe series, set in a fictional west of Scotland area called Shieldinch, is filmed on a specially-built set in Dumbarton and featured the likes of Outlander star Sam Heughan in early roles.\nDeacon Blue singer Lorraine McIntosh, Scottish acting veteran Johnny Beattie and EastEnders actor Alex Ferns also took roles in the show.\nBibby said he brought the motion in the hope it would encourage BBC Scotland to think again, and that he was particularly concerned over closure of the Dumbarton studio.\nHe said: \"River City has been a platform and a pathway for young creative talent in Scotland. It's really important we have that platform, and I hope the BBC think again and maintain this iconic soap.\" \nThe Scottish government's culture secretary Angus Robertson said during the debate the decision to end River City was \"more than regrettable\" and that it displayed a \"worrying trend in decision making that runs counter to the BBC's commitment to invest in the nations.\"\nPurdon admitted the cancellation would carry an emotional impact for him personally, too.\nHe said: \"I'm 42 this year and I started when I was 19 so it means everything to me.

Purdon, the only remaining original cast member from its 2002 launch, said the show was important for off-screen talent it nurtured as well as those on screen, emphasising the programme's training academy - which teaches participants through classes and workshops.He said: \"It's the only Scottish show that is constant throughout the year, and it's not just on screen. However Purdon said short-term productions would not be able to replicate the consistency of River City, and it would be a \"massive blow to the industry\" if the cancellation went ahead.",

        "article_text": "McLaren's Oscar Piastri leads the 2025 drivers' championship after victory in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\nAfter the first triple header of the season, there is a week's break before Formula 1 heads to Miami from 2-4 May.\nBefore that, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions following the race in Jeddah.\nWill Max Verstappen modify his driving as a result of the decision to give him a five-second penalty in Saudi Arabia? - Kate\nMax Verstappen was given a five-second penalty in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because the stewards adjudged him to have gained an advantage by leaving the track while contesting the lead with McLaren's Oscar Piastri at the first corner.\nThe stewards pointed to the driving standards guidelines in making their decision, reporting that \"Car 81 (Piastri) had its front axle at least alongside the mirror of Car One (Verstappen) prior to and at the apex of corner one when trying to overtake Car One on the inside.\n\"In fact, Car 81 was alongside Car One at the apex. Based on the drivers' standards guidelines, it was therefore Car 81's corner and he was entitled to be given room.\"\nVerstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".\nThe guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option. \nBut Verstappen races hard, and pushes the limit of the rules. In critical situations such as this, he will do everything he can to keep position, and then force the stewards to make a decision.\nThis is understandable on two levels: first, the advantage of being in front and running in clean air is significant, as the race subsequently showed, and if he ends up being allowed to keep the position, it can win him the race; second, in the past, the stewards have often chosen not to punish him.\nHowever, the guidelines have changed this year, after significant pressure from the other drivers, exactly because of the way Verstappen races.\nThis was the first time the new rules have been tested with Verstappen, and this time his approach did not work. But he has had a lifetime of racing this way, so it would be quite a switch for him to change his approach.\nHaving said that, he is smart as well as tough. It would be a surprise if he did not learn from this incident in some ways for next time.\nFrom Piastri's side, he has now laid down a marker to Verstappen. He is a decisive, clinical racer who is not to be intimidated.\nVerstappen and Piastri go into the first corner side by side in Saudi Arabia\nDoes Lando Norris need to go sit down with Nico Rosberg to understand how he changed his mentality in his championship year? \u2013 Gary\nIn 2016, Nico Rosberg won the championship by pushing himself to the limit to be able to compete with an essentially faster team-mate in Lewis Hamilton, ensuring he was his best self all the time and hoping that would be enough.\nRosberg was handed a significant advantage with the comparative reliability of the two Mercedes at the start of the season, and even then Hamilton would have clawed the advantage back had he not had an engine failure while leading in Malaysia late in the season.\nThe situation at McLaren this year feels different. In 2024, Norris was decisively the faster and more convincing McLaren driver over the season. In 2025 so far, that has been Piastri.\nNorris is struggling to adapt to certain characteristics of the McLaren - particularly its lack of front grip at certain phases of the corner with his driving style.\nBut he is aware of what he needs to do. As he put it in Jeddah on Sunday: \"It's my qualifying, my Saturdays, which are not good enough at the minute. That's because I am struggling a little bit with the car.\n\"Yesterday was not the car, it was just me trying to take too many risks.\n\"So I just have to peg it back. I've got the pace. It's all in there. It's just sometimes I ask for a bit too much and sometimes I get a bit too 'ego' probably and try to put the perfect lap together. I just need to chill out a little bit.\"\nOf course when the margins are so tight - pole is being decided by hundredths of a second at each race - it's one thing to say that, and another to do it without coming off second best.\nDuring the race in Saudi Arabia, Liam Lawson picked up a 10-second penalty for completing his pass on Jack Doohan off-track, so gained an advantage. Max Verstappen only got five seconds for his off-track advantage. What's the difference between these two? - James\nAs the stewards explained in the verdict on Verstappen: \"Ordinarily, the baseline penalty for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage is 10 seconds.\n\"However, given that this was lap one and a turn one incident, we considered that to be a mitigating circumstance and imposed a five-second time penalty instead.\"\nSo Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.\nWhy can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. drive-through etc) rather than at a pit stop or after the race is completed? \u2013 Neil\nAfter the controversy of the title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi in 2021, it was decided that teams should no longer be able to talk directly to the race director during a grand prix.\nHowever, they can still talk to his assistants in race control and discuss incidents. So when a driver does a manoeuvre that looks borderline, teams have three options.\nThey can choose proactively to give the place back - as McLaren did with Lando Norris against Lewis Hamilton in Bahrain.\nThey can get in touch with race control and ask for an opinion on the move, and then make a decision as to what to do about it.\nOr they can plough on and hope for the best, as Red Bull did in Jeddah.\nThe FIA stewards will then make their decision as to how to handle it. They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.\nOf course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.\nThis is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.\nSome people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. But it is where the sport has landed for now.\nSaudi 'horrible' & 2025 looking 'painful' - Hamilton\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix review\nWilliams have already beaten their 2024 full season points total. What has made them so much better? \u2013 Stewart\nWilliams' progress this season is a direct result of the investment put in by owners Dorilton since they took over in 2020 and the changes to the team made under new boss James Vowles.\nInto last year, the introduction of new factory processes caused a difficult winter, the car barely made the first test and it was overweight for the first chunk of the season.\nThe difference this year was dramatic - their launch was held at Silverstone in public view in mid-February, and they ran the car for the first time there.\nWilliams are very much focused on 2026 and the new rules being introduced then, but as Vowles put it at the launch: \"What I can demonstrate is very clear progress that's taken place in manufacture, process, technology kicking in.\n\"We are moving into a new building this year, a benchmark driver in-the-loop simulator, that was started in 2023. The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it. But I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nBeing on the weight limit sounds like a small detail but is actually a big deal. Last year, it was costing them not far off 0.5 seconds a lap early in the year. Add that to this year's performance, and instead of being the fifth quickest car on average, as they are now, they would be eighth fastest, ahead of only Haas and Sauber.\nOn top of that, Williams now has two world-class drivers rather than just one. And they are not crashing like they were last year.\nAlex Albon ran with the car's improved performance and scored good points in the first three races, while both he and Carlos Sainz were in the top 10 in Saudi Arabia.\nSo, in a nutshell, the team has made progress, they have a better driver line-up and you're seeing it in the performance of the car.\n\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson",

        "article_text": "US stocks and the dollar plunged again as President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on the US central bank boss calling him \"a major loser\" for not lowering interest rates.\nIn a social media post, Trump called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates \"pre-emptively\" to help boost the economy, saying Powell had been consistently too slow to respond to economic developments. \n\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote.\nTrump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy comes as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. \nThe president's intensifying clash with Powell, whom he named to lead the Fed during his first term, has added to the market turmoil.\nThe S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest US companies, fell roughly 2.4% on Monday. It has lost roughly 12% of its value since the start of the year. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4% and has dropped about 10% so far this year, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.5% and is down roughly 18% since January.\nHowever, on Tuesday, trading on most major stock indexes in the Asia-Pacific region was subdued. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed around 0.1% lower, and the ASX 200 in Sydney closed around 0.3% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher.\nIn European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax was down around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%.\nThough the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence. \nThe dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022.\nInterest rates on US government debt also continued to rise on Tuesday, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries.\nMeanwhile, the price of gold hit a new all-time record high, breaking the $3,500 (\u00a32,613) per ounce mark as investors seek out so-called \"safe haven\" assets.\nThe precious metal is viewed as a safer place to put money during times of economic uncertainty.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said as well as tariffs, gold's appeal had also increased due there being \"no long-term resolution in sight for conflicts around the world, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza\".\n\"There are also concerns about the risk that geo-political tensions escalate as opportunities in the Arctic are eyed by the US and Russia,\" she added.\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs.\nThe latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy.\nTrump last week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\"\nSuch a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank.\nPowell last year told reporters he did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him. \nBut one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.\n\nTrump's latest comments come as top economic policymakers are gathering in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\nChristopher Meissner, a professor of economics at University of California, Davis, and who formerly worked with the IMF, told the BBC's Today programme that before the 1970s there was \"significant\" political pressure on the Federal Reserve from time to time.\n\"However, the past 30 or 40 years what we've learned is that central bank independence is the key to financial stability and low inflation. And I think this is a major reversal and we have to watch out for it,\" he added.\n\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" added Ms Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThe IMF will publish its latest growth forecasts for individual countries later, and last week it said these projections would include \"notable markdowns\".\nMr Meissner said: \"They used to say 'When the US sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold'. It'll be really curious to see if that continues.\n\"However, I think people are expecting a pretty significant downturn in the US in the coming months... and that can't be good for the rest of the world.\"\nMs Streeter said that Trump's policies had damaged the reputation of the US, which is \"no longer being seen as a calmer port in a storm\".\n\"Yields on 10\u2013year US Treasuries have held onto their recent rise above 4.4%. It's another sign of unease about the direction of the US economy, amid worries that policies playing out could keep inflation higher and slow growth, and flags the anxiety rattling through the markets right now,\" she added.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "There's a secret side of YouTube, just beyond the guiding hand of the algorithm \u2013 and it\u2019s nothing like what you know. The vast majority of YouTube's estimated 14.8 billion videos have almost never been seen. Until now.\nOn 23 April 2005, YouTube posted its first video; 19 awkward seconds of the platform's co-founder describing elephants at the zoo. But 20 years later, YouTube has moved from its amateur roots to such a behemoth that the company says it's the new Hollywood. YouTube is the world's number one TV streaming service, where users clock billions of hours of watching every day. Leading YouTubers regularly outperform big-name studios. For comparison, an estimated 823 million cinema tickets were sold across all of the US and Canada in 2024. Meanwhile, MrBeast's most successful video alone racked up 762 million views, about one watch for every 10 people on earth. \u00a0\nThat's the vision of YouTube the company promotes \u2013 slick, professional, entertaining and loud \u2013 but from one perspective, it's all a fa\u00e7ade.\nThrough another lens, the essence of YouTube is more like this video from 2020. Before I watched, it had only been seen twice. A man points the camera out of his bedroom window as a flurry breaks out in the dead of winter. \"Here it is,\" he says. \"The falling snow.\" The sound of a TV plays in the background. A bird lands on a nearby fence. 19 minutes go by. Nothing happens.\n\"The conversations we're having about YouTube are based on an impoverished view of what the platform really is,\" says Ryan McGrady, senior researcher at the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, US. \"When we just focus on what's popular, we miss how the vast majority of people actually use YouTube as uploaders, and overlooking the role it plays in our society.\"\nI spent the last month dipping into one of the first truly random samples of YouTube ever collected outside the company. I saw a side of the internet that sometimes feels lost, one full of pure, unvarnished self-expression. It's an entire world that YouTube's all-seeing algorithm won't show you.\n\"YouTube isn't just a vehicle for professionals,\" McGrady says. \"We rely on it as the default video arm of the internet. YouTube is infrastructure. It's a critical tool that regular people use to communicate.\"\nYouTube turns 20\nFor more on the world's biggest video platform, read our stories on:\n\u2022 YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know\n\u2022 The YouTube videos that changed the way we think about ourselves\n\u2022 How a tiny village became India's YouTube capital\nTo unveil this side of YouTube, McGrady and his colleagues built a tool that dials videos at random. The scraper tried more than 18 trillion potential URLs before it collected a big enough sample for real scientific analysis. Among the findings, the researchers estimate that the median video has been watched just 41 times. Posts with more than 130 views are actually in the top third of the service's most popular content. In other words, the vast majority of YouTube is practically invisible.\nMost of these videos aren't meant for us to see. They exist because people need a digital attic to store their memories. It's an internet unshaped by the pressures of clicks and algorithms \u2013 a glimpse into a place where content doesn't have to perform, where it can simply exist.\n12 years ago, a woman from the US named Emily posted a YouTube video called \"sw33t tats\". I learned it's even older than that, recorded around 2008. In the video, Emily, who asked to withhold her full name, sits in her college dorm room. She pries her mouth open as her younger sister brings a marker to the inside of Emily's lower lip.\n\"Stop moving!\", her sister yells as she starts to write, the girls barely able to control their laughter. Emily holds her lip open to the camera, and her sister does the same, revealing a sweet tat of her own. But the footage is blurry; whatever these fake tattoos said is lost to time.\nEmily, now 34 and living in New York City, forgot this video existed until I asked her about it. \"I don't even remember why I uploaded this,\" she says. \"I think wanted to send it to my sister, but I also I had to free up space on my hard drive. I just needed a place to put it. I don't know, it's funny and weird. I'm glad it's still here.\"\n\"We tend to assume the reason to use social media is to try to be an influencer, either you're Joe Rogan or you're a failure. But that's the wrong way to think about it,\" says Ethan Zuckerman, who leads the YouTube research as the director of the University of Massachusetts' Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure.\nYouTube tells the BBC it's incorrect to suggest the platform doesn't let you see videos with low views or content from small channels. The algorithm's job is to help people find the videos they want to watch and that will give them value, YouTube says, and sometimes that does include videos with a small number of views.\n\"The magic of YouTube is that whether a video has 60 views or six million, people are able to find community, learn a new skill, be entertained, or share their voice with the world,\" says Boot Bullwinkle, a YouTube spokesperson. \"Every channel starts from the same blank slate, from which they can build an audience and grow a business.\"\nZuckerman and his colleagues weren't the first to go looking for YouTube's underbelly. Between 2009 and 2012, for instance, iPhones included a feature that let users post videos straight to YouTube with a few taps. YouTube reported that mobile uploads jumped 400% a day. Unless people added a custom title, the name for all these videos followed a standard format, which makes them easily searchable over a decade later. A few online tinkerers have explored these videos, which apparently number in the millions. One even built a custom player that cycles through them.\nWithout the algorithm's recommendations, you'll find that YouTube is a study of the everyday, Zuckerman says, people documenting small moments in their lives and using the available tools to exchange ideas.\nIn South Asia, for example, Zuckerman says YouTube and similar networks seem to function as a video messaging tool for people with low or no literacy. Most of YouTube comes from outside of the US, in fact. Zuckerman's lab has estimated that over 70% of YouTube videos are in languages other than English. You find fisherman in South America waving from a boat, or two construction workers speaking in Hindi about how much they miss home. Videos like these fall under what he calls \"friends and family\" content, where comments and interactions all come from people who seem to know the user personally.\n\"If any of these videos went viral, it would mean something went terribly wrong. That's not what most of YouTube for,\" Zuckerman says.\nMost unwatched YouTube is less entertaining than sw33t tats, which, with respect to Emily, sets a low bar. This stuff is bland enough to melt your brain. A bride gets ready for a photo shoot. A grouchy Korean man rants about politics. Six seconds of a martial arts instructor, devoid of context. Dash camera footage from a car struggling to escape a parking lot. A woman advertises a horse for sale in 2018. Endless, mundane screen recordings of video games \u2013 the University of Massachusetts Amhurst study found people playing video games seems to make up almost 20% of YouTube. \u00a0\nOccasionally, you stumble on something fun, or more often, just plain weird. Three men performatively slapping each other's rear ends to a James Brown song. A woman reviews a brand of pre-sliced bologna (it's \"not too bad\"). Or take the channel \"Space Stuff and Other Stuff\", where a kid raps about the planet Neptune and shares his condolences after Queen Elizabeth's passing. The latter falls in the \"other stuff\" category, apparently.\nSome videos are heartrending. I listened to an elderly man describe how he's living in a car on a farm, trading manual labour for a place to stay. There was a moving tribute to a departed cat from her owner, Tyler. \"Kiko didn't make it,\" he says, holding back tears. \"It's so darn quiet without her here.\" A few dozen videos I paused to watch a young ballerina float delicately across a stage, wafting back and forth in front of a hushed crowd.\n\"As researchers, we spend a lot of time with this stuff. It can be a lot like looking at people's personal snapshots,\" Zuckerman says. \"Most of it's boring, but sometimes it's poignant, even haunting. And every so often, you get something that feels incredibly revealing about how human beings communicate.\"\nBut my favourite videos by far came from Bill \"The WoofDriver\" Hellman. He's a 58-year-old working in real estate just outside of Baltimore, US. But that's not his passion. What Hellman really cares about is his dogs, and the unique way he cares for them. \"You've never seen anything like this before,\" he says in one video. I guarantee that he's right.\nHellman has built over 50 custom-made vehicles that he uses to take his four huskies out for what he calls \"urban mushing\". He uses social media to document their adventures on the trails of the eastern US. It all looks a bit like the dog sled races of the Iditarod. Except here, the dogs are usually strapped to the side of his various slow-moving contraptions, recumbent bicycles and electric dog-walking carts. By the looks of it Hellman's dogs are thrilled to participate.\nHe's posted more than 2,400 YouTube videos in the last 14 years, many of which include original rock songs. (Hellman says he's written more than 100 WoofDriver songs, in fact.) He puts in a lot of work, heading out with drones and groups of friends to document his journeys. Hellman's even paid for celebrity endorsements through the platform Cameo to promote his videos. But for all the effort, his channel often gets little traction. Many videos have views in the low double digits.\n\"I don't get a big audience a lot of the time, but that doesn't bother me. I was just so in love with how happy it made the dogs that at some point I thought 'I gotta share this',\" Hellman says. \"Maybe it'll inspire someone to take better care of their dogs, but really, I use YouTube like the cloud, so I have a place to document my adventures.\"\nYouTube doesn't pay the bills, and the WoofDriver isn't selling anything \u2013 though he's happy to give you the dimensions if you want to build your own urban dog sled. \"I just do it because of the joy it brings me,\" Hellman says.\nRandom YouTube usually doesn't look like the highly produced videos of the WoofDriver, but he's a good representation in one sense. Like Hellman's content, the majority of these unseen YouTube videos range from neutral to overwhelmingly positive.\nThe same can't be said for what rises to the top. Research suggests YouTube's algorithm amplifies negativity, reinforces stereotypes and gives users little control over the content they don't want to see. Over the years, YouTube has faced increasing criticism over concerns about hate speech, political extremism and misinformation. Along with other social media platforms, YouTube has been utilised by drug cartels and harnessed by terrorists as a tool for promotion and recruitment.\nYouTube says that the company has employed a set of community guidelines since its earliest days to establish what's allowed on the platform. The company says it has redoubled efforts to address its responsibilities. One way YouTube measures its success is through its \"violative view rate\". In 2017, for every 10,000 views on YouTube, 63-72 views came from content that violated YouTube policies, but today that number has fallen to eight to nine views, according to the company.\nYouTube says it gives users several ways to manage YouTube recommendations and search results, such as deleting your Watch History.\nWhen the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure set out to study YouTube, part of the impetus was to document how common hate speech and misinformation is on the platform. \"If you go looking for it, you'll find it,\" McGrady says, but compared to the total body of videos on YouTube it's exceedingly unusual. Still, it doesn't matter how rare a damaging video is if it gets a ton of views, McGrady says, and harmful content remains a serious issue on YouTube.\nIn recent years, Google has faced a wave of scrutiny from policy makers, with new laws and a mountain of proposed regulations \u2013 not to mention a series of antitrust cases. But when the regulatory conversation turns to the videos on YouTube themselves, the focus is almost always on content that goes viral, McGrady says.\nThis ignores the obligations YouTube should have because, according to McGrady, the company is running a piece of essential infrastructure.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The ghosts of India's TikTok\n\u2022 Google just updated its algorithm. The internet will never be the same\n\u2022 The riddles humans can solve but computers can't\n\"The internet is deeply troubled, and we can't ignore the way tech companies are exacerbating those problems,\" McGrady says. \"What makes me hopeful is that when you find a way to look at how people are really using the web, a lot of it still feels like the early internet. It's expression, communication, connection. Fundamentally, it's a place where regular people share themselves and do wonderful things.\"\nThe YouTube we talk about \u2013 the one full of celebrities, scandals and manufactured virality \u2013 only tells part of the story. The majority exists in quiet moments, in shaky camera work and voices meant for no one in particular. \u00a0I watched hundreds of these videos. Everything one of them is public, but it's also clear that most people didn't upload this content for strangers. It was like being let in on a secret, a sprawling, uncurated documentary of human life. But watching it also felt like work compared to the doomscroll-inducing entertainment you get from the algorithm. Eventually, I closed my tabs and headed back to the YouTube homepage, back to the polished world of the corporate internet.\n* Thomas Germain is a senior technology journalist for the BBC.

        "article_text": "US Vice-President JD Vance has responded to Pope Francis's death, acknowledging his meeting with the pontiff on Easter Sunday.\n\"My heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him,\" Vance wrote in a statement posted to social media platform X. \"I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill.\"\nVance, who converted to Catholicism as an adult, had diplomatic meetings with Vatican officials over the weekend before he left Rome for India. \nHe followed his statement with a link to his favourite homily by the late Pope - a March 2020 address on fear and faith that was given during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe White House also offered condolences on X, with an unsigned statement that read: \"Rest in Peace, Pope Francis.\"\nThe meeting with Pope Francis was not originally on Vance's schedule for the trip to Italy. But sources had said Vance was hoping he could secure even a brief moment with the Pope - a personal goal for him as a Catholic, as well as a political one. \nThe pontiff was a long-time critic of US President Donald Trump. In 2016, he questioned then-presidential candidate Trump's faith, saying \"a person who thinks only about building walls... and not of building bridges, is not Christian\". \nRecently, he referred to Trump's immigration views as \"an ugly thing\", and his plans to ramp up deportations as a \"disgrace\". Caring for migrants was a signature issue for the Pope. \nVance has defended Trump's policies, sometimes invoking his own religious beliefs in response to the criticism. Still, his visit was aimed at thawing relations, insiders said.\nOn Saturday, Vance also met the Vatican's secretary of state and secretary for relations with states and international organisation.\nIn a statement, the Vatican described \"cordial talks\" on Saturday that affirmed \"good existing bilateral relations\" and a \"common commitment\" to protect freedom of religion.\nOn Sunday, Vance's office confirmed a visit to the Pope that lasted about 15 minutes. Vance \"expressed his gratitude to Pope Francis for inviting him to meet on Easter Sunday and for the hospitality the Vatican has extended to his family\".  \nVance converted to Catholicism in 2019, then in his mid-30s. He wrote that he found the family and social values of the Catholic Church appealing and of a part with his view of conservative politics.\nStill, amid his disagreements with Pope Francis on immigration, he acknowledged that his faith was newer and may differ from Pope Francis's, even as he revered the Pope. The US Catholic Church has at times clashed with Pope Francis, taking a more conservative approach to social issues.\nAt the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington in February, Vance referred to himself as a \"baby Catholic\" and said there were \"things about the faith that I don't know\".\nThe death of Pope Francis, the first Latin American leader of the Roman Catholic Church, was announced on Monday. He was 88.\n\"This morning at 07:35 local time (05:35 GMT) the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the home of the Father,\" Cardinal Kevin Farrell said in the statement, which was published by the Vatican on its Telegram channel.\nAlso on Sunday, Francis appeared at the Vatican's St Peter's Square to wish thousands of worshippers a happy Easter.\nHe had been discharged from hospital last month, after five weeks of treatment for an infection that led to double pneumonia.",

        "article_text": "McLaren's Oscar Piastri leads the 2025 drivers' championship after victory in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\nAfter the first triple header of the season, there is a week's break before Formula 1 heads to Miami from 2-4 May.\nBefore that, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions following the race in Jeddah.\nWill Max Verstappen modify his driving as a result of the decision to give him a five-second penalty in Saudi Arabia? - Kate\nMax Verstappen was given a five-second penalty in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because the stewards adjudged him to have gained an advantage by leaving the track while contesting the lead with McLaren's Oscar Piastri at the first corner.\nThe stewards pointed to the driving standards guidelines in making their decision, reporting that \"Car 81 (Piastri) had its front axle at least alongside the mirror of Car One (Verstappen) prior to and at the apex of corner one when trying to overtake Car One on the inside.\n\"In fact, Car 81 was alongside Car One at the apex. Based on the drivers' standards guidelines, it was therefore Car 81's corner and he was entitled to be given room.\"\nVerstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".\nThe guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option. \nBut Verstappen races hard, and pushes the limit of the rules. In critical situations such as this, he will do everything he can to keep position, and then force the stewards to make a decision.\nThis is understandable on two levels: first, the advantage of being in front and running in clean air is significant, as the race subsequently showed, and if he ends up being allowed to keep the position, it can win him the race; second, in the past, the stewards have often chosen not to punish him.\nHowever, the guidelines have changed this year, after significant pressure from the other drivers, exactly because of the way Verstappen races.\nThis was the first time the new rules have been tested with Verstappen, and this time his approach did not work. But he has had a lifetime of racing this way, so it would be quite a switch for him to change his approach.\nHaving said that, he is smart as well as tough. It would be a surprise if he did not learn from this incident in some ways for next time.\nFrom Piastri's side, he has now laid down a marker to Verstappen. He is a decisive, clinical racer who is not to be intimidated.\nVerstappen and Piastri go into the first corner side by side in Saudi Arabia\nDoes Lando Norris need to go sit down with Nico Rosberg to understand how he changed his mentality in his championship year? \u2013 Gary\nIn 2016, Nico Rosberg won the championship by pushing himself to the limit to be able to compete with an essentially faster team-mate in Lewis Hamilton, ensuring he was his best self all the time and hoping that would be enough.\nRosberg was handed a significant advantage with the comparative reliability of the two Mercedes at the start of the season, and even then Hamilton would have clawed the advantage back had he not had an engine failure while leading in Malaysia late in the season.\nThe situation at McLaren this year feels different. In 2024, Norris was decisively the faster and more convincing McLaren driver over the season. In 2025 so far, that has been Piastri.\nNorris is struggling to adapt to certain characteristics of the McLaren - particularly its lack of front grip at certain phases of the corner with his driving style.\nBut he is aware of what he needs to do. As he put it in Jeddah on Sunday: \"It's my qualifying, my Saturdays, which are not good enough at the minute. That's because I am struggling a little bit with the car.\n\"Yesterday was not the car, it was just me trying to take too many risks.\n\"So I just have to peg it back. I've got the pace. It's all in there. It's just sometimes I ask for a bit too much and sometimes I get a bit too 'ego' probably and try to put the perfect lap together. I just need to chill out a little bit.\"\nOf course when the margins are so tight - pole is being decided by hundredths of a second at each race - it's one thing to say that, and another to do it without coming off second best.\nDuring the race in Saudi Arabia, Liam Lawson picked up a 10-second penalty for completing his pass on Jack Doohan off-track, so gained an advantage. Max Verstappen only got five seconds for his off-track advantage. What's the difference between these two? - James\nAs the stewards explained in the verdict on Verstappen: \"Ordinarily, the baseline penalty for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage is 10 seconds.\n\"However, given that this was lap one and a turn one incident, we considered that to be a mitigating circumstance and imposed a five-second time penalty instead.\"\nSo Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.\nWhy can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. drive-through etc) rather than at a pit stop or after the race is completed? \u2013 Neil\nAfter the controversy of the title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi in 2021, it was decided that teams should no longer be able to talk directly to the race director during a grand prix.\nHowever, they can still talk to his assistants in race control and discuss incidents. So when a driver does a manoeuvre that looks borderline, teams have three options.\nThey can choose proactively to give the place back - as McLaren did with Lando Norris against Lewis Hamilton in Bahrain.\nThey can get in touch with race control and ask for an opinion on the move, and then make a decision as to what to do about it.\nOr they can plough on and hope for the best, as Red Bull did in Jeddah.\nThe FIA stewards will then make their decision as to how to handle it. They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.\nOf course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.\nThis is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.\nSome people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. But it is where the sport has landed for now.\nSaudi 'horrible' & 2025 looking 'painful' - Hamilton\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix review\nWilliams have already beaten their 2024 full season points total. What has made them so much better? \u2013 Stewart\nWilliams' progress this season is a direct result of the investment put in by owners Dorilton since they took over in 2020 and the changes to the team made under new boss James Vowles.\nInto last year, the introduction of new factory processes caused a difficult winter, the car barely made the first test and it was overweight for the first chunk of the season.\nThe difference this year was dramatic - their launch was held at Silverstone in public view in mid-February, and they ran the car for the first time there.\nWilliams are very much focused on 2026 and the new rules being introduced then, but as Vowles put it at the launch: \"What I can demonstrate is very clear progress that's taken place in manufacture, process, technology kicking in.\n\"We are moving into a new building this year, a benchmark driver in-the-loop simulator, that was started in 2023. The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it. But I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nBeing on the weight limit sounds like a small detail but is actually a big deal. Last year, it was costing them not far off 0.5 seconds a lap early in the year. Add that to this year's performance, and instead of being the fifth quickest car on average, as they are now, they would be eighth fastest, ahead of only Haas and Sauber.\nOn top of that, Williams now has two world-class drivers rather than just one. And they are not crashing like they were last year.\nAlex Albon ran with the car's improved performance and scored good points in the first three races, while both he and Carlos Sainz were in the top 10 in Saudi Arabia.\nSo, in a nutshell, the team has made progress, they have a better driver line-up and you're seeing it in the performance of the car.\n\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson",

I thought they gave that up two weeks ago. It's the same old stuff from the media. That's an old one. Try finding something new,\" he said. \nTrump said the source of the story \"sounds like disgruntled employees\", an idea that was also floated by Hegseth himself earlier Monday when he claimed the news media was \"full of hoaxsters\" who \"try to slash and burn people\".\nHegseth did not directly respond to the story about the second Signal chat, which was initially reported by the New York Times.\nIn a statement to the newspaper, the White House said no classified information was shared.\nThe messages in the second chat, sent on 15 March, included flight schedules for American F/A-18 Hornets carrying out strikes on Houthi targets. \nHegseth's wife, Jennifer, is a former Fox News producer and holds no official position within the Pentagon. Hegseth has previously been criticised for reportedly including his wife in meetings with foreign leaders.\nHis brother, Phil, and personal lawyer, Tim Parlatore, both hold positions at the Department of Defense. But it is not clear why any of the three would require advanced warnings of sensitive US strike plans.\nUnlike the first Signal group, the second one - called \"Defense | Team Huddle\" - was created by Hegseth, according to the New York Times.\nThe existence of the earlier Signal group was revealed by Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of the Atlantic magazine, who was accidentally included in it by Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser. \nOfficials used the group to discuss information relating to upcoming strikes in Yemen. Goldberg left the original chat after the first attacks on 14 March, but the two group chats appeared to discuss the same military operation that took place over several weeks.\nThe White House has also denied that classified information was discussed in the first group, although critics of Hegseth - including former US defence officials - question that. They say discussing such information in Signal groups could jeopardise US personnel carrying out military operations.\nSignal uses end-to-end encryption, meaning only the sender of the message and its recipients can view its contents. \nThis is considered a high level of security for a messaging app. But it offers no protection if someone's phone is viewed by another person or falls into the wrong hands, or if the wrong person is added to a group chat.\nExperts say this is why classified communications normally take place in secure, government-controlled locations rather than on officials' private devices.\nThe existence of the second Signal group is the latest controversy surrounding the head of the Pentagon, who this year is controlling a budget of $892bn (\u00a3670bn).\nHegseth last week fired three top officials for an \"unauthorised disclosure\" - an accusation the officials said was \"baseless\".\nIn a testy exchange outside the White House ahead of an annual Easter event, Hegseth appeared to attribute the latest story to the officials he fired.\n\"What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out,\" he said. \nHegseth denounced the reporters, and said he has spoken to the president and that they were \"on the same page all the way\" before turning away from the cameras. \nIn an op-ed for Politico magazine published on Sunday, John Ullyot, a former top Pentagon spokesperson who resigned last week, wrote that the department was in \"total chaos\".\nHe added: \"The dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president - who deserves better from his senior leadership.\"\nUllyot said it was not true that the three fired officials were leaking information and wrote: \"Unfortunately, Hegseth's team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door.\"\nHowever, in a statement on X, Sean Parnell, current chief spokesman for the Pentagon, accused the \"Trump-hating media\" of \"destroying anyone committed to President Trump's agenda\".\nHe echoed the White House by saying that \"there was no classified information in any Signal chat\".\nWashington says its strikes in Yemen are punishment for Houthi attacks on cargo vessels transiting through the Red Sea, a critical waterway for international trade.\nSince November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.\nThe Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.\nUS air strikes on an oil terminal in north-western Yemen this week killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others, according to the Houthi-run health ministry. The Houthi-led government said the attack constituted a \"war crime\".",

        "article_text": "He had tea with the Queen, was blessed by the Pope and spread Hawaiian culture across the globe. More than a century later, a festival dubbed the \"Olympics of hula\" honours his legacy.\nSilence engulfed the audience at Edith Kanaka'ole Stadium in Hilo, Hawai'i, as a group of hula dancers appeared on stage. They moved gracefully in unison, rhythmically depicting a scene of an ancient Hawaiian myth as they bellowed mele (chants). The hula performance, which was part of the annual Merrie Monarch Festival, wasn't a mere spectacle; it was a powerful celebration of Hawaiian culture \u2013 and for years, it was banned.\nThe week-long\u00a0Merrie Monarch Festival (which takes place 20-26 April 2025 and is celebrating its 62nd anniversary) has been called the \"Olympics of hula\"\u00a0and perpetuates the sacred, centuries-old practice of dancing and chanting that preserves and portrays our native Hawaiian language, history, religion and culture. Every year, thousands of Hawaiians descend on the Big Island to attend the event, while thousands more watch live broadcasts of Hawai'i's 23 best h\u0101lau (hula groups) compete on TV. Yet, the festival is more than just a hula contest; its dance performances, arts and craft exhibitions, and a royal parade through downtown Hilo is considered the biggest display of Hawaiian culture in the world.\n\"It's the one week out of the year where we celebrate being Hawaiian,\" said K\u016b Kahakalau, a Hawaiian language and culture expert. \"And it's all thanks to the undertakings of King Kal\u0101kaua.\"\nFondly dubbed \"The Merrie Monarch\", King David La'amea Kal\u0101kaua was the last king of Hawai'i. He ruled the Kingdom of Hawai'i from 1874 until his death in 1891, but his ascension to the throne was nothing short of contentious. Shortly after the death of King Kamehameha IV, whose family had ruled the kingdom since 1795, Hawai'i's legislature\u00a0decided to elect a native\u00a0ali'i\u00a0(noble chief) instead of the king's widow. The decision incited a full-blown riot. As the queen's supporters stormed the Honolulu courthouse, British and American sailors stationed at Honolulu harbour were called in to quell the fighting and Kal\u0101kaua took the oath of office the following day.\nBy the time of Kal\u0101kaua's reign, Native Hawaiian heritage was at great risk. Christian missionaries had begun arriving on the islands in 1820, introducing diseases that killed Native Hawaiians, converting islanders away from our traditional polytheistic religion and infiltrating the political system to suppress local culture and beliefs. One of the most significant ways they did this was by banning public performances of the hula, a dance missionaries deemed \"vile heathen chants\".\nKal\u0101kaua sought to restore a unified sense of national pride among Hawaiians, and his reign marked a period of cultural renaissance across the islands. He lived by the motto Ho'oulu L\u0101hui\u00a0(Increase the Nation) and sought to remake Hawai'i for Hawaiians \u2013 all of which resulted in the revival of traditional customs such as language, music, arts and traditional medicines that had long been suppressed during the missionary-influenced era of his predecessors. One of his crowning achievements was preserving the hula. As Kal\u0101kaua famously proclaimed: \"Hula is the language of the heart, and therefore the heartbeat of the Hawaiian people.\"\u00a0\nTo many people around the world, \"hula\" may conjure images of tiki bars, plastic dancers shaking their hips on car dashboards or something that only happens at beachside resorts. But long before hula was commodified and appropriated, it was a sacred dance among Native Hawaiians \u2013 an ancient practice that served as an archive of our stories, beliefs and way of life. Prior to the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, there was no written language in Hawai'i. Instead, ancient Hawaiians used oral tradition and hula to pass on their identity and culture from one generation to the next. Even when practice was prohibited, Hawaiians took hula underground, continuing to teach the forbidden dance in secret in caves and far-flung areas.\nAs part of Kal\u0101kaua's Ho'oulu L\u0101hui\u00a0policy, hula experienced a resurgence. In fact, the king's lavish two-week coronation ceremony was essentially a celebration of Native Hawaiian culture, featuring traditional music, hula and l\u016b'au \u2013\u00a0all of which had previously been banned. To commemorate his 50th birthday three years later,\u00a0ho'opa'a\u00a0(chanters) and\u00a0'\u014dlapa\u00a0(dancers) performed in public for the first time in years, while a parade wound its way through downtown Honolulu. Today, the Merrie Monarch Festival pays tribute to the proud sense of Hawaiian identity Kal\u0101kaua revived.\n[Kal\u0101kaua] was deeply committed, proud and knowledgeable about his Hawaiian heritage,\" said Kahakalau, noting that the king was also the first person to have the Kumulipo (a creation chant that also includes the genealogy of Hawaiian royalty) written down.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nYet, Kal\u0101kaua wasn't just content to revive Hawaiian customs in Hawai'i; he wanted to share the Kingdom's culture around the world. So, in 1881, the \"Merrie Monarch\" continued the proud Hawaiian tradition of long-distance seafaring by\u00a0spending 281 days circumnavigating the globe, becoming the first head of state to travel around the world.\nDuring Kal\u0101kaua's international diplomacy tour, he was greeted by the Emperor of Japan to the sounds of\u00a0Hawai'i Pono'\u012b\u00a0(the Kingdom's national anthem, which Kal\u0101kaua had written); he proposed immigration policies with Chinese politicians; he toured the Great Sphinx with the Khedive of Egypt; he was blessed by Pope Leo XIII in Rome; he had tea with Queen Victoria of England, and he boarded a train that was struck by a bull in Spain. In New York, Kal\u0101kaua met with Thomas Edison to discuss the possibility of getting electricity to Honolulu. In 1886, the king's wish came true.\u00a0'Iolani Palace\u00a0(which is now a museum and the only royal residence in the United States), became illuminated with electric lights \u2013 five years before the White House did.\n\"He was able to build important relationships, create liaisons, and sign treaties with multiple countries [that benefitted our people],\" said Kenneth \"Aloha\" Victor, a kumu hula (master hula teacher) and designer of Kaulua'e, a made-in-Hawai'i clothing and lifestyle brand. In addition to sending envoys to Europe and Asia, Kal\u0101kaua maintained consulates and legations in more than 130 cities across the globe. The Kingdom had 13 consulates in Great Britain alone.\nBack at home, during an era of increased literacy, Kal\u0101kaua met with traditional na kahuna (priests) and na kapuna (elders) to compile many of the ancient Hawaiian myths and chants that are portrayed through hula and mele and write them in Hawaiian. In 1888, he took things one step further and translated these stories into English for the first time in the book, Legends and Myths of Hawai'i, which he often presented as gifts to foreign dignitaries so they'd get a better understanding of Hawai'i, its culture and its people.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The word embodying the spirit of Hawai'i\n\u2022 A lei maker's guide to the real Honolulu\n\u2022 Hawaii's ancient land management system\nKal\u0101kaua's mission to integrate Hawai'i with the rest of the world also resulted in the creation of the Hawaiian Youths Abroad Program, in which the king selected young Hawaiians whom he felt could become future leaders of the Kingdom and sent them abroad to study things like medicine, law, engineering, foreign languages and art.\u00a0More than 100 years later, the programme's legacy still echoes across the islands: Princess Abigail Kaw\u0101nanakoa, the granddaughter of one of the students the king sent abroad, played an instrumental role in restoring 'Iolani Palace and was a staunch supporter of native Hawaiian rights until her death in 2022.\nA multi-hyphenate in every sense of the word, Kal\u0101kaua embraced modernity just as much as he valued Hawaiian culture. He was a voracious inventor, designing blueprints for tornado-proof ships, fish-shaped torpedoes, sealed bottle caps and rangefinder scopes. He even had a telephone installed that connected 'Iolani Palace where he lived and worked to his private boathouse less than a mile away, where he'd often be found hosting royal l\u016b'aus\u00a0for foreign dignitaries and heads of state.\nFor Hawaiians today, Kal\u0101kaua is much more than just a Renaissance man. \"When Kal\u0101kaua travelled [abroad], he promoted and shared our culture with the world,\" said Ana Kon, a Hawaiian cultural specialist based in Hilo. \"It's why, more than a century later, we continue to honour his legacy today at the Merrie Monarch Festival.\"\nFor those unable to snag tickets to the Merrie Monarch Festival's highly coveted hula competitions, there are still plenty of opportunities to participate in the festivities. Hilo's Afook-Chinen Civic Auditorium and Butler Buildings host a vibrant arts and crafts fair featuring the creations of more than 150 local artisans and brands from across Hawai'i. \"Our 'aloha wear' is a celebration of hula,\" said Victor, of his clothing, which he said honours the people, places and movements in Hawaiian culture.\nOf course, Kal\u0101kaua's legacy lives on beyond the festival. In many ways, every hula step, l\u016b'au gathering and Hawaiian-language phrase is a nod back to our last king's efforts to revive our customs at home and introduce them around the world.

Beachside resorts like\u00a0Outrigger Reef in Waikiki Beach are adopting a regenerative tourism approach at its A'o Cultural Center by allowing guests to meet traditional Hawaiian navigators and canoe builders, teaching them how to use traditional Hawaiian tools and \u2013 yes \u2013 participate in hula lessons.\n\"It all spawns back to [King Kal\u0101kaua's] creed,\" said Victor. \"That hula is the heartbeat of our Hawaiian people.\"\nCORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this story stated that\u00a0US sugar planters overthrew the Kingdom of Hawai'i.

It has lost roughly 12% of its value since the start of the year. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4% and has dropped about 10% so far this year, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.5% and is down roughly 18% since January.\nHowever, on Tuesday, trading on most major stock indexes in the Asia-Pacific region was subdued. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed around 0.1% lower, and the ASX 200 in Sydney closed around 0.3% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher.\nIn European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax was down around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%.\nThough the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence. \nThe dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022.\nInterest rates on US government debt also continued to rise on Tuesday, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries.\nMeanwhile, the price of gold hit a new all-time record high, breaking the $3,500 (\u00a32,613) per ounce mark as investors seek out so-called \"safe haven\" assets.\nThe precious metal is viewed as a safer place to put money during times of economic uncertainty.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said as well as tariffs, gold's appeal had also increased due there being \"no long-term resolution in sight for conflicts around the world, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza\".\n\"There are also concerns about the risk that geo-political tensions escalate as opportunities in the Arctic are eyed by the US and Russia,\" she added.\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs.\nThe latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy.\nTrump last week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\"\nSuch a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank.\nPowell last year told reporters he did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him. \nBut one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.\n\nTrump's latest comments come as top economic policymakers are gathering in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\nChristopher Meissner, a professor of economics at University of California, Davis, and who formerly worked with the IMF, told the BBC's Today programme that before the 1970s there was \"significant\" political pressure on the Federal Reserve from time to time.\n\"However, the past 30 or 40 years what we've learned is that central bank independence is the key to financial stability and low inflation. And I think this is a major reversal and we have to watch out for it,\" he added.\n\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" added Ms Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThe IMF will publish its latest growth forecasts for individual countries later, and last week it said these projections would include \"notable markdowns\".\nMr Meissner said: \"They used to say 'When the US sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold'. It'll be really curious to see if that continues.\n\"However, I think people are expecting a pretty significant downturn in the US in the coming months... and that can't be good for the rest of the world.\"\nMs Streeter said that Trump's policies had damaged the reputation of the US, which is \"no longer being seen as a calmer port in a storm\".\n\"Yields on 10\u2013year US Treasuries have held onto their recent rise above 4.4%. It's another sign of unease about the direction of the US economy, amid worries that policies playing out could keep inflation higher and slow growth, and flags the anxiety rattling through the markets right now,\" she added.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "McLaren's Oscar Piastri leads the 2025 drivers' championship after victory in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\nAfter the first triple header of the season, there is a week's break before Formula 1 heads to Miami from 2-4 May.\nBefore that, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions following the race in Jeddah.\nWill Max Verstappen modify his driving as a result of the decision to give him a five-second penalty in Saudi Arabia? - Kate\nMax Verstappen was given a five-second penalty in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because the stewards adjudged him to have gained an advantage by leaving the track while contesting the lead with McLaren's Oscar Piastri at the first corner.\nThe stewards pointed to the driving standards guidelines in making their decision, reporting that \"Car 81 (Piastri) had its front axle at least alongside the mirror of Car One (Verstappen) prior to and at the apex of corner one when trying to overtake Car One on the inside.\n\"In fact, Car 81 was alongside Car One at the apex. Based on the drivers' standards guidelines, it was therefore Car 81's corner and he was entitled to be given room.\"\nVerstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".\nThe guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option. \nBut Verstappen races hard, and pushes the limit of the rules. In critical situations such as this, he will do everything he can to keep position, and then force the stewards to make a decision.\nThis is understandable on two levels: first, the advantage of being in front and running in clean air is significant, as the race subsequently showed, and if he ends up being allowed to keep the position, it can win him the race; second, in the past, the stewards have often chosen not to punish him.\nHowever, the guidelines have changed this year, after significant pressure from the other drivers, exactly because of the way Verstappen races.\nThis was the first time the new rules have been tested with Verstappen, and this time his approach did not work. But he has had a lifetime of racing this way, so it would be quite a switch for him to change his approach.\nHaving said that, he is smart as well as tough. It would be a surprise if he did not learn from this incident in some ways for next time.\nFrom Piastri's side, he has now laid down a marker to Verstappen. He is a decisive, clinical racer who is not to be intimidated.\nVerstappen and Piastri go into the first corner side by side in Saudi Arabia\nDoes Lando Norris need to go sit down with Nico Rosberg to understand how he changed his mentality in his championship year? \u2013 Gary\nIn 2016, Nico Rosberg won the championship by pushing himself to the limit to be able to compete with an essentially faster team-mate in Lewis Hamilton, ensuring he was his best self all the time and hoping that would be enough.\nRosberg was handed a significant advantage with the comparative reliability of the two Mercedes at the start of the season, and even then Hamilton would have clawed the advantage back had he not had an engine failure while leading in Malaysia late in the season.\nThe situation at McLaren this year feels different. In 2024, Norris was decisively the faster and more convincing McLaren driver over the season. In 2025 so far, that has been Piastri.\nNorris is struggling to adapt to certain characteristics of the McLaren - particularly its lack of front grip at certain phases of the corner with his driving style.\nBut he is aware of what he needs to do. As he put it in Jeddah on Sunday: \"It's my qualifying, my Saturdays, which are not good enough at the minute. That's because I am struggling a little bit with the car.\n\"Yesterday was not the car, it was just me trying to take too many risks.\n\"So I just have to peg it back. I've got the pace. It's all in there. It's just sometimes I ask for a bit too much and sometimes I get a bit too 'ego' probably and try to put the perfect lap together. I just need to chill out a little bit.\"\nOf course when the margins are so tight - pole is being decided by hundredths of a second at each race - it's one thing to say that, and another to do it without coming off second best.\nDuring the race in Saudi Arabia, Liam Lawson picked up a 10-second penalty for completing his pass on Jack Doohan off-track, so gained an advantage. Max Verstappen only got five seconds for his off-track advantage. What's the difference between these two? - James\nAs the stewards explained in the verdict on Verstappen: \"Ordinarily, the baseline penalty for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage is 10 seconds.\n\"However, given that this was lap one and a turn one incident, we considered that to be a mitigating circumstance and imposed a five-second time penalty instead.\"\nSo Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.\nWhy can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. drive-through etc) rather than at a pit stop or after the race is completed? \u2013 Neil\nAfter the controversy of the title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi in 2021, it was decided that teams should no longer be able to talk directly to the race director during a grand prix.\nHowever, they can still talk to his assistants in race control and discuss incidents. So when a driver does a manoeuvre that looks borderline, teams have three options.\nThey can choose proactively to give the place back - as McLaren did with Lando Norris against Lewis Hamilton in Bahrain.\nThey can get in touch with race control and ask for an opinion on the move, and then make a decision as to what to do about it.\nOr they can plough on and hope for the best, as Red Bull did in Jeddah.\nThe FIA stewards will then make their decision as to how to handle it. They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.\nOf course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.\nThis is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.\nSome people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. But it is where the sport has landed for now.\nSaudi 'horrible' & 2025 looking 'painful' - Hamilton\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix review\nWilliams have already beaten their 2024 full season points total. What has made them so much better? \u2013 Stewart\nWilliams' progress this season is a direct result of the investment put in by owners Dorilton since they took over in 2020 and the changes to the team made under new boss James Vowles.\nInto last year, the introduction of new factory processes caused a difficult winter, the car barely made the first test and it was overweight for the first chunk of the season.\nThe difference this year was dramatic - their launch was held at Silverstone in public view in mid-February, and they ran the car for the first time there.\nWilliams are very much focused on 2026 and the new rules being introduced then, but as Vowles put it at the launch: \"What I can demonstrate is very clear progress that's taken place in manufacture, process, technology kicking in.\n\"We are moving into a new building this year, a benchmark driver in-the-loop simulator, that was started in 2023. The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it. But I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nBeing on the weight limit sounds like a small detail but is actually a big deal. Last year, it was costing them not far off 0.5 seconds a lap early in the year. Add that to this year's performance, and instead of being the fifth quickest car on average, as they are now, they would be eighth fastest, ahead of only Haas and Sauber.\nOn top of that, Williams now has two world-class drivers rather than just one. And they are not crashing like they were last year.\nAlex Albon ran with the car's improved performance and scored good points in the first three races, while both he and Carlos Sainz were in the top 10 in Saudi Arabia.\nSo, in a nutshell, the team has made progress, they have a better driver line-up and you're seeing it in the performance of the car.\n\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson",

In critical situations such as this, he will do everything he can to keep position, and then force the stewards to make a decision.This is understandable on two levels: first, the advantage of being in front and running in clean air is significant, as the race subsequently showed, and if he ends up being allowed to keep the position, it can win him the race; second, in the past, the stewards have often chosen not to punish him.However, the guidelines have changed this year, after significant pressure from the other drivers, exactly because of the way Verstappen races.This was the first time the new rules have been tested with Verstappen, and this time his approach did not work. They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.Of course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.This is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.Some people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. \"So Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.Why can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. \"Verstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".The guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option.",

It's a real family affair, with Benn's sisters and cousin also joining him in camp.\nHaving spent 12 years of his childhood in Mallorca, Benn speaks fluent Spanish to the locals in the gym.\nWhen the training session begins, however, the laughter stops. There is noticeable shift in mindset \u2013 a sign of just how serious Benn is approaching this fight.\nHe says he is \"leaving no stone unturned\" as he fights for the family name \u2013 and to prove his own worth - in this bloodline rivalry.\n\"I've got a chip on my shoulder about [people] saying I'm the nepo kid, that I had it easy,\" he adds.\nBut this is no longer about fathers. Benn's reputation amongst boxing fans has been stained.\nAlthough he has been cleared to fight by an anti-doping panel, they feel he should be more transparent about the reasons behind the failed test.\nBenn says he has been \"cleared three times\" and is reluctant to dwell on the past. \nNigel, meanwhile, speaks more openly about the impact it had on them both, saying \u00a31m was spent on the legal battles.\nThe former super-middleweight champion says he is not a drinker but would consume \"half a bottle of red wine every night\" during the period as his mental health issues worsened, while his son turned to therapy to get through the dark times.\n\"I was watching my son really crying in my arms, heartbroken. I just knew [he was innocent],\" Nigel adds.\n\"Because [if he was] I would let the public know, I'd say, 'Mate, yeah, sorry mate, he's done this'. But I know he hasn't and I will stand with my son.\"\nNigel Benn was a two-weight world champion during his boxing career\nBenn taps into modern-day training methods by sporting an oxygen mask during cardio to simulate high-altitude training.\nHe expertly talks about nutrition, saying in the past he was \"eating curries and pop-tarts\" after weigh-ins.\nThere is something quite comical about the way he unintentionally reels his past takeaway order in the style of Smithy from sitcom Gavin and Stacey.\n\"I'd have prawn puri for starters, lamb rogan josh, Bombay potatoes with some saag aloo, peshwari naan, all the poppadoms, pilau rice, saag paneer,\" Benn says.\nThere is no doubt he is now living the life of an elite athlete.\nBut so much has happened outside of the ring that we have forgotten, or perhaps never had the opportunity to truly find out, how good a boxer Benn actually is. \nBefore his ban, he was on a roll with early stoppage victories over past-their-prime Chris Algieri and Chris van Heerden.\nHis two fights in America since the cancelled Eubank bout \u2013 points wins over Rodolfo Orozco and Peter Dobson - have been rather unspectacular.\nBenn is a vastly improved fighter from the novice dropped by French journeyman Cedrick Peynaud in 2017.\nHowever, with around 20 amateur bouts in Australia before he turned pro, how costly has the time out of the ring \u2013 not to mention the mental scars inflicted by the doping scandal \u2013 been on Benn's boxing apprenticeship?\nBenn has been sparring the likes of IBF super-middleweight champion William Scull and undefeated middleweight Bruno Surace.\nNigel raves enthusiastically about a particularly \"mind-blowing\" sparring session against an unnamed top-level fighter which left him too excited to sleep.\n\"I'm 99% sure he will [beat Eubank] within four rounds,\" Nigel predicts.\nIs this a case of rose-tinted dad glasses or an unbiased analysis from one of the best British fighters ever?\nWorld-title challenger Eubank has fought at a significantly higher level. Although a stipulation prevents Eubank from gaining more than 10lb on fight night, he is still the more natural at the weight. \n\"Yes, I am jumping up two weight divisions. Yes, that brings its challenges,\" Benn says.\n\"And yes his CV's better, but the difference between me and him is he's lost every time he stepped up. I haven't.\"\nBenn believes that \"people see this as a 50/50\" contest, even though Eubank is the bookmakers' favourite.\n\"I must be delusional or people just don't know what they're dealing with,\" he says.\n\"Because I see it being a one-sided beatdown.

I've played against him when he's firing on all cylinders and it's not fun for me. It's fun for everyone else to watch but it's hard to beat.\n\"Would I be surprised if he started rattling [more majors] off? No. Am I going to be there to try and stop him? Absolutely.\"\nPeople from all walks of life reached out - McIlroy\nR&A 'would love' Trump's Turnberry to host Open\nMcIlroy will have 'unfinished business' at Portrush Open\nMcIlroy's next chance to add to his major tally comes next month in the US PGA Championship. It is being staged from 15-18 May at North Carolina's Quail Hollow - a course he has won at four times.\nHe will then head to Oakmont in Pennsylvania from 12-15 June for the US Open. McIlroy has had six top-10 finishes in the tournament in the past six years, including being runner-up in the past two.\nAnd when he arrives on the Antrim coast for the 153rd staging of golf's oldest major from 17-20 July, he will find the vast majority of the record 278,000 spectators will be supporting both him and Ireland's Shane Lowry, who won the title the last time it was held on the Dunluce Links in 2019.\nThe hype around McIlroy's return to the scene of one of his most disappointing major results - his first drive of the championship careered out of bounds as he posted a quadruple-bogey eight on the opening hole before going on to miss the halfway cut - has only been heightened since his win at Augusta National.\nSchauffele, who will return the Claret Jug to the R&A at the start of the week at Royal Portrush, is hoping to \"use that to my advantage\".\n\"If I can cruise along and fly under the radar, that's exactly what I'll do,\" he added.\nThe 31-year-old has drunk \"wine and tequila\" from the famous old trophy, which has spent most of the year with his parents because \"dad definitely consumes more wine than I do\".\nAnd the Californian is hoping for what he perceives to be traditional UK summer weather to buffet the course - lashing rain and howling wind - during the championship, as happened during his victory at Royal Troon last July.\n\"I'm from San Diego where [the wind] blows a blistering three miles an hour,\" he smiled.\n\"When I think of Open Championship golf, I don't think of it being sunny. I think of people wearing beanies hunkering down, trying everything they can with their caddie to overcome that war that you're at with the golf course.\n\"It's such a validating and rewarding feeling to do it.

        "article_text": "Alex Yee is making his London Marathon debut 10 years after completing the Mini London Marathon for a fifth time\nWhen Alex Yee sits down for post-race dim sum with his family on Sunday, it will represent a poignant full-circle moment.\nThat was the reward Yee, who has Chinese heritage on his father's side, recalls provided the main motivation to run - and twice place third in - the Mini London Marathon as a child.\nIt was not long before the spectacle of the London Marathon captured his imagination and he nagged his parents to help him peer over the barriers for a closer look at the elites.\nBut on Sunday it is Yee, the reigning Olympic and world triathlon champion, whom hundreds of thousands of spectators will hope to catch a glimpse of as he embraces the unknown on the streets of his home city.\n\"As time went on I realised the excitement of the London Marathon, the impact it had and how momentous a day it was,\" Yee tells BBC Sport before his debut over 26.2 miles.\n\"I'm not thinking past the experience but afterwards I'd definitely like to get some dim sum with my family and have that deja vu moment,\" he adds, 10 years on from his last mini marathon.\nThere are certainly less demanding challenges the 27-year-old could have undertaken to provide the mental refresh he sought after a career-defining year. \nBut after capturing triathlon's two biggest prizes fewer than 12 weeks apart, ending his world title wait in October after his spectacular recovery on the banks of the River Seine clinched Olympic gold in Paris in the summer, Yee knew where he wanted to set his sights next.\nNot that he expected his coach to agree to his left-field suggestion.\n\"Definitely not. It's been something I've asked every single year, but it never really made sense,\" says Yee, the most decorated Olympic triathlete in history.\n\"This time we were trying to think what would get me to LA [2028 Olympics] in the best place mentally and physically. It was important to freshen things up.\n\"It's been really exciting to work on my running after five years of trying to make my swim and bike an appropriate level to be competitive in triathlon. It's something I've wanted to do and I'm excited to scratch that itch.\" \nLondon Marathon 2025 - everything you need to know\n'Our daughters will be with us', say dads of Southport victims running London Marathon\nAlex Yee overturned a 15-second deficit to rival Hayden Wilde in the final 2.5km to win a dramatic Olympic men's triathlon gold at Paris 2024\nIt should be no surprise that Yee, an athlete obsessed with the process of improvement as much as the success it brings, has relished this new challenge. \nHe speaks about his first marathon training block with a beaming smile and is not ruling out another in future - although a return to triathlon is scheduled for early 2026 at the latest.\n\"To have something which has given me that purpose to get out of bed, to go out and keep searching for those fine margins, I think that's really rare to find in the first year after an Olympics when you hear of athletes soul searching and not knowing what to do,\" says Yee.\n\"To be an expert on something, you have to be once a fool. That's the way I'm seeing it. I wanted to go in with an open mind and come out the other side as a better runner - but also better holistically.\n\"It's been really interesting to learn from so many people and feel like a novice again.\"\nYee is part of a stellar elite men's field featuring 10 athletes who have run the marathon in under two hours and five minutes, including one of his sporting idols in four-time winner Eliud Kipchoge.\nThere is also Olympic champion Tamirat Tola, defending champion Alexander Mutiso Munyao, and debutant Jacob Kiplimo - who in February became the first person to run a half marathon in under 57 minutes. \nYee's target? Enjoy the experience - and go through halfway in 64 minutes and 30 seconds. \nThat would give him the chance to become only the 10th British man to run under 2:09, while only 22 have broken 2:10.\nRunning is Yee's strongest discipline and he has competed for Great Britain on the track and in cross-country, while his 5km best of 13:26 is the third-fastest ever by a British man.\n\"It would be a massive honour to, hopefully, be in that ballpark of people who have achieved amazing things,\" says Yee.\n\"I think it's going to be an amazing day for the Brits but also a historic day at the front. Hopefully I can say I was part of a sub-two hour marathon race.\"\nAlex Yee will meet Eliud Kipchoge, whose most recent London Marathon victory came in 2019, after Sunday's race\nTo Yee's astonishment, Kipchoge was among those to offer him advice and said in January that he would like to meet and help mentor the Briton when they are in London.\nSo the former mini marathon runner and Kenya's two-time Olympic champion have arranged to meet after the race.\nIn the meantime, Kipchoge, widely regarded as the greatest distance runner of all time, has offered wisdom via WhatsApp - something Yee describes as \"surreal\".\n\"His big piece of advice was to get to the start line. It sounded silly at the time, but after unfortunately seeing people forced to pull out, it's probably the strongest piece of advice of all,\" says Yee.\nThey are likely to have much to discuss. \nBoth are passionate about using the power of sport to inspire, with Yee now keen to utilise his platform as Olympic champion.\nHe intends to provide opportunities to school children through the launch of his own foundation, initially in the south London area he grew up in.\nYee also hopes documenting his marathon journey on YouTube can demonstrate that elite athletes are not \"superhuman\", before he stars on the other side of the barriers he used to watch behind. \n\"The more we share our story I feel like people realise that we're just like anyone else, and there's no reason why they can't dream to achieve what I have - or even so much more,\" says Yee.\n\"You start to feel this urgency with the fortunate position I'm in, being an Olympic champion, that I can and I want to make a difference. \n\"I'm not expecting to leave this big legacy behind. If I can change one person's life, that's good enough for me.\"",

        "article_text": "In April 1983, a German magazine, Stern, and a British newspaper, The Sunday Times, claimed to have made one of the century's most extraordinary historical discoveries. In fact, it was one of the century's most extraordinary hoaxes \u2013 and the scandal that followed cost millions and ruined reputations.\nOn 25 April 1983, 42 years ago this week, respected German magazine Stern published what they believed to be the most spectacular historical scoop: the previously unknown private diaries of Adolf Hitler. To show off their extraordinary exclusive to the world's press, the weekly news magazine had arranged a Hamburg press conference for the same day. The story would indeed dominate global headlines \u2013 but not in the way the magazine hoped.\nThree days earlier, Stern's London editor Peter Wickman had told BBC News that they were \"absolutely convinced\" that they had the authentic Hitler diaries in their hands. \"We were very dubious at the beginning, but we had a graphologist looking at them, we had an expert who compared the paper. We had historians like Professor Trevor-Roper, and they are all convinced they are genuine.\"\nThe handwritten journals ran from 1932 to 1945, covering the entire period of Hitler's Third Reich. \"There are 60 diaries, they look a bit like school exercise books but with a hard cover. They have seals outside with a swastika and an eagle and inside, of course, Hitler's very spidery gothic handwriting,\" Wickman told the BBC.\nStern believed that their discovery had the potential to rewrite what was previously known about the Nazi leader. And the diaries' content was certainly eye-opening, revealing a little-known sensitive side to the F\u00fchrer. They detailed everything from Hitler's battles with flatulence and halitosis, and the pressure from his girlfriend Eva Braun to get Olympics tickets, to notes about sending Stalin \u2013 \"the old fox\" \u2013 a birthday telegram. The notebooks also seemed to indicate, somewhat startlingly, that the Nazi leader was unaware of the Holocaust that was being carried out in his name.\u00a0\nThe journals had supposedly been unearthed by Stern journalist Gerd Heidemann. The reporter was already regarded around Stern as something of a Nazi memorabilia obsessive. In 1973, the magazine had assigned him to write a story about a dilapidated yacht which had once belonged to Hitler's second-in-command, Hermann G\u00f6ring. Heidemann spent a fortune buying the yacht and restoring it. He also began an affair with G\u00f6ring's daughter Edda, who introduced him to a number of former Nazis. It was through these contacts, Heidemann said, that he had come across Hitler's diaries.\nHeidemann claimed that the plane had been carrying the diaries, which were salvaged from the crash and stowed away in a hayloft. In the intervening years, they had found their way to an East German collector who was now offering to sell them. The reporter would negotiate the deal to buy them, acting as intermediary between his East German source and Stern.\nThe promise of a sensational world exclusive, providing previously unknown insight into the mind of the Nazi dictator, proved irresistible to the magazine. But Stern was determined to keep a tight grip on who knew about their scoop, so when they hired handwriting experts to authenticate the diaries \u2013 providing them with \"genuine\" Hitler documents for comparison \u2013 they would only give them a few selected pages of the notebooks to look at. Stern ultimately forked out some 9.3 million Deutschmarks (\u00a32.3m) for the volumes, and, having paid such an exorbitant sum, opted to store them in a Swiss vault for safekeeping.\nThe first historian to examine the diaries was Prof Hugh Trevor-Roper, also known as Lord Dacre of Glanton. In 1947, he had written a book, The Last Days of Hitler, which had brought him a great deal of academic prestige, and he was regarded as a leading expert on the Nazi dictator. He was also an independent director of The Times newspaper, which two years earlier had been acquired along with its sister paper, The Sunday Times, by Rupert Murdoch.\nLord Dacre was initially sceptical about the diaries, but flew to Switzerland to view them. His opinion began to be swayed when he heard the diaries' origin story and was told, erroneously, that chemical tests had found them to be pre-war. But what really tipped the balance for the historian was seeing the huge volume of material involved.\u00a0\n\"The thing that struck Hugh Trevor-Roper most forcefully and certainly struck me as a non-expert when I saw the original material was the sheer scale of it,\" The Times editor Charles Douglas-Home told the BBC on 22 April 1983. \"The enormous range of this archive. It's not just that there are nearly 60 volumes of notebooks filled out in Hitler's longhand which is there, there are about 300 of his drawings and pictures and personal documents such as his party card. I remember there are the drawings which he submitted to art school when he was a young man hoping to get into art school, and there is a painting, an oil painting and so on. Now a forger would have to be very good to forge across that whole range.\"\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\u00a0\nLord Dacre became convinced that the journals were genuine, even writing an article for The Times vouching for their authenticity and declaring that historic events might need to be re-evaluated in light of them. As word got out about the Hitler diaries, a bidding war developed over their serialisation rights, with The Sunday Times proprietor, Murdoch, flying over to Zurich to negotiate a deal in person.\nWith serialisation deals signed, Stern hastily planned a press conference to announce the publication of Hitler's diaries to the world. But even before the notebooks' grand reveal, doubts were being raised about their veracity \u2013 not least by the staff of The Sunday Times themselves, who had been burnt before. In 1968, the newspaper had made a down payment on diaries supposedly written by the Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini, which had also been vouched for, by his son no less. \"But they turned out to be fakes devised by two little old ladies who lived in Vercelli outside Milan,\" journalist Phillip Knightley, who worked for The Sunday Times's investigative team, told Witness History in 2011.\nHowever, Murdoch was certain about the diaries and, despite the reservations of its editor, Frank Giles, rushed the serialisation into print in The Sunday Times with the headline \"world exclusive\" the day before Stern's press announcement.\nGiles rang Lord Dacre seeking reassurance about the story only to have the historian confess that he was not so much having doubts as making \"a 180-degree turn\" regarding the diaries' authenticity. \"Everybody in the room, all the newspaper executives slumped down in their chairs and put their heads in their hands because we had lost our principal authenticator,\" said Knightley. \"It was clear that the story was absolutely wrong.\"\nThe Sunday Times could still have stopped the presses and changed the front page. But when Giles rang the proprietor, \"Murdoch said, 'Just because Dacre has been vacillating for all this time, screw him, we'll publish,'\" recalls Knightley.\nFor Stern, things would just get worse at its\u00a0news conference\u00a0the next day. After editor-in-chief Peter Koch declared that he was \"100% convinced that Hitler wrote every single word in those books\", Lord Dacre, the very historian who had vouched they were the real deal, admitted under questioning that he was having second thoughts.\nTo the horrified looks of the Stern executives, Lord Dacre said that he wasn't able to establish a link between the plane crash and the alleged diaries and that he had been rushed into making a judgement. \"I must say as a historian, I regret that the normal methods of historical verification have, perhaps necessarily, been to some extent sacrificed to the requirements of the journalistic scoop,\" he said.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The true story of The Great Escape\n\u2022 The British politician who faked his own death\n\u2022 How Oskar Schindler saved 1,200 Jewish people in WW2\nThe day after the chaotic press conference, Charles Hamilton, a US autographs dealer, told BBC Breakfast that as soon he saw the diaries' pages he \"could smell the ebullient odour of forgeries\". Hamilton said that he knew the signature wasn't authentic because he was constantly offered fake Hitler documents. \"Shortly it will be established without any question, and without any panel of experts which I think is superfluous at the present time, the whole affair will die down and it will be a great hoax in the history of mankind,\" he said.\nAnd he was not wrong. Within two weeks, rigorous forensic analysis had exposed the diaries as fakes. Not only, as Hamilton had pointed out to the BBC, was Hitler's supposed signature not accurate, but chemical testing revealed that their paper, glue and ink were not manufactured until after World War Two. The diaries were peppered with errors, modern-day phrases and historical inaccuracies, sometimes referring to information that Hitler could not have possibly known.\nIn the wake of these revelations The Sunday Times quickly abandoned its serialisation and printed an apology. Stern also publicly apologised for having fallen for the hoax.\nUnder pressure, Heidemann revealed that the East German source supplying the diaries was Konrad Kujau \u2013 a counterfeiter who turned out to be the author of the works. Kujau was a skilled artist, but his forgeries were far from sophisticated. Seeking inspiration, he had plagiarised large parts of Max Domarus's book Hitler: Speeches and Proclamations 1932-1945, and as a result had copied word for word some of the chronological and factual mistakes in that book's first edition. To try to give the journals a more personal feel, he had imagined a more prosaic side to the F\u00fchrer's life, throwing in entries like \"I can't even get off work and visit Eva\", \"Have to go to the post office, to send a few telegrams\", and \"Eva says I have bad breath\". Kujau had even struggled with the elaborate Gothic initials he used on the diary covers, accidentally sticking the initials FH to them instead of AH. He had then attempted to age the notebooks by merely pouring tea over them and bashing them on his desk.\u00a0\nWhat helped with the initial authentication of the diaries was that Kujau was such a prolific forger of Nazi memorabilia that many of the \"genuine\" documents Stern had given to experts, to enable them to compare Hitler's handwriting, had actually also been produced by Kujau himself. He was arrested by the police and admitted to his role in the hoax. He even went so far as to demonstrate his guilt by writing his confession in the style of Hitler's handwriting. In 1985, he was found guilty of fraud and forgery and sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison.\u00a0\nOn further investigation, the police found Heidemann had also inflated the prices he said his source was requesting for the diaries, and had been skimming money off the top of the sums paid by Stern. He seems to have done this to fund his lavish lifestyle, the upkeep of his Nazi yacht and his penchant for buying ever more dictators' memorabilia (he would later claim to possess Idi Amin's underwear). He, like Kujau, was convicted in 1985 of fraud and was sentenced to four years, eight months. At his trial, Heidemann maintained that he too had been duped, but Kujau always insisted that the reporter knew the diaries were fakes.\u00a0\nIn the fallout from the scandal, Lord Dacre's reputation as a historian would be permanently tarnished. Koch and another of Stern's editors would lose their jobs, while Giles would be removed from his role as The Sunday Times editor. Even Murdoch would later claim to the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics in 2012 that his decision to run with the story \"was a major mistake I made, I take full responsibility for it. I will have to live with it for the rest of my life.\"\nHowever, his newspaper's circulation was boosted by his decision to print the false story. And since Murdoch had insisted on a clause that Stern return all the money paid to it by The Sunday Times if the diaries were shown to be fake, the media mogul would only profit financially from the hoax.\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher.\nIn European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax was down around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%.\nThough the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence. \nThe dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022.\nInterest rates on US government debt also continued to rise on Tuesday, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries.\nMeanwhile, the price of gold hit a new all-time record high, breaking the $3,500 (\u00a32,613) per ounce mark as investors seek out so-called \"safe haven\" assets.\nThe precious metal is viewed as a safer place to put money during times of economic uncertainty.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said as well as tariffs, gold's appeal had also increased due there being \"no long-term resolution in sight for conflicts around the world, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza\".\n\"There are also concerns about the risk that geo-political tensions escalate as opportunities in the Arctic are eyed by the US and Russia,\" she added.\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs.\nThe latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy.\nTrump last week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\"\nSuch a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank.\nPowell last year told reporters he did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him. \nBut one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.\n\nTrump's latest comments come as top economic policymakers are gathering in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\nChristopher Meissner, a professor of economics at University of California, Davis, and who formerly worked with the IMF, told the BBC's Today programme that before the 1970s there was \"significant\" political pressure on the Federal Reserve from time to time.\n\"However, the past 30 or 40 years what we've learned is that central bank independence is the key to financial stability and low inflation. And I think this is a major reversal and we have to watch out for it,\" he added.\n\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" added Ms Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThe IMF will publish its latest growth forecasts for individual countries later, and last week it said these projections would include \"notable markdowns\".\nMr Meissner said: \"They used to say 'When the US sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold'. It'll be really curious to see if that continues.\n\"However, I think people are expecting a pretty significant downturn in the US in the coming months... and that can't be good for the rest of the world.\"\nMs Streeter said that Trump's policies had damaged the reputation of the US, which is \"no longer being seen as a calmer port in a storm\".\n\"Yields on 10\u2013year US Treasuries have held onto their recent rise above 4.4%. It's another sign of unease about the direction of the US economy, amid worries that policies playing out could keep inflation higher and slow growth, and flags the anxiety rattling through the markets right now,\" she added.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Fr Jorge Bergoglio often described Ireland affectionately as \"the green country\", recalling his first impressions of its landscape when, in 1980, he spent a short sabbatical in Dublin trying to improve his English.\nWhen the Argentinian priest made a return visit, in August 2018, he was known by a different name: Pope Francis.\nThe Vatican confirmed that Pope Francis died at the age of 88 on Easter Monday. \nDuring the 2018 visit, he became only the second pope in the church's history to set foot on Irish soil.\nJohn Paul II, who visited in 1979 at the height of the Troubles, famously told a crowd of 300,000 people in Drogheda: \"On my knees, I beg you to turn away from the paths of violence and return to the ways of peace.\"\nNearly 40 years later, at a state reception in Dublin Castle, Pope Francis lauded the work of those who negotiated the Good Friday Agreement and expressed his \"firm hope that the peace process will overcome every remaining obstacle and help give birth to a future of harmony, reconciliation and mutual trust\".\nHowever, the former Irish President Mary McAleese said the Pope \"took wrong advice\" when planning his visit to Dublin by not visiting Northern Ireland.\nIt was \"completely wrong-headed,\" she told BBC's Evening Extra programme.\n\"He should have gone,\" she added.\n\"The leaders of the protestant churches had invited him to Northern Ireland. Itself a wonderful, miraculous thing, and he didn't go... At the time there was no government in place in Northern Ireland and that might have weighed heavily in the thinking, but I also just think he got bad advice.\"\nArchbishop Eamon Martin, the primate of All Ireland, says the Pope often asked for updates on the Irish peace process when they met.\n\"He had a great interest in how things were in Northern Ireland, and how well the peace was developing. And he asked if he could make a message to Ireland to commend us on the journey of peace that we have taken and to encourage us to persevere on that road.\"\nArchbishop Martin believes that commitment to peace inspired the Pope's choice of papal name.\n\"He chose the name Francis, of course, and it was a daring thing to do.  He was the first Pope ever to use the name of the great Saint Francis of Assisi. \n\"And that message of peace, of praising God in creation, the message of brotherhood and sisterhood\u2014of fraternity\u2014characterised the pontificate of Pope Francis.\"\nBut between those two papal visits \u2014 from John Paul's passionate pleading for peace to Francis's endorsement of an historic peace process \u2014 Ireland had changed almost beyond recognition.\nA country once seen as a citadel of global Catholicism had seen plummeting church attendance as the moral credibility of bishops and priests was undermined by the twin forces of secularisation and the clerical abuse crisis.\nIn welcoming the Pope, then Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar told him Ireland was a more diverse, less religious place, a country which understood that \"marriages do not always work, that women should make their own decisions, and that families come in many different, wonderful forms, including those headed by a grandparent, lone parent or same-sex parents, or parents who are divorced\".\nAs Ireland's first gay head of government, Varadkar seemed to embody the social transformation he was describing.\nThe taoiseach also called for a \"new relationship between church and state\", urging the Pope to address the \"history of sorrow and shame\" laid bare by the abuse of vulnerable children.\nHours later, Francis met eight survivors of clerical abuse for 90 minutes at the Vatican embassy in Dublin.\nAt the final Mass in Phoenix Park the next day, the Pope recalled that meeting and then offered a series of apologies, written in his own hand, for the \"crimes\" of clerical abuse and made a public plea for forgiveness.\nFr Timothy Bartlett, who had a key role in planning the Pope's visit, says this \"penitential act\" was \"the most profound, eloquent and developed apology to those who had been hurt by abuse in the church\".\n\"I am absolutely satisfied that historians will look back at that and regard it as one of the most profound apologies ever given on this issue.\"\nIt was Fr Bartlett who gave the Pope the sheet of paper he used to pen that historic apology on the flight from the Knock Shrine to the Irish capital.\n\"I think it will go down as one of the most eloquent, personal and profound acknowledgements of all of that issue and hurt,\" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme on Monday.\n\"He had been dealing with all these other things, but he stayed attentive to the victims of abuse he had met the night before.\n\"That was what was dominant in his mind.\"\nArchbishop Martin thinks it is also significant that Pope Francis asked to meet with homeless people at the Capuchin Day Centre in Dublin.\n\"Pope Francis always exercised a preferential option for the poor, for those on the peripheries, for those who were not only poor materially, but who were excluded from society, or indeed from the church.\n\"He wanted to walk to them, to accompany them. I think that made him fearless in speaking quite prophetically to the church, to society and to the global world.\"\nWhen the Pope completed his 32-hour visit to Ireland, he returned to his home in Rome, where he had chosen to live amongst others in a Vatican guesthouse, rather than reside in the solitary splendour of the Apostolic Palace.\nMore than once, he publicly criticised bishops who spent large sums of money to support a lavish lifestyle. And he warned new cardinals not to see themselves as \"princes of the church\", but rather as servants.\n\"Humility\", the Pope would later say, \"is the gateway to all virtues.\"\nIt was this personal modesty that impressed so many who met Pope Francis\u2014even those outside the Catholic fold.\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Gavin Robinson told BBC News NI that Pope Francis \"injected a level of humility that we don't often recognise within the Catholic Church, that you don't see through the opulence of St Peter's Basilica, Rome, the Vatican, the state that it is\". \n\"No flashy cars, no flashy suits, no flashy shoes. He was somewhat different and he brought the sort of early principles of Christian faith that I would recognise into a role that I see quite far apart from that. \n\"So he wanted to do things differently. He seemed a more gentle, humble, engaging, caring individual.\"",
