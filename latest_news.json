Instead, Buttler resigned with a smile, his mate by his side, leaving McCullum searching for a new lieutenant.\nEngland's fall from the white-ball summit has been stark and there are issues aplenty to face...\n'Last rites and alarm bells drown out England's good vibes'\nEngland bowler Wood may need knee surgery\nThe first is the most obvious - finding Buttler's replacement.\nHarry Brook is the overwhelming favourite given he is the current deputy, impressed when standing in for the five-match one-day international series against Australia last September and is regularly praised by coaches and team-mates for his smart 'cricket brain'.\nBut appointing the 26-year-old would bring its own challenges.\nThere is less crossover ahead in England's multi-format schedule, but playing every white-ball match and being a Test regular would require Keely Hodgkinson's stamina.\nMcCullum has already accepted he will have to miss tours, having taken charge of the Test and limited-overs sides. If Brook were named skipper, he would surely have to do the same.\nThe alternative is turning to a white-ball specialist, but Adil Rashid, 37, is too old and Liam Livingstone and Phil Salt too insecure in the XI. Sam Curran has Indian Premier League captaincy experience, but is currently out of the side.\nRecalling a specialist captain like James Vince or Sam Billings is surely a non-starter.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nBoth Buttler and McCullum were keen to stress the resignation is not the end of the 34-year-old's England career.\n\"I'm sure we will look at ways that we can get the best out of him in terms of his role, so he can have maximum impact as well,\" said the former Black Caps skipper.\nYet Buttler the batter is in need of reinvigoration. He has scored only two 50s in ODIs since September 2023, but an example to follow is not hard to find.\n\"Hopefully now I can follow Joe Root's lead and play like he has since he relinquished the captaincy,\" Buttler said of his team-mate, who gave up the Test job and scored centuries in three of his next four Tests.\nButtler cannot continue as a non-captaining, non-bowling number six in the modern game, meaning some imagination is required.\nMcCullum and Buttler created a new role for Jamie Smith in this tournament - a powerplay-attacking number three that has resulted in Smith twice being dismissed cheaply by poor shots.\nPerhaps, a revitalised Buttler is actually the ideal man for that.\nThis one is English cricket's long-standing problem.\nWhen England focus on the Test side, the white-ball team struggles. When they give priority to those in a coloured kit, the red-ball side lurches towards review-inducing crisis.\nThat Buttler has rarely had his best players available is the caveat that should go down alongside a tournament record that reads one title and three sorry exits.\nMcCullum's first act as white-ball leader has been to bring the two sides closer together. Smith, Ben Duckett, Brydon Carse and Gus Atkinson are all Test players given limited-overs opportunities. The results cannot be deemed a success.\nEngland will play only 10 Tests this year, having played 17 in 2024, and McCullum does not sound ready for change.\n\"Most other teams manage that, if you look at India's players and how they play cross-formats, look at Australia's fast bowling line-up, New Zealand are similar,\" he said.\n\"I'm hopeful that with some shrewd planning and a better understanding of what our player pool looks like, we'll be able to make sure we can get it across all formats, because that's ultimately what people that follow this team deserves.\"\nThe damage caused by England's Champions Trophy campaign may not be consigned to three matches in eight days in Pakistan.\nMark Wood's knee injury could yet have serious consequences for their quest to regain the Ashes this winter.\nIf, as feared, he requires surgery, there have to be genuine concerns about how well the fast bowler can recover from going under the knife again aged 35.\nWood was picked for this tournament as part the current set-up's pace obsession.\nThat he, Jofra Archer, Jamie Overton, Atkinson and Saqib Mahmood - all capable of bowling at least 88mph - were picked is part of McCullum's plan to make fast bowling one of the USPs of English cricket. Again, this plan has not worked here.\nMcCullum will have half an eye on the next 50-over World Cup in southern Africa where fast, bouncy pitches should suit the ploy, but a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka comes before then.\nWho is the new-ball metronome to be the TikTok generation's Chris Woakes? Who will take middle-over wickets like Liam Plunkett or offer support to Archer at the death?\nAnd spinner Rashid's replacement looks as far away as ever\u2026\nThat takes us to another issue that continues to disadvantage England. They have to find a generation of 50-over cricketers from a pool who are not playing the format.\nThe Hundred is not going anywhere. England need to find a solution to the problems it has caused rather than just throw their arms into the air.\nThe main issue is not giving youngsters a taste of 50-over cricket - the One-Day Cup will continue to do that while it is played as a development competition alongside The Hundred - but instead ensuring the talents spotted have enough competitive, challenging cricket to aid their progression afterwards.\nThis is where the Lions programme will be crucial.\nJacob Bethell, Jordan Cox, Tom Hartley and Carse all played in the Lions' last ODI in February 2023 and have gone on to varying degrees of success on the international stage.\nAnother solution would be to move the One-Day Cup and give England an advantage over their rivals.\nNo nation's players are currently playing a good amount of domestic one-day cricket. Were England to find a way, their rebuild could gain a jump start.",

        "article_text": "These were already turbulent times in Romania.\nBut as people here navigate the late winter ice and slush on Bucharest's elegant streets, the abrupt departure of the Tate brothers by private jet has left a fresh trail of confusion and unanswered questions in its wake.\nA country grappling with a cancelled presidential election, its future in Europe, its support for neighbouring Ukraine, widespread corruption, and collapsing faith in public institutions, is now left pondering why two controversial foreigners, facing a raft of complex but serious criminal charges, have been treated with such apparent lenience; their confiscated assets and their passports suddenly returned to them.\nWas a secret deal done between Romania's government and the Trump administration? If so, in these increasingly transactional times, what does Romania get in return? Or was this more like a pre-emptive gesture of good will towards the American president, a gift to lay at Donald Trump's imperious feet?\nOr are we searching for conspiracies when the truth is probably far more chaotic?\nAs foreign leaders \u2013 from Volodymyr Zelensky to Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 travel to Washington DC bearing deals and other apparent peace offerings, one might ask who could blame Romania, a staunch NATO ally navigating a host of internal and external challenges, for trying to keep an increasingly unpredictable US administration on side?\n\"It's a matter of life (or death) for Romania,\" said security analyst George Scutaru, describing his country's need to shore up Western support in the face of growing pressure from the Kremlin. \nDeclining to comment on the Tate issue specifically, Scutaru said it was clear Moscow was seeking to undermine Romania's democracy and that the government had good reason to seek ways to remind the Trump administration of the many advantages \u2013 commercial, diplomatic, and military \u2013 of continuing to back it.\nBut if the Tate brothers are part of that equation, it is already clear that many Romanians are not impressed.\nThis is a country already facing a strong populist backlash against an elite ruling class that is widely seen as corrupt and out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people who feel treated as second-class citizens \u2013 a mere source of cheap labour - within the European Union.\nSo, the sight of the Tates appearing to receive special treatment plays into the notion that Romania's institutions are hollow and cater only to those with money.\n\"For me, what has happened is unacceptable. We cannot allow Romania's image to be tarnished by impunity and defiance,\" fumed Elena Lasconi, a prominent presidential candidate here, expressing deep concern that Romanian prosecutors' sudden decision to relax the Tates' travel restrictions was the result of \"external influence.\"\n\"It's my personal perception that probably there is\u2026 pressure on the Romanian political system, as logically the prosecutor would have applied very strict rules to control (the Tates) and probably the United States would have been a place where they would be allowed to travel (due to concerns they would not be extradited if they failed to return),\" said  international human rights lawyer, Silvia Tabusca.\nIt is beyond doubt that Andrew Tate's lucrative brand of assertive masculinity has earned him allies in President Trump's administration. One of his former lawyers, Paul Ingrassia, now works in the White House. \nMany in the so-called \"manosphere\" see Tate as a persecuted hero who has just been rescued from Romania's corrupt clutches.\nThere is also a more nebulous far-right alignment between some pro-Trump and pro-Tate figures in the US, far-right and allegedly pro-Russian forces in Romania, and the Kremlin itself, which stands accused of plotting to weaken Bucharest's pro-western stance.\nBut the picture is not clear cut.\nPresident Trump distanced himself from the brothers' case on Thursday and there are signs of a broader push-back in the US, with the governor of Florida Ron DeSantis making it clear the Tates are \"not welcome\" in his state, amid plans to open a \"preliminary inquiry\" into allegations against them of human trafficking and violence against women.\nMeanwhile in Bucharest, the theory that Romania's government cut a deal with the US to release the brothers is treated with caution by some analysts.\n\"I think the chances (of such a deal) are fifty-fifty,\" said Sorin Ionita, a political commentator, questioning the ability of Romania's various institutions and ministries to arrange a \"coherent\" policy concerning the Tates.\n\"I'm not sure they coordinate. Did they manage to demand something in exchange (from the US)? I'm not sure,\" said Ionita, bemoaning a situation almost designed to persuade Romania's public to lose faith in state institutions, and speculating that lower level \"satellite\" figures in an equally chaotic Trump administration were probably behind any deal in order \"to extract money from the Tate brothers.\" The BBC has seen no evidence of this.\n\"It's very depressing to see,\" he added.\nAs for the question of whether the Tates will return to Romania, as their lawyer has promised, to continue their legal battles, a degree of uncertainty endures.\nThe fact that most of their assets have been unfrozen could be seen as weakening the Romanian authorities' ability to compel them to come back. The Tates themselves have also questioned whether they can receive a fair trial in Romania, complaining of a \"conspiracy\" against them.\nAnd while Andrew Tate pointed out on Thursday that he and his brother currently face \"no active indictment\" in Romania, a more accurate way of describing their situation might be to say there is currently a lull in a long and complex legal process. An initial case has been returned to prosecutors for amendments, while a second and more substantial prosecution case against them is now pending.\n\"In the second case, we have 34 victims that cooperate and have been identified as victims. Among them are two minors, one a 17-year-old girl that has been recruited in order to be exploited by the criminal group. And the second girl is 15-years-old, and there is a crime for sexual acts with a minor in which they are also involved,\" said the lawyer, Silvia Tabusca, outlining the allegations in the second case. \nThe brothers also face arrest on separate and unrelated criminal charges in the UK. The Tates deny any wrongdoing in all these cases.\nIn the coming months, Romania faces far more pressing challenges than the fate of two foreign celebrities. Presidential elections have been rescheduled for May and a leading candidate \u2013 often accused of being a Kremlin puppet - has just been detained and is facing six criminal charges including fascism and undermining the constitutional order.\nWith their self-declared misogyny, extreme views, and online personas, Andrew and Tristan Tate do chime with some of the themes preoccupying and dividing society in America and far beyond. \nClearly, they remain influential figures, particularly among boys and young men. But the brothers face years of legal battles which may well push them, and their still lucrative brand, further to the periphery of the far larger dramas now reshaping our world.",

Or was this more like a pre-emptive gesture of good will towards the American president, a gift to lay at Donald Trump's imperious feet?Or are we searching for conspiracies when the truth is probably far more chaotic?Minister questions why Tate brothers were allowed to leave RomaniaDid the White House help end the Tate brothers travel ban?Andrew Tate: The self-proclaimed misogynistAs foreign leaders \u2013 from Volodymyr Zelensky to Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 travel to Washington DC bearing deals and other apparent peace offerings, one might ask who could blame Romania, a staunch NATO ally navigating a host of internal and external challenges, for trying to keep an increasingly unpredictable US administration on side? Declining to comment on the Tate issue specifically, Scutaru said it was clear Moscow was seeking to undermine Romania's democracy and that the government had good reason to seek ways to remind the Trump administration of the many advantages \u2013 commercial, diplomatic, and military \u2013 of continuing to back it.But if the Tate brothers are part of that equation, it is already clear that many Romanians are not impressed.This is a country already facing a strong populist backlash against an elite ruling class that is widely seen as corrupt and out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people who feel treated as second-class citizens \u2013 a mere source of cheap labour - within the European Union.So, the sight of the Tates appearing to receive special treatment plays into the notion that Romania's institutions are hollow and cater only to those with money.Getty ImagesThe brothers were released from house arrest by a Romanian court in January\"For me, what has happened is unacceptable.",

        "article_text": "Amanda Pritchard, head of NHS England, would have regular Monday meetings with Health Secretary Wes Streeting to review performance and address challenges. But last Monday was different. After discussing the state of the health service, she announced she was stepping down - with just one month's notice.\nIt came as a shock to many in the organisation, under which there are 1.4 million staff who deal with 1.7 million patients everyday. But those in the know had suspected something was happening - though not the timing.\nThat meeting between Pritchard and Streeting was the natural conclusion of changes which had been rumbling on in the corridors of power for some time.\nNHS England was given autonomy by the then-Conservative Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in 2013. The aim was to free the organisation from interference by politicians.\nUnder Sir Simon Stevens - now Lord Stevens - NHS England developed into what looked like a rival power base and led by an alternative health secretary. He was at the heart of work drawing up long-term NHS plans under David Cameron and Theresa May. Lord Stevens knew his way around Whitehall and knew how to win backroom battles with ministers.\nAmanda Pritchard had been deputy to Lord Stevens since 2019 and played a vital role in the NHS response to the pandemic, including the vaccine roll-out. It had seemed inevitable she would take over the top job in 2021. Understandably, she expected to continue in the same vein as her predecessor. But with the arrival of a Labour government last year that certainty began to weaken.\nThe first clue that things would be going back to a more traditional management regime, with more direct government control, came when two health experts were appointed from previous Labour governments: Alan Milburn, Blair's health secretary, and Paul Corrigan, an adviser. It became clear that they would be involved in shaping policy with Wes Streeting.\nOne well-placed health source said those two \"remembered the old days\", before the NHS's shift to autonomy, which they felt made the system \"too bureaucratic\".\nAnother clue came when work began on a new NHS 10-year plan for England. With previous plans Lord Stevens had \"held the pen\", but this time the government brought in Sally Warren from the King's Fund think tank - outside NHS England management - to head up the the work.\nAt the same time, noises were being made about slimming down NHS England management - and instead devolving money to local health boards and patient services. Government sources deny that NHS England is being subsumed into the health department but say it will have a \"leaner\" role, cutting out duplication.\nAmanda Pritchard was well aware of the direction of travel. She could see that her job was going to change and had considered stepping down later this year. There has been no suggestion of any row or confrontation with Wes Streeting.\nNHS officials say that the decision to leave at the end of March was because it will be the end of a financial year - and there was no need to stay for the launch of the 10-year plan in the early summer.\nIn January Ms Pritchard had a bruising experience at the hands of two parliamentary select committees. One suggested she and colleagues were \"complacent\" and another said they were disappointed with \"lengthy and diffuse answers\". In a BBC interview she admitted that \"we're not all brilliant performers at committee hearings\" but it was right to be scrutinised. Privately, according to sources, she found the process \"frustrating given how much time she had given to the role\" under some of the most difficult years in the history of the NHS.\nShe will be replaced by Sir Jim Mackey, an experienced NHS trust boss, who is being titled the \"transition\" chief executive. Policy will be run by Wes Streeting's department with Sir Jim, we are told, focusing on delivery including cutting the hospital waiting list of nearly 7.5 million. He had recently helped draft a recovery plan for planned treatment and appointments.\nSo where does all this leave the NHS?\nOn one hand, Amanda Pritchard has provided consistent leadership in various roles under six different health secretaries. The autonomy of NHS England enabled its chief executive to bang the drum for the health service and pressure the government.\nBut on the other hand, serious problems remain with patient outcomes and those closer to Streeting argue more direct government control means less bureaucracy, and the ability to free up resources to deploy where needed.\nOne health source argued that the upcoming changes would end confusion over policy and strategy and encourage collaboration between ministers and NHS England - without being a formal takeover. But another suggested it was \"a bit of a mess\" and there could now be instability and distractions for NHS administrators when they need to focus on wider health challenges.\nMuch will depend on how much money is allocated in the Treasury spending review.\nIt's patients that matter - and it's not yet clear whether or not these changes will help them.",

        "article_text": "UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has met US President Donald Trump during his first visit to the White House. \nHere are some of the key moments as the pair took questions from reporters before and after the talks. \nSir Keir did not turn up to the meeting empty-handed. \nPart way through their opening remarks, the prime minister reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles III - an invitation for a second state visit.\nTrump appeared to be genuinely taken back for a few seconds, asking: \"Am I supposed to read it right now?\"\nAfter taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an \"honour\" to visit the \"fantastic\" country.\nHe added that King Charles was a \"beautiful man, a wonderful man\".\nDuring Trump's first term as president, he met King Charles's mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, during a three-day state visit in 2019.\nSir Keir said Thursday's invitation to host Trump once more for a second full state visit was \"unprecedented\".\nWhile cordial, the initial meeting in the Oval Office between Sir Keir and Trump left no doubt that the US president hoped to be firmly in charge.\nThe meeting was a pattern we've now seen six times with foreign leaders at the Trump White House, including with French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this week: Trump taking control of the room and using the opportunity to get his own messages, both domestic and international, across to the reporters there.\nDuring their half-hour session, Trump leaned forward and slightly towards Sir Keir - wearing a nearly identical, but slightly different coloured tie to Trump's -  dominating the conversation and taking charge of calling on reporters.\nA joint afternoon news conference later began with a slightly more diplomatic and matter-of-fact tone, with both Trump and Sir Keir standing at their respective lecterns and going to considerable lengths to lavish praise on the other. \nTrump joked he would have been president 20 years ago with Sir Keir's \"beautiful\" accent. \nAt one point, Sir Keir was asked about Trump's controversial call to make Canada \u2013 a member of the Commonwealth \u2013 the 51st state of the US.\n\"I think you're trying to find a divide that doesn't exist,\" Sir Keir replied.\nTrump interjected quickly with the words \"that's enough\" before moving on \u2013 again taking control of the room as he stood next to a visibly surprised Sir Keir.\nTo put it gently, Sir Keir and Trump are from different schools of politics - both in their style and substance.\nBut asked to name their similarities Trump said: \"He loves his country, and so do I.\"\nWhat else do they share? Trump said \"we like each other, frankly, and we like each other's country\".\nBut the \"common thread\" between the two men was that \"we love our country\", Trump said.\nSir Keir had a number of tricky topics to raise with Trump - from trade to US security guarantees for Ukraine - and at the beginning of their news conference he called his counterpart \"a very tough negotiator\". \nAsked if the prime minister had convinced him not to impose trade tariffs on the UK, Trump said \"he tried\", adding: \"He was working hard, I'll tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.\"\nBut he has said there was \"a very good chance\" of a trade deal \"where tariffs wouldn't be necessary\". \nSuch a deal, Trump said, could be made \"pretty quickly\". \nSir Keir spoke of a \"new economic deal with advanced technology at its core\". \nTrump said he was \"inclined to go along with\" the UK's Chagos Islands deal.\nThe UK is in talks with Mauritius about handing over the territory but continuing to lease one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which contains a UK-US military airbase.\nThe agreement has been mired in uncertainty after Trump's re-election as US president, given several US Republicans have argued it could deliver a potential security boost to China.\nBut during the meeting, Trump said he had a \"feeling\" the deal was going to \"work out very well\".\nLast week, Trump made headlines by calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a \"dictator\" in a social media post, echoing Russian claims about Kyiv's cancelled elections.\nAn election was scheduled for May 2024, but it was suspended because Ukraine has been under martial law since Russia began its full-scale invasion.\nAsked by the BBC's Chris Mason about his use of the word \"dictator\", Trump replied: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that.\"\nIn the news conference later, Trump also appeared to have softened his attitude to Zelensky, praising him as \"very brave\" and saying the pair got on \"really well\". \nTalking about the potential for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, Trump said \"progress towards peace\" would continue when Zelensky visits the White House on Friday. The two are expected to sign a major minerals deal.\nAt the Munich Security Conference last week, US Vice President JD Vance attacked the UK and other European democracies, warning that \"free speech is in retreat.\"\nAsked about the comments, Trump called on his deputy to defend himself. Vance argued \"there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British\" but also \"American technology companies and by extension, American citizens\".\nThat led to Sir Kier cutting in, saying \"we've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom - and it will last for a very, very long time\".\nHe rejected Vance's claim, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there\".",

The new, wide-ranging deals with Beijing have led to protests on Rarotonga - the largest Cook Island - and a vote of no confidence against Brown in parliament, which he survived earlier this week. They have also worried Australia, another powerful ally. \nNew Zealand said it was \"blindsided\" by the China deals, but Brown believes his country is independent and does not need to consult Wellington on issues he says are of no concern to them.\nHe has, nevertheless, tried to reassure Australia and New Zealand that the deals with China don't replace their relationships. But the apparent snub comes at a time when the West's grip on the Pacific seems to be loosening. \nThe rise of China in the Pacific isn't new. Whether it's bagging a security deal in the Solomon Islands or providing medical services in Tonga, China's presence in the region has been growing. And the US and its allies have made a consistent effort to counter that.\nBut now there is a new dynamic at play as the Trump administration upends relationships with allies such as Ukraine and appears increasingly unpredictable. \nThe Cook Islands has had what's known as a \"free association\" relationship with New Zealand, a former coloniser, since the 1960s - meaning Wellington helps on issues like defence and foreign affairs, and that Cook Islanders hold New Zealand citizenship.\nThe two countries are very close. There are around 15,000 Cook Islanders living in the Pacific island nation, but as many as 100,000 live in New Zealand and Australia. Culturally, Cook Island M\u0101ori - who make up the majority of the population - are also closely related to, but distinct from, New Zealand M\u0101ori. \nThe deals with China aren't the only sign that Brown wants to pull away from New Zealand which have caused concern. He recently abandoned a proposal to introduce a Cook Islands passport following a public outcry. \n\"[The relationship with NZ] connects us politically and connects us to our brothers and sisters of Aotearoa [the M\u0101ori word for New Zealand] \u2013 they left our shores to sail to Aotearoa. We need to remember that,\" said Cook Islander Jackie Tuara at a recent demonstration against Brown's deals with China. \nIn a nation that is not used to huge displays of protest, several hundred people gathered outside parliament in Rarotonga, holding up placards that read: \"Stay connected with NZ\". Others waved their New Zealand passports. \n\"Let us stand in partnership with countries that have the same democratic principles as we are a democratic nation, are we not?\" Ms Tuara said. \"We don't want to see our land and our oceans sold to the highest bidder. Those resources are for us \u2013 for our children, for their future.\"\nBut for all those who are opposed to Brown's recent moves away from New Zealand, there are plenty of Cook Islanders who back him.\nChina specialist Philipp Ivanov, in apparent agreement with the prime minister, says that \"the Pacific island nations have their own agency, their own motivations and their own capabilities\". \nHe believes that the recent developments in the Cook Islands are \"all part of that little great game that's going on between Australia and China and New Zealand in the Pacific. It's a whack-a-mole kind of game.\"\nWhile the US has long been a dominant force in security and military in the region, China has tried to strengthen its ties with the small but strategic Pacific Island nations through aid, infrastructure and security deals.\nIn response, the likes of the US and the UK have beefed up their diplomatic presence across the region. Australia too has made it clear it will redouble its support. But it's unclear to what extent US President Donald Trump will continue his predecessor's commitments in the region to counter China - and Beijing is taking advantage of that.\nLast week, planes flying between New Zealand and Australia were diverted after China conducted military exercises involving live fire. Both Australia and New Zealand had been trailing the three Chinese warships that were making their way down the eastern coast of Australia in what experts say is an escalation and unexpected show of power.\n\"It's a pretty efficient way of testing the diplomatic response in both the Australia-China and New Zealand-China bilateral relationship, and what the US is prepared to say in defence [of its allies],\" says defence analyst Euan Graham, from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\n\"It's also making the point that in the numbers game, China will always be ahead of smaller countries with smaller navies and Australia's navy is at a historic low.\"\nChina's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, told national broadcaster ABC that Beijing's actions had been appropriate and he won't apologise for it. \nAustralia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been keen to emphasise that no international laws were broken and that the drills were carried out in international waters. Indeed, many have pointed out that Australia and its allies often sail warships through the South China Sea.\n\"I'd see it as China wanting to capitalise on the chaotic effect that Trump is having right now,\" says Mihai Sora, director of the Pacific Islands programme at Australia's Lowy Institute. \"China is taking advantage of that moment to [say], look Australia, you are actually alone. Where is the United States in all of this?\"\nAustralia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong freely admits \"we are in a permanent state of contest in our region, that is the reality\".  \nIn speaking out about the warships last week, Australia's government was trying to reassure the public about China's intentions, while also wanting to tell Australians that it's all in hand. That is not a coincidence as Australia heads towards a federal election in the coming months.\n\"[Opposition leader Peter] Dutton comes from this national security and home affairs background, so the government doesn't want to give him any air to criticise Labor,\" Philipp Ivanov says. \"Being weak on China would be disastrous for them, given what's going on in the US and given our own elections.\"\nBut it also brings into focus the dilemma this part of the world faces.\n\"Canberra will be contesting every single move that Beijing tries to make \u2026 and it reflects the fact that Canberra and Beijing have diverging strategic interests,\" says James Laurenceson, the director of Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney.\nBut, he adds, they also have \"enormous commonalities\" - China is Australia's largest  trading partner - and New Zealand's - for instance.\n\"So you've got to be able to ride both these horses at the same time.\"\nIt's not an easy relationship - it never has been. The bigger surprise is that of the US, a traditional ally.\nAlthough many in the Trump administration still describe China as a grave threat, US allies are unsure what to expect from the Washington-Beijing relationship.\nAnd now, as Trump threatens steel and aluminium tariffs and a withdrawal of foreign assistance, Australia feels more isolated than ever. The recent activity of China's warships in the Tasman Sea serves to highlight that isolation.\n\"I wouldn't think of them as military acts, so much as political acts using military hardware,\" says Mr Sora of the Lowy Institute.\n\"I think the political act is to say, look, we can do this anytime we want. You can't do anything about it, and the United States is not doing anything about it, because they're busy tearing down the global system.\"",

        "article_text": "Many of the stars of Toxic Town had not heard of the scandal the drama is based on, but are hoping the Netflix retelling will bring it into the spotlight.\nThe show follows the real-life battle of families in Corby, Northamptonshire, whose children were born with defects in the 1980s and 90s.\nIn court it was argued that toxic airborne pollutants from the town's demolished steelworks had harmed unborn babies.\nActor Brendan Coyle, who was born in Corby, admitted he had been unaware of the story, but said there was excitement in his hometown to see it told to the world.\n\"One of the mothers has been in touch... It's kind of the talk of the town. People are excited about it,\" he said.\n\"For them, the mothers and these children, to have their story told... it's amazing. It's something that's been buried for a long time in terms of people's perception.\"\nIn the drama, the Downton Abbey star plays Roy Thomas, a fictional Corby borough councillor.\nThe 62-year-old actor explained that, like many in the town, his family had moved from Scotland to work at the Corby Steelworks, which in 1979, just before its closure, had about 10,000 employees.\n\"When I was born in Corby, 80% of the population of that town had been born in Scotland,\" he said.\n\"My granny and granddad came down from Bellshill, which is a mining community outside Glasgow. They never lost their accent because you're in amongst it, you know?\"\n\nMembers of his family, including his brother, still live and work in the area.\n\"My brother asked 'Is there any craic in this?'\" he laughed.\n\"On the surface it's very bleak... but in the documentary [the Horizon programme on the case] you see the women they talk to and there's great spirit and humour and great craic.\n\"I think Jack [Thorne, writer of the drama] has captured that brilliantly.\"\nFor executive producer Annabel Jones, humour was an important part of the storytelling.\nShe said: \"Corby is known for its sense of humour; known for its warmth. I wanted to make sure that comes across through the characters as well, because I want it to feel true to Corby.\n\"I didn't want it to feel that people didn't have a sense of hope at that time.\"\nThe Emmy and Bafta-winning Welsh producer first heard about the scandal while in lockdown during the pandemic.\nA friend, from Corby, told her about the case while they were on a masked-up walk in a park.\nShe recalled: \"I was absolutely gobsmacked that, firstly, I have never heard of this story, and secondly, why have I never heard of this story?\n\"This really needs to be pulled into the public consciousness; we need to be made aware so things like this don't happen again.\"\nFrom that point, the 53-year-old began speaking to as many people involved in the case as possible to ensure their stories were told story accurately.\nOne of the nuances of the adaptation is the Corby accent, which Coyle compared to a \"diluted\" Scottish accent.\nHe said: \"It's an odd one but I can recognise it anywhere. I've been on a tube before and been like 'Are you from Corby?' There is nothing like it.\"\nThe executive producer added: \"It's such a particular accent because obviously Corby has lots of different influences... We did work with lots of accent coaches to try and perfect it.\n\"Jodie Whittaker really worked hard. It was probably the thing she was most nervous about. When she met with Susan she very kindly reassured her and told her she'd done a good job.\"\nOther members of the cast met or emailed the people they played to help craft their performance.\nHowever, this was not an option for Robert Carlyle. The man he portrayed, Corby borough councillor Sam Hagen, died in October 2022, a year before filming began.\nTo help, the production team sourced hours of video footage in which the real-life politician told his story.\nCarlyle, who starred in The Full Monty, said: \"He's got a straight kind of voice; a slightly higher kind of Glasgow man that talks like that... I thought... 'That just sounds like my dad.'\n\"I thought 'There's elements here of my dad in Sam' and that was my way in.\"\nThe Trainspotting actor described his character as \"a hero with a small h\" who \"fundamentally wants Corby to succeed\".\nCarlyle said: \"He was determined to make the best of his life down there to try and regenerate this town. He's the kind of man who made sure the traffic lights are working correctly and there's a zebra crossing in the right place.\n\"He does the right thing. It's lovely; a lot of my characters aren't like that. It's nice to have a chance to play somebody who is inherently good.\"\nCastmate Rory Kinnear, who played solicitor Des Collins, explained the show never made a judgement on any of the characters, one way or the other \n\"Everyone believes they're doing the right thing,\" he said.\n\"It allows an audience to decide whether they think those people did do the right things at the right time for the right reason.\"\nKinnear did not speak to the real-life lawyer while preparing for the role.\nHe said: \"The choice of casting me means they were taking it in a slightly different way. I knew they were creating a version of Des in terms of age; in terms of look; in terms of lots of other things\"\nThe real Des Collins, however, thought the Bond actor's portrayal was very close to the truth: \"He got me down to a tee. He was more me than I am,\" he said.\n\"I ended up on a couple of occasions, having seen it, saying 'Oh, I wish said that' and then I realised it wasn't me doing it, it was Rory Kinnear pretending to be me.\"\nThe actor hopes the drama will get people talking. \"As the sibling of a disabled person myself, one is well aware that they are not at the forefront of public interest,\" he said.\n\"What excites me about this is, not just the story itself, but the fact Netflix are doing it and it's a departure for them to do a four-part series like this of this subject matter.\n\"You could well imagine this being on late on BBC2 or Channel 4, and 250,000 loved it and watched it, but it doesn't have any impact.\n\"I think Netflix's ambition with it is to make sure it's something everybody watches, talks about and is made aware of.\"\nBBC Radio Northampton has produced an eight-part documentary series called In Detail: The Toxic Waste Scandal, which will be available for download on 4 March.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

Later that day, his body was found at the foot of a cliff by an off-duty policeman on a waterbike.\nLee does not believe Nathan made the journey to the remote location in the opposite direction to his hotel on his own, and said it would take an hour to walk up there. \nHe added Nathan had \"no reason to be up there\". \n\"We strongly believe he was taken up there, whether it was by taxi or against his own will,\" Lee said. \"And something has happened for him to be found where he was found.\"\nThe family said the day after his death attempts were made to use Nathan's bank cards, but this was not followed up by the authorities.\nAlannah and Lee have also been tracing Nathan's known movements on the night. They said he had been on a video call with one of his friends until his phone battery ran out.\nCarrying out their own investigations, the family discovered Nathan on public CCTV on the promenade, where they said he did not appear significantly intoxicated. They have found other premises with CCTV, but said the owners would not pass on any recordings without a request from the Spanish authorities. \nThe family said they had repeatedly tried to find out how the investigation into Nathan's death was progressing, but have been met with silence.\nThey recently received a police file which Alannah said was \"empty\", with the case described as closed.\nNathan's mother Elizabeth said there was \"no empathy\" from the Spanish police immediately after his death and claimed they were \"treated like dogs\". \nElizabeth said she had to identify her son by being shown a photo of a tattoo on his torso.\nShe said not knowing how he ended up at the remote location is torturous.\n\"Our boy deserves answers and we as a family deserve answers. Nathan wasn't a drunkard who'd go out and forget about everything. Nathan was really with it,\" she said.\n\"Not knowing about that last hour or two before his death, it's eating us away, day in day out, from the time we get up to the time we go to bed. We live this nightmare.\"\nNathan's father Jonathan said: \"They've done nothing, nothing at all. It's just a total disregard for his life in every kind of way.\"\nThe family said they needed to travel to Benidorm because of their frustration and to hand police the information they have gathered about the time between Nathan leaving his friends and the discovery of his body.\nThe Spanish authorities have agreed to meet them and discuss their concerns.\nLee said the family will not give up in its quest to find out what happened.\n\"We'll keep going and going until we find out why - and how he got up there,\" he said.\nA spokesperson for the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development office said: \"We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Spain and are in contact with the local authorities.\"",

        "article_text": "A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares.\nA man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, \"Where you from, ma'am?\"\n\"England.\"\n\"Hope you enjoy Estelle,\" he says.\n\"Do you?\" I ask.\n\"A lot better than where I was before.\"\nWelcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas.\nConcrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter.\nThe UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside.\nLooking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released.\nJust one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment.\nNo prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row.\nJimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery.\nHe's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison.\n\"I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives,\" he says. \"If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison.\"\nDelgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government.\nThe \"good time credit\" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well.\nCredits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation.\nOff the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison.\n\"They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life,\" he says. \"I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works.\"\nThe rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%).\nThe BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood.\n\"The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007,\" Ms Mahmood says. \"They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s.\"\nShe believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. \"It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime.\"\nThe Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet.\n\"The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007,\" says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. \"And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem.\"\nWhat would make a real difference, she says, would be diverting more people from incarceration in the first place: \"To shorten sentences, to reduce the use of recalls to prison, and to invest more heavily in rehabilitative programs in prison and in programs and services in the community.\"\nAs well as incentivisation, the UK government is also considering the use of \"diversion programmes\" - where offenders are sent on rehabilitation courses rather than to jail. This can apply to people with addiction issues or mental health problems. It's what they do here in Texas to reduce the burden on the courts and attempt to sort the root cause of the offence.\nMore people have been put to death in Texas than anywhere else in the US. Since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 593 prisoners have been executed. There are 176 people currently on death row - so it might seem strange the UK government could take a leaf out of their book.\nEven so, the justice secretary believes there is still much the UK can learn from what happens at Estelle.\n\"I don't think that the fact that they have the death penalty here means that we shouldn't be learning lessons from strategies that they've introduced that really work,\" Ms Mahmood says.\nIt's a plan with \"huge potential in the UK\" according to Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, who believes it will make prisons safer and more productive.\n\"It will help ensure prisoners are doing what is necessary to reduce the risk they will reoffend and create more victims,\" he says.\nBut not everyone agrees with incentivising convicted criminals to work towards an early release from prison.\nSamantha Nicholls' son was murdered in 2018. Twenty-two year old Joe Pooley was thrown into a river in Ipswich and held under the water. Three people were jailed for his murder in 2021. Joe's mother believes inmates should never be released before their sentence is complete.\n\"Prison is a punishment - you should do your time,\" she says. \"It needs to be a deterrent - you're there because you did something wrong.\"\nIt's clear the UK needs to find solutions to cut prison overcrowding \u2013 and find them fast. Even the recent prisoner early release scheme will barely keep pace with more offenders being jailed. New prison buildings will take years to come on stream. But does this Texan prison have the answers?\nThe challenge for ministers and the criminal justice system is how to stop the revolving doors on the UK's prisons - the reoffending and lack of prospects facing those who are released which draws them back into crime.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments. \nIt'll be delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.",

        "article_text": "A trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer.\nSpeaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged \"a real trade deal\" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners. \nThe trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade. \nSir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an \"unprecedented\" second state visit to the UK.  \nReceiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a \"great honour\" and described the King as \"a wonderful man\".\nSir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was \"truly historic\". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit. \nHaving confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes.\nThe US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. \nOn the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. \nHowever, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine.\nAsked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \"backstop\". \nHe said \"nobody will play around\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals. \nThe US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\". \n\"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\" he said. \nHe later added he had \"a lot of respect\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday.\nThe UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders. \nHowever, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\". \nThe deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back. \nAfter taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\". \nReferring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. \n\"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said. \nHe said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century. \n\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said. \nTrump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union. \nHe also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.\nAsked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\"\n\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"\nIn a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\". \nSince leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.\nIn his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way.\nHowever, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems. \nThe head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce - a former Labour MP and minister - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that businesses will be encouraged by what he called an \"important first step\".\n\"In trade negotiations, relationships matter,\" says William Bain, adding that seeing the two leaders find common ground on their respective economies and trade is \"helpful\".\nHe added that a deal to keep tariffs low would most benefit automotive and pharmaceutical industries in the UK.",

        "article_text": "Stars, film fans and fashionistas rejoice as the biggest night in the showbiz calendar is here at last - the 97th Oscars.\nSpanish-language musical Emilia P\u00e9rez leads the way with 13 nominations, but recently saw its awards chances damaged after offensive historic tweets from its star resurfaced.\nWicked, The Brutalist, Conclave and Anora are also among the top contenders, with the race for best picture too close to call.\nUS comedian Conan O'Brien is presenting the awards from Los Angeles, with the show starting at 16:00 (PT), 19:00 (ET) and midnight (GMT).\nYou can also expect plenty of references during the night to the wildfires which devastated LA and left thousands of homes destroyed.\nHere are all the major talking points and things to look out for at the ceremony, as an eventful awards season draws to an end.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez, about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, has 13 nominations in total \u2013 including best picture, best actress (Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n) and best supporting actress (Zoe Salda\u00f1a).\nIt is the most-nominated non-English language film of all time. It's actually a French production, largely set in Mexico, with Spanish as the main language spoken. \nKarla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n's nomination made her the first trans person to be nominated in an acting category (although Elliot Page was nominated for Juno in 2008, before the actor transitioned).\nHowever, the film \u2013 which had already caused controversy in Mexico \u2013 has been beset by controversy following a social media row involving Gasc\u00f3n.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez remains strong in a couple of categories, but it's unlikely to sweep the board in the way Oppenheimer \u2013 which also had 13 nominations \u2013 did last year.\nChasing down Emilia P\u00e9rez with 10 nods is three-and-a-half epic The Brutalist, starring Adrien Brody.\nWicked also has 10 nominations, including for British actress Cynthia Erivo and her co-star Ariana Grande, while Demi Moore has the first Oscar nomination of her career for her role in The Substance.\nMeanwhile, pope selection drama Conclave has eight nominations, including best actor for its British star Ralph Fiennes.\nAll the films above are up for the coveted best picture prize, and are joined by Anora, about a New York stripper who falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nThe film, which has six nominations, leapt ahead in the race after a string of precursor wins at the Critics Choice Awards as well as two major guild ceremonies - the Directors Guild of America and Producers Guild of America Awards.\nBut there remains no consensus on what will ultimately win the top prize \u2013 with the other contenders for best picture including A Complete Unknown, Dune: Part Two, I'm Still Here and Nickel Boys.\nThis has been an unpredictable awards season, and there could still be plenty of surprises in store.\nIn the best actress category, Moore, 62, is nominated for playing a fading star who swaps her body for a younger and more beautiful version of herself in The Substance.\nBut it's a tight race.\nThere were gasps backstage at the Baftas (where I was) when Anora star Mikey Madison scooped up the best actress prize.\nIt was a big blow to the assumed Oscar momentum for Moore, and an incredible moment for Madison, who was relatively unknown before her role in Anora.\nThis is exactly the type of rags-to-riches story that awards ceremonies love \u2013 and the film itself celebrates.\nBest actor may also be up in the air. Adrian Brody is the frontrunner, with his nod for The Brutalist \u2013 but Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is his toughest competition, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.\nLast week, Chalamet's surprise SAG win shook up the race, after his somewhat eccentric awards campaign.\nIf he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner of best actor.\nIn the best supporting actor category, Kieran Culkin is the frontrunner for A Real Pain, while Zoe Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.\nIt's worth noting it's been a decade since the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite started trending, due to the lack of diversity at the 2015 Academy Awards.\nThis year, there are people of colour in both the best actress and best actor categories.\nIn fact, Sing Sing's Colman Domingo is nominated for best leading actor for the second year in a row.\nElsewhere, however, progress remains slow.\nCoralie Fargeat is the only woman to be nominated for best director, for The Substance, out of a field of five.\n\"Has there been progress, yes. Has there been enough? Absolutely not,\" April Reign, LA-based founder of the #OscarsSoWhite movement, told me.\n\"It was never just about the Oscars not being black enough. It was also about gender, age, class, sexuality and geography too.\"\n\"If we're still able to count them on one hand, then we're not there yet.\"\nMost of the nominees will be gracing the red carpet \u2013 I'm already betting we'll see more tears and hand holding from Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.\nThere had been a big question mark over whether Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n will show up after the row over her past tweets.\nHowever, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself \u2013 although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.\nPresenters include Halle Berry, Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr, Cillian Murphy, Da'Vine Joy Randolph and Emma Stone.\nThis year's Oscars race has played out against the grim backdrop of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles.\nThe nominations themselves were postponed twice due to the fires.\nThere's no doubt it's going to be hard for the awards to strike the right tone when so many people are suffering. It doesn't sit well with celebrities flaunting their wealth on the red carpet.\nCancelling the whole event, however, was \"never on the table,\" according to Lynette Howell Taylor, an LA-based British film producer and member of the Academy's board of governors, who lost her own house in the fires.\nShe told me there would \"definitely be recognition of what the city has gone through\" during the ceremony, with clear signposting of support mechanisms and ways to donate.\n\"But ultimately the show will be about the celebration of the movies of the year, like it is every year,\" she said.\nThis year, the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony.\nInstead, Wicked stars Erivo and Grande will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony, which will last a reported 10 minutes long.\nI can already see social media going into a meltdown over Defying Gravity, but it remains to be seen if the duo can recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.\nDoja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony.\nThe Academy Awards ceremony is hosted this year for the first time by comedian and podcaster Conan O'Brien.\nHe replaces US late night presenter Jimmy Kimmel, who has presented the show four times including last year.\nThe 2025 Oscars will air live on Sunday 2 March from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the ceremony has been held since 2002.\nThe show can be watched in the US on ABC and can be streamed on Hulu. It is also being broadcast around the world in more than 200 territories.\nUK viewers can watch on ITV and ITVX from 22:30 GMT.\nCynthia Erivo is the first black British woman to receive two Oscar nominations for acting, after also being nominated for Harriet in 2020.\nIf she wins best actress this time, for playing Elphaba in Wicked, she'll become an EGOT - having completed the set of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards.\nRalph Fiennes is flying the flag in the best actor category with his first nomination for 28 years. He's recognised for playing a cardinal who oversees the selection of a new Pope in Conclave.\nElsewhere, Felicity Jones is nominated for best supporting actress for The Brutalist - a decade after her first Oscar nomination - while Sir Elton John is in the best original song race.\nThe country will also be rooting for two more screen legends - Wallace and Gromit (and their makers Aardman Animations), who are hoping for their fourth Oscar. They are shortlisted for best animated feature for their latest outing, Vengeance Most Fowl.\nRead more about this year's awards season films:",

        "article_text": "Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife appeared to have been dead for \"quite a while\" when the couple and their dog were found dead on Wednesday afternoon at their home in the US state of New Mexico, police say.\nHackman, 95, was discovered in a side room near the kitchen of the house in Santa Fe, while his wife Betsy Arakawa, a 65-year-old classical pianist, was found in a bathroom.\nAuthorities reported no signs of injury but deemed the deaths \"suspicious enough\" to investigate and have not ruled out foul play. No cause of death was given. \nIn a wide-ranging career, Hackman won two Academy Awards for The French Connection and Unforgiven.\nThree of Hackman's children from a previous marriage confirmed the death of their father and Ms Arakawa in a statement to the BBC.\n\"He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just Dad and Grandpa. We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss,\" Elizabeth, Leslie and Annie Hackman said.\nWarning: This story contains details some readers may find upsetting\nThe Santa Fe County Sheriff's office confirmed the deaths.\n\"On 26 February, 2025, at approximately 1:45pm, Santa Fe County Sheriff's deputies were dispatched to an address on Old Sunset Trail in Hyde Park where Gene Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa, and a dog were found deceased,\" the office said.\nIn a news conference on Thursday afternoon, Sheriff Adan Mendoza said: \"It sounds like they had been deceased for quite a while, and I don't want to guess in reference to how long that was.\"\nHe added: \"There was no immediate sign of foul play. Haven't ruled that out yet.\n\"This is an investigation, so we're keeping everything on the table.\"\nA sheriff's detective who responded to the scene said that they believed the couple had been dead for some time because of Ms Arakawa's \"decomposition\" and \"mummification\" in the hands and feet.\n\"The male decedent also showed obvious signs of death, similar and consistent with the female decedent,\" said the search warrant.\nNear Ms Arakawa's head was a portable heater, which the detective determined could have been brought down in the event that she abruptly fell to the ground.\nA prescription bottle and scattered pills were on the bathroom countertop close to her body. The couple's German Shepherd dog was found dead in a bathroom closet near to Ms Arakawa.\nHackman was discovered wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a blue long-sleeve T-shirt and brown slippers. Sunglasses and a walking cane were next to the body.\nThe detective suspected that the actor had fallen suddenly.\nThe circumstances of their death were \"suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation\", said the search warrant, because the person who called emergency services found the front door of the property open.\nBut the detective observed no sign of forced entry into the home. Nothing appeared out of place inside. Neither was there any indication that belongings had been rummaged through, or that any items had been removed.\nTwo other, healthy dogs were discovered roaming the property - one inside and one outside. \nThe couple's 2,300 sq ft ranch-style home, part of a gated community, was valued at around $1m, according to tax records.\nThe local utility responded and found no sign of a gas leak in the area. The fire department detected no indication of a carbon monoxide leak or poisoning, according to the search warrant.\nThe detective spoke at the scene to two maintenance workers, one of whom had called the emergency services.\nThe two workers said they sometimes conducted routine work at property, but rarely ever saw the couple.\nThey indicated that they communicated with them by phone and text, primarily with Ms Arakawa.\nThe two workers said they last had contact with the couple two weeks beforehand.\nA recording of the 911 call obtained by the BBC shows the emotional caller telling a dispatcher how he found the two bodies.\n\"No, they're not moving,\" he says in the audio. \"Just send somebody out here really quick.\"\nThe person, who made the call while standing outside the property and peering in through a window, is heard saying \"damn\" repeatedly. \nHackman met Ms Arakawa when she was working part-time at a California gym in the mid-1980s, the New York Times has previously reported.\nHe won the best actor Oscar for his role as Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in William Friedkin's 1971 thriller The French Connection, and another for best supporting actor for playing Little Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood's Western film Unforgiven in 1992.\nA relative latecomer to Hollywood, Hackman's breathrough came in his thirties, when he was nominated for an Oscar for portraying Buck Barrow in 1967's Bonnie and Clyde - opposite Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway - and again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970.\nBoth films saw him recognised in the supporting actor category. He was also nominated for best leading actor in 1988 for playing the FBI agent in Mississippi Burning.\nHe played more than 100 roles during his career, including supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s.\nHackman featured opposite many other Hollywood heavyweights including Al Pacino in 1973's Scarecrow and Gene Wilder in 1974's Young Frankenstein.\nHis last big-screen appearance came as Monroe Cole in Welcome to Mooseport in 2004, after which he stepped back from Hollywood for a quieter life in New Mexico.",

        "article_text": "Nudity, swearing, petulance, club anthems, more nudity and a woman dressed as a horse - the 2025 Brit Awards had it all.\nCharli XCX was the big winner, taking home five prizes in all - including best artist, best album and song of the year.\nUS star - and the BBC's Sound of 2025 - Chappell Roan picked up two awards; while Ezra Collective, The Last Dinner Party, Fontaines DC and Stormzy got one apiece.\nBut no-one's only interested in all that. Here's what really went down at the 2025 ceremony at London's O2 Arena.\nListen, this was never going to be anything other than Charli's night. \nThe pop star's seventh album, Brat, captured the cultural zeitgeist in a way that few artists ever manage.\nReleased in June, the record combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork; as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she's accumulated along the way, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.\nIn the star's own words, the album was \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".\nJust as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Lorde, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.\nCritics called it \"pop music for the future\" and praised the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's coming of age. \nKnowingly trashy, yet surprisingly deep, it was easily the best British album of the last 12 months - and one that proved Charli's detractors wrong.\n\"I feel like dance music, electronic music, gets a really bad rep because everyone is like, 'It's not that deep, is it? And I kind of feel it is,\" she said after collecting her second award.\n\"This genre of music, for me, is euphoric, it allows me to escape, it allows me to feel on such a deep level.\"\nTeddy Swims, swimming in teddy bears. We see what he did there.\nJade Thirlwall was the last of the Little Mix crew to launch a solo career, but she's been giving it her all. \nAs well as winning best pop artist at Saturday's ceremony, she put on one of the night's highest-concept performances - a five-act melodrama about the cruelty of the music industry and her creative rebirth.\nOver the course of the night, she wore six different outfits. But she chose the wrong one for climbing the stairs to pick up her trophy. Thank goodness the Sugababes were there to help.\nJack Whitehall made a welcome return as the ceremony's host, after four years away.\nAs ever, his jokes were close to the bone... including a passing reference to allegations surrounding some presenters on Brits broadcaster ITV.\n\"ITV had so many of its presenters cancelled this year that they had to come crawling back to an ex, and what an honour it is to be hosting again the biggest night in British music,\" he joked.\nLater, he described Youtuber-turned-musician KSI as \"an inspiration\".\n\"Because you listen to Kendrick Lamar and you're like, 'I couldn't do that in a million years'. Then I listen to your song and I'm like, 'Oh, I could do this'.\"\nSpeaking before the show, Whitehall revealed a sneaky secret: He uses a fake script during rehearsals.\n\"Previously I used to do the actual script in rehearsal, and then you'd have an hour of people from record labels and publishers coming and knocking on the dressing room door going, 'You can't say this, you can't say that',\" he told Heart radio.\n\"So now I just do this fake script, which if you heard it, you'd be like, 'This is the lamest script ever', because it's all me just complimenting everyone and going, 'Oh, our next award is the best musician I've ever heard. They're great.'\"\n\"I'm wearing shades because I mashed up my eye playing padel [ball],\" said Stormzy, as he accepted the prize for best rap/hip-hop artist.\n\"I've got a very sore eye. I've got a bruised cornea.\n\"My eye's sore under here, I'm not being a mad man with shades on inside.\"\nSabrina Carpenter pretended to pleasure a royal guardsman. \nCharli XCX gave a speech in a see-through top, with no bra. \nOne of Jade Thirlwall's dancers mooned at the camera. \nDanny Dyer uttered one of the English language's most offensive swear words.\nI'd guess that ITV's responses to Ofcom are going to make an interesting read.\nWord of the censor's concerns even filtered through to the arena during the show, much to Charli's annoyance.\n\"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,\" she said from the podium. I feel like we're in the era of free the nipple though, right?\"\nAs fans applauded, the singer grimaced: \"They put the clap track on, cool. Thanks for being on my side.\"\nThe Brits were set up in 1977 to celebrate the British Music Industry, and they are run by the BPI - an organisation funded by, and representing, the biggest record labels in the country.\nBut lots of the winners on Saturday used their speeches to criticise the way they are being treated.\n\"Are we building careers, or are we just chasing moments - because moments fade and careers take time,\" said Myles Smith. \"So please stick with artists past a viral hit.\"\nChappell Roan, who won best international artist, had a similar plea.\n\"I had to write a lot of bad songs to get to the good ones - and artists deserve that freedom, to explore horrible concepts, and to flop, and rise, and not be pressured into making music based off of what's trending.\"\nCharli XCX's multiple victories proved their point. Signed at the age of 14, she had to fight to make the music she wanted - after years of being told her songs were too abrasive and uncommercial.\n\"It feels really nice to be recognised on this album, when I haven't made any sacrifices,\" she said.\n\"I've been doing my own thing in my own corner of the industry - and I guess, this time, culture caught up with us.\"\nMyles Smith has had an incredible 12 months. After giving up his job to pursue music, his feel-good pop anthem Stargazing went viral. So viral that it ended up as the best-selling British song of 2024.\nAsked about the moment he realised it had taken on a life of its own, he told us: \"I got new wi-fi the other day, and they put me on hold... and it was Stargazing.\n\"And that said two things. One: This is like, the most irritating thing. But at the same time, I had made it to hold.\"\n\"Did you sing it for the operator when they picked up?\" we asked. \n\"No, I was passed to seven more people.\"\nSee? Being a pop star doesn't give you any shortcuts in the world of broadband service provider call centres.\nWhy did Jared Leto open his red carpet interview by trying to teach us an English accent?\nTo find out, you'd have to ask Jared Leto and, frankly, we're too scared.\nSabrina Carpenter was the night's biggest star - opening the show with a cheeky wink, a phalanx of bearskin-wearing guards and a vaudevillian mash-up of Espresso, Bed Chem and... er, Rule, Britannia.\nBut was the decision to hand her the \"global success\" award a thinly-veiled ploy to tempt her back on to the stage?\nThe prize was originally created in 2013 to recognise British acts who had sold millions of records and concert tickets abroad. The previous recipients were One Direction (2013-14), Sam Smith (2015), Adele (2016-17) and Ed Sheeran (2018-19).\nSix years ago it was abandoned altogether... until they needed something to honour Sabrina.\nTo be fair, the singer racked up an incredible 21 weeks at number one in the UK singles chart last year - more than anyone has ever achieved in a single calendar year - so her trophy wasn't entirely undeserved. \nA lot of viewers were left perplexed when Jack Whitehall sat down with Danny Dyer and what appeared to be his date: A woman with a horse for a face (we're not being unkind, see above for proof).\nWell, it turns out that Danny's neighbour was a German DJ who goes by the name of HorsegiirL and keeps their identity hidden behind a mask. Sort of like Deadmau5, but with fetlocks.\nMaybe next year she can come back to do a duet with Foals.\n \nEzra Collective made history by becoming the first jazz band to win the Brit Award for best group - beating previous title-holders like Coldplay, The Cure and Bring Me The Horizon.\nTaking to the stage, frontman Femi Koleoso had a few words to say about cuts to music education, and the lack of funding for youth clubs like Tomorrow's Warriors - where his band got their start.\n\"I'll bang this drum a bunch of times and I'll continue to do so until the entire country gets it\", he said.\n\"This moment right here is because of the great youth clubs, and the great teachers and the great schools that support young people playing music.\n\"The reason we continue to bang this drum is because so many of the problems that face greater society in the UK...  we're unsure of how to fix it, but the solution lies with giving a young person a trumpet, the solution lies in giving a young person a saxophone.\n\"Because when you do that, you give them a dream, an aspiration and a goal.\"\nTo prove his point, he invited the London youth group Kinetika Bloco onto the stage of the O2, to blast through Ezra Collective's infectiously upbeat jazz anthem Shaking Body.\nThis year's Brit Award trophies, designed by Gabriel Moses, were cast in bronze... And they were heavy. \nWeighing 1.6kg each, you could break a toe if you dropped one. And Charli had to pick up four of the things for her winner's photo.\nIt took approximately six people to arrange them in her arms (\"don't push them between my boobs\", she squealed at one point) before she was ready for the flashbulbs.\n\"Is this lame?\" she asked at the last moment. \"It feels lame.\"\nThen she dropped them all and fell to the floor in a fit of giggles.",

        "article_text": "These were already turbulent times in Romania.\nBut as people here navigate the late winter ice and slush on Bucharest's elegant streets, the abrupt departure of the Tate brothers by private jet has left a fresh trail of confusion and unanswered questions in its wake.\nA country grappling with a cancelled presidential election, its future in Europe, its support for neighbouring Ukraine, widespread corruption, and collapsing faith in public institutions, is now left pondering why two controversial foreigners, facing a raft of complex but serious criminal charges, have been treated with such apparent lenience; their confiscated assets and their passports suddenly returned to them.\nWas a secret deal done between Romania's government and the Trump administration? If so, in these increasingly transactional times, what does Romania get in return? Or was this more like a pre-emptive gesture of good will towards the American president, a gift to lay at Donald Trump's imperious feet?\nOr are we searching for conspiracies when the truth is probably far more chaotic?\nAs foreign leaders \u2013 from Volodymyr Zelensky to Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 travel to Washington DC bearing deals and other apparent peace offerings, one might ask who could blame Romania, a staunch NATO ally navigating a host of internal and external challenges, for trying to keep an increasingly unpredictable US administration on side?\n\"It's a matter of life (or death) for Romania,\" said security analyst George Scutaru, describing his country's need to shore up Western support in the face of growing pressure from the Kremlin. \nDeclining to comment on the Tate issue specifically, Scutaru said it was clear Moscow was seeking to undermine Romania's democracy and that the government had good reason to seek ways to remind the Trump administration of the many advantages \u2013 commercial, diplomatic, and military \u2013 of continuing to back it.\nBut if the Tate brothers are part of that equation, it is already clear that many Romanians are not impressed.\nThis is a country already facing a strong populist backlash against an elite ruling class that is widely seen as corrupt and out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people who feel treated as second-class citizens \u2013 a mere source of cheap labour - within the European Union.\nSo, the sight of the Tates appearing to receive special treatment plays into the notion that Romania's institutions are hollow and cater only to those with money.\n\"For me, what has happened is unacceptable. We cannot allow Romania's image to be tarnished by impunity and defiance,\" fumed Elena Lasconi, a prominent presidential candidate here, expressing deep concern that Romanian prosecutors' sudden decision to relax the Tates' travel restrictions was the result of \"external influence.\"\n\"It's my personal perception that probably there is\u2026 pressure on the Romanian political system, as logically the prosecutor would have applied very strict rules to control (the Tates) and probably the United States would have been a place where they would be allowed to travel (due to concerns they would not be extradited if they failed to return),\" said  international human rights lawyer, Silvia Tabusca.\nIt is beyond doubt that Andrew Tate's lucrative brand of assertive masculinity has earned him allies in President Trump's administration. One of his former lawyers, Paul Ingrassia, now works in the White House. \nMany in the so-called \"manosphere\" see Tate as a persecuted hero who has just been rescued from Romania's corrupt clutches.\nThere is also a more nebulous far-right alignment between some pro-Trump and pro-Tate figures in the US, far-right and allegedly pro-Russian forces in Romania, and the Kremlin itself, which stands accused of plotting to weaken Bucharest's pro-western stance.\nBut the picture is not clear cut.\nPresident Trump distanced himself from the brothers' case on Thursday and there are signs of a broader push-back in the US, with the governor of Florida Ron DeSantis making it clear the Tates are \"not welcome\" in his state, amid plans to open a \"preliminary inquiry\" into allegations against them of human trafficking and violence against women.\nMeanwhile in Bucharest, the theory that Romania's government cut a deal with the US to release the brothers is treated with caution by some analysts.\n\"I think the chances (of such a deal) are fifty-fifty,\" said Sorin Ionita, a political commentator, questioning the ability of Romania's various institutions and ministries to arrange a \"coherent\" policy concerning the Tates.\n\"I'm not sure they coordinate. Did they manage to demand something in exchange (from the US)? I'm not sure,\" said Ionita, bemoaning a situation almost designed to persuade Romania's public to lose faith in state institutions, and speculating that lower level \"satellite\" figures in an equally chaotic Trump administration were probably behind any deal in order \"to extract money from the Tate brothers.\" The BBC has seen no evidence of this.\n\"It's very depressing to see,\" he added.\nAs for the question of whether the Tates will return to Romania, as their lawyer has promised, to continue their legal battles, a degree of uncertainty endures.\nThe fact that most of their assets have been unfrozen could be seen as weakening the Romanian authorities' ability to compel them to come back. The Tates themselves have also questioned whether they can receive a fair trial in Romania, complaining of a \"conspiracy\" against them.\nAnd while Andrew Tate pointed out on Thursday that he and his brother currently face \"no active indictment\" in Romania, a more accurate way of describing their situation might be to say there is currently a lull in a long and complex legal process. An initial case has been returned to prosecutors for amendments, while a second and more substantial prosecution case against them is now pending.\n\"In the second case, we have 34 victims that cooperate and have been identified as victims. Among them are two minors, one a 17-year-old girl that has been recruited in order to be exploited by the criminal group. And the second girl is 15-years-old, and there is a crime for sexual acts with a minor in which they are also involved,\" said the lawyer, Silvia Tabusca, outlining the allegations in the second case. \nThe brothers also face arrest on separate and unrelated criminal charges in the UK. The Tates deny any wrongdoing in all these cases.\nIn the coming months, Romania faces far more pressing challenges than the fate of two foreign celebrities. Presidential elections have been rescheduled for May and a leading candidate \u2013 often accused of being a Kremlin puppet - has just been detained and is facing six criminal charges including fascism and undermining the constitutional order.\nWith their self-declared misogyny, extreme views, and online personas, Andrew and Tristan Tate do chime with some of the themes preoccupying and dividing society in America and far beyond. \nClearly, they remain influential figures, particularly among boys and young men. But the brothers face years of legal battles which may well push them, and their still lucrative brand, further to the periphery of the far larger dramas now reshaping our world.",

        "article_text": "The legendary actor tells Katty Kay that his parents would have much rather he became an accountant or insurance broker, but finally came around when they saw him perform on stage.\nWith a shelf filled with awards, including Screen Actors Guild trophies, Emmys, a Golden Globe, a Tony and a pair of Olivier Awards, 86-year-old Sir Derek Jacobi has proven to be much more than \"the classical Shakespearean actor of our generation,\" as BBC special correspondent Katty Kay describes him during an interview at his home in London.\nSir Derek credits a serendipitous combination of luck and talent for his decades-long career, which includes roles in blockbusters like Gladiator and its 2024 sequel, and stints on sitcom Frasier, for which he won the 2001 Emmy for outstanding guest actor in a comedy series.\n\"Somehow, I was born to be an actor. That's what I feel. There was never any alternative,\" Sir Derek says about first appearing on the stage at the age of 17. He was born in north-east London to a father who ran a sweet shop and a mother who was a secretary. \"That's what I wanted. That's what I thought I could do. That's what I enjoyed.\"\nEnjoying the spotlight was just a part of his success. Sir Derek notes that after he found himself at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre (which he affectionately calls the Rep) in 1960, there wasn't anything else that matched the euphoria of basking in an audience's applause. It was a far cry from what his parents had hoped for. Like most, they'd expected their son to go into a field with stability, like accounting or insurance.\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay\nWatch\u00a0Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on\u202fYouTube.\n\"I always thought\u2026 I wanted to be an actor. I had no talent for anything else,\" he says. \"Hamlet confirmed it.\" After reciting one of the doomed prince's monologues to Kay, Sir Derek admits that most of his roles have disappeared into the ether, but the work of the Bard has stayed with him since those early performances almost 70 years ago. \"All the other parts have gone. Hamlet's still around. Shakespeare stays.\"\nSir Derek is quick to name drop some of his esteemed colleagues: Dame Maggie Smith, Sir Laurence Olivier, Dame Vanessa Redgrave, Albert Finney and Sir Robert Stephens. But he's as quick to note that he didn't have the classical training many of them had. He tells Kay that it was a bit of luck that led to his successes, which include being knighted by the late Queen Elizabeth II and earning the Danish Order of the Dannebrog.\n\"I think there's talent and I think there's luck. Without that luck, the talent isn't enough on its own,\" he says. \"You've got to have the opportunity to show you've got talent. Without that opportunity\u2026 nobody's seeing it.\"\nMore like this:\u00a0\n\u2022 It took nearly 60 years for Brooke Shields to overcome her imposter syndrome\n\u2022 Ina Garten on her internet appeal: 'Young people don't have mom in the kitchen'\u00a0\n\u2022 Olympic legend Lindsey Vonn explains the mindset of a winner\u00a0\nAnother obstacle Jacobi notes was the fact that he was never seen as classically handsome. \"They had a head start because they were nice to look at,\" he says of Stephens and Olivier, while he credits being able to hone his craft in front of an audience from the age of 17 as what set him apart. He tells Kay that luck landed him that first job and his time at the Rep stood in for drama school. \"It was a huge learning experience.\"\nAnd although Sir Derek says he hasn't stopped learning, he works at a different pace now, and has learned to find new ways of working.\n\"You slow down,\" the 86-year-old says. \"It's more difficult to remember lines. I used to have a very sharp brain. I don't anymore. That, obviously, is age.\" These days, he has some help with those lines via an earpiece just in case, with Kay likening it to a skier using a knee brace.\u00a0\n\"I've really had a charmed life,\" Sir Derek says, reflecting on his career, his long-time husband, theatre director Richard Clifford, and the fact that he can still do what he loves. Sir Derek's upcoming projects include appearances in episodes of Doctor Who Unbound and Good Omens as well as films The Vampyre: Blood & Ink, with Malcolm McDowell and action-comedy Tinsel Town, alongside Rebel Wilson and Kiefer Sutherland.\n\"I can't complain about anything in my life.\"\nInfluential with Katty Kay airs on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Support for Ukraine has become a key issue since Donald Trump returned to the White House.\nPresident Trump has made a number of claims about how much the United States has spent compared to European countries.\nBut some of his claims are questionable - with no evidence to back them up.\nPresident Trump has made this claim on a number of occasions - including when he hosted France's President Macron in the White House this week.\nShort answer: Figures suggest the actual spend is much lower.\nBBC Verify can find no evidence to back up the claim.  There are different calculations on US spending in or related to Ukraine - and they produce a much lower figure.\nThe Kiel Institute is a German-based think tank tracking support going into Ukraine.  It calculated that the United States spent $119.7bn (\u00a394.3bn) on aid between January 2022 and December 2024.\nOthers have reached a higher figure - but with a broader definition of what counts as spending on Ukraine.\nThe US Department of Defense has provided a figure looking at all spending on Operation Atlantic Resolve - a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nIt says $182.8bn has been \"appropriated\" - a figure that covers US military training in Europe and replenishment of US defence stocks.\nEither way, both figures are considerably lower than claimed by the president.\nWe asked the White House about the basis for the $350bn claim. So far, it hasn't provided an explanation.\nPresident Trump has claimed: \"We've spent more than $300bn and Europe has spent about $100bn - that's a big difference\"\nShort answer: Figures suggest Europe has spent more when all aid is included and, as above, we can't find any evidence for the $300bn figure.\nThe United States is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. But Europe combined has spent more money than the United States, according to the Kiel Institute.\nThe figure includes aid directly from the European Union, but also from bilateral deals from European countries, both inside and outside the EU. It includes military, financial and humanitarian aid.\nThey calculate that between 24 January 2022 and the end of 2024, Europe as a whole spent $138.7bn on Ukraine. In the same period, the United States spent $119.7bn, according to their figures.\nNATO secretary general Mark Rutte made a similar argument, adding Canada into his calculation.\nMr Rutte said February 2025: \"In 2024, NATO Allies provided over 50 billion euros in security assistance to Ukraine \u2013 nearly 60% of this coming from Europe and Canada.\"\nWe asked for NATO's figures, but they said they were classified.\nThis is a claim President Trump made when he hosted President Macron. It prompted President Macron to disagree, saying both Europe and the US had given a mixture of grants and loans.\nShort answer: The EU has provided loans, but also grants. \nPresident Macron is correct, according to Kiel figures. But they suggest President Trump also has a point; the US has sent more grants, while the EU sent more loans.\nHowever, again, there are different figures out there.\nThe European Union says EU countries have provided around $145bn in aid so far and that just 35% of that has been loans. Like the United States Department of Defence, the EU has used a broader definition of what counts as aid to Ukraine.\nEU loans will have been on generous terms - so Ukraine will be repaying less interest than it would normally. In some cases, Ukraine isn't expected to pay anything, with repayments coming from revenues from frozen Russian assets.\nWhat we can say is that aid to Ukraine has been a mixture of loans and grants.\nThe UK is one of the biggest individual state donors to Ukraine.\nThe only countries to have spent more are the United States and Germany, according to Kiel data.\nBut the UK contributions are much smaller than the United States.\nThat raises a question for the UK and other European countries; if the United States withdraws a large part of its funding to Ukraine, can other states make up the difference?\nThat would require a significant increase in their contributions.\n\nAdditional reporting: Thomas Spencer and Tamara Kovacevic\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

        "article_text": "Great Britain toured Australia in 1996\nEngland v Australia: Women's Test\nVenue: Allegiant Stadium, Las Vegas Date: Saturday, 1 March (02:00 GMT, Sunday, 2 March)\nCoverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app\nLisa McIntosh is up-front with her thoughts on England's women facing world champions Australia in Las Vegas.\n\"Do you know? It makes me feel really proud,\" says the former Great Britain captain. \"But I'm not going to lie - I'm a bit envious.\n\"I'd have loved to have just turned up with my kitbag and got on the plane and played in Vegas. But I'm made up for them.\"\nWhen England's players step out at Allegiant Stadium in Vegas on Saturday night, McIntosh is part of the trailblazing group of women they can thank.\nTwenty-nine years ago, with minimal help, that group organised and self-funded a Great Britain tour to Australia - and beat the hosts. They remain the last British rugby league team to win an Ashes series.\nSo they know what it takes to defeat the Jillaroos.\n\"I think what England need to do is not fear them,\" McIntosh says. \"Australia are so good, that straight away people start to worry.\n\"But you go out there and you be confident. If you match them player for player, there's no reason why you can't beat them.\"\nBack in 1996, Great Britain's travelling party overcame the odds to defeat Australia.\nA series that was on a knife edge until its final seconds featured funding battles, scrambles for flights and accommodation, a tour manager carrying \u00a329,000 in a briefcase, disappearing kit and emotional phone calls home.\nThen came the forging of lifelong friendships, belated Hall of Fame recognition - and a victory shield that vanished.\nBut first came the fight just to get on to the pitch.\nPaula Clark was the team physio, Nikki Carter the tour manager, and Jackie Sheldon the assistant coach\n\"It was basically about two weeks before we were due to go that we actually knew we were going,\" says Jackie Sheldon, Great Britain's assistant coach in 1996.\nSheldon was secretary of the Women's Amateur Rugby League Association (Warla), which then oversaw the British women's game, when it received an invitation in 1995 to tour Australia.\nAccepting the offer was the easy part. Then came the trickier aspects. For a start, there wasn't a Great Britain women's team.\nSo with Warla chair Anne Thompson, Sheldon set up a committee to hire a head coach, find players and form a backroom team. With no budget, everyone had to be persuaded to take on the roles unpaid.\n\"These people who got involved were professional people,\" Sheldon says. \"And they were all giving their time for free.\n\"I would go: 'This is what I want, and I haven't got any money. Will you come on board?' And they'd say: 'Yeah.' Because they believed in what we were trying to do.\"\nIan Harris, a coach who worked in local authority sports development, took charge of the team, with Sheldon and Thompson as his assistants, and a squad of 26 was put together. Now they had to find \u00a370,000 to pay for the tour.\nSheldon, herself then a council sports development officer, got to work. \"We were not funded by anywhere,\" she says, \"so I wrote a grant application to the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, and we got something like \u00a334,000 from them. And each of the players were given a target of about \u00a31,000 to raise.\"\nAs the summer of 1996 approached, the plans were coming together.\nThen with just weeks to go, the team's tour manager dropped out - and chaos loomed.\nSheldon and Thompson knew Nikki Carter, a Hull Vixens player who had management experience from working at a care home. They asked if she would step in as tour manager.\n\"I was asked: 'Do you think you could help them out?'\" Carter says.\n\"I was like: 'What do you mean?' They said: 'Go to Australia with them.' I was like: 'Hmm, I'd love to. Best go and ask my boss, really.'\n\"But it suddenly started to unravel. Lots of things that should have been organised 12 weeks out from going to Australia weren't actually organised.\"\nThe touring party had no flights, no accommodation, no kit.\nSheldon says: \"The previous manager, prior to Nikki, had been tasked with securing the flights, and he didn't secure them and didn't tell us, so it was only about three weeks beforehand that it all came out that we had no flights.\n\"My manager allowed me time in work to phone all the airlines to try to get, I think, 32 flights at three weeks' notice.\"\nAs Sheldon sorted flights, Carter sourced kit, chased hotels and helped to complete the fundraising. \"Most of the money was raised in the final eight weeks,\" she says. They needed to set up a bank account quickly for the tour. And in 1996, that was a problem.\n\"There was no bank account set up in Australia,\" Carter says, \"and it wasn't like now, where you could ring the bank and say: 'I'm going to put this money in there and I'm going to spend it from my bank account.'\n\"One of the girls on the tour, who played for Wakefield, was a bank manager. And she said: 'It's not possible to set the bank account up. It took too long.'\n\"So I ended up going to Australia with a briefcase with \u00a329,000 in cash and travellers' cheques, because there just was no other way. I carried that briefcase through the whole tour - everywhere I went, that went.\"\nThe Great Britain party made it to Australia, but there were more obstacles. Arriving at Sydney Airport, they were hit with an immediate transport problem. Their coach was only big enough to fit either all the players, or all the kit - but not both. Carter, meanwhile, was organising team meals on the fly.\n\"I think there was a lot of bartering,\" captain McIntosh says, \"trying to get good deals, where we'd get breakfast and tea included.\"\nThe team faced seven matches in 19 days: a Sydney Select side were thumped 86-0, before an Australian Capital Territory side were defeated 36-0 in Canberra, where the first Test against Australia was also held.\nGreat Britain lost that match 16-14, to a late penalty - amid controversy.\n\"We got a penalty in the last few minutes,\" McIntosh says. \"Karen Burrows converted it, but the officials disallowed it - they said it didn't go over.\"\nNext was a trip north to Brisbane, with the team booked in for an exhausting 12-hour, 700-mile-plus coach journey. Tour manager Carter intervened.\n\"We'd gone on the coach from Sydney to Canberra, but we needed to fly to Brisbane,\" Carter says.\n\"So we went to the airport and I said: 'Would you be able to get us 32 flight tickets from Canberra to Brisbane tomorrow?' And the guy at the desk looked at me a bit strange. He tapped away and he said: 'Oh, yeah, yeah, we could do that.' Then I had to negotiate on all the luggage.\n\"And then I said to him: 'OK. How would I pay: Cash or travellers' cheques?' And this guy's face was a picture. So I paid for 32 flights with some travellers' cheques.\"\nIn Brisbane, the Great Britain and Australia players stayed in the same accommodation. \"They were like student dorms,\" McIntosh says.\nHere, there was another challenge for the tourists - keeping track of their kit.\n\"We were given each two shirts, so at the end of the tour, we had one to swap and one to keep so we could frame,\" McIntosh says. \"But the kit was laundered and a couple of shirts from our bag went missing, including my spare number 13 shirt.\n\"We never found out what happened to it, but we had our suspicions.\"\nBritain beat a Queensland XIII 22-8 to warm up for the second Test against Australia, and they won that key match 18-12 to level the series. Now it was back to Sydney for the decider.\nBut for some members of the squad with young children, being far away from home was proving tough.\n\"I rang home at certain times of the day because I knew the kids wouldn't be there,\" Carter says. \"My eldest daughter was six when I went. If I rang home, she would be crying down the phone, saying: 'I'm missing you, Mummy.' And it would then take days to recover from that phone call.\n\"There was that pang of guilt because I'm out here and I'm having a great time. At the same time, I've left my children at home - and as a mother, is that the right thing?\n\"It was hard and anybody in that position who says it wasn't, I think will be telling you porky pies.\"\nGreat Britain's team of 1996 are the only northern hemisphere women's side to have beaten Australia in a three-Test series\nAfter a 30-0 victory over a Presidents XIII in Sydney, Great Britain faced the deciding Test against Australia. It was a nail-biter.\nThe tourists built up a healthy lead, with McIntosh running half the length of the pitch for a fine individual try - but had to withstand a battering as Australia fought back. As the clock ticked down, Britain held a slender 20-18 lead.\n\"We were defending on our line for our lives for the last 10 minutes,\" McIntosh says. \"It just never seemed to end.\"\nThe captain has little memory of watching those closing minutes, having been concussed in a clattering tackle.\n\"When the final whistle went,\" McIntosh says, \"I said to Paula Clark, the team physio: Have we won?\n\"We didn't realise how significant it would be in time - winning the Ashes in Australia. It was just like: 'We beat the Aussies on their own turf and it was great.'\"\nLisa McIntosh and vice-captain Brenda Dobek would be later inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame\nThe Britain squad returned to a quiet reception at Heathrow. \"We came through the airport and it was like tumbleweed,\" McIntosh says.\nBut off the back of the series win, Sheldon convinced Sport England to fund a national women's rugby league development manager and was asked to take on the role. She would also be England's head coach through a 1998 tour to New Zealand, the World Cups of 2000 and 2003 and, in between, a return tour to Australia in 2002.\n\"The development dropped off after 2003, when I left,\" Sheldon says. \"GB was not a priority for the RFL at the time. It was re-established in 2007 when they started getting Sport England funding for it, but neither England nor GB have beaten Australia since 2002.\n\"You can see the difference in terms of what Australia started to do after that period.\n\"It's physicality, building the team, intensity of competition, and development of the women's game, so you've got breadth and depth of players coming through. It's an infrastructure you need, and you can see it in Australia.\"\nBelatedly, Great Britain's 1996 team have been recognised. Former referee Julia Lee, who officiated during the tour, began driving the Women in Rugby League project, a celebration of the sport's female pioneers.\nIn 2022, McIntosh joined team-mates Brenda Dobek and Sally Milburn as they became the first women inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame.\nLast October, Jane Banks and Michelle Land followed, while the 1996 side became the first team to be inducted.\n\"I think it's sad that it took so long, but I think it's fantastic that we're in a different place now,\" Carter says.\nOctober's ceremony in Wigan brought virtually the entire squad back together.\n\"There was a camaraderie that was built in '96,\" Carter says. \"We all met up for the Hall of Fame inauguration, and it was like we'd never been away from each other.\"\nGreat Britain's players made long-lasting friendships with the Australians too - which finally reunited McIntosh with one of her shirts.\n\"I never found the shirt that was taken during the tour, but I did get back the one that I swapped,\" McIntosh says. \"Their captain, who I swapped my shirt with, returned it to me.\"\nBut there's one major memento from 1996 that no-one can find.\nGreat Britain's team, mostly in Australia shirts, show off the shield that later went missing\nBritain's players, wearing the Australia shirts they had just swapped, posed for a team picture after winning the series.\nIn that special moment, they showed off their prize - a large shield.\nThree years ago, before an exhibition to celebrate their achievements, an appeal was put out to locate the shield. It hasn't turned up.\n\"We thought we'd brought it back, and that it was at the RFL,\" McIntosh says. \"But it's not.\"\nThe mystery remains unresolved. \"Lisa always said she reckoned I had it in my attic,\" Sheldon says. \"I've got just about everything else in my attic but not that shield.\"\nIf anyone does have it, they're sitting on a piece of history. \n\"It's in somebody's attic, because I can't see where else it would have gone,\" Carter says. \"So maybe everyone needs to look in their attic!\"",

        "article_text": "Italian cuisine may be one of the most recognised and loved in the world \u2013 often imagined as a collection of ancient recipes and local traditions preserved by skilful nonnas over the centuries. But now, a food historian is exposing common myths and false stories, arguing that the Italian cuisine as we know it is barely a few decades old.\nFood is no doubt an integral part of the country's culture and identity \u2013 so much so that Italians cherish Neapolitan pizza or pasta alla carbonara as much as the great historical and artistic treasures of the boot-shaped peninsula. Tales abound of centuries-old local feuds over what city has the best filled pasta, while every local cheese or cured meat is likely to boast links to the Renaissance or the Middle Ages.\nAlberto Grandi, food historian and professor of economic history at the University of Parma, has been debunking Italian food myths for years. In 2018, Grandi published Denominazione di Origine Inventata (Invented Designation of Origin: The Lies of Marketing on Typical Italian Products) and later launched a podcast called DOI. But it was a 2023 interview with Financial Times that put Grandi's work into the spotlight and sparked wide debates across Italy.\nGrandi claimed in the interview that pasta alla carbonara was invented in Italy just after World War Two using US Army provisions like bacon and powdered egg yolks, countering the common belief that the authentic recipe includes pork jowl and Roman pecorino cheese. This theory is backed by other authors, like Luca Cesari in The Discovery of Pasta: A History in Ten Dishes, but caused outrage in a country increasingly obsessed with maintaining the lore of Italian authenticity in food. The discussion evolved into a heated Italian-American dispute about the origin of the iconic dish. \u00a0\nGrandi's latest book, La Cucina Italiana Non Esiste (Italian Cuisine Doesn't Exist), written with his podcast co-host Daniele Soffiati and published in April 2024, stirred new controversies with its provocative title.\u00a0\nThe idea that many beloved recipes and products such as cheeses or cured meats have hundreds of years of history, Grandi and Soffiati claim, is pure fantasy. Food is constantly changing and evolving. No product or recipe has always been as we know it now, and most dishes have a shorter history than most people imagine.\nGrandi argues that migration is what made Italian cuisine what it is today. Millions of people left Italy in the 19th and 20th Centuries, emigrating to South America, North America and European countries. They were leaving behind a country that was poverty-stricken, where the diet was limited to a handful of products. Pellagra, a disease caused by lack of vitamin B3, was endemic in several areas of Italy at the end of the 19th Century.\u00a0\nThe Italians who landed on New York's Ellis Island left hunger and misery behind. And it was in the \"new world\", Grandi argues, that Italian immigrants found the wealth and ingredients to create the recipes that eventually popularised Italian food worldwide.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nHowever, many Italians are not familiar with this history. They might imagine that their beloved recipes were born in Italy, passed down, unchanged, from generation to generation and eventually exported abroad by Italian migrants. \"It might seem that the rest of the world didn't know how to eat until all of a sudden Italians arrived,\" says Grandi. He believes it's pure myth \u2013 popularised by social media \u2013 that nonnas taught Americans how to cook rich, genuine Italian food.\nPizza is the most famous example of this. Born as a cheap street food in Naples, in the 19th Century it was almost synonymous with poverty and filth. Pizza is \"a crust of leavened bread dough, oven-toasted, with a sauce of a bit of everything on top\", wrote Pinocchio author Carlo Collodi in 1886. He added that pizza had \"an air of complex filth that perfectly matches that of its vendor\".\nIt was in America, says Grandi, that pizza became \"red\". While fresh tomatoes were among the original toppings, Italian immigrants to the US popularised pizza prepared with tomato sauce, a product that industrialisation made easy to access and store. And it was in the US that pizzerias really started to take off. \u00a0\nScholars call this process \"the pizza effect\": when a product leaves its place of origin, gets profoundly transformed and then returns to its place of origin to be fully embraced in a completely different form.\nGrandi also angered Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese producers when he argued that parmesan has evolved for the better over the last few decades, and the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese that was eaten in Italy 100 years ago and earlier \u2013 a smaller wheel with a black rind \u2013 is now only made in Wisconsin.\nThe shift in the Italian culinary landscape started with the rapid expansion that occurred in Italy post-WWII. The boom brought new possibilities to millions of Italians. Cars, supermarkets and refrigerators meant that people who were limited to a daily local supply could travel to restaurants, buy new products and create new recipes. Tiramisu, says Grandi, is a great example of this: a dessert created in the late 1960s that is based on supermarket ingredients and only possible with a refrigerator. \u00a0\u00a0\nWith the new products and brands also came marketing. \"Television influenced our cuisine and gastronomical identity greatly,\" says Grandi. He argues that most of Italy's gastronomic traditions were invented by food marketers. Carosello, a short television programme that aired in Italy every night from 1957 to 1977, introduced new products and brands through stories, sketches and iconic characters. Carosello provided the consumer education upon which Italian home cuisine was then built, especially by mothers and grandmothers.\nGrandi's book explains that when industry-driven growth started to lose steam in the 1970s, Italy's economy pivoted to small companies, niche products and local excellence. Thousands of protected labels and regional products emerged and Italians doubled down on gastro-nationalism.\n\"Cuisine is no longer part of our identity,\" says Grandi, \"it is our identity.\" He argues that after decades of industry decline and economic stagnation, Italians have no faith in the future \u2013 that's why they \"invent the past\".\nIn less than a century, Grandi says, Italians went from being malnourished migrants to self-appointed custodians of ancestral traditions. The obsession for tradition has sparked searches for \"true\" recipes and \"correct\" ways of consuming food. Italians are ever more adamant to say that bolognese should be called rag\u00f9 alla bolognese and never served with spaghetti. You should also never put chicken (let alone pineapple) on pizza, cook pasta alla carbonara with cream or break spaghetti in two.\n\"I always say that every time anyone in the world adds cream to carbonara, somebody in Rome dies,\" says Grandi. \"Italians used to get upset when they were defined as 'pizza, pasta, mandolin, mafia',\" he adds. \"Now it looks like it's us Italians feeding those stereotypes.\"\nSocial media seems to have contributed to popularising these attitudes. The X account Italians mad at food, launched in 2015, showcases comments of furious Italians who are outraged and offended by how people in other nations choose to eat \"their\" cuisine. The account even sells t-shirts with quotes like \"carbonara is not an opinion\" and \"you break spaghetti, you break my heart\".\nContent creators on platforms like TikTok and Instagram have popularised a genre of video content showing Italians reacting to food \"blasphemy\", with creators and celebrities vigorously showcasing their disgust and indignation \u2013 with no shortage of drama and hand gestures.\nThe popularity of these memes is now so widespread that people might think all Italians feel offended by people's choice of pasta sauce.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\n\"Food as entertainment can be triggering, especially for Italians,\" says Aurora Cavallo, a young Italian chef known as Cooker Girl, with more than 1.3 million followers on both TikTok and Instagram. \"For many people in the world, food isn't just an object but something that carries a lot of significance,\" she adds. \"In my experience, Italians can be more sensitive not just towards recipes, but also towards how food is handled on screen.\"\nGrandi's relentless debunking of Italian food myths has made many people angry over the last few years, but he is adamant that he just wants to dispute the invented history of many products and recipes, not their quality.\nAs social media demonstrates, however, some Italians have convinced themselves that food dogmas are more important than innovations or accuracy.\n\"We don't need to make up stories about Italy's amazing products,\" says Cavallo, echoing Grandi. \"We shouldn't create a situation in which changing recipes is the end of the world because that's the opposite of how Italian food came to be.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Nudity, swearing, petulance, club anthems, more nudity and a woman dressed as a horse - the 2025 Brit Awards had it all.\nCharli XCX was the big winner, taking home five prizes in all - including best artist, best album and song of the year.\nUS star - and the BBC's Sound of 2025 - Chappell Roan picked up two awards; while Ezra Collective, The Last Dinner Party, Fontaines DC and Stormzy got one apiece.\nBut no-one's only interested in all that. Here's what really went down at the 2025 ceremony at London's O2 Arena.\nListen, this was never going to be anything other than Charli's night. \nThe pop star's seventh album, Brat, captured the cultural zeitgeist in a way that few artists ever manage.\nReleased in June, the record combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork; as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she's accumulated along the way, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.\nIn the star's own words, the album was \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".\nJust as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Lorde, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.\nCritics called it \"pop music for the future\" and praised the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's coming of age. \nKnowingly trashy, yet surprisingly deep, it was easily the best British album of the last 12 months - and one that proved Charli's detractors wrong.\n\"I feel like dance music, electronic music, gets a really bad rep because everyone is like, 'It's not that deep, is it? And I kind of feel it is,\" she said after collecting her second award.\n\"This genre of music, for me, is euphoric, it allows me to escape, it allows me to feel on such a deep level.\"\nTeddy Swims, swimming in teddy bears. We see what he did there.\nJade Thirlwall was the last of the Little Mix crew to launch a solo career, but she's been giving it her all. \nAs well as winning best pop artist at Saturday's ceremony, she put on one of the night's highest-concept performances - a five-act melodrama about the cruelty of the music industry and her creative rebirth.\nOver the course of the night, she wore six different outfits. But she chose the wrong one for climbing the stairs to pick up her trophy. Thank goodness the Sugababes were there to help.\nJack Whitehall made a welcome return as the ceremony's host, after four years away.\nAs ever, his jokes were close to the bone... including a passing reference to allegations surrounding some presenters on Brits broadcaster ITV.\n\"ITV had so many of its presenters cancelled this year that they had to come crawling back to an ex, and what an honour it is to be hosting again the biggest night in British music,\" he joked.\nLater, he described Youtuber-turned-musician KSI as \"an inspiration\".\n\"Because you listen to Kendrick Lamar and you're like, 'I couldn't do that in a million years'. Then I listen to your song and I'm like, 'Oh, I could do this'.\"\nSpeaking before the show, Whitehall revealed a sneaky secret: He uses a fake script during rehearsals.\n\"Previously I used to do the actual script in rehearsal, and then you'd have an hour of people from record labels and publishers coming and knocking on the dressing room door going, 'You can't say this, you can't say that',\" he told Heart radio.\n\"So now I just do this fake script, which if you heard it, you'd be like, 'This is the lamest script ever', because it's all me just complimenting everyone and going, 'Oh, our next award is the best musician I've ever heard. They're great.'\"\n\"I'm wearing shades because I mashed up my eye playing padel [ball],\" said Stormzy, as he accepted the prize for best rap/hip-hop artist.\n\"I've got a very sore eye. I've got a bruised cornea.\n\"My eye's sore under here, I'm not being a mad man with shades on inside.\"\nSabrina Carpenter pretended to pleasure a Beefeater. \nCharli XCX gave a speech in a see-through top, with no bra. \nOne of Jade Thirlwall's dancers mooned at the camera. \nDanny Dyer uttered one of the English language's most offensive swear words.\nI'd guess that ITV's responses to Ofcom are going to make an interesting read.\nWord of the censor's concerns even filtered through to the arena during the show, much to Charli's annoyance.\n\"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,\" she said from the podium. I feel like we're in the era of free the nipple though, right?\"\nAs fans applauded, the singer grimaced: \"They put the clap track on, cool. Thanks for being on my side.\"\nThe Brits were set up in 1977 to celebrate the British Music Industry, and they are run by the BPI - an organisation funded by, and representing, the biggest record labels in the country.\nBut lots of the winners on Saturday used their speeches to criticise the way they are being treated.\n\"Are we building careers, or are we just chasing moments - because moments fade and careers take time,\" said Myles Smith. \"So please stick with artists past a viral hit.\"\nChappell Roan, who won best international artist, had a similar plea.\n\"I had to write a lot of bad songs to get to the good ones - and artists deserve that freedom, to explore horrible concepts, and to flop, and rise, and not be pressured into making music based off of what's trending.\"\nCharli XCX's multiple victories proved their point. Signed at the age of 14, she had to fight to make the music she wanted - after years of being told her songs were too abrasive and uncommercial.\n\"It feels really nice to be recognised on this album, when I haven't made any sacrifices,\" she said.\n\"I've been doing my own thing in my own corner of the industry - and I guess, this time, culture caught up with us.\"\nMyles Smith has had an incredible 12 months. After giving up his job to pursue music, his feel-good pop anthem Stargazing went viral. So viral that it ended up as the best-selling British song of 2024.\nAsked about the moment he realised it had taken on a life of its own, he told us: \"I got new wi-fi the other day, and they put me on hold... and it was Stargazing.\n\"And that said two things. One: This is like, the most irritating thing. But at the same time, I had made it to hold.\"\n\"Did you sing it for the operator when they picked up?\" we asked. \n\"No, I was passed to seven more people.\"\nSee? Being a pop star doesn't give you any shortcuts in the world of broadband service provider call centres.\nWhy did Jared Leto open his red carpet interview by trying to teach us an English accent?\nTo find out, you'd have to ask Jared Leto and, frankly, we're too scared.\nSabrina Carpenter was the night's biggest star - opening the show with a cheeky wink, a phalanx of Beefeaters and a vaudevillian mash-up of Espresso, Bed Chem and... er, Rule, Britannia.\nBut was the decision to hand her the \"global success\" award a thinly-veiled ploy to tempt her back on to the stage?\nThe prize was originally created in 2013 to recognise British acts who had sold millions of records and concert tickets abroad. The previous recipients were One Direction (2013-14), Sam Smith (2015), Adele (2016-17) and Ed Sheeran (2018-19).\nSix years ago it was abandoned altogether... until they needed something to honour Sabrina.\nTo be fair, the singer racked up an incredible 21 weeks at number one in the UK singles chart last year - more than anyone has ever achieved in a single calendar year - so her trophy wasn't entirely undeserved. \nA lot of viewers were left perplexed when Jack Whitehall sat down with Danny Dyer and what appeared to be his date: A woman with a horse for a face (we're not being unkind, see above for proof).\nWell, it turns out that Danny's neighbour was a German DJ who goes by the name of HorsegiirL and keeps their identity hidden behind a mask. Sort of like Deadmau5, but with fetlocks.\nMaybe next year she can come back to do a duet with Foals.\n \nEzra Collective made history by becoming the first jazz band to win the Brit Award for best group - beating previous title-holders like Coldplay, The Cure and Bring Me The Horizon.\nTaking to the stage, frontman Femi Koleoso had a few words to say about cuts to music education, and the lack of funding for youth clubs like Tomorrow's Warriors - where his band got their start.\n\"I'll bang this drum a bunch of times and I'll continue to do so until the entire country gets it\", he said.\n\"This moment right here is because of the great youth clubs, and the great teachers and the great schools that support young people playing music.\n\"The reason we continue to bang this drum is because so many of the problems that face greater society in the UK...  we're unsure of how to fix it, but the solution lies with giving a young person a trumpet, the solution lies in giving a young person a saxophone.\n\"Because when you do that, you give them a dream, an aspiration and a goal.\"\nTo prove his point, he invited the London youth group Kinetika Bloco onto the stage of the O2, to blast through Ezra Collective's infectiously upbeat jazz anthem Shaking Body.\nThis year's Brit Award trophies, designed by Gabriel Moses, were cast in bronze... And they were heavy. \nWeighing 1.6kg each, you could break a toe if you dropped one. And Charli had to pick up four of the things for her winner's photo.\nIt took approximately six people to arrange them in her arms (\"don't push them between my boobs\", she squealed at one point) before she was ready for the flashbulbs.\n\"Is this lame?\" she asked at the last moment. \"It feels lame.\"\nThen she dropped them all and fell to the floor in a fit of giggles.",

        "article_text": "Was it pruning or felling? \nThe alleged chopping of centuries-old chinar trees in Indian-administered Kashmir has sparked outrage, with locals and photos suggesting they were cut down, while the government insists it was just routine pruning. The debate has renewed focus on the endangered tree and efforts to preserve it.\nThe chinar is an iconic symbol of the Kashmir valley's landscape and a major tourist draw, especially in autumn when the trees' leaves light up in fiery hues of flaming red to a warm auburn.\nThe trees are native to Central Asia but were introduced to Kashmir centuries ago by Mughal emperors and princely kings. Over the years, they have come to occupy an important place in Kashmiri culture.\nBut rapid urbanisation, illegal logging and climate change are threatening their survival, prompting authorities to take steps to conserve them.\nThe Jammu and Kashmir government has been geotagging chinar trees in an effort to keep track of them and their health. The project involves attaching a QR code to each tree with information about its location, age and other physical characteristics. \n\"We are 'digitally protecting' chinar trees,\" says Syed Tariq, a scientist who's heading the project. He explains that information provided by the QR code can help locals and tourists get to known more about a tree, but it can also help counter problems like illegal or hasty cutting of them.\nThe project has geotagged about 29,000 chinar trees so far, with another 6,000\u20137,000 still left to be mapped.\nDespite its heritage value, there was no proper count of these trees, says Mr Syed. While government records cite 40,000, he calls the figure debatable but is certain their numbers have declined.\nThis is a problem because the tree takes at least 50 years to reach maturity. Environmentalists say new plantations are facing challenges like diminishing space. Additionally, chinar trees need a cool climate to survive, but the region has been experiencing warmer summers and snowless winters of late.\nBut on the bright side, these trees can live for hundreds of years - the oldest chinar tree in the region is believed to be around 700 years old. A majority of the trees are at least a few centuries old and have massive trunks and sprawling canopies.\nThe trees received maximum patronage during the Mughal period, which stretched from the early 1500s to the mid-1800s. Many of the trees that exist in the valley were planted during this period, Mr Syed says.\nThe Mughal kings, who ruled many parts of erstwhile India, made Kashmir their summer getaway due to its cool climate and beautiful scenery. They also erected \"pleasure gardens\" - landscaped gardens famous for their symmetry and greenery - for their entertainment. \nThe chinar enjoyed pride of place in these gardens and the trees were usually planted along water channels to enhance the beauty of the place. Many of these gardens exist even today.\nAccording to government literature,  in the 16th Century Mughal emperor Akbar planted around 1,100 trees in one such pleasure garden near the famous Dal Lake in Srinagar, but about 400 have perished over the years due to road-widening projects and diseases caused by pests. \nEmperor Jahangir, Akbar's son, is said to have planted four chinar trees on a tiny island in Dal Lake, giving it the name Char Chinar (Four Chinars) - now a major tourist draw. Over time, two trees were lost to age and disease, until the government replaced them with transplanted mature trees in 2022.\nInterestingly, the chinar is protected under the Jammu and Kashmir Preservation of Specified Trees Act, 1969, which regulates its felling and export and requires official approval even for pruning. The law remains in force despite the region losing statehood in 2019.   \nBut environmental activist Raja Muzaffar Bhat says authorities often exploit legal loopholes to cut down chinar trees.\n\"Under the garb of pruning, entire trees are felled,\" he says, citing a recent alleged felling in Anantnag district that sparked outrage.\n\"The government is geotagging trees on one side, but cutting them on the other,\" he says. He adds that while authorities remove trees for urban projects, locals also fell them illegally.\nChinar trees have durable hardwood, ideal for carvings, furniture and artefacts. Locals also use them for firewood and making herbal medicine.\nGovernment projects like geotagging are raising awareness, says Mr Bhat. He adds that Kashmiris, deeply attached to the chinar as part of their heritage, now speak out against its felling or damage.\nLast week, many posted photos of the allegedly chopped trees in Anantnag on X (formerly Twitter) while opposition leaders demanded that the government launch an investigation and take action against the culprits.\n\"The government should protect the trees in letter and in spirit,\" Mr Bhat says. \n\"Because without chinar, Kashmir won't feel like home.\"",

In the end it happens.\n\"It should not happen, but this is something that happens in football.\"\nBoth Matt Doherty and Boubacar Traore missed spot-kicks for Wolves in the 5-4 shootout defeat after a 1-1 draw over 120 minutes at Vitality Stadium.\nIt was a dramatic climax to a game where Evanilson had put the Cherries ahead on his return from injury, before his fellow Brazilian Cunha levelled with a sensational equaliser from around 30 yards.\nHowever, Cunha's display went from magical to madness with a dismissal that will leave his side - fourth bottom in the Premier League - without their best player for crucial games in their relegation fight.\nThe red-mist moment, where he clashed multiple times with Kerkez, including fighting, kicking out at the Hungarian full-back while he was on the ground and aiming a headbutt when Kerkez had got back to his feet.\nAfter being pulled away by team-mates, referee Sam Barrott eventually gave him a red card but a furious Cunha refused to leave the field, needing to be escorted and pushed down the tunnel. \nHe will be suspended for three games following the red card for violent conduct, but additional games cannot be ruled out because of the severity of the incident and having already served a two-match ban for clashing with Ipswich Town security in December.\nFormer Arsenal defender Martin Keown said on Match of the Day: \"The ability he has is top level, the goal he scored belongs in the Champions League, but then suddenly we see the ugly.\n\"I have not seen that on the football pitch since the 1970s - he just lost it. The referee had to send him off. They couldn't get him out of the ground. This was the ugly part and it is something he has to stop.\n\"Wolves need points to stay up. He will be a huge loss.\"\nCunha sent off as Bournemouth beat Wolves on penalties\nWhy did Bournemouth VAR check take eight minutes?\nWolves have what could be described as a favourable run of fixtures coming up against teams in the bottom half of the Premier League. \nBut Cunha is certain to miss matches against Everton, bottom club Southampton and West Ham, while third-bottom Ipswich follow on 5 April.\nWolves have built a five-point buffer over Ipswich and Leicester City after winning two of their past four league matches.\nBut losing talisman Cunha will be a massive blow, given he is their top league scorer on 13 goals and their attacking inspiration in this troubled campaign.\nCunha was sent off in the 120th minute of the match in the FA Cup fifth-round tie at Vitality Stadium\nCunha has been linked with a big-money move over the past year with Europe's top clubs keen, but he may be viewed as a loose cannon because of his antics.\nAs well as his aggressive display at Bournemouth, in an unsavoury incident at Ipswich earlier in the season, Cunha elbowed a member of the Portman Road staff before snatching his glasses off his face.\nThe Brazil forward is known to have a \u00a362.5m release clause in place which may also put off suitors looking to secure a summer transfer.\nWolves boss Pereira told BBC Match of the Day: \"When the situation happened I was looking for the ball.\n\"It means that I didn't see the situation, but football is emotional and the level was very high today. Not only inside the pitch, but outside [the pitch]. With a lot of pressure, and in the end these are things that can happen.\n\"You know now he is frustrated, he is better in my opinion. I never speak to the team when we are nervous or frustrated. It is better to wait one day and think about everything. After we can have a talk.\n\"Of course, he is an important player, but next game we play with 11 and start with 11.\"\nSpeaking in his post-match news conference, he added: \"Matheus is a special player and today he played extra time. The last three weeks he has a problem in the hamstring and he tried.\n\"I didn't see the situation. Don't ask me about it because I was looking at the other end. In the end the referee decided the red card.\"\nAsked about whether Cunha deserves another chance, Pereira added: \"Of course, he is important but I cannot speak about what I don't know. It is important to check the situation, to look for what happened because I was looking for the other side.\n\"The others say to me he kick, he punch, he do what he did with the head and the player went to hospital? No, OK. But it is a situation that cannot happen of course.\n\"To judge the situation, I must have the clear image in my mind.\"\nBournemouth boss Andoni Iraola criticised the decision to show Kerkez a yellow card in the Cunha clash. It was was the defender's second in this season's FA Cup and means he will be banned from playing in the quarter-final tie.\n\"Milos Kerkez has received a yellow card for adopting an aggressive attitude,\" said Iraola. \"After what they have done to Milos Kerkez, they should reward him because [of] the attitude he has.\n\"They punch him, they kick him on the floor, they headbutt him and he doesn't react! You punish this? I will have to say to Milos [that] probably I cannot do as well as a player.\n\"The prize is they show him a yellow card and he will not play the quarter-final. Yes, I am very disappointed with the refereeing.\"\nLatest Wolves news, analysis and fan views\nGet Wolves news sent straight to your phone",

A BBC spokesperson said: \"Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone features important stories we think should be told - those of the experiences of children in Gaza. \"The letter, sent to Mr Davie, BBC board chair Samir Shah, chief content officer Charlotte Moore, and CEO of BBC News Deborah Turness, said the film offered an \"all-too-rare perspective on the lived experiences of Palestinian children\".It reads: \"Beneath this political football are children who are in the most dire circumstances of their young lives.",

        "article_text": "A trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer.\nSpeaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged \"a real trade deal\" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners. \nThe trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade. \nSir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an \"unprecedented\" second state visit to the UK.  \nReceiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a \"great honour\" and described the King as \"a wonderful man\".\nSir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was \"truly historic\". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit. \nHaving confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes.\nThe US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. \nOn the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. \nHowever, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine.\nAsked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \"backstop\". \nHe said \"nobody will play around\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals. \nThe US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\". \n\"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\" he said. \nHe later added he had \"a lot of respect\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday.\nThe UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders. \nHowever, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\". \nThe deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back. \nAfter taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\". \nReferring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. \n\"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said. \nHe said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century. \n\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said. \nTrump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union. \nHe also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.\nAsked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\"\n\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"\nIn a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\". \nSince leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.\nIn his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way.\nHowever, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems. \nThe head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce - a former Labour MP and minister - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that businesses will be encouraged by what he called an \"important first step\".\n\"In trade negotiations, relationships matter,\" says William Bain, adding that seeing the two leaders find common ground on their respective economies and trade is \"helpful\".\nHe added that a deal to keep tariffs low would most benefit automotive and pharmaceutical industries in the UK.",

Instead of just hugging the star, the woman appeared to have kissed his face, with Jin responding by turning his face away.\nThe kiss angered other BTS fans, one of whom filed a criminal complaint against her, leading police to launch an investigation. \nOn 13 June, 2024, the day after he was discharged from the army, Jin, whose real name is Kim Seok-jin, held a fan event where he hugged 1,000 fans and performed songs in front of 3,000 others.\nDuring the three-hour long \"hugathon\", fans who won the chance to embrace him queued up and went on stage one by one to meet the 33-year-old star.\nBut one of them caused an uproar when she appeared to kiss Jin's face. \nClips of the moment went viral on the internet. Videos show that Jin, taken aback by the move, tried to turn his head while hugging the woman before quickly moving on to the next fan. Fans could also be seen reacting angrily to her actions. \nShe later wrote on her blog later that she kissed him \"on his neck\" and \"the skin was very soft\".\nThe woman's identity has not been revealed but police added that they had identified her with the assistance from their Japanese counterparts. \nThe BBC has reached out to BTS' agency HYBE for comment. \nJin is the first BTS member to have been discharged from military duty. He was followed by J-Hope who was discharged in October. The other four - V, RM, Jimin, Jungkook and Suga - are still serving and the band is expected to reunite only in June 2025.\nK-pop idols are known for having a close relationship with their fanbases through various communication channels and events. It's common for artists to communicate with fans through social media livestream chats and in-person events to cultivate loyal fans.\nBut fans and agencies have increasingly been aware of some toxic fan cultures as well. For example, many artists have been vocal about the stress caused by \"sasaeng fans\", who are overly obsessed with their idols that would stalk and harass the artists.",

        "article_text": "Some people seek fame or infamy on social media, while others find themselves embroiled in a storm of unsolicited and often vitriolic comments. This happened to a Cambridge University academic - but how has being in the spotlight affected her?\nA photo of Dr Ally Louks and her completed PhD thesis, posted to X in November 2024, attracted viral fame when it was viewed more than 120 million times - and the numbers have risen steadily since then.\nAmong the congratulations and interest in her subject - \"the politics of smell\" - were many disturbing comments, mysogynistic, accusatory and personally threatening.\nReflecting on the experience three months on, she says: \"This has undoubtedly changed my life... and while I would not wish this on anyone, it has given me a platform to speak positively about academia and research.\"\nDr Louks, a supervisor in English Literature at the university, is a self-confessed introvert and rarely used social media before posting her photo - which was mainly intended for her friends - on X.\nHer subject - \"Olfactory Ethics: The politics of smell in modern and contemporary prose\" - explored \"why certain writers of the past century use the language associated with smell to characterise harmful attitudes towards objects of disgust and desire\".\n\"I draw on the well-documented history of olfactory prejudice in order to examine its contemporary relevance,\" she says.\nFor example, her work looked at Hitler's claims about the smell of Jewish people in his book Mein Kampf, and how descriptions of the transatlantic slave trade were also used \"to legitimize racism\".\nHer seemingly innocent post attracted a number of abusive comments from people who believed women should stay out of academia and those who did not understand her work, and were \"under-informed or indeed uninformed\", as she puts it.\nThe comments included threats of rape and death.\nWithin about 36 hours of her post, the haters got on board.\n\"It was pretty all-consuming for the first week,\" she says. \n\"Replies were coming in far faster than I could read them, so I wasn't sleeping much in an attempt to keep up with the conversation. \n\"I won't pretend that it was pleasant to have people saying unkind things, but the critiques were ultimately quite baseless as they were based on the title and abstract of my thesis alone or were downright misogynistic. \n\"It never caused me to question the value or validity of my work. I tried to approach the situation with openness and intellectual curiosity, because there was some valid scepticism, and I've relished the opportunity to prove the worth of my work among the public audience that I've been gifted.\"\nDr Louks says she tried to approach the attention - both good and bad - in a positive way - and would advise anyone else to do the same.\n\"The positive comments I received significantly outweighed the negatives, but the negative ones were liked and shared which boosted them to the top of my feed.\n\"I refused to engage with anyone who was aggressive or insulting but I did respond to some people who were sceptical or just didn't understand my work. I was perfectly happy to prove the validity of it.\n\"I don't engage so there's no point in the negative posters carrying on.\n\"My story shows that it's possible to remain both open to criticism and respectful of others online whilst also defending what matters, which is the value and validity of research in the humanities and the legitimacy of women's role in academia.\"\n\"Initially I was very shaken up when the hateful comments starting coming in,\" she says.\n\"I'm an introvert and I never asked for this - and while some people say they are even jealous of this social media 'fame', I wouldn't wish this on anyone.\n\"But it has given me a platform to talk about the importance of academia so for me, personally, it's undoubtedly been a good thing.\"\nDr Louks now has been assigned both a British and American literary agent.\n\"It doesn't go over my head that the reason that I have all of these opportunities is because people responded to my work with such scepticism initially,\" she previously told the BBC.\nDr Louks says she received - and continues to receive - support from both her college and the university as a whole, which she describes as \"really heartening\".\n\"This experience has undoubtedly changed my life... but in many ways this experience hasn't changed me. \n\"I think a lot of people want this kind of attention, but I have never harboured a desire to become famous. \n\"What I am passionate about doing is sharing my research, sparking conversations about important social phenomena, and translating academic work for public audiences, and this experience has given me a platform to do that and to perhaps turn that into a career.\"\nFor someone who used to shy away from social media, she admits that \"all of the things I post get a lot of attention now because I have gained a large following. \n\"But the attention has been overwhelmingly positive since that initial post. \n\"I do think very carefully about what I say online now, and as a generally offline person, it has been a real learning experience, but I think you typically can't go too wrong if you remain open to feedback and approach discussions with generosity and a willingness to listen.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

        "article_text": "Listen to Sue read this article \nIn a busy, terraced house in Bradford, three sisters are animatedly chatting. It's a big day at their home: a beautician sits on their sofa, styling their hair and makeup. The room is warm with fun and laughter. It feels like a scene from a Jane Austen novel: three women in their late 20s, each of them bursting with personality, swapping stories.\nAnd like most Austen novels, the conversation often turns to marriage.\nThe sisters are preparing for a family wedding at the weekend - where the bride and groom are first cousins. Many people might find this unusual, but in their family and in some parts of Bradford, it's fairly common.\nAyesha, who at 29 is the oldest of the three sisters, also married her first cousin in 2017. She has two children with her husband and their marriage is happy, she says. It felt perfectly normal at the time to marry her cousin. Their mother, a Pakistani migrant, assumed it was what all three of her daughters would do.\nBut 26-year-old Salina, the youngest of the three, tells us she broke the mould by having what they call a \"love\" marriage, choosing a partner from outside the family. Salina tells us she is outgoing and ambitious; marrying a cousin simply did not appeal to her. Then there's Mallika, who at 27 is the middle of the three. She's still single and has already decided not to marry within her family.\n\"I said to my mum that I wouldn't judge my sisters but I wasn't going to do it,\" Mallika tells us. She says having an education has created opportunities for her. \"Before, even if you had an education, you wouldn't be expected to carry on with it. You would be thinking of marriage. Now the mindset is so different.\"\nIn the UK and across Europe, cousin marriage is coming under increased scrutiny - particularly from doctors, who warn that children of first cousins are more likely to experience an array of health problems.\nAnd there's now some new, potentially worrying data from Bradford to add into that mix.\nResearchers at the city's university are entering their 18th year of the Born in Bradford study. It's one of the biggest medical trials of its kind: between 2007 and 2010, researchers recruited more than 13,000 babies in the city and then followed them closely from childhood into adolescence and now into early adulthood. More than one in six children in the study have parents who are first cousins, mostly from Bradford's Pakistani community, making it among the world's most valuable studies of the health impacts of cousin marriage.\nAnd in data published in the last few months - and analysed in an upcoming episode of BBC Radio 4's Born in Bradford series -  the researchers found that first cousin-parentage may have wider consequences than previously thought.\nThe most obvious way that a pair of blood-related parents might increase health risks for a child is through a recessive disorder, like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell disease.  According to the classic theory of genetics laid out by the biologist Gregor Mendel,  if both parents carry a recessive gene then there's a one in four chance that their child will inherit the condition. And when parents are cousins, they're more likely to both be carriers. A child of first cousins carries a 6% chance of inheriting a recessive disorder, compared to 3% for the general population.\nBut the Bradford study took a much broader view - and sheds fresh light. The researchers weren't just looking at whether a child had been diagnosed with a specific recessive disorder. Instead they studied dozens of data points, observing everything from the children's speech and language development to their frequency of healthcare to their performance at school. Then they used a mathematical model to try to eliminate the impacts of poverty and parental education - so they could focus squarely on the impact on \"consanguinity\", the scientific word for having parents who are related.\nThey found that even after factors like poverty were controlled for, a child of first cousins in Bradford had an 11% probability of being diagnosed with a speech and language problem, versus 7% for children whose parents are not related.\nThey also found a child of first cousins has a 54% chance of reaching a \"good stage of development\" (a government assessment given to all five year-olds in England), versus 64% for children whose parents are not related.\nWe get further insight into their poorer health through the number of visits to the GP. Children of first cousins have a third more primary care appointments than children whose parents are not related - an average of four instead of three a year.\nWhat is notable is that even once you account for the children in that group who already have a diagnosed recessive disorder, the figures suggest consanguinity may be affecting even those children who don't have a diagnosable recessive disorder.\nNeil Small, emeritus professor at the University of Bradford and the author of the study, says that even if all of the children with recessive disorders visited their GP more than average, \"this does not explain the much wider distribution of excess health care usage in the consanguineous children\".\nThe study, he says, is \"exciting because it gives the opportunity for a much more accurate development of a response, targeting interventions and treatments\".\nIt is, of course, just one study, and the population of Bradford is not representative of the whole of the UK.\nNevertheless, it adds to a growing concern among scientists that has caught the attention of lawmakers across Europe. Two Scandinavian countries have now moved to outlaw cousin marriage entirely. In Norway, the practice became illegal last year; in Sweden, a ban will come into effect next year.\nIn the UK, the Conservative MP Richard Holden has introduced a private members' bill to outlaw the practice, adding it to the list of illegal marriages (alongside parents, child, siblings, and grandparents). But the Labour government says there are \"no plans\" to impose a ban. At present, the UK is still following the policy of \"genetic counselling\", in which first cousin-couples are educated about the risks of having children, and encouraged to get extra screening in pregnancy.\nBut amid concern about child health and strains on the NHS, some academics are asking whether a beefed-up approach to counselling is needed, with more funding and laser-focused intervention. And there are those who think it's time to follow the Scandinavian example and impose something bound to be difficult and controversial: an outright ban on cousin marriage.\nFor most in the UK, the prospect of marrying a cousin is largely alien. But it wasn't always so unusual. The father of evolution Charles Darwin married his first cousin, Emma Wedgwood. Their son, the Victorian scientist Sir George Darwin, went on to estimate that cousin marriages accounted for almost one in 20 aristocratic unions in 19th Century Britain. One of them was Queen Victoria, who married her first cousin, Prince Albert. The novel Wuthering Heights is full of fictional examples.\nBy the 20th Century the proportion of marriages between cousins had declined to about 1%. But it remains a relatively common practice among some South Asian minorities. In three inner-city Bradford wards, almost half (46%) of mothers from the Pakistani community were married to a first or second cousin, according to the most recent Born in Bradford data published two years ago.\nFor those who want to ban the practice, the public health argument is compelling. When announcing his private members' bill in December, Richard Holden highlighted the higher risk of birth defects. Later, on Talk TV, he pointed to data showing that infant mortality rates are higher for children born to cousin parents, with more heart, brain, and kidney problems due to recessive disorders. He also explained that health effects can be \"compounded\" when the practice persists through generations.\nThis risk to child health is one of the reasons Patrick Nash, a researcher and co-founder at the Pharos Foundation research institute, wants to see cousin marriage banned. In a paper published in the Oxford Journal of Law and Religion last year, Nash wrote that a ban would result in \"immediate\" health improvements, especially in communities where the practice is common. He said:  \"Banning cousin marriage would improve public health drastically and have no negative health implications of its own.\"\nOn the ground in Bradford, it's a more mixed picture. Prof Sam Oddie, a consultant neonatologist and researcher at Bradford Teaching Hospitals, has worked in the city for more than two decades. Over the years he has observed lots of severe genetic disorders. \"I've seen fatal skin conditions, fatal brain conditions, fatal muscle conditions\". He says it was \"immediately clear\" these conditions were occurring more in Bradford than elsewhere.\nHe remembers some tragic examples: families who lost several children, one after the other, to the same genetic disorder. \"That's very upsetting and very difficult for the family to get their heads around.\"\nBut crucially, Prof Oddie thinks the main risk to genetic health in Bradford is not cousin marriage, but a similar issue known as endogamy, in which people marry members of their close community. In a tight-knit ethnic group, people are more likely to share common ancestors and genes - whether or not they are first cousins, he says.\nEndogamy is not unique to Pakistani communities in the UK. It is an issue too in the UK's Jewish community and globally among the Amish and also French Canadians.\n\"It's often the case that the exact familial tie can't be traced, but the gene occurs more commonly within a certain group, and for that reason, both parents carry the affected gene,\" Prof Oddie says. \"It's an oversimplification to say that cousin marriage is the root of all excess recessive disorders in Bradford or in Pakistani communities. Endogamy is an important feature.\"\nRather than a ban, he stresses the power of education - or what he calls \"genetic literacy\". It's a phrase that crops up again and again from the people we speak to. For many years there's been a campaign in Bradford to inform people in the Pakistani community about their genetic risks. Couples are given specialist advice at their GP; at pregnancy classes, information is shared with expectant mothers.\nAnd in Bradford at least, some are taking the message on board. Back at the sisters' house, all three women we interview say that ideas around cousin marriage are slowly changing, in part due to an increased awareness of health risks. They live in the deprived, post-industrial Manningham area of the city. There's a distinct feeling of neighbourliness here. All of the front doors open directly onto the street, which is full of children playing. Occasionally the sounds of their laughter drift inside.\n\"It has to be something that happens gradually - it's slow, you can't rush it,\" says Salina, the sister who chose to have a love marriage. \"My mum was very young when she came [to the UK from Pakistan]. She had certain views but those changed because she loves us. I just explained to her, 'Mum, how does it benefit you to push cousin marriage?'.\"\nMallika, her older sister, agrees. \"It's also to do with social media and being exposed to different people,\" she says. \"You have new connections... contact with people outside our parents' eyes.\"\nEven Ayesha, the oldest sister who is in a cousin marriage, said she doesn't imagine either of her two children will marry their cousins.\nAt the time she married her cousin, she says, \"I didn't know any different. My parents were strong in their culture. As the generations move on, the culture is disappearing a bit.\"\nShe was aware of the genetic risks when she had her two children. Neither of them have a genetic illness.\n\"We did take that on board,\" she says, on the topic of genetic health. \"But I always feel like if it's going to happen, it's going to happen. If the child is going to be born with a disability then it will happen if you are married to a cousin or not.\"\nIndeed, in Bradford at least, the practice is in decline. The share of new mothers from across the Born in Bradford study who were first cousins with the father of their baby fell from 39% in the late 2000s to 27% in the late 2010s.\nThis is no coincidence, according to Professor John Wright, chief investigator on the Born in Bradford project. He points out that it is only recently that his team published evidence around the risks of cousin marriage in the UK.\n\"When we talked to the families 10 years ago it was very clear that people weren't aware of the risks but like all parents they want to do their best for their children. They want to have healthy children,\" he says.\n\"Education is the starting point and we've shown in Born in Bradford how powerful that is.\"\nAside from health concerns, there's another reason some people want to see cousin marriage banned: its impact on social cohesion. This is what's largely driving the debate in Scandinavia. In Norway, where cousin marriage was banned last year, lawmakers said the practice was linked to forced marriage, with some South Asian immigrant women coerced into unions with relatives.\nThey also looked at the link with so-called \"honour\" violence, according to Tonje Egedius, a journalist who covered the story for a Norwegian newspaper.\n\"[Police] claim that cousin marriage makes it easier for perpetrators to maintain honour in families,\" she says, \"and that marrying within the family is a contributing cause of honour-related violence and abuse\".\nJasmina Holten, a senior Norwegian police officer, said in an interview with Norwegian broadcaster NRK last year that some women coerced into cousin marriage found themselves trapped, with financial dependence on relatives. In those cases, divorce often means ostracism. A ban on cousin marriage could break down that abusive chain, she said.\nLikewise, Sweden's justice secretary Gunnar Str\u00f6mmer said his own country's ban on cousin marriage will liberate women from \"oppressive standards of honour\".\nThis cultural argument is becoming increasingly prominent. Proponents of a ban broadly see cousin marriage as an instrument of segregation, siphoning people off from the rest of society. Nash, from the Pharos Foundation, says that a ban on cousin marriage would help reduce ethnic segregation in places like Bradford.\nOthers are sceptical of the idea that you can force people to integrate through the sharp stick of legislation. They say that even if a ban goes ahead, some couples would continue to marry their cousins through illegal, unregistered unions - and that women in those marriages may feel they no longer have the protection of the state if the relationship goes sour.\nNazir Afzal, former Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North West of England, tells us that \"thoughtful legislation\" would \"offer protections\" to people coerced into cousin marriage. \"[But] we must respect cultural diversity and personal choice,\" he says. \"Cousin marriage is an important cultural practice in many parts of the world, and legislation should be sensitive to the social and familial values that underlie it.\"\nMore broadly, he suggests governments may want to think about boosting education and genetic screening for couples entering cousin marriage - rather than imposing \"blanket bans\".\nFor some, the idea of an outright ban raises the ugly image of certain minorities being targeted over others. Karma Nirvana, a charity that works to end honour-based abuse, described the backbench attempt to ban cousin marriage as \"a tool of political point-scoring, inciting hate and driving a wedge between communities\".\nRichard Holden's bill is awaiting its second reading in the House of Commons. Without government support it has never been likely to pass but its very existence and events in Scandinavia have resulted in cousin marriage being talked about far beyond the communities where it is prevalent.\nOf course, for those Britons in a cousin marriage, life goes on much as before.\nBack at the Bradford house, the beautician is putting her finishing touches to the hair of the three sisters, ahead of their big wedding at the weekend. Ayesha, the sister who is in a cousin marriage, is reflective and thoughtful about her own near decade-long relationship. \"There are difficulties - we've been through lots together, we have sacrificed a lot,\" she says about her husband. \"But we are happy together.\"\n\"I think even with love marriages you're going to have problems. They'll just be different ones.\"\n\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Beavers will be released into the wild in England after the government approved their reintroduction.\nThe decision follows years of trials and will see beavers make an officially approved return to waterways.\nHunted to extinction in Britain four hundred years ago, beavers have in the last two decades been making a comeback.\nBut some farmers are concerned that without proper management the large rodents could have negative impacts on food production.\n\nIt's thought that about five hundred beavers already live in England, some in the wild and others in enclosures. Many more are in Scotland, where wild releases are already permitted.\nConservationists call beavers \"ecosystem engineers\" because of how they redesign where they live. The dams they build slow the flow of rivers and streams and create habitats where other creatures can thrive. They've also been credited with reducing flooding further downstream. \n\"This is an incredibly exciting moment, a real landmark for nature recovery in England,\" Tony Juniper, the head of Natural England, told me next to a beaver dam in Devon. \n\"We're bringing back a missing animal that's been absent for centuries, and an animal that we know will bring huge benefits for the rest of the wildlife that is already depleted across much of England,\" he says.\nThe beavers will be released under a licensing system overseen by Natural England. \nIt says long term plans will need to be in place to avoid impacts on farming, food production and infrastructure. \nThat's something the National Farmers Union say is vital. It wants culling beavers  to be an option if they prove disruptive.\nNFU Deputy President David Exwood said that while beavers could provide certain benefits, \"we are concerned about the negative impacts beavers can have on productive farmland, as well as the management requirements, costs and risks involved\". \n\"Beavers can flood and waterlog fields, feed on agricultural crops like maize, as well as damage and fell trees such as cricket bat willow.\"\nWe met up with Tony Juniper of Natural England at the site of the pilot project for wild beaver release in England, the River Otter catchment in Devon. Beavers first appeared here more than a decade ago - it's not clear where they came from. They may have escaped from enclosures or have been illegally released, so called \"beaver bombing\".\nSince then the wild beavers have been allowed to stay, with their impact on the landscape and the way they interact with local farmland closely monitored.\n\"All of this open water is down to the beavers,\" Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust tells me as we splash our way through the boggy land.\n\"They want this water because it makes them feel safe and secure. It means that they can transport their food as well.\"\nAlong the River Otter Mr Burgess tells me the beavers have created wetlands that now host species such as great white egrets and kingfishers. Dragonfly numbers have soared as have frogs and toads. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.\nNot everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.\nClinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running. Though broadly supportive of the beavers' return there are concerns about whether enough thought has been given to managing their impacts.\n\"We've also seen farmland flooded, we've seen properties flooded. We've seen people's trees in their gardens felled,\" says John Varley, the chief executive of Clinton Devon Estates.\n\"There are positives with the beaver, huge positives, but there's also some quite significant negatives, particularly for small farmers.\"\nScotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. In some areas the beavers have been so successful at breeding that they have had to be relocated or as a last resort culled.\nThe first wild release of beavers in England is now expected to take place in the next few days.

Scotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. \"Beaver TrustOne of the beavers that has been caught in Scotland and is set to be one of the first officially approved wild release in England. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.Beaver TrustSome farmers are worried about the beavers causing damage to their crops and fieldsNot everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.Clinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running.",

        "article_text": "Gene Hackman, who has died aged 95, started his acting career later in life but became one of Hollywood's most bankable stars.\nThe US actor, his wife Betsy Arakawa, 64, and their dog were found dead at their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nSanta Fe County Sheriff's office in New Mexico confirmed they were found \"deceased Wednesday\", but that officers  \"do not believe that foul play was a factor\".\nHackman had an illustrious five-decade career as an actor. \nHe won two Oscars and was nominated for another three, playing violent men, yet was equally at home in comedy.\nHe was once described as having the face of a truck driver, and was suited to character as well as leading roles. Having shot to fame in Bonnie and Clyde at the end of the 60s, he was rarely out of work - in films like The French Connection, Mississippi Burning and Superman.\nBut he retired from acting in 2004 on the advice of his heart doctor, and rarely gave an interview again - opting for a quiet life in New Mexico with his second wife, Betsy.\nEugene Allen Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, in 1930 and led a peripatetic childhood. \nHis parents divorced, and he was palmed off on various relatives until settling with his maternal grandmother in Danville, Illinois.\nHis father left the family when Hackman was still in his teens. \n\"When young Gene was 13, his father abandoned the family, driving away while his son was out playing in the street,\" reported The New York Times' late writer Robert Berkvist.\nHe went on: \"As his father passed by, Mr Hackman recalled years later, he gave him a wave of the hand.\n\"'I hadn't realised how much one small gesture can mean,' he once said. 'Maybe that's why I became an actor.'\"\nHackman's mother died in 1962 - she burned to death in 1962, after setting fire to her mattress with a cigarette while drunk.\nAs a teenager, Hackman was keen to branch out and lied about his age to join the Marines at the age of 16, serving nearly five years.\nHe was stationed in China where he worked as a radio operator, which led to later work as a disc jockey.\n\"I have trouble with direction,\" he once said of his short military career, \"because I have trouble with authority. I was not a good Marine.\"\nAfter briefly studying journalism and TV production at the University of Illinois, Hackman left to enrol at the Pasadena Playhouse in California in the 60s, where he and classmate Dustin Hoffman were voted the \"least likely to succeed\". \nUndeterred by this vote of no confidence, both actors decamped to New York where they shared a flat with another aspiring thespian, Robert Duvall.\nHackman managed to pick up a few minor stage roles, supplementing his income by taking on a variety of odd jobs. \nHe would often relate the story of how he was spotted by a former drill sergeant outside a New York hotel while he was working as a doorman. \nRecognising his former charge, the sergeant exclaimed that he knew Hackman would never amount to anything.\nThere was also a stint as an overnight cleaner in New York's Chrysler Building, something Hackman later described as the worst job he ever had.\nThere were parts in light comedies both off and on Broadway, which led first to minor television roles and then to some film work.\nHis first movie role was in the 1964 film Lilith, starring Warren Beatty. \nImpressed by his performance, Beatty cast Hackman as his brother, Buck Barrow, in Bonnie and Clyde in 1967.\nHackman received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor and was nominated again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970.\nBut then came The French Connection.\nIt was the part that made him.\nHe played the part of the maverick narcotics agent Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle who pursues a French drugs dealer, most notably in a famous sequence on the New York subway. \nIt brought him an Academy Award for best actor, and he reprised the role in The French Connection II in 1975.\nGene Hackman never looked back. \nWhether it was for critically-acclaimed movies such as The Conversation and Night Moves, or popular blockbusters like The Poseidon Adventure, he became a reliable box-office draw.\nOne of the great screen tough guys, he effortlessly switched to comedy in Young Frankenstein and played the sleazy supervillain Lex Luthor in Superman and Superman II. \nHackman was so upset about the producers' treatment of the director, Richard Donner, that he refused to take a part in the next sequel, although he later appeared in Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.\nThe 80s was another successful decade, notably for his appearance in Mississippi Burning, for which he was again nominated for a best actor Academy Award.\nIt was a powerful performance as an FBI agent, tasked, along with a rookie colleague, with investigating the racist murder of black civil rights workers in the early 60s. \nDirector Alan Parker referred to Hackman as \" a very intuitive and instinctive actor\".\nAnother Oscar for best supporting actor came in 1993 for Unforgiven - a Clint Eastwood Western - in which he played a sadistic sheriff, Bill Daggett. \nThe film also won best picture. The awards came three years after Hackman required bypass surgery following a heart attack.\nThere was a leading role as Edward \"Brill\" Lyle, the computer genius in the 1998 film, Enemy of the State, where he starred alongside Will Smith in a frightening tale of government surveillance.\nHackman's hard-edged screen persona made him ideal for the intelligent but ruthless characters in film adaptations of John Grisham novels - such as The Firm and Runaway Jury - in which, for the first time, he and former flatmate Dustin Hoffman appeared on screen together.\nHis versatility, and the luxury of being able able to choose scripts, led in 2001 to another great performance, in the offbeat comedy The Royal Tenenbaums, which drew rave reviews.\nBut he chose to bow out from acting in the political satire, Welcome to Mooseport in 2004.\nExplaining his decision, he told Reuters he didn't want to risk going out on a sour note.\n\"The business for me is very stressful. The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast,\" he said, \"and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it any more.\"\nA decade later, he did briefly come out of retirement to narrate two documentaries about the history of the US Marine Corps - but otherwise stuck to his plan.\nAfter quitting acting, he gained a new reputation as a writer of historical fiction.  \nHe co-wrote four books with Daniel Lenihan, Wake of the Perdido Star (1999), Justice for None (2004), Vermillion (2004) and Escape from Andersonville (2008). \nHe went on to deliver two solo writing efforts, Payback at Morning Peak (2011) and Pursuit (2013).\nHe spoke about why he had taken to his new job.\n\"I like the loneliness of [writing], actually. It's similar in some ways to acting, but it's more private and I feel like I have more control over what I'm trying to say and do,\" he told Reuters.\n\"There's always a compromise in acting and in film, you work with so many people and everyone has an opinion (laughs). \n\"But with the books, it's just Dan and I and our opinions. I don't know that I like it better than acting, it's just different. I find it relaxing and comforting.\"\n\nHackman married Faye Maltese in 1956. The couple had three children but divorced in 1986. \nFive years later he married Betsy Arakawa, who ran an upmarket furniture store in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nGene Hackman made more than 80 films, and still managed to become both a proficient golfer and respected painter. \nHe was also a mean performer on the racetrack, driving Formula Ford cars and taking part in the 1983 Daytona Endurance Race.\nThroughout his career, he gave few interviews and eschewed the celebrity lifestyle. \n\"If you look at yourself as a star,\" he said, \"you've already lost something in the portrayal of any human being.\"",

        "article_text": "A trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer.\nSpeaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged \"a real trade deal\" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners. \nThe trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade. \nSir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an \"unprecedented\" second state visit to the UK.  \nReceiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a \"great honour\" and described the King as \"a wonderful man\".\nSir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was \"truly historic\". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit. \nHaving confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes.\nThe US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. \nOn the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. \nHowever, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine.\nAsked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \"backstop\". \nHe said \"nobody will play around\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals. \nThe US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\". \n\"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\" he said. \nHe later added he had \"a lot of respect\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday.\nThe UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders. \nHowever, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\". \nThe deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back. \nAfter taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\". \nReferring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. \n\"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said. \nHe said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century. \n\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said. \nTrump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union. \nHe also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.\nAsked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\"\n\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"\nIn a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\". \nSince leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.\nIn his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way.\nHowever, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems. \nThe head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce - a former Labour MP and minister - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that businesses will be encouraged by what he called an \"important first step\".\n\"In trade negotiations, relationships matter,\" says William Bain, adding that seeing the two leaders find common ground on their respective economies and trade is \"helpful\".\nHe added that a deal to keep tariffs low would most benefit automotive and pharmaceutical industries in the UK.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said he is planning to hit goods made in the European Union with tariffs of 25%, claiming the bloc was created to \"screw the United States\".\n\"We'll be announcing it very soon,\" he told reporters at an appearance with members of his cabinet. \"It'll be 25% generally speaking and that will be on cars and all other things.\"\nThe European Union said it would react \"firmly and immediately against unjustified tariffs\".\nTrump's appearance sparked questions about his trade plans, as he also appeared to raise the possibility that looming tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, set to come into force on 4 March, might be postponed again.\nAn administration official later said the deadline remained in place, with the president planning to review Mexico and Canada actions related to border security over the coming days. \nTrump made clear on Wednesday that trade with Europe also remained in his sights, repeating his criticism of European policies, which he said put American exporters of food products and cars at a disadvantage.\n\"The European Union was formed to screw the United States - that's the purpose of it and they've done a good job of it,\" he said.  \"But now I'm president.\"\nThe EU rejected the president's claims, saying the creation of a regional market had made doing business in Europe easier for American firms. \n\"It has been a boon for the United States,\" a spokesperson for the commission said. \"We're ready to partner if you play by the rules. But we will also protect our consumers and businesses at every turn. They expect no less from us.\"\nTariffs are a tax on imports that is collected by the government and paid for by the companies bringing in the goods. \nTrump has vowed to use the levies to boost US manufacturing, raise money and push other countries to change policies he opposes. \nBut there are concerns such measures could fuel inflation, with warnings that Americans could face higher prices for goods as businesses may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers.\nSince taking office, he has raised tariffs of 10% on goods from China and taken steps to hit other imports with duties, including directing his staff to develop recommendations for custom \"reciprocal\" tariffs for each country.\nBut he has also suspended some of those plans, leaving many businesses and analysts guessing as to whether he is prepared to carry out his threats.\n\"The 25% threat that he threw out today is in line with the high end of the range that he previously indicated,\" said Tobin Marcus, head of US policy and politics at Wolfe Research. \n\"It's a number that's concerning - certainly should be concerning - for the trans-Atlantic trade relationship, but not totally out of the blue.\"\nAntonin Finkelnburg, of the Federation of German Wholesale, Foreign Trade and Services which represents businesses, told the BBC that a 25% tariff on EU goods entering the US would created a \"difficult\" but \"not an impossible\" situation for Germany's economy.\n\"We are worried but we shouldn't be afraid,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.\nGermany's car industry's products are popular in the US.\nMr Finkelnburg said many German car manufacturers were \"already producing in the American market, so they wouldn't be directly affected by the tariffs\", but said tariffs would still drive up prices.\n\"The car parts that are manufactured in to those cars are crossing the borders of Mexico and Canada several times so that already is driving the prices up,\" he added.\nEarlier this month, Trump ordered 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, America's top two trading partners. But he suspended the duties before they went into effect until 4 March, to allow for talks on border security. \nOn Monday, Trump said he expected tariffs of 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada to come into effect \"on schedule\". \nAt Wednesday's meeting, when asked for an update, he said the 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada would go into effect on 2 April.\nThat is the same day that the Commerce Department is supposed to deliver its wider recommendations for \"reciprocal\" tariffs. \nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters that \"the overall is April 2\" , distinguishing between tariffs tied to concerns about drug trafficking and migration from Mexico and Canada.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all headed lower in mid-day trade, while the peso and Canadian dollar gained.

I'm just hoping they'll let me in when I show up.\"\nThe Bolton actor's turn as PC Mukherjee was a high point in the hilarious outing, as the intrepid new PC was central to the plot, helping the iconic title characters track down their penguin nemesis, the master of disguise Feathers McGraw.\nThe film also featured the vocal talents of Patel's fellow Boltonian, comedian Peter Kay, who voiced PC Mukherjee's superior, Ch Insp Mackintosh.\nCreator and Preston-born Nick Park and his Bristol-based Aardman Animations team have already won four Oscars, so Patel said hopes were high that they would add to that achievement.\n\"The team are so insanely talented and their minds are brilliant and the script is so witty and so fun,\" she said. \n\"It made it such an enjoyable job to work on [and they are] also just all lovely people.\n\"They've got Oscars and they're very successful, they're very well known. \n\"But they're all just really lovely, down to earth people who just want to make the film as good as it can be.\"\nThe trip to the Oscars comes three years after Patel landed her first role in coming-of-age musical drama Everybody's Talking About Jamie. \nThat success came just days after she was rejected by a number of drama schools and she said she got the part in an open online audition.\nSince then, she said she \"fell head first\" into the industry, which was \"kind of mental\", and she recently joined the cast of BBC drama Waterloo Road for the latest series.\nShe said becoming a professional actor was a dream come true.\n\"I never thought that I would be able to do it professionally in this capacity,\" she said.\n\"I was like, 'oh, maybe I'll go to drama school and then in like 10 years, I'll get a little bit on the telly and, and that'll be great'. \n\"And I'll maybe do some community theatre because that's really fun. \n\"But yeah, it's mad. I can't believe it.\n\"Everyone who has ever met me as a child would know that I loved singing and dancing and attention.\"\nShe said she was excited about every aspect of her trip and had chosen her all-important red carpet outfit.\n\"I wanted to find something that I felt really good in, that I felt represented who I was and I think I found that,\" she said.\nHowever, she added that she would keep the exact details of the outfit \"under wraps\".\nAbove everything else though, she said there was one thing she was really looking forward to.\n\"I'm really excited to see Raye perform,\" she said.\n\"I love her so much and I've never seen her live and the first time I'm going to see her is at the Oscars, which is mental.\"\nThe 97th Academy Awards will be held in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on Sunday.

        "article_text": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky met US President Trump in Washington on Friday to sign an agreement that would give the US access to its deposits of rare earth minerals.\nBut after Zelensky left early following a fiery exchange with Trump and Vice-President JD Vance, the White House announced that the deal had not been signed.\nZelensky previously said he hoped the \"preliminary\" agreement with the US would \"lead to further deals\", but confirmed no US security guarantees had yet been agreed - something he had been pushing for.\nTrump had said a deal would help US taxpayers \"get their money back\" for aid sent to Ukraine throughout the war, but said the responsibility of Kyiv's security should fall to Europe.\nOn Wednesday, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine and the US had finalised a version of the agreement. It was published on Friday morning.\nThe preliminary agreement envisages that an \"investment fund\" will be set up for Ukraine's reconstruction. \nShmyhal said Kyiv and Washington would manage the fund on \"equal terms\".\nAccording to the deal, Ukraine will contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas to the fund, and the fund will then invest \"to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine\".\nMeanwhile, the agreement says the US government will, subject to US law, \"maintain a long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine\".\nZelensky acknowledged the fund, but told the BBC on Wednesday it was \"too early to talk about money\". \nThe agreement states that the US will own the maximum amount of the fund allowed under US law. \nDisagreement over the terms of a minerals deal formed part of what appears to be a deepening rift between Trump and Zelensky.\nThe Ukrainian president rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (\u00a3395bn) in mineral wealth, but media reports say this demand has now been dropped.\n\"The US administration started with a deal that challenged Ukraine's sovereignty, then pushed an exploitative one that would bankrupt the country,\" Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister and head of Kyiv school of economics, told the BBC. \n\"Now, they've shifted to a reasonable deal with co-ownership and no direct claims on past aid. That could actually benefit Ukraine.\"\nOn Tuesday, Trump said the US had given Ukraine between $300bn (\u00a3237bn) and $350bn (\u00a3276bn) in aid, and that he wanted to \"get that money back\" through a deal. \nBut German think tank the Kiel Institute estimates the US has sent $119bn in aid to Ukraine.\nZelensky has been pushing for a deal to include a firm security guarantee from the US.\nBut on Wednesday, he said no such guarantee had been made. \n\"I wanted to have a sentence on security guarantees for Ukraine, and it's important that it's there,\" the Ukrainian leader explained. \nAsked by the BBC if he would be prepared to walk away from the agreement if Trump did not offer the guarantees he wanted, Zelensky said: \"I want to find a Nato path or something similar.\n\"If we don't get security guarantees, we won't have a ceasefire, nothing will work, nothing.\"\nDespite this, the published agreement says the US supports \"Ukraine's efforts to obtain security guarantees to build lasting peace\".\nHe said Ukraine would not sign the deal until Zelensky and Trump \"agree on security guarantees\" and decide on how to \"tie this preliminary agreement\" to a US security guarantee.\nTrump said on Wednesday that the US would not provide security guarantees \"beyond... very much\", adding that responsibility for this would now fall to Europe. \nBut he added that the presence of US workers on Ukrainian soil would provide \"automatic security\".\nThe prospect of a minerals deal was first proposed by Zelensky last year as a way to offer the US a tangible reason to continue supporting Ukraine.\nTrump said on Tuesday that Ukraine would get \"the right to fight on\" in return for access to its minerals and suggested the US would continue to supply equipment and ammunition \"until we have a deal with Russia\". \nThe US president has also said Russia is open to accepting European peacekeepers in Ukraine, but Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Kremlin would not consider this as an option.\nTrump had said the two would sign the deal at Friday's meeting at the White House.\nUkrainian PM Shmyhal said the US and Ukraine had prepared a final version of the agreement, though Zelensky aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said that only a framework agreement was due to be signed.\nBut nothing at all was signed during the visit, which instead saw Trump and Zelensky descend into a heated exchange in the Oval Office.\nAt one point, a furious Trump said Zelensky was not grateful enough for the US's support during the war, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three\".\nHe said Zelensky had to \"make a deal or we're out\", adding: \"You don't have the cards.\"\nZelensky said there should be \"no compromises\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nNot long after - and well ahead of schedule - the Ukrainian president was seen leaving the White House.\nThe White House then announced that the deal had not been agreed - and said Trump had decided to call off the signing ceremony himself.\nThe US president wrote on his Truth Social platform that Zelensky had \"disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office\". He added: \"He can come back when he is ready for peace.\"\nIt is now unclear when the deal might be signed, if at all.\nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.\nThis includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine also has significant deposits of titanium and lithium. It says it has substantial amounts of the world's rare earth metals - a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world - but these claims are disputed.\nAlso, some of the country's mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nThere are warnings too that a deal allowing the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth cannot happen unless the country addresses its problem with unexploded mines. \nA quarter of Ukraine's landmass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country.\nAnother issue is that it will be some time before anyone sees any material benefits from the deal.\n\"These resources aren't in a port or warehouse; they must be developed,\" says Mylovanov. \"In that sense if the US invests, it will benefit everyone.\"\nVladimir Putin has not yet addressed reports that the terms of a deal between the US and Ukraine have been agreed.\nBut on Monday evening he told state TV he was ready to \"offer\" resources to American partners in joint projects, including mining in Russia's \"new territories\" - a reference to parts of eastern Ukraine that Russia has occupied since launching a full-scale invasion three years ago.\nPutin said a potential US-Ukraine deal on rare minerals was not a concern and that Russia \"undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine\".\n\"As for the new territories, it's the same. We are ready to attract foreign partners to the so-called new, to our historical territories, which have returned to the Russian Federation,\" he added.\nCommenting on Zelensky's visit to Washington, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday: \"Whether it will be [to sign] the aforementioned agreement or something else, we'll see. There have been no official statements on this matter yet.\"",

The US president has also said Russia is open to accepting European peacekeepers in Ukraine, but Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Kremlin would not consider this as an option.When will the deal be signed?Trump had said the two would sign the deal at Friday's meeting at the White House.Ukrainian PM Shmyhal said the US and Ukraine had prepared a final version of the agreement, though Zelensky aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said that only a framework agreement was due to be signed.But nothing at all was signed during the visit, which instead saw Trump and Zelensky descend into a heated exchange in the Oval Office.At one point, a furious Trump said Zelensky was not grateful enough for the US's support during the war, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three\".He said Zelensky had to \"make a deal or we're out\", adding: \"You don't have the cards. But he added that the presence of US workers on Ukrainian soil would provide \"automatic security\".The prospect of a minerals deal was first proposed by Zelensky last year as a way to offer the US a tangible reason to continue supporting Ukraine.Trump said on Tuesday that Ukraine would get \"the right to fight on\" in return for access to its minerals and suggested the US would continue to supply equipment and ammunition \"until we have a deal with Russia\". \"On Tuesday, Trump said the US had given Ukraine between $300bn (\u00a3237bn) and $350bn (\u00a3276bn) in aid, and that he wanted to \"get that money back\" through a deal.",

Spells at Mainz and Alaves followed before he finished his career in Japan, retiring in 2022.\nThe following year he returned to Barcelona, taking on the football co-ordinator role, and while he may only be a couple of years older than some of those in the current first-team, he is enjoying his new life off the pitch.\n\"I don't miss playing football,\" he said. \n\"I feel that was the end of a chapter in my life, I felt proud about what I did and what I learned from the good and the bad experiences. \n\"I see the players now when they are training and playing and I feel already I did this, and now I am on another step and looking forward.\"\nListen to the full interview with Bojan Krkic on the Euro Leagues podcast on BBC Sounds.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Ethan Kross is a world expert in the psychology of emotions, and he has identified a set of tools that can help us to tend our wellbeing.\nEver since he was a child, Ethan Kross has been \"an observer of emotion\" and the often counter-productive ways that we deal with difficult feelings. \"It seemed as if we were all just stumbling along, occasionally finding an accidental or Band-Aid solution to help us manage our emotional lives. Sometimes our improvised tools helped. Sometimes they made things worse. It seemed so haphazard, isolating, and inefficient,\" he says.\nAs a psychologist at the University of Michigan and director of the Emotion and Self-Control Laboratory, Kross hopes to change this sorry state of affairs. In his new book Shift: How to Manage Your Emotions So They Don't Manage You, he aims to equip us all with a set of tools that will help us to navigate our ups and downs more constructively.\nKross spoke to science writer David Robson about the benefits of \"negative\" feelings, creating safe spaces and emotional oases \u2013 and the surprising upsides of distraction.\nWhat are the most common misconceptions about emotions?\nOne big misunderstanding is that there are good emotions and there are bad emotions and that we should strive to live our lives free of all the bad emotions. This is an error, as far as I'm concerned: we evolved the ability to experience all emotions for a reason. Anger can motivate us to correct an injustice if there's still an opportunity to fix things. Sadness can lead us to introspect and make new meaning out of situations that have fundamentally been altered. Envy can motivate us to strive for things that we want to achieve. In the right proportions \u2013 that is such a key phrase \u2013 all emotions are useful.\nOne way of driving this point home is to think about physical pain, which is about as negative an emotional state as we can imagine. Many of us yearn to live lives free of any kind of physical pain. But some people are born without the capacity to experience pain, due to a genetic anomaly, and those kids end up dying younger than people who can experience pain. If they get their hand stuck in the fire, there's no signal that tells them to pull the hand away. The same principle is true for all our negative emotions.\nPeople often find it liberating to know that they don't have to strive to live a life without negativity. What you want to strive to achieve is just keeping these emotional experiences in check, and I think that's a much more tenable goal.\nMany people believe that their emotions are beyond their control. Where do you think this defeatist attitude comes from? And what are the consequences?\u00a0\nI think it depends on the facet of our emotional experiences that we're talking about. We often don't have control over the thoughts and feelings that are automatically triggered as we live our lives throughout the day, but we can control how we engage with those thoughts and feelings once they're activated, and that's where the promise of emotion regulation resides.\nBut if you don't think you can do something, then you're not going to make the effort to practice it. If you don't think exercising is going to make you more fit, for example, why on Earth would you devote effort to exercising? And if you don't think that you can use different strategies to manage your emotions, why would you ever avail yourself of them?\nSo how can we change our responses to difficult feelings?\nListening to music is one example of a tool that's underutilised. If you ask people why they listen to music, almost 100% of participants will say that they like the way it makes them feel. But if you then look at what people do when they are struggling with their emotions \u2013 such as the last time they were angry, anxious or sad \u2013 only a small minority report using music.\u00a0\nIt's just one category of what I call \"shifters\", which are the tools that can push our emotions around. And once you know how they work, you can be a lot more strategic in how you use them in your life.\nYou also describe how a change in environment can boost our wellbeing. We might have experienced this on holiday, but how can we apply this principle to our day-to-day lives?\u00a0\nAs you say, a lot of people feel restored when they go to an entirely different place that is free of associations with work. But we can't always take that vacation, and what I like to remind people is that there are often places locally that can shift our mood.\nWe talk a lot about getting attached to other people, and when things aren't going well, being in the presence of that figure can be a source of comfort and resilience. But it turns out we also become attached to places in our environment. Mine include the arboretum near my home, the tea house where I wrote my first book and one of my offices on campus. From the moment I am in that space, I have positive associations that help me manage my emotions.\nI think that they're not unlike the safe houses you have in spy movies or books. We all have these safe houses in our lives, and we want to be strategic about going to them when we're struggling. It's a way of managing ourselves from the outside in.\nYou can also curate your environment. We know that plants and images of green spaces can be restorative. So can photos of loved ones. We've done research where we expose people to pictures of loved ones while they're struggling with a problem. We find it speeds up the rate at which they \"repair\" following the experience.\u00a0\nIs the aim to be more conscious of what we can do to change how we're feeling \u2013 rather than just leaving it to chance?\nOne of my hopes for this book is that we can get people to be much more deliberate about incorporating these tools into our lives.\nI was surprised to find that distraction and avoidance can be a productive way of dealing with emotions. How so?\u00a0\nAvoidance \u2013 trying actively not to think about something by distracting yourself or engaging in other behaviours \u2013 is generally derided as an unhealthy tool. And there's no question that chronically avoiding things has been linked with negative outcomes; it's not an approach that I would advocate for anyone to adopt.\nBut we do not have to choose between either approaching or avoiding our emotions; we can be flexible and do both. There's research showing that people who are effective at both approaching and avoiding their emotions, expressing and suppressing, often fare well in the long term.\nWhat might that look like in our lives? Well, let's say you're triggered by something. You get emotional about an argument you have had with someone. One approach might be to address it right there at that moment, but it might make sense to take some time away from thinking about that problem or confronting it. I say that as the kind of person who, in general, does like to confront things right in the moment, just get to the bottom of it, and move on. But sometimes I've benefited from immersing myself in something totally unrelated for a day and then coming back to the problem. I might come back and realise it's not a problem at all, or I'll find that the intensity of the problem is diminished, and I can approach it from a broader perspective.\nHow should we deal with that killer of joy, social comparison?\nWe often hear that we shouldn't compare ourselves to other people. Good luck! We're a social species; part of the way we make sense of ourselves and our place in this world is to compare ourselves to others.\n\u00a0\nIt is true that we often engage in the kinds of comparisons that lead us to feel bad about ourselves, but you can reframe it in ways that make the comparison work for you rather than against you. If I find out that someone is outperforming me, I can say to myself, well, they were able to achieve that, so why can't I? Now it's almost like a target for something that I can shoot towards.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why we need to be more emotional to save the world\n\u2022 The untranslatable emotions you never knew you had\n\u2022 How climate change effects mental health\nDo you have a favourite strategy that you would typically turn to in times of difficulty?\nWhen I'm struggling, my first line of defence is to use distanced self-talk. I'll use my name and the second person pronoun \u2013 you \u2013 to silently coach myself through a problem, as if I'm advising a friend. (Read more: Illeism: The ancient trick to help you think more wisely.) And then I'll also engage in mental time travel. I'll ask myself, 'How am I going to feel about this in a day, 10 days, 10 months from now?' And I'll also go back in time. 'How does this compare to other difficult things I've been through?'\nOftentimes, those tools get me to where I want to be emotionally, but if they're not sufficient, I'll go to my emotional advisors, people in my network who are pretty skilled at empathising with me and advising me. And I'll go for a walk in a green space, or visit one of my emotional oases.\n*Ethan Kross's new book Shift: Managing Your Emotions So They Don't Manage You is published by Vermilion (UK) and Crown (US).\n** David Robson is an award-winning science writer and author.

        "article_text": "Tom Rowland played five games for England U18s, alongside the likes of Marcus Smith, Tom Willis, Joe Heyes and Ted Hill\nTom Rowland remembers rooming with Joe Heyes.\nLeicester prop Heyes is now part of England's Six Nations squad, coming off the bench in each of their three games so far.\nBack then though, in Cape Town, in 2017, both Heyes and Rowland were England Under-18s.\nBoth were props. Both were highly rated. Both would start against South Africa Schools the next day.\nBut, in other ways they were different.\n\"Joe was the size he is now, he was just an absolute beast,\" remembers Rowland.\n\"He was something like 130kg (20st 7lb) aged 16.\n\"Someone like him was made to play in the front row.\"\nRowland wasn't though.\nTwo years earlier, he had been a blind-side flanker or number eight, carrying hard for Bristol's academy team.\nHowever, his coach, seeing the trend for more mobile props, suggested he swap the back row for the front row.\n\"I was only 90kg (14st 2lb) at the time,\" Rowland says.\n\"I enjoyed my gym work, but I never dreamed of being fast-tracked into being a prop.\"\nThe change of position demanded a change in physique.\nRowland was given two aims - to load up the weights bar and his plate.\nSix meals a day, five weights sessions a week.\nEnergy in, power out and, hopefully, bulk up.\n\"I found it pretty tough,\" says Rowland. \"It was a conscious effort making sure I got the food in.\n\"My strength and conditioning coach would always be on to me. You'd have to weigh in in the mornings, you would step on the scales and find you had lost a kilo because you haven't had enough dinner the night before.\n\"I always like to eat relatively 'clean', but it got to a point where they said 'you just need the calories, we don't mind if you are smashing a load of dessert'.\n\"It was always a bit of a battle for me.\"\nRowland made his Bristol debut in February 2017 as an 18-year-old schoolboy\nIt was a battle he won. In the short term at least.\nA couple of years after changing position, he had put on three stone and the England Under-18 loose-head prop shirt.\nRowland played five games, lining up alongside Marcus Smith, Tom Willis, Cadan Murley and Ted Hill, all of whom, like Heyes, are playing for England in this year's Six Nations.\nRowland is still playing, just at a lower level, in a different country and, intriguingly, at a lighter weight.\nThis April, he will be part of the first-ever 'Small Blacks' team \u2013 a New Zealand representative side with a catch., external\nAll its members play weight-restricted rugby, in which no player, whether front row or fly-half, weighs more than 85kg (13st 5lbs).\nIn New Zealand, the concept has taken root.\nIn 2024, 45 teams entered the national under-85kg Cup, with the final taking place at Sky Stadium in Wellington as a curtain-raiser to an All Blacks win over Australia.\nThe players are smaller and more uniform in stature, but the action is fast and hard.\n\"If no-one had a number on their back, you would struggle to know who is playing which position,\" says Rowland.\n\"I wouldn't say it's like sevens, the games can still be quite physical and forward dominated, but everything's done at just a much greater pace.\n\"Everybody is pretty fit so the collisions in the 70th minute are just as hard as those in the opening five minutes of a game. There's no real drop off.\n\"The skill level from one to 15 is great. Even as a prop, you are expected to have as good a catch and pass as anyone in the backline.\n\"The only thing where there's probably a big step down is the set-piece, especially the line-outs. You have a lot of guys who aren't used to jumping in a line-out.\n\"But in a way less focus around the set-piece makes it a bit more exciting, it speeds everything up.\"\nRowland is certainly quicker than he was. Back in his England age-grade days, he weighed in about 17st 5lb.\nNow 26, he plays four stone lighter, the weight he was as a 14-year-old.\n\"I can still enjoy the scrummaging side but I am also now fit enough and at a good weight to be mobile and contribute around the pitch.\n\"I get to carry lots, make tackles and I actually play 80 minutes in most games. I really enjoy not having to get dragged off at around 50 or 60 minutes because I can't breathe any more.\"\nEden Lizards, the side Rowland plays for, won New Zealand's inaugural National Under-85kg Cup in 2020\nRowland's initial weight loss came during the Covid lockdown. Unable to dislodge the likes of Yann Thomas and Jake Woolmore in the first team, he had been released by Bristol.\nWithout access to weights, but with a desire to keep fit, he started running every day.\nWhen restrictions eased and he met up with friends again, Rowland's body shape had changed so dramatically, they thought he was ill.\nRowland felt the opposite.\n\"The weight just flew off me and I felt so much better,\" he says. \"I had more energy - I did have to sell my whole wardrobe though and buy new clothes!\"\nIn 2021, he moved to a new country as well, taking advantage of the New Zealand passport he has through his mother.\nIn a different hemisphere, things turned upside-down.\nWhere once he was piling on pounds any which way he could, now he has to be mindful of passing a weigh-in a couple of hours before matches.\nSome players will, like boxers, shed weight in saunas the night before, tip the scales and then wolf down carbohydrate-heavy food in the dressing room. \nCramps can creep up on those who misjudge their pre-match routine.\nWhen the New Zealand under-85kg team play their first match, it won't be an issue though. At least not for Rowland and his Small Blacks team-mates.\nTheir two matches against the full Sri Lanka national team (ranked 40th in the world) in Kandy and Colombo are being played at a catchweight.\nA cap of 105kg (16st 7lb) has been applied to ensure there isn't a dangerous discrepancy between the hosts and tourists.\n\"It will be interesting to see if we'll be able to kind of hold our own, obviously being a bit lighter than that,\" says Rowland.\nWeight-restricted rugby's potential for growth may be mostly at the grassroots level, retaining players who feel that, while rugby is a game for all sizes, they would prefer a format with more evenly matched physiques.\n\"There would be definitely a pocket of players who would really kind of enjoy this grade of rugby. I think it's only going to be good for the game, and keep people playing,\" says Rowland.\n\"I think it's an idea that would go pretty well in Europe as well.\"\nIf it does, there are long-term hopes of staging a weight-restricted World Cup.\nRowland, who watched former team-mate Smith in action at Eden Park against the All Blacks in July, could, in theory, have a black-and-white decision to make; whether to turn out for England or New Zealand.\n\"Tough, tough question,\" he smiles.\nProbably still not as tough as that sixth meal of the day though.\nRowland (centre) preparing to pack down for Eden Lizards",

But the potential for further duties raises questions about how businesses will respond. \nMs McDaniel said she expected the hit to be felt more in China. \n\"It's not costless for the US, but so far it seems more costly for China,\" she said. \nThe impact of tariffs, if they go into effect, is expected to be felt more in the Canadian and Mexican economies, which count on the US as a key export market.\nBut analysts have warned that the threat of the levies, even if they are never imposed, is still likely to have a chilling effect on investment, including in the US.\nChina has already responded to the first round of tariffs from the US with its own tariffs on US products, including coal and agricultural machinery.  \nTrump has dismissed fears about damage to the American economy.

It had one runway and an additional taxi-way, that was expanded so it could be used as a back-up in case the main runway was out of action.\nIt was never supposed to be for daily use.\nIn fact, in 1979 Gatwick's owners signed a legally binding agreement with the local council not to build another operational runway for at least 40 years. \nNow, though, Gatwick is keen to increase flights in and out, especially for short-haul destinations, by putting the back-up runway into regular use.\nIn the summer of 2023, it put in a planning application, including for additional buildings, flyovers to local roads and expanding rail links.\nHowever, the centre line of a runway that's in full operation, must be at least 210 metres from the centre line of any other runway.\nThe back-up runway needs to shift 12 metres northwards to meet that safety rule.\nJust because the government has given backing in principle for the privately-funded \u00a32.2bn scheme, doesn't mean it is ready for take-off.\nThere is strong opposition to the expansion of Gatwick among some local residents objecting to increases in traffic, noise and pollution. \nClimate campaigners oppose any airport expansion, pointing out that the extra flights will make it harder for the UK to meet its obligations to reduce emissions that are altering the climate.\nAnd in January MPs called on the government to delay the decision on expanding Gatwick until current noise levels were monitored adequately at the site.\nGatwick has until 24 April to submit more information to support its planning application, and respond with measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport.\nThen there will be a fresh consultation on the plans, before the government makes a final decision on 27 October.\nEven if Gatwick is given the go-ahead then, it could still face further hurdles.\n\"There remains the possibility that the final decision could be subject to legal challenge which would lead to further delay,\" Paul Maile, head of planning and infrastructure consenting at Eversheds Sutherland, told the BBC. \n\"It is probable that it will still be several years before work is likely to start, at the earliest,\" he said.\nGatwick has previously said it believed the new runway could be ready by the end of the decade.\nBut there is still a reasonable chance it might not happen at all.\nBy 2030 there will have been another general election, and a different government could overturn any previous decisions. Planning permissions and regulations may change, and climate targets could be ramped up - all of which would put the project at risk.\nIt will also depend on what the public want, says Prof Tony Travers of the London School of Economics.\nPoliticians are \"susceptible to public pressure\" so sometimes choose to slow or cancel infrastructure projects like this.\nWhile there are wider benefits of airport expansion, to the regional and national economy as well as the travelling public, those advantages don't usually prompt people to make placards and write to their MPs. Living under a flight path, on the other hand, does.\nRichard Threlfall, global head of infrastructure, government and healthcare at KPMG International, says other countries, which don't have such strong democracies as the UK, can \"just get on and do it\", when they want infrastructure built.\nIn the UK road bypasses, rail infrastructure, housing and other projects can be slowed or completely blocked, if enough people oppose them.\nBut this government has staked its reputation on overcoming opposition to projects that it believes will boost growth, indicating it wants to see airport expansion despite the objections.

It is used in common substances like plastic, resin, nylon and some forms of dyes, pesticides or detergents. It is very flammable.\nExposure to benzene through breathing or ingestion can cause symptoms like drowsiness, dizziness, tremors, vomiting or sleeplessness.\nVery high levels of exposure can lead to unconsciousness or death, according to the CDC.

        "article_text": "When Luna Sofia Miranda approached Sean Baker in a strip club in New York in 2022, she tried her best to charm him.\nBut he \"very clearly did not want to buy a lap dance,\" she says.\nMiranda, who was 23 at the time, started asking why he and his wife were there.\n\"I'm very nosy,\" she says. \"So I kept asking them questions and I finally got it out of them. They were making a film about strippers.\"\nShe told them she had studied acting, and - after a successful audition - got a call on her 24th birthday, to offer her a part in the film.\nThat film, Anora, is now seen as one of the frontrunners heading into the Oscars on Sunday.\nIt's directed by Baker, and stars Mikey Madison, who is up for best actress for her role as a New York stripper.\nMadison, 25, relied on real-life strippers to help her perfect the part.\nWhen she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.\n\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.\nThey \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.\nWe've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.\nSome praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".\nEdie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.\nTurquet, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.\nShe got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.\n\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.\n\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"\nTurquet points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.\n\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"\nBut when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.\n\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"\nBaker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.\nShe says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.\nThey connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.\nIn the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nMiranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.\n\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.\nOne of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"\nThis section contains spoilers for Anora\nMiranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.\n\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.\n\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"\nTurquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.\n\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.\n\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"\nBut overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.\n\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.\n\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"\nShe said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".\n\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"\n\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"\nFor Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.\n\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\" \nFor Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.\nIn the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.\nWe also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.\n\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.\n\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"\nWhen Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.\nFootage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.\n\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.\nNow, all eyes are on the Oscars.\nMiranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.\n\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"\nShe said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.\n\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.\n\"If this film wins an Oscar, I want to see that.\"",

The prince has had longstanding business connections with Bahrain.There are also strong links between the UK and Bahraini royal families, with King Hamad of Bahrain visiting King Charles in Windsor in November 2024.Mr Hampshire is the only named director of Waterberg Stirling on registration documents, but another person linked to the firm has been Adnan Sawadi.In July 2024, the entrepreneur Mr Sawadi gave a presentation in China showing the intended partnership between SBC and the successor to Pitch@Palace, Innovate Global, which he hoped would provide a bridge connecting Middle Eastern funding with projects in China.His speech singled out for praise Yang Tengbo - the man who later that year would be accused of being a Chinese spy, seeking influence over Prince Andrew, claims that Mr Yang has continued to reject as untrue.Andrew emails show contact with Epstein lasted beyond 2010Prince Andrew says he 'ceased all contact' with alleged Chinese spyAndrew aide asks court to withhold testimony on alleged spy Sign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis straight to your inbox every week with our Royal Watch newsletter. \"Pitch@Palace had been a Dragons' Den-style pitching competition for new business ideas, set up Prince Andrew in 2014 and run by him before he stepped down from royal duties in 2019. SBC had said it was attracted by Pitch@Palace's legacy of contacts, with 80,000 applications from 3,000 entrepreneurial companies in more than 60 countries.The Dutch firm, which has been running since 2010, helps to mentor and grow start-up businesses, particularly in the technology sector, with investments in 1,700 early-stage companies and running schemes in 27 countries.A takeover of the Pitch@Palace network had seemed imminent with SBC saying the partnership would be a \"fantastic opportunity\" and that it wanted to make use of a \"great, but dormant\" network of entrepreneurs.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho heads down the tunnel after being substituted in the 3-2 win against Ipswich\nManchester United head coach Ruben Amorim said he would speak to Alejandro Garnacho after the winger went straight to the dressing room when he was substituted in the first half of the 3-2 win against Ipswich.\nAmorim replaced Argentina international Garnacho with defender Noussair Mazraoui two minutes before half-time following Patrick Dorgu's red card.\nIt was raining heavily at Old Trafford and Garnacho seemed to indicate he wanted to take his shirt off, so he headed down the touchline to the dressing room rather than take a place on the bench.\nIt is not known whether he stayed for the second half.\n\"I am going to talk with Garnacho about that,\" said Amorim.\nIn December, the 20-year-old attacker was dropped for the derby against Manchester City at Etihad Stadium along with Marcus Rashford, partly due to his poor performance in training and his attitude.\nUnlike Rashford, who has not played for United since and is now on loan at Aston Villa, Garnacho returned to first-team duties immediately.\n\"You are making a connection with Rashford,\" said Amorim, assessing Wednesday's situation.\n\"It was cold and wet.\"\nAmorim's decision was a tactical one stemming from the red card, allowing his team to largely keep their original shape with five at the back.\n\"The thinking was that we would play 5-3-1. That is a risk because he [Garnacho] is the one who can play one-v-one in pace,\" Amorim said. \"We had to choose someone to go out. It was my choice.\"\nThe Debrief: Man Utd edge Ipswich, Arsenal stutter & Liverpool go 13 clear\nMan Utd planning post-season matches in Asia\nModern players find criticism offensive - Ten Hag\nThis video can not be played\nNot perfect or pretty but Man Utd stayed in control - Amorin\nThis has been a tough week at United, with news that more staff members will be losing their jobs.\nUnited's victory therefore will come as little comfort to those directly affected, no matter how entertaining this game proved to be.\nA mid-season home win against opposition who look destined for a swift return to the Championship is not going to live long in the memory. \nHowever, the manner of the success, fighting back from the concession of a shambolic early opening goal and rallying again after a red card and another avoidable goal, was greeted with enthusiasm from the stands at the final whistle.\n\"The fans' support was amazing,\" said Amorim. \"I have felt that since day one.\n\"They want to see the team fight to the end, no matter what the situation. We did that today. All the things in the game were against us, but we fought through that. You feel the connection. It was a good win for us.\"\nPrivately, United officials accept this has been a traumatic week and that chief executive Omar Berrada did not find it easy on Monday to stand before staff and tell them the bad news that up to 200 jobs could go in the next four months.\nIt is perfectly believable when some currently working at the club say morale among the rank and file is at its lowest ebb.\nBut the conviction among those running United is absolute that the changes needed to be made.\nTheir problem is an understanding that off-field decisions are assessed through the prism of results at first-team level. And the results have been terrible.\nEarly in this contest, with Ipswich leading through the atrocious mix-up that offered Jaden Philogene a fourth-minute tap-in, the visiting fans offered their own pretty blunt assessment of United. The words were somewhat more industrial but effectively: \"You're really not very good.\"\nThat's fair enough when assessing opponents who are supposed to be challenging for major honours but started this game 15th in the table.\nYet those responsible for making key decisions are adamant faith in Amorim remains high. They feel what is currently being endured amounts to teething problems with a coach trying to implement a new system.\nAnother change, it is argued, will merely repeat past mistakes. The club have been in a malaise for years, it could be said, and the cycle has to be broken.\nHowever, there is also an acceptance this will not be straightforward.\nAmorim noted that this success - like the robust rearguard action that brought an FA Cup victory with 10 men at Arsenal and a defiant draw against champions-elect Liverpool - was not achieved in the manner he wants his side to play.\n\"We need to survive, but it is hard for me to play like we play in the second half because I feel the players are more comfortable defending the low block,\" Amorim said.\nAmazingly, United have now matched their best form under Amorim by going two Premier League games without defeat.\nThey are up to 14th but are nine points off the top half of the table and a distant 13 away from a Champions League place, even if the Premier League gets five places as expected.\nNo-one at Old Trafford expects Amorim's side to go on a huge winning run to the end of the season.\nHowever, there is a feeling that they can improve \u2013 and results in the FA Cup fifth-round tie with Fulham on Sunday and the Europa League last-16 tie with Real Sociedad are crucial to maintaining hopes of European qualification. Dorgu will miss the Fulham game through suspension.\nAmorim has learned already that the price of being associated with United is that any action of significance will be amplified. The glare of publicity is fierce.\nPlenty at the club noted within the reaction to this week's cost-cutting news at United that not many employers offer staff the free lunches that are being taken away. Other companies have made far more people redundant.\nBut the allure of United drives interest and therefore commercial revenues far beyond most comparable-sized businesses.\nThere is always attention on United, whether about matters on or off the pitch.\nDebate surrounding this game will not be about the result but about that ridiculous opening goal when Dorgu and Andre Onana practically waved Ipswich through to score.\n\"When everybody watched that ball, they thought 'here we go again',\" said Amorim.\nAnd there was much to discuss about Dorgu's red card.\nAmorim stressed he saw no malice, explaining: \"He doesn't want to harm anyone. Sometimes you overdo it.\"\nSo, Amorim's fourth home Premier League win as United head coach had plenty of drama about it.\nBut it will take far more than this to sweep away the dark clouds currently hanging over Old Trafford.\nSix points separate eight teams - how race for Europe is shaping up\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

The \u00a32.2bn expansion will be funded through private investment.\n\"I am issuing a minded to approve decision that provides some additional time to seek views from all parties on the provisions, prior to a final decision,\" Alexander said in a written ministerial statement on Tuesday.\nGatwick has until 24 April to respond to demands for it to include measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport, in its overall plans before a final decision will be made in October.\nStewart Wingate, Gatwick Airport chief executive, said following the latest announcement that the government has \"outlined a clear pathway to full approval later in the year\" and that the airport would \"engage fully\" in the process.\nThe Transport Secretary's support for expansion comes as the government is looking at ways to boost economic growth in a bid to boost living standards, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves backing a third runway at Heathrow last month.\nGatwick, in West Sussex, is Europe's busiest single runway airport, with more than 40 million passengers using it last year.\nOn Tuesday, Alexander told industry leaders aviation was good for economic growth and said she was \"not some sort of flight-shaming eco warrior\".\nThe growth arguments for expanding Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK's two largest airports, differ with the former catering for more freight traffic relating to international goods trade. \nAn extra runway at Gatwick would see capacity increased for holidaymakers and business travellers, particularly for short-haul destinations, as opposed to Heathrow's longer-haul flights.\nGatwick managers have said that with 55 take-offs and landings in a busy hour, the airport is \"full\".\nBeing able to use both runways could increase the number of departures by 50,000 a year by the end of the 2030s, the airport argued. \nIt said some 30,000 of those flights are planned to depart from the north runway which will only be used for departures and not landings.\nBut there is strong opposition to any expansion, particularly from climate campaigners.\nGreenpeace UK policy director Douglas Parr said the extension would not drive economic growth. \"The only thing it's set to boost is air pollution, noise, and climate emissions,\" he added.\nAlex Chapman, senior economist at left-of-centre think tank New Economics Foundation, also argued the move would not create new jobs, but would just shift them from other parts of the country.\n\"People are already perfectly able to catch cheap flights on holiday or travel for business,\" he added.\nUnion Unite general secretary Sharon Graham backed Gatwick having a second runway, but warned it would need \"to come with guarantees of well paid, unionised jobs and proper facilities for workers\".\nBronwen Jones, development director at Gatwick, said a second runway would be \"a win for everyone\".\nShe said it would create more flight slots across both runways. \n\"That allows us to offer new routes, new airlines, more frequencies on existing routes, so that passengers have more choice.\"\nSally Pavey, chair of Communities Against Gatwick Noise Emissions (CAGNE), is worried about \"uncontrollable noise, ramifications on the roads, decline in air quality... and climate change\".\n\"We can't keep ignoring climate change and it would be wrong to allow a new 'bucket and spade' runway, as we put it, at the expense of residents and the economy,\" she said. \nThe group would take legal action through a judicial review if the expansion goes ahead, she added.\nGatwick said it has committed to reducing noise levels to below those of 2019 - which CAGNE says was one of the worst years for noise.\nOn Wednesday the government's independent advisers, the UK climate change committee (UKCCC), recommended that to meet the country's climate goals the amount of planet-warming gases released by the country's aviation sector needed to fall by 17% compared to 2003 levels.\nSome of the pollution from flying, it said, could be reduced by switching planes to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and by capturing the planet-warming gases released.\nBut experts think it could be challenging to obtain the feedstock, like corn grain or food waste, needed to make SAF.\nThe UKCCC said the best way to reduce the industry's impact on climate change would be to significantly slow the demand for flying.\nAt current levels demand is expected to grow by 53% by 2040, while the UKCCC says this should be closer to 16%.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

Instead, there'll be big numbers from Ezra Collective, Sam Fender, Lola Young, and Teddy Swims.\nAn eclectic set of nominations also sees recognition for The Beatles, a Christmas song by Eurovision star Sam Ryder, and hits by TikTok stars like Artemas and KSI.\nHere's what you need to know ahead of the ceremony.\n\nIt might not have been year's biggest-selling album, but Charli XCX's Brat spawned the most conversations.\nReleased in June, it combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she'd accumulated, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.\nJust as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.\nAs authentic as it was catchy, Charli's seventh album introduced her to a whole new audience... and brought her a clutch of Brit nominations.\nEarlier this week, organisers announced she'd won songwriter of the year - earning the star her first ever Brit award (she'd received nominations before in the best female and best pop act categories).\nThat sets the scene for her to dominate tonight's show. If she wins everything she's nominated for, she'll tie with Raye as the most-awarded artist in a single Brits ceremony.\nSabrina Carpenter gave one of the best performances at last month's Grammy Awards. \nArriving on stage in a sparkly tuxedo dress, she rearranged her hits Espresso and Please Please Please in a jazzy big band style, and even delivered a fleet-footed tap dance sequence.\nBetter still, she turned the whole performance into a screwball comedy - missing her cues, dropping her cane, and accidentally knocking over her set. \nA former Disney star, she sold it all with a cheeky nod and a wink, undercutting the ceremony's more self-serious acts (The Weeknd, we're looking at you).\nHopefully the singer will deliver something equally Short n' Sweet when she pops into the Brits ahead of her UK tour.\nLiam Payne had a huge connection to the Brits, both as part of One Direction and as a solo artist, so it's likely that the ceremony will include a tribute to the star - who tragically died in Argentina last October.\nGossip columns have speculated that his former bandmates would reunite to honour his memory, but with Zayn and Louis both on tour, that seems unlikely.\nAccording to The Sun, the tribute will be \"a strong section of the show and not simply an In Memoriam name-check\".\nQuoting an unnamed source, the newspaper said: \"His family aren't involved in the plans but they are being kept in the loop.\n\"The Brits are treating it with the utmost respect and sensitivity.\"\nIt's four years since Jack Whitehall last hosted the Brit Awards, but his tenure was largely seen as a triumph - thanks largely to his willingness to poke fun at the stars in the audience.\n\"If you like Adele songs but find them too upbeat you're in for a treat,\" he said at the 2018 ceremony. \n\"Sam Smith will be performing.\"\nHe's been honing his script for this year's ceremony over the Atlantic, jetting over from US filming commitments with less than 48 hours to go.\nBut in a preview video, he was up to his old tricks, suggesting he should spray-paint himself orange to declare \"Make the Brits Great Again\".\n\nWith 70 nominees across 13 categories, there are lots of records up for grabs this year. Here are some of the big ones.\nInside the UK, the ceremony is broadcast live on ITV and ITVX from 20:15 GMT. International viewers can watch the show on the official Brits YouTube channel.\nBBC News will be live from the red carpet from 16:30GMT - with a live page providing coverage throughout the night. \nArtist of the year\nGroup of the year\nAlbum of the Year\nRead the full list of nominees here.\n",

        "article_text": "Italian cuisine may be one of the most recognised and loved in the world \u2013 often imagined as a collection of ancient recipes and local traditions preserved by skilful nonnas over the centuries. But now, a food historian is exposing common myths and false stories, arguing that the Italian cuisine as we know it is barely a few decades old.\nFood is no doubt an integral part of the country's culture and identity \u2013 so much so that Italians cherish Neapolitan pizza or pasta alla carbonara as much as the great historical and artistic treasures of the boot-shaped peninsula. Tales abound of centuries-old local feuds over what city has the best filled pasta, while every local cheese or cured meat is likely to boast links to the Renaissance or the Middle Ages.\nAlberto Grandi, food historian and professor of economic history at the University of Parma, has been debunking Italian food myths for years. In 2018, Grandi published Denominazione di Origine Inventata (Invented Designation of Origin: The Lies of Marketing on Typical Italian Products) and later launched a podcast called DOI. But it was a 2023 interview with Financial Times that put Grandi's work into the spotlight and sparked wide debates across Italy.\nGrandi claimed in the interview that pasta alla carbonara was invented in Italy just after World War Two using US Army provisions like bacon and powdered egg yolks, countering the common belief that the authentic recipe includes pork jowl and Roman pecorino cheese. This theory is backed by other authors, like Luca Cesari in The Discovery of Pasta: A History in Ten Dishes, but caused outrage in a country increasingly obsessed with maintaining the lore of Italian authenticity in food. The discussion evolved into a heated Italian-American dispute about the origin of the iconic dish. \u00a0\nGrandi's latest book, La Cucina Italiana Non Esiste (Italian Cuisine Doesn't Exist), written with his podcast co-host Daniele Soffiati and published in April 2024, stirred new controversies with its provocative title.\u00a0\nThe idea that many beloved recipes and products such as cheeses or cured meats have hundreds of years of history, Grandi and Soffiati claim, is pure fantasy. Food is constantly changing and evolving. No product or recipe has always been as we know it now, and most dishes have a shorter history than most people imagine.\nGrandi argues that migration is what made Italian cuisine what it is today. Millions of people left Italy in the 19th and 20th Centuries, emigrating to South America, North America and European countries. They were leaving behind a country that was poverty-stricken, where the diet was limited to a handful of products. Pellagra, a disease caused by lack of vitamin B3, was endemic in several areas of Italy at the end of the 19th Century.\u00a0\nThe Italians who landed on New York's Ellis Island left hunger and misery behind. And it was in the \"new world\", Grandi argues, that Italian immigrants found the wealth and ingredients to create the recipes that eventually popularised Italian food worldwide.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nHowever, many Italians are not familiar with this history. They might imagine that their beloved recipes were born in Italy, passed down, unchanged, from generation to generation and eventually exported abroad by Italian migrants. \"It might seem that the rest of the world didn't know how to eat until all of a sudden Italians arrived,\" says Grandi. He believes it's pure myth \u2013 popularised by social media \u2013 that nonnas taught Americans how to cook rich, genuine Italian food.\nPizza is the most famous example of this. Born as a cheap street food in Naples, in the 19th Century it was almost synonymous with poverty and filth. Pizza is \"a crust of leavened bread dough, oven-toasted, with a sauce of a bit of everything on top\", wrote Pinocchio author Carlo Collodi in 1886. He added that pizza had \"an air of complex filth that perfectly matches that of its vendor\".\nIt was in America, says Grandi, that pizza became \"red\". While fresh tomatoes were among the original toppings, Italian immigrants to the US popularised pizza prepared with tomato sauce, a product that industrialisation made easy to access and store. And it was in the US that pizzerias really started to take off. \u00a0\nScholars call this process \"the pizza effect\": when a product leaves its place of origin, gets profoundly transformed and then returns to its place of origin to be fully embraced in a completely different form.\nGrandi also angered Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese producers when he argued that parmesan has evolved for the better over the last few decades, and the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese that was eaten in Italy 100 years ago and earlier \u2013 a smaller wheel with a black rind \u2013 is now only made in Wisconsin.\nThe shift in the Italian culinary landscape started with the rapid expansion that occurred in Italy post-WWII. The boom brought new possibilities to millions of Italians. Cars, supermarkets and refrigerators meant that people who were limited to a daily local supply could travel to restaurants, buy new products and create new recipes. Tiramisu, says Grandi, is a great example of this: a dessert created in the late 1960s that is based on supermarket ingredients and only possible with a refrigerator. \u00a0\u00a0\nWith the new products and brands also came marketing. \"Television influenced our cuisine and gastronomical identity greatly,\" says Grandi. He argues that most of Italy's gastronomic traditions were invented by food marketers. Carosello, a short television programme that aired in Italy every night from 1957 to 1977, introduced new products and brands through stories, sketches and iconic characters. Carosello provided the consumer education upon which Italian home cuisine was then built, especially by mothers and grandmothers.\nGrandi's book explains that when industry-driven growth started to lose steam in the 1970s, Italy's economy pivoted to small companies, niche products and local excellence. Thousands of protected labels and regional products emerged and Italians doubled down on gastro-nationalism.\n\"Cuisine is no longer part of our identity,\" says Grandi, \"it is our identity.\" He argues that after decades of industry decline and economic stagnation, Italians have no faith in the future \u2013 that's why they \"invent the past\".\nIn less than a century, Grandi says, Italians went from being malnourished migrants to self-appointed custodians of ancestral traditions. The obsession for tradition has sparked searches for \"true\" recipes and \"correct\" ways of consuming food. Italians are ever more adamant to say that bolognese should be called rag\u00f9 alla bolognese and never served with spaghetti. You should also never put chicken (let alone pineapple) on pizza, cook pasta alla carbonara with cream or break spaghetti in two.\n\"I always say that every time anyone in the world adds cream to carbonara, somebody in Rome dies,\" says Grandi. \"Italians used to get upset when they were defined as 'pizza, pasta, mandolin, mafia',\" he adds. \"Now it looks like it's us Italians feeding those stereotypes.\"\nSocial media seems to have contributed to popularising these attitudes. The X account Italians mad at food, launched in 2015, showcases comments of furious Italians who are outraged and offended by how people in other nations choose to eat \"their\" cuisine. The account even sells t-shirts with quotes like \"carbonara is not an opinion\" and \"you break spaghetti, you break my heart\".\nContent creators on platforms like TikTok and Instagram have popularised a genre of video content showing Italians reacting to food \"blasphemy\", with creators and celebrities vigorously showcasing their disgust and indignation \u2013 with no shortage of drama and hand gestures.\nThe popularity of these memes is now so widespread that people might think all Italians feel offended by people's choice of pasta sauce.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\n\"Food as entertainment can be triggering, especially for Italians,\" says Aurora Cavallo, a young Italian chef known as Cooker Girl, with more than 1.3 million followers on both TikTok and Instagram. \"For many people in the world, food isn't just an object but something that carries a lot of significance,\" she adds. \"In my experience, Italians can be more sensitive not just towards recipes, but also towards how food is handled on screen.\"\nGrandi's relentless debunking of Italian food myths has made many people angry over the last few years, but he is adamant that he just wants to dispute the invented history of many products and recipes, not their quality.\nAs social media demonstrates, however, some Italians have convinced themselves that food dogmas are more important than innovations or accuracy.\n\"We don't need to make up stories about Italy's amazing products,\" says Cavallo, echoing Grandi. \"We shouldn't create a situation in which changing recipes is the end of the world because that's the opposite of how Italian food came to be.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "When Luna Sofia Miranda approached Sean Baker in a strip club in New York in 2022, she tried her best to charm him.\nBut he \"very clearly did not want to buy a lap dance,\" she says.\nMiranda, who was 23 at the time, started asking why he and his wife were there.\n\"I'm very nosy,\" she says. \"So I kept asking them questions and I finally got it out of them. They were making a film about strippers.\"\nShe told them she had studied acting, and - after a successful audition - got a call on her 24th birthday, to offer her a part in the film.\nThat film, Anora, is now seen as one of the frontrunners heading into the Oscars on Sunday.\nIt's directed by Baker, and stars Mikey Madison, who is up for best actress for her role as a New York stripper.\nMadison, 25, relied on real-life strippers to help her perfect the part.\nWhen she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.\n\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.\nThey \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.\nWe've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.\nSome praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".\nEdie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.\nTurquet, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.\nShe got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.\n\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.\n\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"\nTurquet points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.\n\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"\nBut when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.\n\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"\nBaker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.\nShe says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.\nThey connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.\nIn the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nMiranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.\n\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.\nOne of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"\nThis section contains spoilers for Anora\nMiranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.\n\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.\n\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"\nTurquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.\n\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.\n\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"\nBut overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.\n\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.\n\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"\nShe said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".\n\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"\n\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"\nFor Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.\n\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\" \nFor Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.\nIn the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.\nWe also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.\n\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.\n\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"\nWhen Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.\nFootage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.\n\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.\nNow, all eyes are on the Oscars.\nMiranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.\n\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"\nShe said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.\n\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.\n\"If this film wins an Oscar, I want to see that.\"",

        "article_text": "A trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer.\nSpeaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged \"a real trade deal\" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners. \nThe trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade. \nSir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an \"unprecedented\" second state visit to the UK.  \nReceiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a \"great honour\" and described the King as \"a wonderful man\".\nSir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was \"truly historic\". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit. \nHaving confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes.\nThe US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. \nOn the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. \nHowever, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine.\nAsked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \"backstop\". \nHe said \"nobody will play around\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals. \nThe US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\". \n\"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\" he said. \nHe later added he had \"a lot of respect\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday.\nThe UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders. \nHowever, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\". \nThe deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back. \nAfter taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\". \nReferring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. \n\"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said. \nHe said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century. \n\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said. \nTrump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union. \nHe also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.\nAsked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\"\n\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"\nIn a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\". \nSince leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.\nIn his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way.\nHowever, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems. \nThe head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce - a former Labour MP and minister - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that businesses will be encouraged by what he called an \"important first step\".\n\"In trade negotiations, relationships matter,\" says William Bain, adding that seeing the two leaders find common ground on their respective economies and trade is \"helpful\".\nHe added that a deal to keep tariffs low would most benefit automotive and pharmaceutical industries in the UK.",

the company's successful mobile phone app that works with a device's GPS to place monsters in the real world - is an example of this.\n\"This is what I think is the biggest strength of Pok\u00e9mon, and it's important for us to come up with this kind of idea,\" he says. \n\"So that's how I think of what we want to achieve next.\"\nOne of the hottest topics among long-term Pok\u00e9mon fans today is scalpers.\nThe resurgence of the collectible card game has caught the attention of resellers who buy up new packs in the hope of landing rare, valuable cards.\nYouTuber Logan Paul switched a lot of people on to the potential profits of the hobby when he paid $5.3m (\u00a33.9m) for the most expensive Pok\u00e9mon card ever.\nGaming companies have long had an issue with the second-hand market, and Mr Ishihara says it \"prevents new products from being sold\".\n\"When the second hand market becomes more valuable because of rarity, that is problematic because our business is affected.\"\nFans have suggested The Pok\u00e9mon Company could produce a greater volume of hard-to-find or limited-run items but Mr Ishihara says it cannot do much to control the resale market.\n\"Those items are seen to be valuable because they're rare or seen as vintage \u2013 and it's not our place to say that they're not,\" he says.\nOn the topic of counterfeit products Mr Ishihara is more direct, and says the company's legal teams have fought \"rigorously\" against clones and fakes since the beginning. \nIt recently won a long legal battle against the Chinese company behind a copycat mobile app.\nAnd earlier this year it joined Nintendo to sue the makers of Palworld -

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

        "article_text": "Great Britain toured Australia in 1996\nEngland v Australia: Women's Test\nVenue: Allegiant Stadium, Las Vegas Date: Saturday, 1 March (02:00 GMT, Sunday, 2 March)\nCoverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app\nLisa McIntosh is up-front with her thoughts on England's women facing world champions Australia in Las Vegas.\n\"Do you know? It makes me feel really proud,\" says the former Great Britain captain. \"But I'm not going to lie - I'm a bit envious.\n\"I'd have loved to have just turned up with my kitbag and got on the plane and played in Vegas. But I'm made up for them.\"\nWhen England's players step out at Allegiant Stadium in Vegas on Saturday night, McIntosh is part of the trailblazing group of women they can thank.\nTwenty-nine years ago, with minimal help, that group organised and self-funded a Great Britain tour to Australia - and beat the hosts. They remain the last British rugby league team to win an Ashes series.\nSo they know what it takes to defeat the Jillaroos.\n\"I think what England need to do is not fear them,\" McIntosh says. \"Australia are so good, that straight away people start to worry.\n\"But you go out there and you be confident. If you match them player for player, there's no reason why you can't beat them.\"\nBack in 1996, Great Britain's travelling party overcame the odds to defeat Australia.\nA series that was on a knife edge until its final seconds featured funding battles, scrambles for flights and accommodation, a tour manager carrying \u00a329,000 in a briefcase, disappearing kit and emotional phone calls home.\nThen came the forging of lifelong friendships, belated Hall of Fame recognition - and a victory shield that vanished.\nBut first came the fight just to get on to the pitch.\nPaula Clark was the team physio, Nikki Carter the tour manager, and Jackie Sheldon the assistant coach\n\"It was basically about two weeks before we were due to go that we actually knew we were going,\" says Jackie Sheldon, Great Britain's assistant coach in 1996.\nSheldon was secretary of the Women's Amateur Rugby League Association (Warla), which then oversaw the British women's game, when it received an invitation in 1995 to tour Australia.\nAccepting the offer was the easy part. Then came the trickier aspects. For a start, there wasn't a Great Britain women's team.\nSo with Warla chair Anne Thompson, Sheldon set up a committee to hire a head coach, find players and form a backroom team. With no budget, everyone had to be persuaded to take on the roles unpaid.\n\"These people who got involved were professional people,\" Sheldon says. \"And they were all giving their time for free.\n\"I would go: 'This is what I want, and I haven't got any money. Will you come on board?' And they'd say: 'Yeah.' Because they believed in what we were trying to do.\"\nIan Harris, a coach who worked in local authority sports development, took charge of the team, with Sheldon and Thompson as his assistants, and a squad of 26 was put together. Now they had to find \u00a370,000 to pay for the tour.\nSheldon, herself then a council sports development officer, got to work. \"We were not funded by anywhere,\" she says, \"so I wrote a grant application to the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, and we got something like \u00a334,000 from them. And each of the players were given a target of about \u00a31,000 to raise.\"\nAs the summer of 1996 approached, the plans were coming together.\nThen with just weeks to go, the team's tour manager dropped out - and chaos loomed.\nSheldon and Thompson knew Nikki Carter, a Hull Vixens player who had management experience from working at a care home. They asked if she would step in as tour manager.\n\"I was asked: 'Do you think you could help them out?'\" Carter says.\n\"I was like: 'What do you mean?' They said: 'Go to Australia with them.' I was like: 'Hmm, I'd love to. Best go and ask my boss, really.'\n\"But it suddenly started to unravel. Lots of things that should have been organised 12 weeks out from going to Australia weren't actually organised.\"\nThe touring party had no flights, no accommodation, no kit.\nSheldon says: \"The previous manager, prior to Nikki, had been tasked with securing the flights, and he didn't secure them and didn't tell us, so it was only about three weeks beforehand that it all came out that we had no flights.\n\"My manager allowed me time in work to phone all the airlines to try to get, I think, 32 flights at three weeks' notice.\"\nAs Sheldon sorted flights, Carter sourced kit, chased hotels and helped to complete the fundraising. \"Most of the money was raised in the final eight weeks,\" she says. They needed to set up a bank account quickly for the tour. And in 1996, that was a problem.\n\"There was no bank account set up in Australia,\" Carter says, \"and it wasn't like now, where you could ring the bank and say: 'I'm going to put this money in there and I'm going to spend it from my bank account.'\n\"One of the girls on the tour, who played for Wakefield, was a bank manager. And she said: 'It's not possible to set the bank account up. It took too long.'\n\"So I ended up going to Australia with a briefcase with \u00a329,000 in cash and travellers' cheques, because there just was no other way. I carried that briefcase through the whole tour - everywhere I went, that went.\"\nThe Great Britain party made it to Australia, but there were more obstacles. Arriving at Sydney Airport, they were hit with an immediate transport problem. Their coach was only big enough to fit either all the players, or all the kit - but not both. Carter, meanwhile, was organising team meals on the fly.\n\"I think there was a lot of bartering,\" captain McIntosh says, \"trying to get good deals, where we'd get breakfast and tea included.\"\nThe team faced seven matches in 19 days: a Sydney Select side were thumped 86-0, before an Australian Capital Territory side were defeated 36-0 in Canberra, where the first Test against Australia was also held.\nGreat Britain lost that match 16-14, to a late penalty - amid controversy.\n\"We got a penalty in the last few minutes,\" McIntosh says. \"Karen Burrows converted it, but the officials disallowed it - they said it didn't go over.\"\nNext was a trip north to Brisbane, with the team booked in for an exhausting 12-hour, 700-mile-plus coach journey. Tour manager Carter intervened.\n\"We'd gone on the coach from Sydney to Canberra, but we needed to fly to Brisbane,\" Carter says.\n\"So we went to the airport and I said: 'Would you be able to get us 32 flight tickets from Canberra to Brisbane tomorrow?' And the guy at the desk looked at me a bit strange. He tapped away and he said: 'Oh, yeah, yeah, we could do that.' Then I had to negotiate on all the luggage.\n\"And then I said to him: 'OK. How would I pay: Cash or travellers' cheques?' And this guy's face was a picture. So I paid for 32 flights with some travellers' cheques.\"\nIn Brisbane, the Great Britain and Australia players stayed in the same accommodation. \"They were like student dorms,\" McIntosh says.\nHere, there was another challenge for the tourists - keeping track of their kit.\n\"We were given each two shirts, so at the end of the tour, we had one to swap and one to keep so we could frame,\" McIntosh says. \"But the kit was laundered and a couple of shirts from our bag went missing, including my spare number 13 shirt.\n\"We never found out what happened to it, but we had our suspicions.\"\nBritain beat a Queensland XIII 22-8 to warm up for the second Test against Australia, and they won that key match 18-12 to level the series. Now it was back to Sydney for the decider.\nBut for some members of the squad with young children, being far away from home was proving tough.\n\"I rang home at certain times of the day because I knew the kids wouldn't be there,\" Carter says. \"My eldest daughter was six when I went. If I rang home, she would be crying down the phone, saying: 'I'm missing you, Mummy.' And it would then take days to recover from that phone call.\n\"There was that pang of guilt because I'm out here and I'm having a great time. At the same time, I've left my children at home - and as a mother, is that the right thing?\n\"It was hard and anybody in that position who says it wasn't, I think will be telling you porky pies.\"\nGreat Britain's team of 1996 are the only northern hemisphere women's side to have beaten Australia in a three-Test series\nAfter a 30-0 victory over a Presidents XIII in Sydney, Great Britain faced the deciding Test against Australia. It was a nail-biter.\nThe tourists built up a healthy lead, with McIntosh running half the length of the pitch for a fine individual try - but had to withstand a battering as Australia fought back. As the clock ticked down, Britain held a slender 20-18 lead.\n\"We were defending on our line for our lives for the last 10 minutes,\" McIntosh says. \"It just never seemed to end.\"\nThe captain has little memory of watching those closing minutes, having been concussed in a clattering tackle.\n\"When the final whistle went,\" McIntosh says, \"I said to Paula Clark, the team physio: Have we won?\n\"We didn't realise how significant it would be in time - winning the Ashes in Australia. It was just like: 'We beat the Aussies on their own turf and it was great.'\"\nLisa McIntosh and vice-captain Brenda Dobek would be later inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame\nThe Britain squad returned to a quiet reception at Heathrow. \"We came through the airport and it was like tumbleweed,\" McIntosh says.\nBut off the back of the series win, Sheldon convinced Sport England to fund a national women's rugby league development manager and was asked to take on the role. She would also be England's head coach through a 1998 tour to New Zealand, the World Cups of 2000 and 2003 and, in between, a return tour to Australia in 2002.\n\"The development dropped off after 2003, when I left,\" Sheldon says. \"GB was not a priority for the RFL at the time. It was re-established in 2007 when they started getting Sport England funding for it, but neither England nor GB have beaten Australia since 2002.\n\"You can see the difference in terms of what Australia started to do after that period.\n\"It's physicality, building the team, intensity of competition, and development of the women's game, so you've got breadth and depth of players coming through. It's an infrastructure you need, and you can see it in Australia.\"\nBelatedly, Great Britain's 1996 team have been recognised. Former referee Julia Lee, who officiated during the tour, began driving the Women in Rugby League project, a celebration of the sport's female pioneers.\nIn 2022, McIntosh joined team-mates Brenda Dobek and Sally Milburn as they became the first women inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame.\nLast October, Jane Banks and Michelle Land followed, while the 1996 side became the first team to be inducted.\n\"I think it's sad that it took so long, but I think it's fantastic that we're in a different place now,\" Carter says.\nOctober's ceremony in Wigan brought virtually the entire squad back together.\n\"There was a camaraderie that was built in '96,\" Carter says. \"We all met up for the Hall of Fame inauguration, and it was like we'd never been away from each other.\"\nGreat Britain's players made long-lasting friendships with the Australians too - which finally reunited McIntosh with one of her shirts.\n\"I never found the shirt that was taken during the tour, but I did get back the one that I swapped,\" McIntosh says. \"Their captain, who I swapped my shirt with, returned it to me.\"\nBut there's one major memento from 1996 that no-one can find.\nGreat Britain's team, mostly in Australia shirts, show off the shield that later went missing\nBritain's players, wearing the Australia shirts they had just swapped, posed for a team picture after winning the series.\nIn that special moment, they showed off their prize - a large shield.\nThree years ago, before an exhibition to celebrate their achievements, an appeal was put out to locate the shield. It hasn't turned up.\n\"We thought we'd brought it back, and that it was at the RFL,\" McIntosh says. \"But it's not.\"\nThe mystery remains unresolved. \"Lisa always said she reckoned I had it in my attic,\" Sheldon says. \"I've got just about everything else in my attic but not that shield.\"\nIf anyone does have it, they're sitting on a piece of history. \n\"It's in somebody's attic, because I can't see where else it would have gone,\" Carter says. \"So maybe everyone needs to look in their attic!\"",

That's when Mrs Webb, from Watford, became a fan.\nShe began a business with her husband, Harry, selling the cards online just before the pandemic. During lockdown, it \"really blew up\".\nMrs Webb started making YouTube videos under the name \"PokiChloe\" to reach new fans.\nThe couple joined forces with another Youtuber, Dean Leander - AKA PokeDean - to open a physical business.\nToday her Youtube channel, which mostly shows daily life in her Chorleywood shop, has more than 118,000 subscribers.\nIn recent years, Pok\u00e9mon cards have become valuable collectors' items and many shop visitors hope they too could be sitting on a gold mine.\nLast year, a Nottinghamshire man made \u00a355,000 when he sold a collection of cards from the 1990s and 2000s.\nBut a collector from Suffolk failed to sell his fourth print Charizard card when it did not reach its reserve of \u00a38,000.\nMrs Webb explained: \"It could be anything that makes a card collectable. \n\"It could be that they're rare... It could be that it's a really popular Pok\u00e9mon.\n\"Sometimes overnight prices change on cards and I can't tell you why that card is now valuable.\"\nSometimes cards worth up to \u00a3100,000 have been brought into the shop, although PokiChloe admits the big sums no longer surprise her. \n\"It's going to sound really awful: I'm very used to it now,\" she says. \n\"It is very surreal to think that this little bit of cardboard is worth that sort of money because to some people that's a deposit for a house - that could buy them two or three cars.\n\"But with what we do now we're exposed to it. Often it's just another day and another Pok\u00e9mon card.\"\nMany of the visitors who arrive at Collector's Cardhouse come with large binders tucked under their arms filled with cards they stashed away in their childhood. \nMany of these collections are, unfortunately, not worth anything. \nIf, however, PokiChloe does deem a card valuable, it then has to be \"graded\".\nThe process involves sending the card to a grading company who analyse it for signs of wear and then award it a graded score, usually out of 10, which denotes its quality and potential value.\nPokiChloe compared those cards that get a 10 to \"gold dust\".\n\"It has to be completely clean,\" she says. \n\"There can't be scratches on the holographic part, there can't be any whitening or damage on the back, it can't be creased. It has to be perfect like it's never been touched before.\n\"We had a Charizard that was graded a 10. It was a special card that was given out to employees at Creatures, who own Pok\u00e9mon. I think there's only 300 of them and we had a 10 and we sold it for just under \u00a340,000.\"\nMrs Webb said a common misunderstanding is that a card has to be old to be valuable.\n\"There are packs that you could open today from the shop that cost you about \u00a330,\" she says.\n\"If you got the best card in the set and it was graded a 10, you'd be looking at a couple of thousand.\n\"And they're cards that only came out a few years ago. So they're not even what we would call vintage. They're modern cards.\"\nA graded card, regardless of how damaged it is, is sealed in plastic to preserve its condition. \nMrs Webb said: \"We get people that send off cards that aren't in good condition. They just want to encapsulate it and keep it as a memory. So that's quite nice to see.\n\"I know the money is a big part of it and obviously people are blown away by the prices, but for some people it's about the memories, the nostalgia and just having some memories from when they were kids.\"\nNext year Pok\u00e9mon is celebrating its 30th anniversary. PokiChloe has ambitious plans for the future of Collector's Cardhouse.\n\"I want to keep this growing,\" she says.\n\"If you'd asked me about this five years ago I wouldn't have believed it. I used to work in an office, I had a very normal job before this, and now this is my life... So, as long as people enjoy it, I'm going to keep doing it.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

        "article_text": "\"I swear to God I need help,\" said the man quietly on the other end of the line.\nThe Ethiopian, who calls himself Mike, said he is being held with 450 others in a building inside Myanmar, along the country's border with Thailand.\nThey are among the thousands of people who have been freed from the notorious scam compounds that have thrived on the border for years, in what appears to be the toughest action so far against the industry along the Thai-Myanmar border.\nBut many of them are now stranded in Myanmar in makeshift camps because the process of assessing them and arranging flights back to their own countries is so slow. \nThe armed militia groups who are holding them have a very limited capacity to support so many people \u2013 more than 7,000. One of them has said they have stopped freeing people from the compounds because they are not being moved to Thailand fast enough.\nThe BBC understands that conditions in the camps are unsanitary, food barely sufficient, and many of the freed workers, like Mike, are in poor health. He is suffering from panic attacks, after working for a year in a scam centre where he was routinely beaten.\nHe told us they got two very basic meals a day, there were only two toilets for 450 people, who he said were now relieving themselves wherever they could.\nMike described being invited a year ago to take up what he was promised would be a good job, in Thailand, requiring only good English language and typing skills.\nInstead he found himself subjected to a brutal regime, forced to work long hours every day to meet the target for defrauding people online set by his Chinese bosses.\n\"It was the worst experience of my life. Of course I was beaten. But believe me I have seen a lot worse done to other people.\"\nMike is one of an estimated 100,000 people who are believed to have been lured to work in the scam operations along the Thai-Myanmar border, most of them run by Chinese fraud and gambling operatives who have taken advantage of the lawlessness in this part of Myanmar. \nDespite horrifying accounts of abuse from those who escaped in the past, thousands still come from parts of the world where good jobs are scarce, enticed by promises of good money.\nChina, where many of the scam victims come from, has acted to shut down scam operations along its own border with Myanmar, but until this year neither China nor Thailand had done much about the Thai-Myanmar border.\nAriyan, a young man from Bangladesh, has come back to Thailand to try to help 17 friends who are still there. He said he made a promise to himself to do this after his own gruelling escape from one of the most notorious scam centres last October.\nHe showed us a brief, shaky video of the compound, still under construction in a remote, forested valley, where he was held, and remembers the terrible treatment he and his friends suffered at the hands of their Chinese boss.\n\"They gave us a target every week, $5,000. If not, they gave us two electric shocks. Or they put us in a dark room, with no windows. But if we earned a lot of money, they were very happy with us.\"\nAriyan had to approach men in the Middle East and lure them into transferring funds to fictitious investments. Using AI, the scammers made him appear on the screen to be an attractive young woman, altering his voice as well. \nHe says he hated doing it. He remembers one man who was willing to sell his wife's jewellery to fund the fraudulent investment, and wishing he could warn him. But he said the bosses monitored all their calls.\nThe release of the scam workers started more than two weeks ago after Thailand, under pressure from China and some of its own politicians, cut power and telecommunications links to the compounds on the border. \nIt limited banking access to the scam bosses and issued arrest warrants for some of the militia leaders who had been protecting the business.\nThat hit the business, but it also hit the ordinary Karen people who live nearby even harder, putting pressure on the militia commanders to show willingness in ending the abuses in the scam centres. They began helping those trying to escape, and completely evacuating some compounds.\nThe camp Mike is housed in is now being guarded by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, a breakaway insurgent faction of the ethnic Karen community. \nUntil recently, it was protecting the many scam compounds which have sprung up in its territory. You can see them easily as you drive along the Moei River which divides the two countries - unlikely expanses of new buildings over in war-torn Karen State contrasting with the rural landscape on the Thai side of the border.\nThailand insists it is moving as fast as it can to process the former scam workers and get them home. \nA group of 260 freed workers were brought over the Moei River on a raft earlier this month. And around 621 Chinese nationals were flown straight back to China with a police escort on chartered planes. Otherwise, the movement of freed workers to Thailand seems to have stalled.\nThe problem is that they are from many different countries, some of which are doing little to help get their people home. Around 130 of the first 260 who came over are from Ethiopia, which does not have an embassy in Bangkok. \nThe BBC has been told that some other African countries will only fly their people home if someone else pays. Most of the freed workers have nothing; even their passports were withheld by the compound bosses.\nThailand fears bringing over thousands of people it will then have to look after indefinitely. It also wants to screen them to find out which are genuine victims of human trafficking and which may have committed criminal acts, but does not have the capacity to do this with such a large group of people.\nDifferent ministries and agencies, including the army, are involved in managing this problem, and have to agree who does what. It does not help that several senior police and immigration officers have been transferred over their alleged involvement in the scam business.\n\"If this issue is not resolved, then we will not stop working on it \u2013 we must work seriously,\" said Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday in Bangkok. But she was referring to the wider problem of the scam business, not the growing humanitarian crisis among the freed workers.\n\"Unfortunately, it seems we're in a bit of a standstill,\" says Judah Tana, an Australian who runs an NGO which has for years been helping the victims of trafficking in the scam centres.\n\"We are hearing distressing information about the lack of sanitation and toilets. Many of the 260 who already came were screened for TB and tested positive. We are hearing from those who are still inside that people are coughing up blood. They are very happy that they have been liberated from the scam compounds, but our worry is that we're not engaging fast enough.\"\nThailand now seems ready to bring over one group of 94 Indonesians, as their embassy has been pushing for their release for several days and has booked flights to Indonesia for them.\nBut that still leaves more than 7,000 still inside Myanmar, unsure what will now happen to them.\nMike told me he and many others with him feared that if they are not allowed to cross into Thailand soon, the DKBA may hand them back to the scam bosses, where they could face punishment for trying to leave. \nOn Wednesday night his panic attacks and breathing were so bad, he said, they took him to hospital.\n\"I just want to go home,\" he said over the phone. \"I just want to go back to my country. That is all I am asking.\"",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'I accept what I did was awful' - 'Steve'\nWarning: this article contains offensive language\nSteve was leaving the football ground when he shouted back at some away fans. Moments later he was in handcuffs and under arrest.\nHe had shouted a homophobic slur, committing a hate crime that led to him being charged with a Section 5 Public Order offence. The case ended up in court, where he pleaded guilty, and he was banned from attending football matches in the UK for three years.\nNow Steve - not his real name as he fears for the impact on his professional and personal life - is trying to make amends after coming through a fan education programme run by anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out.\nHere he shares his story with BBC Sport.\nA lifelong football fan, Steve had just watched his side play Chelsea and was leaving the stadium.\n\"I heard Chelsea fans shouting and I shouted back, 'Oi, you Chelsea rent boys', gave them a few gestures and thought nothing of it.  I thought I was just having a bit of back and forth with the away fans,\" he said.\nWhat followed is all a bit of a blur.\n\"I walked away and then all of a sudden I was surrounded by six security guards. And then from that point, a police officer arrested me and put the cuffs on.\"\nSince January 2022, the Crown Prosecution Service has defined the \"Chelsea rent boy\" chant - aimed at the west London club's players and supporters - as a homophobic slur and says that anyone singing it is committing a hate crime and could face prosecution.\n\"I'm in my 20s and I didn't really understand that [term],\" Steve said. \"I knew there was stuff around it, but I didn't really perceive why it was homophobic.\"\nSteve was eventually referred to Kick It Out, which runs a fan education programme where offenders learn about the different types of discrimination and the impact their actions can have on victims.\n\"I accept that [what I did] was awful, and now it's about repaying that, turning that into something positive. I've had a look at myself... I'm willing to make amends,\" he said.\n\"People are going to make mistakes, but you're judged on how you then move forward.\"\nHe said the session had changed him \"massively\".\n\"It's made me aware of how there's a fine line between what's considered banter and just abuse.\"\nThe Kick It Out course is run by Alan Bush, the charity's fan education and engagement manager, who has delivered more than 400 sessions in the past five years. In that time, 40 fans were referred to him by either police or clubs for using the Chelsea slur.\n\"We can't ban our way out of discrimination and we can't just ban football fans from football. All we do is we push it back into society,\" Bush said.\n\"Football has a responsibility to educate its fans... then fans say to other fans  'you can't say that, mate,  you'll end up in court' or 'you can't say that because that's wrong'. There's a chance they report, there's a chance that they challenge. And I just think that has to be a far better than just banning people.\"\nHe added that \"the vast majority have not understood the gravity of how offensive that [chant] can be, how that can cause harassment, alarm and distress to an individual\".\nTo illustrate his point, Bush tells the offenders the story of Lee Johnson, a passionate Tottenham fan who was forced out of football for nearly a decade after hearing the Chelsea chant inside White Hart Lane as a teenager.\n\"It completely shook me to my core,\" Johnson - who is now co-chair of the Proud Lilywhites, the LGBTQ+ supporters' association of Tottenham Hotspur - told BBC Sport. \n\"It felt like all of the lights had gone out and I was just isolated by myself. It just took me straight back to when I was younger at school. 'Rent boy' was one of the things I used to get [called].\"\nJohnson had often been a target for abuse in his home town. Football used to be an escape, somewhere he could \"get lost in the magic of the game\" but hearing homophobic chanting made him question everything.\n\"I was thinking 'Am I safe here?' If people around me knew that I was gay, would they be attacking me or be verbally abusive? Would they stop singing it about Chelsea and would they start singing it about me?\" he said.\n\"People were using a term that has caused a lot of harm to me over the years. It's very traumatic. I think it was still the first half and I just said to my friend, 'I can't be here'. It was a fight or flight response. I left and I didn't come back for nearly 10 years.\"\nSince 2023, the Football Association has also been able to charge clubs if their fans sing the chant.\nSeven charges have been brought against six clubs for homophobic chanting, according to English football's governing body. The clubs, which include Wolves, Leeds and Luton have been fined a total of \u00a3415,000.\nTwo charges raised against Tottenham Hotspur following their Premier League match with Manchester United on 29 September 2024 are yet to be decided.\nThe updated FA guidance, combined with the change in law, appears to be having the desired effect.\nFigures from Kick it Out show reports of mass homophobic chanting are falling, with 17 reported incidents last season, down from 43 in the 2021-22 season.\nSteve knows he has been part of the problem.\nHe has never considered himself homophobic but since he got arrested he has been through a spectrum of emotions.\n\"Fear. Annoyance. Despair. Guilt. But then came acceptance,\" he said.\n\"My journey has sort of been about personal growth. Now I want to make a difference going forward. I want to make football a better place.\"\nHe wants to make sure other do not repeat his mistakes, adding: \"Treat everybody with respect or you'll end up like me with a ban and a criminal record.\n\"Some people who are gay have walked away from football altogether and don't feel it's safe. So, if I can just stop one person from doing that. I'll be happy. Just think before you speak.\"",

        "article_text": "The Trump administration's steep cuts to staff at national parks, forests and wildlife habitats have triggered a growing backlash, as public access and conservation efforts in these remote wild landscapes fade away.\nThe impacts have already been felt by visitors - who are seeing longer park entrance lines, reduced hours at visitor centres, trails closed and dirty public facilities - and workers who not only are worried about their futures as their jobs vanish, but also the state of these outdoor marvels eroding. \nEach season, Kate White and her team typically carry 600lbs (270kg) of litter on their backs out of the Enchantments, a sensitive alpine wilderness located in Washington state that welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year.\nRemote and often covered in snow and ice, staff are needed to maintain backcountry toilets that must be serviced with helicopters, which Ms White says may overflow without proper maintenance. \n \"I'm not totally sure what the plan is to get that done,\" she says.\n\"That's probably gonna be very damaging to the ecosystem in that area, and maybe to the visitor experience.\"\nBut one of the most important parts of her job was to keep people safe - and be there if the worst happened.\nAs a National Forest wilderness ranger for over nine years, she has seen her share of tragedy when hikers or campers are confronted with severe weather and remote and tricky terrain. She has comforted people who have faced life-threatening injuries and even recovered bodies of hikers who died while out in the steep and often icy mountain region.\n\"We were kind of usually first on scene if something were to happen,\" she says.\nOn any typical Saturday in the summer months, she'd speak to an average of 1,000 visitors. She and her team published reports on trail conditions and helped hikers who appeared unprepared - wearing sandals or not carrying enough water - and guided them to easier and safer routes. \nNow, those jobs are gone.\nShe worries what the cuts will mean for the future of public safety and how people experience US parks and forests, especially ahead of the busy spring and summer months when millions travel to visit. \nMass terminations, first announced on 14 February, have led to 5% of the National Park Service staff \u2013 around 1,000 workers - being forced out.\nThe cuts have hit the US Forest Service, which maintains thousands of miles of popular hiking trails, even harder. Around 10% of the Forest Service's staff - about 3,400 people, including Ms White and her team - have been fired.\nThe cuts have upended the management of national parks, which get around 325 million visitors annually, as well as national forests, which see about 159 million visitors each year.\nLong queues of cars were stuck outside Grand Canyon National Park over President's Day weekend, one day after the mass firing, due to a lack of toll operators to check people in at the gate. Similar lines of cars have been growing at other parks as well.\nA popular trail outside Seattle was closed indefinitely only hours after the cuts were announced, with a sign at the trailhead explaining that the closure is \"due to the large scale termination of Forest Service employees\" and \"will reopen when we return to appropriate staffing levels\".\nAt Yosemite National Park, the annual \"firefall\" spectacle led to a different kind of display this year when a group, which reportedly included employees, hung an upside-down American flag at the park in protest of the Trump administration's recent deep cuts to staff.\nAndria Townsend, a carnivore biologist who supervised a team of eight people at Yosemite National Park before she was fired in an email, told the BBC she \"100%\" supports the protest.\n\"It's bringing lots of good attention to the issue,\" she says.\nShe says she is especially worried for the future of the endangered species that she had been working to protect.\nMs Townsend studied and attached GPS collars to the Sierra Nevada red fox and the Pacific fisher, which is related to a badger, in attempts to track and preserve the species.\n\"They both are in dire straits,\" she says, with only about 50 fishers and 500 red fox left in the wild.\nStaff at a sister site conducting similar research were also cut.\n\"I don't want to be doom and gloom, but it's really hard to say what the future is now,\" she says.\n\"The future of conservation just feels very uncertain.\"\nLong-time couple Claire Thompson, 35, and Xander Demetrios, 36, have worked for the Forest Service for about a decade, most recently maintaining trails in central Washington state so that hikers could explore the snow-capped Cascade mountains.\nThe email firing them and thousands of other staff cited \"performance\" issues \u2013 something they took issue with.\n\"Especially with the amount we've gone above and beyond,\" says Mr Demetrios, explaining that his work in the backcountry had carried significant risk to his safety, and sometimes involved rescuing people from dangerous situations, including one person who had fallen in a river and become hypothermic.\nHe and Ms Thompson have carried heavy equipment through rugged terrain, through foul weather at times, to clear trails and repair bridges and outhouses \u2013 and never being paid more than $22 (\u00a317.40) an hour.\n\"It's been hurtful - insulting - to just feel like your work is so devalued, and by people who I'm quite certain have like zero concept of what we do at all,\" Ms Thompson added. \nFollowing a backlash, dozens of national park staff were reportedly rehired since the mass terminations on Valentine's Day. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, whose department oversees the National Park Service (NPS), has also committed to hiring over 5,000 seasonal workers during the coming warm months.\n\"On a personal level, of course, I've got great empathy for anybody that loses a job,\" Burgum told Fox News last Friday.\n\"But I think we have to realise that every American is better off if we actually stop having a $2 trillion a year deficit.\"\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) being spearheaded by Elon Musk claims to have saved over $65bn from the widespread cuts which have hit dozens of federal agencies across government. However, it has produced no evidence to back that figure, which would represent around 0.9% of the entire 2024 federal budget.\nOutdoor advocates say that travellers currently planning their outdoor vacations to national parks should expect numerous issues, including increased litter, a shortage of lodging and the unavailability of many services they have come to expect.\n\"If the administration doesn't reverse these policies, visitors are going to need to lower their expectations,\" says John Garder of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) in Washington DC.\nSome of these cuts are already being felt: Yosemite has fired their only locksmith, Gettysburg fired the staff who handle cabin reservations for visitors, and hurricane damage to the Appalachian Trail won't get repaired in time for through-hikers trying to complete the 2,200-mile (3,540km) trail.\nMeanwhile, private businesses that operate in and around parks stand to lose out on billions of dollars if visitors drop off, according to the NPCA.\nConcerns are also growing about the absence of park and forest service personnel who assist in wildfire fighting during the dry season.\nWildland firefighters, like Dan Hilden, have so far been exempted from forest service cuts. He says the roles of the people who were terminated are \"completely crucial\" to fire safety. Many directly fight fires, while others are responsible for \"sweeping\" backcountry trails - telling people to leave and ensuring that no one is in danger from expanding fires.\n\"I don't know how we'll be doing that this summer, because we're heavily dependent on them,\" says Hilden, explaining that it takes several days to travel into the wilderness for these sweeps.\n\"Every year things have been getting worse as the staffing issues go. This year is going to be a lot worse.\"",

They cover infrastructure, ship-building, tourism, agriculture, technology, education and, perhaps crucially, deep-sea mineral exploration.\nBrown says his decisions will be based on the \"long-term interests\" of the Cook Islands, which are remote, resource-rich and vulnerable to climate change. \nNot everyone agrees with him. The new, wide-ranging deals with Beijing have led to protests on Rarotonga - the largest Cook Island - and a vote of no confidence against Brown in parliament, which he survived earlier this week. They have also worried Australia, another powerful ally. \nNew Zealand said it was \"blindsided\" by the China deals, but Brown believes his country is independent and does not need to consult Wellington on issues he says are of no concern to them.\nHe has, nevertheless, tried to reassure Australia and New Zealand that the deals with China don't replace their relationships. But the apparent snub comes at a time when the West's grip on the Pacific seems to be loosening. \nThe rise of China in the Pacific isn't new. Whether it's bagging a security deal in the Solomon Islands or providing medical services in Tonga, China's presence in the region has been growing. And the US and its allies have made a consistent effort to counter that.\nBut now there is a new dynamic at play as the Trump administration upends relationships with allies such as Ukraine and appears increasingly unpredictable. \nThe Cook Islands has had what's known as a \"free association\" relationship with New Zealand, a former coloniser, since the 1960s - meaning Wellington helps on issues like defence and foreign affairs, and that Cook Islanders hold New Zealand citizenship.\nThe two countries are very close. There are around 15,000 Cook Islanders living in the Pacific island nation, but as many as 100,000 live in New Zealand and Australia. Culturally, Cook Island M\u0101ori - who make up the majority of the population - are also closely related to, but distinct from, New Zealand M\u0101ori. \nThe deals with China aren't the only sign that Brown wants to pull away from New Zealand which have caused concern. He recently abandoned a proposal to introduce a Cook Islands passport following a public outcry. \n\"[The relationship with NZ] connects us politically and connects us to our brothers and sisters of Aotearoa [the M\u0101ori word for New Zealand] \u2013 they left our shores to sail to Aotearoa. We need to remember that,\" said Cook Islander Jackie Tuara at a recent demonstration against Brown's deals with China. \nIn a nation that is not used to huge displays of protest, several hundred people gathered outside parliament in Rarotonga, holding up placards that read: \"Stay connected with NZ\". Others waved their New Zealand passports. \n\"Let us stand in partnership with countries that have the same democratic principles as we are a democratic nation, are we not?\" Ms Tuara said. \"We don't want to see our land and our oceans sold to the highest bidder. Those resources are for us \u2013 for our children, for their future.\"\nBut for all those who are opposed to Brown's recent moves away from New Zealand, there are plenty of Cook Islanders who back him.\nChina specialist Philipp Ivanov, in apparent agreement with the prime minister, says that \"the Pacific island nations have their own agency, their own motivations and their own capabilities\". \nHe believes that the recent developments in the Cook Islands are \"all part of that little great game that's going on between Australia and China and New Zealand in the Pacific. It's a whack-a-mole kind of game.\"\nWhile the US has long been a dominant force in security and military in the region, China has tried to strengthen its ties with the small but strategic Pacific Island nations through aid, infrastructure and security deals.\nIn response, the likes of the US and the UK have beefed up their diplomatic presence across the region. Australia too has made it clear it will redouble its support. But it's unclear to what extent US President Donald Trump will continue his predecessor's commitments in the region to counter China - and Beijing is taking advantage of that.\nLast week, planes flying between New Zealand and Australia were diverted after China conducted military exercises involving live fire. Both Australia and New Zealand had been trailing the three Chinese warships that were making their way down the eastern coast of Australia in what experts say is an escalation and unexpected show of power.\n\"It's a pretty efficient way of testing the diplomatic response in both the Australia-China and New Zealand-China bilateral relationship, and what the US is prepared to say in defence [of its allies],\" says defence analyst Euan Graham, from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\n\"It's also making the point that in the numbers game, China will always be ahead of smaller countries with smaller navies and Australia's navy is at a historic low.\"\nChina's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, told national broadcaster ABC that Beijing's actions had been appropriate and he won't apologise for it. \nAustralia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been keen to emphasise that no international laws were broken and that the drills were carried out in international waters. Indeed, many have pointed out that Australia and its allies often sail warships through the South China Sea.\n\"I'd see it as China wanting to capitalise on the chaotic effect that Trump is having right now,\" says Mihai Sora, director of the Pacific Islands programme at Australia's Lowy Institute. \"China is taking advantage of that moment to [say], look Australia, you are actually alone. Where is the United States in all of this?\"\nAustralia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong freely admits \"we are in a permanent state of contest in our region, that is the reality\".  \nIn speaking out about the warships last week, Australia's government was trying to reassure the public about China's intentions, while also wanting to tell Australians that it's all in hand. That is not a coincidence as Australia heads towards a federal election in the coming months.\n\"[Opposition leader Peter] Dutton comes from this national security and home affairs background, so the government doesn't want to give him any air to criticise Labor,\" Philipp Ivanov says. \"Being weak on China would be disastrous for them, given what's going on in the US and given our own elections.\"\nBut it also brings into focus the dilemma this part of the world faces.\n\"Canberra will be contesting every single move that Beijing tries to make \u2026 and it reflects the fact that Canberra and Beijing have diverging strategic interests,\" says James Laurenceson, the director of Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney.\nBut, he adds, they also have \"enormous commonalities\" - China is Australia's largest  trading partner - and New Zealand's - for instance.\n\"So you've got to be able to ride both these horses at the same time.\"\nIt's not an easy relationship - it never has been. The bigger surprise is that of the US, a traditional ally.\nAlthough many in the Trump administration still describe China as a grave threat, US allies are unsure what to expect from the Washington-Beijing relationship.\nAnd now, as Trump threatens steel and aluminium tariffs and a withdrawal of foreign assistance, Australia feels more isolated than ever. The recent activity of China's warships in the Tasman Sea serves to highlight that isolation.\n\"I wouldn't think of them as military acts, so much as political acts using military hardware,\" says Mr Sora of the Lowy Institute.\n\"I think the political act is to say, look, we can do this anytime we want. You can't do anything about it, and the United States is not doing anything about it, because they're busy tearing down the global system.\"",

        "article_text": "Support for Ukraine has become a key issue since Donald Trump returned to the White House.\nPresident Trump has made a number of claims about how much the United States has spent compared to European countries.\nBut some of his claims are questionable - with no evidence to back them up.\nPresident Trump has made this claim on a number of occasions - including when he hosted France's President Macron in the White House this week.\nShort answer: Figures suggest the actual spend is much lower.\nBBC Verify can find no evidence to back up the claim.  There are different calculations on US spending in or related to Ukraine - and they produce a much lower figure.\nThe Kiel Institute is a German-based think tank tracking support going into Ukraine.  It calculated that the United States spent $119.7bn (\u00a394.3bn) on aid between January 2022 and December 2024.\nOthers have reached a higher figure - but with a broader definition of what counts as spending on Ukraine.\nThe US Department of Defense has provided a figure looking at all spending on Operation Atlantic Resolve - a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nIt says $182.8bn has been \"appropriated\" - a figure that covers US military training in Europe and replenishment of US defence stocks.\nEither way, both figures are considerably lower than claimed by the president.\nWe asked the White House about the basis for the $350bn claim. So far, it hasn't provided an explanation.\nPresident Trump has claimed: \"We've spent more than $300bn and Europe has spent about $100bn - that's a big difference\"\nShort answer: Figures suggest Europe has spent more when all aid is included and, as above, we can't find any evidence for the $300bn figure.\nThe United States is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. But Europe combined has spent more money than the United States, according to the Kiel Institute.\nThe figure includes aid directly from the European Union, but also from bilateral deals from European countries, both inside and outside the EU. It includes military, financial and humanitarian aid.\nThey calculate that between 24 January 2022 and the end of 2024, Europe as a whole spent $138.7bn on Ukraine. In the same period, the United States spent $119.7bn, according to their figures.\nNATO secretary general Mark Rutte made a similar argument, adding Canada into his calculation.\nMr Rutte said February 2025: \"In 2024, NATO Allies provided over 50 billion euros in security assistance to Ukraine \u2013 nearly 60% of this coming from Europe and Canada.\"\nWe asked for NATO's figures, but they said they were classified.\nThis is a claim President Trump made when he hosted President Macron. It prompted President Macron to disagree, saying both Europe and the US had given a mixture of grants and loans.\nShort answer: The EU has provided loans, but also grants. \nPresident Macron is correct, according to Kiel figures. But they suggest President Trump also has a point; the US has sent more grants, while the EU sent more loans.\nHowever, again, there are different figures out there.\nThe European Union says EU countries have provided around $145bn in aid so far and that just 35% of that has been loans. Like the United States Department of Defence, the EU has used a broader definition of what counts as aid to Ukraine.\nEU loans will have been on generous terms - so Ukraine will be repaying less interest than it would normally. In some cases, Ukraine isn't expected to pay anything, with repayments coming from revenues from frozen Russian assets.\nWhat we can say is that aid to Ukraine has been a mixture of loans and grants.\nThe UK is one of the biggest individual state donors to Ukraine - the latest was a $2.8bn (\u00a32.26bn) loan agreement signed during President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to London on 1 March.\nThe only countries to have spent more are the United States and Germany, according to Kiel data.\nBut the UK contributions are much smaller than the United States.\nThat raises a question for the UK and other European countries; if the United States withdraws a large part of its funding to Ukraine, can other states make up the difference?\nThat would require a significant increase in their contributions.\n\nAdditional reporting: Thomas Spencer and Tamara Kovacevic\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

Its policy towards Gaza, it says, was \"paradoxical: Hamas was illegitimate, yet there was no effort to develop an alternative\".\nThe military had chosen a \"conflict management\" approach to dealing with Gaza, it says. And had assumed that Hamas was \"neither interested [in] nor preparing for a large-scale war\" - a perception reinforced by Hamas's own deception tactics.\nEvidence from 2018 onwards suggesting that Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist group by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - was indeed developing an ambitious plan was interpreted as \"unrealistic or unfeasible\", reflecting \"Hamas's long-term aspirations rather than an actionable threat\".\nThe report says that in the months leading up to the war, the Military Intelligence Directorate began to develop a new assessment, suggesting that Hamas' plan was not merely a vision but \"a concrete framework for operational planning\".\nHowever, this emerging assessment was not brought to the attention of senior officials in military intelligence.\nThe report identifies a broad streak of complacency within the military about Hamas's intentions and how to deal with the threat it posed.\n\"There was no deep discussion of the question: What if we are wrong?\" the report says.\nOver time, \"a significant and continuous gap between the intelligence assessments of Hamas and reality\" had developed.\nThe report also highlights what it says was \"a decline in deep familiarity with the enemy's different worldview, including its culture, religion, language and history\".\nIt calls for deep reform of the intelligence directorate's culture, \"fostering intellectual openness, scepticism, listening, learning, debate, and constructive disagreement\".\nIt says the desire to protect highly valuable intelligence sources contributed to the military's failure to raise the alert level immediately before 7 October.\nThe Gaza Division, it says, \"was effectively defeated for several hours\" on 7 October, significantly impairing its ability to understand what was going on and respond effectively.\nIt says the Air Force responded quickly, but that \"there was significant difficulty distinguishing between IDF troops, civilians and terrorists\".\nThe report also says that in some incidents, wounded soldiers were evacuated before civilians.\nAfter presenting the findings to commanders on Monday, the IDF's outgoing chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said he took full responsibility for the failures.\n\"I embrace my responsibility. It is mine. I was the commander of the army on 7 October and I have my responsibility and I have all of your responsibility. I see that as mine too. And I see that in every command of mine that went wrong, there is also a part of me,\" he said in a video.\nLast month, the general announced his resignation over the failures and called for a commission of inquiry to carry out a broader investigation that would help prevent another attack.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has not acknowledged any responsibility for what happened on 7 October, has said such a state inquiry should wait until the end of the war.\nHis critics accuse Mr Netanyahu of being unwilling to admit any personal fault.\nIsrael responded to the 7 October attack by launching an air and ground campaign in Gaza, during which at least 48,365 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

        "article_text": "The uncertain future of two killer whales is no closer to being resolved despite the closure of their marine zoo home two months ago.\nWikie, 23, and her 11-year-old son Keijo are still being kept at Marineland Antibes, located in southern France, after it closed in January due to a forthcoming law banning the use of orcas in shows. \nFor months managers at Marineland have tried to send the killer whales to other marine zoos but this has angered animal rights campaigners who want them housed in a sanctuary, where the orcas won't have to perform or be used for breeding.\nThe orcas were expected to go to another marine zoo in Spain when the French government rejected a move to a proposed sanctuary in Canada a few weeks ago.\nBut now Agne\u0300s Pannier-Runacher, the French ecology minister, said she would speak to colleagues in Spain, Italy and Greece about creating a different sanctuary together. However, her proposal has few other details and has been criticised.\nThe ecology ministry, when asked by the BBC, had no further information on where a sanctuary might be located or who would fund its construction and running costs.\nLoro Parque, a marine zoo in Spain that wants to receive the killer whales from Marineland, told the BBC this week the current proposal was \"wholly unsuitable\" and that they were best positioned to care for them.\nChristoph Kiessling, vice-president of the facility in Tenerife, said whale sanctuaries were \"currently unable to meet the complex physiological, social and environmental needs\" of killer whales.\nMost designs involve cordoning off a bay and employing staff to ensure Wikie and Keijo - who were born in captivity and cannot be released into the wild - were properly fed and looked after.\nKiessling did say such a solution might be possible if there was more extensive research and planning but \"such a process could take years, leaving the two Marineland [orcas] in a facility that is being wound down\".\nCampaigners point out that several orcas have died at Loro Parque in the last few years, including three between March 2021 and September 2022.\nManagers at the marine zoo said scientific examination of those orcas by the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria showed the deaths were unavoidable.\nThey also fear Wikie might be used for breeding. Loro Parque announced in January that Morgan, the only female of the three orcas currently kept there, is pregnant.\nKatheryn Wise, from the charity World Animal Protection, said Loro Parque was ultimately an entertainment business that used orcas to make money.\nShe added: \"Morgan's pregnancy underlines the fact that Loro Parque could never be a suitable option for Wikie and Keijo and should be removed as an option.\"\nMarineland, who are still paying to look after the orcas, said a move to Loro Parque as soon as possible was in the best interests of the animals' welfare. They have asked the ecology ministry to approve the transfer.\nThe whale sanctuary in Canada applied to the French government to take in the orcas last year but their bid was rejected in January.\nThey were told the site they had selected in Nova Scotia was too far away and that the water there was too cold for Wikie and Keijo, who have spent their whole lives in southern France.\nFollowing Pannier-Runacher's proposal for a sanctuary in Europe, which she announced a fortnight ago in a video on Instagram, the directors of the rejected Canadian project criticised the idea of one being built in the Mediterranean.\nThey wrote a letter to her in which they cited Dr David Perpi\u00f1\u00e1n, a diplomate at the European College of Zoological Medicine, who said: \"Wikie and Keijo's origin is Iceland.

For months managers at Marineland have tried to send the killer whales to other marine zoos but this has angered animal rights campaigners who want them housed in a sanctuary, where the orcas won't have to perform or be used for breeding.The orcas were expected to go to another marine zoo in Spain when the French government rejected a move to a proposed sanctuary in Canada a few weeks ago.But now Agne\u0300s Pannier-Runacher, the French ecology minister, said she would speak to colleagues in Spain, Italy and Greece about creating a different sanctuary together. 'The water is too warm for orcas'The whale sanctuary in Canada applied to the French government to take in the orcas last year but their bid was rejected in January.They were told the site they had selected in Nova Scotia was too far away and that the water there was too cold for Wikie and Keijo, who have spent their whole lives in southern France.Following Pannier-Runacher's proposal for a sanctuary in Europe, which she announced a fortnight ago in a video on Instagram, the directors of the rejected Canadian project criticised the idea of one being built in the Mediterranean.They wrote a letter to her in which they cited Dr David Perpi\u00f1\u00e1n, a diplomate at the European College of Zoological Medicine, who said: \"Wikie and Keijo's origin is Iceland.

        "article_text": "In one of the most exciting and dramatic awards seasons ever, the field is wide open in several fields. BBC film critics give their expert predictions for the major Academy Awards categories.\nCaryn James: It has been a fun awards season, watching the nominees for best picture pinball around. Anora became the early favourite as the brash young voice of the future, until the bonkers Emilia P\u00e9rez became the Oscar darling for a minute, then Conclave had its moment as the smart mainstream choice, until The Brutalist announced itself as the epic with artistic ambitions until... full circle, Anora is the frontrunner again. It says a lot about the strength and variety of films this year that such mayhem could happen at all. Anora \u2013 funny, original and a little bit heartbreaking \u2013 is the likely winner. And among the realistic choices (six of the nominees might as well be category filler, and Karla So\u00edia Gasc\u00f3n's unearthed offensive tweets shattered Emilia's chances), Anora should win. But lurking in the background is Conclave, which could win by consensus, given that voters rank their choices in this category. Simplistic scenario: votes for the top film are so scattered that Conclave finally gets the most votes because it's everybody's second choice. Plus, it really is a satisfying political thriller that happens to be set in the Vatican, and its Bafta and SAG awards are a sign of real support. In a year that has had so many frontrunners, a Conclave win is entirely plausible.\nNicholas Barber: This time last year, Oppenheimer was firm favourite to win the Oscar for best picture \u2013 and plenty more besides. This year, things aren't so simple. What we can say, judging by all the other awards ceremonies that have been and gone this year, is that Dune: Part Two, Emilia P\u00e9rez, I'm Still Here, Nickel Boys, The Substance and Wicked are vanishingly unlikely to take home the biggest prize of the night. None of them has whipped up the enthusiasm that's required from both the public and the critics. That leaves us with Anora, The Brutalist, A Complete Unknown and Conclave \u2013 and over the last few weeks I've wavered between all four of them as the most likely best picture winner. As I write, Anora seems to be the favourite, and I can understand why. It's a film about contemporary American life made by an American auteur, and it balances uncompromising grittiness with exuberant, crowd-pleasing flair. In a year when arguments could be made for and against so many contenders, Anora has come to feel like the choice that could please everyone, so it may well complete the journey it began when it won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last May.\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0This is a strong category, but I doubt that the Academy's voters will go for a French director who was largely unknown in the US before she made\u00a0The Substance, so Coralie Fargeat is out. The various Emilia P\u00e9rez backlashes have hurt Jacques Audiard's chances, and A Complete Unknown hasn't received much praise for its directing as such, so James Mangold is a long shot, too. That means that the best director Oscar will either go to Sean Baker, for the verve and naturalism he brings to Anora, or to Brady Corbet, for the valiant artistic vision of The Brutalist. But the amiable Baker has made several excellent films that haven't garnered many awards, including Tangerine and The Florida Project, so I suspect that he will be the Academy's choice.\nCaryn James: This race comes down to a stark contrast, between Sean Baker, whose Anora is a beautifully orchestrated contemporary romp, and Brady Corbet, whose The Brutalist wilfully announces its ambition as the kind of film they don't make anymore, an historical epic complete with intermission. It's a good guess that Baker is likely to triumph, because he won the Directors Guild Award and the film won the Producers Guild award, two major predictors of the Oscars. And he should win. He made Anora feel effortless, but beneath that apparent ease is some masterful work, as he navigates the changes in tone \u2013 from fairy tale to screwball comedy to drama \u2013 that make the film so rich. Coralie Fargeat deserves her place here for her confident direction of The Substance, but it's really a two-man race.\nCaryn James: Adrian Brody was on his way to making this a done deal, having won every major precursor from the Golden Globe to the Bafta, until Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet got in his way by winning the SAG award for A Complete Unknown. Oscar voting had ended by the time Chalamet won, but as an indicator of how the votes go, SAG has a great track record. You can never underestimate Oscar voters' affection for a biopic, and Chalamet's take on Bob Dylan was a true embodiment of a character as well as a spot-on impersonation. But Brody is still very likely to win, and he should, for his searing performance as a Holocaust refugee. He creates a portrait of a man who is talented and ambitious, sometimes ruthless and sometimes vulnerable, and fully human. But let's acknowledge how strong the category is this year, the rare case where it would be perfectly appropriate for Ralph Fiennes, Colman Domingo or Sebastian Stan to win too.\nNicholas Barber: Adrien Brody (The Brutalist) and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (A Complete Unknown) are neck and neck, so it's tricky to say which attributes will tempt the Academy more. Will it be pain, anguish and a Hungarian accent, or a nifty impersonation elevated by some expert singing and guitar-picking? Will it be the long-awaited return to greatness of a Hollywood stalwart who has already won an Oscar, or the crowning of a fresh-faced youngster who has nonetheless amassed a tremendous body of work? It could go either way, but Chalamet's Oscar campaigning has been flawless \u2013 he has shown himself to be fun-loving and self-mocking, but at recent awards ceremonies, including Sunday's SAG Awards, he has emphasised how seriously he takes a difficult job \u2013 so I'm betting on him. My own personal favourite is the wonderfully versatile Ralph Fiennes, who is so quiet and reserved yet so racked by doubt in Conclave \u2013 but I doubt that this is his year.\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0OK, so we know that Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n isn't going to win \u2013 the publicising of her offensive X posts settled that \u2013 so that leaves us with Cynthia Erivo for Wicked, Mikey Madison for Anora, Demi Moore for The Substance and Fernanda Torres for I'm Still Here. Both Moore and Torres won Golden Globes for their roles, in a musical / comedy and in a drama respectively, and for most of the time since then, they've been the frontrunners. Madison shook things up when she won the Bafta, so it's now the closest of calls. But I reckon that Moore will win. Partly, that's because of her savagely self-parodying performance as a former A-list star being turned into a monster by the ageist entertainment industry. And partly it's because her comeback narrative, as spelt out in her Golden Globes acceptance speech, would furnish the Academy with the kind of feelgood story it loves so much.\nCaryn James: Demi Moore has been on an almost steady march toward her first Oscar, marred only by Mikey Madison's Bafta, ever since her pitch-perfect campaign/acceptance speech on winning the Golden Globe for The Substance. Moore checks all the boxes: the story of how Hollywood finally takes her seriously, the insider status and the no-holds-barred performance in a film with a resonant message. She is still the likely winner, but there could be an upset from Madison for her star-making role in Anora, or by Fernanda Torres, who should win. Torres gives a beautifully nuanced, restrained performance in\u00a0I'm Still Here\u00a0as a grieving yet determined widow during Brazil's political dictatorship. But Oscars tend to go to screaming, yelling, tearing-down-the-scenery roles, which is what The Substance and Anora call for. A brilliantly subtle performance like Torres's has an uphill battle.\nCaryn James: There's a reason Kieran Culkin has won every major award in this category in the run-up to the Oscars: he really deserves to. His wilfully outrageous, sad and moving character of Benji in A Real Pain may have echoes of his role as Roman Roy in Succession, but it is also funny and affecting on its own, a delicate mix of comedy and tragedy. And it hasn't hurt his chances that every acceptance speech of his is wry, self-deprecating and fun to watch. Some winners make an earnest point of saying \"There is no winner\" or spreading the praise around, but Culkin has turned acceptances into a stand-up art form. In another year, Edward Norton might have taken the award for his sharply drawn performance as Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown, but that seems like a very unlikely upset.\nNicholas Barber: This year's Oscars are harder to predict than usual, but the best supporting actor category is the exception that proves the rule. Ever since Kieran Culkin won the Golden Globe for his role in A Real Pain in January, he has kept on winning and winning \u2013 and now it feels as if there is no point in any of his competitors turning up to the ceremony at all. Even those of us who would argue that Culkin isn't really a supporting actor in the film, but a co-lead with its writer-director, Jesse Eisenberg, have had to accept the inevitable. The only regrettable part of the whole business is that this category is stacked with Oscar-worthy performances, namely Yura Borisov's soft-hearted Russian muscle in Anora, Edward Norton's gentle Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown, Guy Pearce's bluff tycoon in The Brutalist, and Culkin's old Succession co-star Jeremy Strong as controversial lawyer Roy Cohn in The Apprentice. If they hadn't been up against Culkin, any one of them might have won.\nNicholas Barber: For a while it looked as if Zoe Salda\u00f1a had this Oscar in the bag. Of course,\u00a0she isn't really a supporting actress\u00a0in Emilia P\u00e9rez, but one of the leads. As soon as voters put her in this category, though, it seemed to be hers for the taking. Not only does she deliver a fabulous performance that includes energetic song-and-dance numbers, but she is a mainstay of the Marvel and Star Trek cinematic universes, so she has helped Hollywood make zillions of dollars. Then a journalist uncovered Those Social Media Posts. The bigoted remarks made by the other star of Emilia P\u00e9rez, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, stripped the film of much of its goodwill, and Salda\u00f1a's hopes were badly damaged in the explosion of recriminations. Oscars observers started wondering: Would Ariana Grande win for Wicked, instead? It's still possible, but Saldana has distanced herself smartly from the scandal, and made emotional speeches at other award ceremonies, including the Baftas and the SAG Awards, so the Academy will probably reward her for her work, rather than punish her for her co-star's opinions.\nCaryn James: Zoe Salda\u00f1a may be the one person to escape unscathed from the Emilia P\u00e9rez debacle, and get the Oscar, as she should. She has won every precursor award, and is actually the dynamic centre of the story. Rita, the lawyer who helps the title character to transition and create a new identity, gives Salda\u00f1a her richest role yet and she makes the most of it. Rita starts as a fiery, beleaguered small-town lawyer, wrestles with her conscience about being involved with a criminal, and eventually becomes a philanthropist, and Salda\u00f1a sings and dances her way through it all with grace and presence. And she had the perfectly crafted answer when first asked about her co-star's offensive tweets, saying she was \"saddened\". Very well played. Isabella Rossellini makes a huge impact as Sister Agnes in a small role in Conclave, and Monica Barbaro is amazing as she channels Joan Baez in A Complete Unknown, but they can't complete with Salda\u00f1a's Rita.\nCaryn James: Peter Straughan is sure to win for Conclave. He turns Robert Harris's potboiler novel into a sleek, thoughtful screenplay, which is a huge part of what makes the film \u2013 pretty talky when you think about it, and not exactly an action movie \u2013 so suspenseful and entertaining. Turning that straightforward novel into a faithful screenplay may sound simple, but in fact Straughn's adaptation has a magician's deft touch, taking the best of the story and making it much better. It's great to see that RaMell Ross and Joslyn Barnes's screenplay for Ross's Nickel Boys is nominated. It's a dazzling adaptation of Colson Whitehead's extremely literary novel, but the film hasn't received the kind of major awards traction it would need to compete. The rest of the category is fairly weak. The screenplay is the least of Emilia P\u00e9rez, Sing Sing is less about script than performance. And the banal screenplay for the biopic A Complete Unknown shouldn't even have a place in this conversation.\nNicholas Barber: Peter Straughan's gripping adaptation of Robert Harris's novel, Conclave, has picked up prizes at the Golden Globes, the Critics' Choice awards, and the Baftas. And when Conclave won best picture at the Baftas, the film's director, Edward Berger, made a point of singing Straughan's praises. Is he unbeatable at this stage? The controversies swirling around Emilia P\u00e9rez may have put it out of the running \u2013 as adventurous as Jacques Audiard's screenplay is \u2013 and there doesn't seem to be much chatter about A Complete Unknown, Nickel Boys and Sing Sing in this category. So, yes, unless there are some Conclave-style shenanigans going on behind closed doors, Straughan should triumph here.\nNicholas Barber: This is one of this year's toughest categories to predict. September 5 hasn't built any momentum over awards season, but the other four best screenplay nominees \u2013 Anora, The Brutalist, A Real Pain, The Substance \u2013 are all brilliant in their own distinctive ways, and were all written or co-written by the films' directors. Sean Baker's Anora script won at the WGA Awards; Brady Corbet and Mona Fastvold's The Brutalist was given the prize by two US critics' organisations; Jesse Eisenberg's A Real Pain won at the Baftas, and Coralie Fargeat's The Substance won at Cannes last year. My own preference, in a year of extremely long films, is Eisenberg's precision-engineered screenplay for A Real Pain, because it doesn't waste a scene, or a syllable of dialogue, in a trim 90 minutes. But I think that Anora will beat it, which would be OK by me, too.\nCaryn James: This is one of the richest categories, with three very different, thoroughly deserving nominees. Sean Baker's Anora is fresh and bold. Coralie Fargeat's The Substance is audacious and zeitgeisty. And Jesse Eisenberg's A Real Pain is perceptive and humane to its core. Anora and The Substance were also nominated for best picture, a sign of strength that might give them an edge. But I'm guessing that A Real Pain, which should win, will come through in the end. Where Anora and especially The Substance owe a lot to those films' initial concepts, Eisenberg's screenplay is the work of a writer with an ear for making his dialogue both believable and affecting. Of course, Anora is coming on so strong in other categories, you can't possibly rule it out, but if voters want to spread the awards around they may see this as a chance to give A Real Pain some well-earned recognition.\u00a0\nCaryn James: Once, this race seemed down to Emilia P\u00e9rez v I'm Still Here, but Emilia's implosion clears the way for I'm Still Here, which will win now and always should have. Walter Salles's brilliantly moving story of a family dealing with the aftermath of their father's disappearance during the Brazilian dictatorship in the 1970s is an eloquent, timely masterpiece that reveals the personal cost of politics. The film is nominated for best picture, which it surely won't win, and Fernanda Torres for actress, where winning would be an upset, but those nominations are a sign of strength that will translate into winning the International prize. There isn't a weak film in this category, with The Seed of the Sacred Fig another standout, but I'm Still Here towers above the others. There were celebrations in Brazil at the nominations alone, and although Brazilian films have been nominated before, including Salles's 1998 Central Station, it looks like the celebrations will go on for the country's first Oscar in this category.\nNicholas Barber: A storm of bad publicity knocked Emilia P\u00e9rez off-course this awards season, and suddenly it seemed as if one of its competitors might grab the Oscar for best international film. The most likely of these would be I'm Still Here, a powerful and popular Brazilian political drama whose star, Fernanda Torres, has been nominated for best actress. Also in with a chance are Flow, a Latvian cartoon which is nominated for best animated feature film, and The Seed of the Sacred Fig, which was made in secret in Iran by Mohammad Rasoulof, and then smuggled out of the country. But a week is a long time in awards season, and the Oscars take place a whole month after Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n's offensive tweets were unearthed. My hunch is that the storm is passing, and that Emilia P\u00e9rez, which won the equivalent prize at the Baftas, will get its Oscar, after all.\nNicholas Barber: Nineteen years ago, Nick Park (and his co-director) won the Oscar for Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. Nine years ago, the Oscar went to Pixar's Inside Out. Follow-ups to both films are nominated this year, and as this is one category in which voters aren't averse to handing prizes to sequels, either of them could win. Things are looking especially promising for Aardman's claymation caper, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, a favourite of mine which nabbed not one but two Baftas \u2013 one for animated feature film and one for children's / family film. The dialogue-free Latvian charmer, Flow, has its cheerleaders, too, whereas Memoir of a Snail, an Australian stop-motion animation, is just too gloomy to get voters behind it. That leaves the nominee which I believe will win: The Wild Robot. It's a sci-fi epic, yet it has a big heart and loveable picture-book visuals. Besides, its writer-director, Chris Sanders, made Lilo & Stitch, The Croods, and How to Train Your Dragon, but has never won an Oscar. Surely his peers will want to rectify that this year?\nCaryn James: How important is box office? That may be the deciding factor in this race, which is between two eco-themed films: The Wild Robot, the frontrunner, and Flow, its only likely competition. Flow is a true original, a dialogue-free Latvian film about a cat who tries to survive a flood. The Wild Robot is a funny, heart-tugging story about an intelligent robot, voiced by Lupita Nyong'o, who grows a human heart after being stranded on an island full of animal creatures facing an environmental crisis of its own. The Wild Robot has starry voices, including Pedro Pascal as Fink the Fox and Mark Hamill as Thorn the bear, and it has earned more than $300m. In itself that might not be enough to get the Oscar, but the combination of star power, a timely message and its popularity with audiences is likely to make it the winner. And it is charming, so fair enough. The attention to Flow so far might be its best reward.\nCaryn James: There are years when documentaries with urgent political messages become the undeniable frontrunners and inevitable winners, such as Navalny in 2023 and 20 Days in Mariupol last year. This is one of those years. The extraordinary No Other Land will win and it should. Its eye-opening first-hand look at a village in the West Bank from 2019 to 2023, when Israeli forces destroyed homes and displaced the villagers, makes the cost of the conflict visceral. The film's backstory is compelling: it was made by a team of Israelis and two Palestinians, whose personal stories shape the film. And it resonates with even more impact since the turmoil in the Middle East continues. The film has not found a US distributor despite earning awards from several festival and critics' groups. but it has done very well in self-distribution. A vote for it might even convince the Hollywood players who have the power to release it wider.\nNicholas Barber: The past two winners of the Oscar for best documentary feature were 20 Days in Mariupol, which celebrated the resilience of the Ukrainian people during the current war, and Navalny, which condemned Vladimir Putin's regime. That trend could well continue this year, at a time when those inter-related topics are more urgent than ever, with the prize going to Porcelain War. Brendan Bellomo and Slava Leontyev's film offers an intense, citizen's-eye view of the conflict in Ukraine, and shows civilians being trained as combatants. What separates it from other such documentaries is that the main participants, Leontyev and his wife Anya Stasenko, are artists who sculpt and paint exquisitely patterned porcelain animals. The theme is the importance of storytelling and creativity as ways to resist oppression \u2013 and what could be more appealing to Hollywood's film-making community than that?\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0If voters feel that a film as lucrative as Wicked shouldn't go away empty-handed, then giving it the prize for best original score is one obvious way for them to show it some love. But my money is on Daniel Blumberg's awe-inspiring score for The Brutalist, which won the Bafta in the same category. One of the questions raised by Brady Corbet's film is how such a low-budget indie drama can seem so epic, and the music has a lot to do with it. It's big, bold and experimental, with strange ticking and clinking noises to establish the theme of construction, stately motifs to echo the characters' grand ambitions, and some symphonic bombast and wild jazz to convey the thrill of arriving in the US in the middle of the 20th Century. It's also deeply eerie at times, so you can expect it to be used on trailers for horror films and science-fiction sagas for years to come.\nCaryn James: It might seem like Emilia P\u00e9rez and Wicked have the edge, but the songs that pop out of these musicals have their own category. Here, the award for the background music is between Conclave's Volker Bertelmann, who won the Oscar for his music in\u00a0All Quiet on the Western Front\u00a0(like Conclave, directed by Edward Berger), or Daniel Blumberg, who won this year's Bafta for his score for The Brutalist. Both scores serve their films well. Bertelmann's classical style adds suspense to the Vatican thriller. But I'd give the edge to Blumberg, who should win for his evocative score that adds a touch of the contemporary to the film's post-World War Two setting. Sometimes jazz-infused, sometimes commanding, his score enhances the mood without thwacking viewers over the head.\nCaryn James: The film that should win wasn't even nominated. It's still a head-scratcher why Jomo Fray's eloquent, imaginative cinematography for Nickel Boys, which gracefully meshed with director RaMell Ross's first-person narrative, wasn't acknowledged, while the film got a best picture nod. But there are two very strong contenders among the nominees. The Brutalist, shot in old-style, widescreen, rarely used VistaVision, has epic sweep, and is full of clarity. And Nosferatu's cinematography is a beautiful mix of colour in its scenes of daily life, and darkness in the shadowy world of the vampire. Jarin Blaschke, who has worked on previous, stunning Robert Eggers's films, equals that work in Nosferatu and should win. But The Brutalist and Lol Crawley probably will, if only because the film has been so much in the awards conversation, while Nosferatu definitely hasn't.\nNicholas Barber: The fact that Nickel Boys didn't get onto the shortlist for its immersive first-person camerawork is one of the Oscars' most puzzling oversights this year, and it's a shame, too, that the stylish Conclave was ignored. Of the films that were nominated, Nosferatu boasts glorious mountain vistas and shadowy Victorian chambers, while The Brutalist has the geeky appeal of large-format VistaVision film stock. But I have a feeling that the Academy will honour Greig Fraser's stunning views of uncanny alien worlds in Dune: Part Two. After all, voters have to give at least something to bona-fide Hollywood blockbusters, and this would be a worthwhile way for them to do so.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said he has a \"lot of respect\" for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, on the eve of their talks at the White House.\nAsked by the BBC if he would apologise for recently calling him a \"dictator\", he said he could not believe he had said this. He also called Zelensky \"very brave\".\nTrump was speaking after talks with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer about ending the war between Ukraine and Russia.\nHe predicted a \"very good meeting\" with Zelensky on Friday, saying efforts to achieve peace were \"moving along pretty rapidly\". \nThis week's meetings come after the Trump administration shocked its Western partners by holding the first high-level US talks with Moscow since Russia invaded Ukraine just over three years ago. \nAmerica's new president had appeared to blame Zelensky for the war and chided him for not starting peace talks earlier.\n\"You've been there for three years,\" he had said last Tuesday. \"You should have ended it... You should have never started it. You could have made a deal.\"\nBut this Thursday, speaking after meeting Sir Keir, Trump told reporters asking about his forthcoming talks with Zelensky: \"I think we're going to have a very good meeting tomorrow morning. We're going to get along really well.\" \nAsked by the BBC's Chris Mason if he still thought Zelensky was a \"dictator\", he replied: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that.\"\nZelensky will be hoping to win some kind of security guarantees for his country that would underpin any peace deal that may be negotiated.\nAsked about these on Thursday, Trump only said he was \"open to many things\" but he wanted to get Russia and Ukraine to agree a deal before deciding what measures might be put in place to enforce it.\nOn his visit on Friday, Zelensky is expected to sign a deal that will give the US access to Ukraine's rare earth mineral resources.\nTrump suggested that the presence of US mining concerns in Ukraine would act as a deterrent against future Russian attacks on Ukraine.\n\"It's a backstop, you could say,\" he said on Thursday. \"I don't think anybody's going to play around if we're there with a lot of workers and having to do with rare earths and other things which we need for our country.\"\nThe British prime minister had said earlier that the UK was prepared to send troops to Ukraine after the war as part of a peacekeeping force but only if the US, Nato's leading member, provided a \"backstop\".    \nAsked if the US would aid British peacekeepers if they were attacked by Russia, Trump said: \"The British have incredible soldiers, incredible military and they can take care of themselves. But if they need help, I'll always be with the British, okay?\" \nNato's Article 5 holds that Nato members will come to the defence of an ally which comes under attack.\nPraising Trump's \"personal commitment to bring peace\" in Ukraine, Sir Keir said the UK was \"ready to put boots on the ground and planes in the air to support a deal\".\n\"We're focused now on bringing an enduring end to the barbaric war in Ukraine,\" he said. \nBut, he added, it must not be a peace deal \"that rewards the aggressor or that gives encouragement to regimes like Iran\".\nAsked whether Vladimir Putin was trustworthy, the UK prime minister said his views on the Russian president were well-known.\nAsked in turn why he seemed to trust Putin and Sir Keir did not, Trump said: \"I know a lot of people that you would say no chance that they would ever deceive you, and they are the worst people in the world.\n\"I know others that you would guarantee they would deceive you, and you know what, they're 100% honourable, so you never know what you're getting.\"\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, who had been due to meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington before he cancelled the talks \"due to scheduling issues\", told BBC News that Putin and Russia did \"not want to have peace\".\n\"For any peace agreement to function, it needs the Europeans as well as Ukrainians on board,\" she added.\nStopping off in the Irish Republic on Thursday en route to the US, Zelensky met the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin at Shannon Airport. \n\"We discussed the steps to end the war with guaranteed peace for Ukraine and the whole of Europe,\" he said later.\nFollowing the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian president in 2014, Moscow annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed pro-Russian separatists in bloody fighting in eastern Ukraine.\nThe conflict burst into all-out war when Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022.\nIt is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people, most of them soldiers, have been killed or injured, and millions of Ukrainian civilians have fled as refugees.\nAs well as Crimea, Russia now occupies parts of four other regions - Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.  \nThe Kremlin warned on Thursday that Russia would make no territorial concessions to Ukraine as part of a peace deal.\n\"All territories that have become subjects of the Russian Federation... are an integral part of our country, Russia,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. \"This is an absolutely indisputable fact and a non-negotiable fact.\"\nSeparately, Russian and US officials met in the Turkish city of Istanbul for talks on rebuilding diplomatic ties. \nThe two nuclear superpowers expelled one another's embassy staff when Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, was in the White House.",

However, the family accepts the Court of Appeal's decision to drop all charges.  \n\"The constant media attention and speculation which has accompanied the process has exacted indescribable, lasting damage on the family, particularly on Liam's son who is trying to process emotions which no seven-year-old should have to experience.  \n\"The family has always wished for privacy to grieve and asks that they be given the space and time to do so.\n\"This weekend, at the Brit Awards, Liam was remembered for his phenomenal contribution to British music and for his wider, positive impact on millions of adoring fans the world over.

Its policy towards Gaza, it says, was \"paradoxical: Hamas was illegitimate, yet there was no effort to develop an alternative\".\nThe military had chosen a \"conflict management\" approach to dealing with Gaza, it says. And had assumed that Hamas was \"neither interested [in] nor preparing for a large-scale war\" - a perception reinforced by Hamas's own deception tactics.\nEvidence from 2018 onwards suggesting that Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist group by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - was indeed developing an ambitious plan was interpreted as \"unrealistic or unfeasible\", reflecting \"Hamas's long-term aspirations rather than an actionable threat\".\nThe report says that in the months leading up to the war, the Military Intelligence Directorate began to develop a new assessment, suggesting that Hamas's plan was not merely a vision but \"a concrete framework for operational planning\".\nHowever, this emerging assessment was not brought to the attention of senior officials in military intelligence.\nThe report identifies a broad streak of complacency within the military about Hamas's intentions and how to deal with the threat it posed.\n\"There was no deep discussion of the question: What if we are wrong?\" the report says.\nOver time, \"a significant and continuous gap between the intelligence assessments of Hamas and reality\" had developed.\nThe report also highlights what it says was \"a decline in deep familiarity with the enemy's different worldview, including its culture, religion, language and history\".\nIt calls for deep reform of the intelligence directorate's culture, \"fostering intellectual openness, scepticism, listening, learning, debate, and constructive disagreement\".\nIt says the desire to protect highly valuable intelligence sources contributed to the military's failure to raise the alert level immediately before 7 October.\nThe Gaza Division, it says, \"was effectively defeated for several hours\" on 7 October, significantly impairing its ability to understand what was going on and respond effectively.\nIt says the Air Force responded quickly, but that \"there was significant difficulty distinguishing between IDF troops, civilians and terrorists\".\nThe report also says that in some incidents, wounded soldiers were evacuated before civilians.\nAfter presenting the findings to commanders on Monday, the IDF's outgoing chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said he took full responsibility for the failures.\n\"I embrace my responsibility. It is mine. I was the commander of the army on 7 October and I have my responsibility and I have all of your responsibility. I see that as mine too.

        "article_text": "A new revival of Christopher Marlowe's pioneering play about the 14th-Century King of England puts the spotlight back on his relationship with his male \"favourite\" Piers Gaveston.\nThis week, at its base in Stratford-upon Avon, the world-famous Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) is opening a new production of Christopher Marlowe's Edward II. Though this influential 16th-Century play about a beleaguered queer monarch is more than 430 years old, it still feels stingingly relevant.\u00a0Marlowe depicted a king whose authority and ability to rule is fatally undermined by his relationship with another man. Modern-day UK monarchs hold only ceremonial power, but overt queerness in the British royal family remains vanishingly rare.\u00a0Lord Ivar Mountbatten, a second cousin of King Charles III who is currently competing on US reality show The Traitors, is widely described as \"the first openly gay royal\".\nMarlowe's play dramatises the struggles of Edward II, a real-life King of England who reigned from 1307 to 1327. A year after Edward II succeeded his father, Edward I, he married the King of France's daughter, Isabella, in an effort to strengthen Anglo-French relations. Queen Isabella bore Edward II four children, and became a formidable figure in her own right \u2013 she is sometimes called \"the she-wolf of France\". But Marlowe's play really hinges on the king's controversial relationship with his male \"favourite\", Piers Gaveston, and how this sparked a constitutional crisis that he never recovered from.\u00a0\nThe playwright\u00a0never says outright that the two men are lovers, but the queer subtext is hardly subtle. In one scene, after he is reunited with his favourite, Edward beseeches him to \"kiss not my hand [but] embrace me, Gaveston, as I do thee\". In another, Isabella bemoans the fact \"the king regards me not, but [instead] dotes upon the love of Gaveston\". Only a wilfully obtuse reader of Marlowe's text could miss the insinuation that these two men are more than just friends.\u00a0\nEver since it was written, Marlowe's play has helped to cement the real-life Edward's debatable but not entirely misleading reputation as a \"gay king\". To put it simply, we can never know for certain whether Edward II had a romantic and/or sexual relationship with any of his male favourites. But when it was first performed in 1592, it paved the way for the monarch's queerness to be openly discussed by historians. \"The earliest text we have accusing Edward of some kind of sexual transgression was written around the time Gaveston was murdered [in 1312],\" historian Kit Heyam, author of The Reputation of Edward II, 1305-1697, tells the BBC. \"It says that at the beginning of Edward's reign, there was 'much lechery habitually practised'.\"\u00a0\nIn the parlance of the time, \"lechery\" was used to describe any kind of \"sinful\" sexual behaviour, according to the mores of the Catholic Church, which held religious authority in England at the time. \"The text seems to be suggesting that this behaviour will stop now that Gaveston's dead, but it stops short of saying that the sexual transgression was actually between Gaveston and the king,\" Heyam says. In the centuries after Edward II's death, it became less risky for writers to insinuate that Edward II may have been sexually transgressive, but the invention of the printing press in the 15th Century cranked up the innuendo. \"Writers would sensationalise their texts to make them more commercially appealing, so they started saying that Edward II was definitely sexually transgressive, and it was definitely the fault of his male favourites,\" Heyam says. \"But Marlowe was the first person to join the dots, and say that Edward II was actually sleeping with them.\"\nThe actor and RSC co-artistic director Daniel Evans, who portrays Edward II in the new production, believes that Marlowe's play still feels \"radical\" in 2025. His interest in reviving it was piqued by director Daniel Raggett, who posed a \"provocative\", hypothetical question that underlines the piece's enduring relevance: \"What would happen if our current king, Charles III, suddenly said: 'I know I've been married for a while, but I actually want someone called Colin by my side, not Camilla?'\" It might not cause a civil war, as Edward's relationship with Gaveston begets in Marlowe's play, but Evans questions just how accepting today's \"supposedly liberal and permissive society\" would be. \"Deep-rooted homophobia still exists, and the whole notion of the British Royal Family, of lineage and heirs, is very dependent on a heteronormative family structure,\" he notes.\nEvans and Raggett were also intrigued by the play's late-20th-Century renaissance, which is inextricably linked with the burgeoning LGBTQ+ rights movement. Dr Will Tosh, head of research at Shakespeare's Globe, and author of Straight Acting: The Many Queer Lives of William Shakespeare, says that Marlowe's play \"doesn't have a hugely long performance history\" outside of the era in which it was written. He notes that in the 18th and 19th centuries, it essentially went \"into cold storage\" because the idea of a male monarch having a male lover would have been anathema to conservative Georgian and Victorian audiences. The play's subsequent revival in the second half of the 20th Century coincides with a \"more curious and less judgmental attitude to queer intimacy\", Tosh says.\nIn 1969, two years after male homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales, but 11 years before the same advance was made in Scotland, Ian McKellen portrayed Edward II in a Prospect Theatre Company production that toured the UK. Gaveston was played by James Laurenson, a New Zealand actor who died last year, and their on-stage kiss caused some controversy when the production arrived in Edinburgh. \"The late councillor John Kidd took offence to this show of male affection, particularly as it took place on a stage erected within the assembly hall of the Church of Scotland,\" McKellen recalls on his website. Though a couple of local policemen were sent to watch the production, McKellen notes that they found \"no problem\" with its contents and this brief fuss \"guaranteed full houses for the run.\"\nWhen this production was broadcast on the BBC a year later, it made history by including the first same-sex kiss ever shown on British television. In a 2017 interview, McKellen said that the Prospect production also had a profound impact on \"many, many Americans\" who watched it on US network PBS. \"They saw for the first time in their lives two men kissing and couldn't believe it, but took comfort from it,\" he said.\nThe play's place in the queer canon was further cemented by a 1991 film adaptation directed by artist and gay rights activist Derek Jarman. Featuring a deliberately anachronistic mix of modern and medieval props, costumes and backdrops, Jarman's film dials up Marlowe's homoeroticism, and reframes the story within the context of the contemporary LGBTQ+ rights movement. As Gaveston (played by Andrew Tiernan) is tortured for his transgressions, Jarman shows police clashing with protesters from gay-rights group OutRage!.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0\"He was a monster\": How history got Henry VIII wrong\n\u2022\u00a0The redemption of America's most vilified First Lady\n\u2022\u00a0The historic female gang who menaced London\nA year before Jarman's film, Marlowe's play was staged by the RSC with Simon Russell Beale in the title role. Angela K Ahlgren argues in her\u00a02011 essay Performing Queer Edward II in the 1990s\u00a0that Jarman's film and this RSC revival of the play \"reflect notions of queerness circulating in the 1990s because they stage violence, same-sex desire, and references to contemporary gay political issues\". At the time, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was devastating the gay male population globally, and queer activists in the UK were protesting against Section 28, a piece of legislation that prohibited the supposed \"promotion of homosexuality\" by schools and local councils. It had been enacted by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Government in 1988, following a rising tide of anti-gay sentiment in the media.\nStill, Marlowe's play should never be regarded as a work of historical gospel. Tosh says the playwright's \"major dramatic innovation\" is to make the king's relationship with Gaveston the \"central drama\" of his life by \"compressing the timeline\". In reality, Edward II cultivated relationships with other highly influential male favourites after Gaveston was murdered in 1312, just five years into his 19-year-reign. But Marlowe depicts his bond with Gaveston as by far the most emotionally significant. \"After Gaveston's death in the play, Edward invokes his memory to justify whatever he's doing. And later, when Edward is imprisoned and mistreated, he invokes Gaveston's name again as a plea for salvation,\" Tosh says.\u00a0\nOf course, Marlowe's play also invites us to make serious presumptions about the nature of the two men's relationship. Historian Kathryn Warner, author of Edward II: The Unconventional King, says we can never know for certain how Edward II felt about Gaveston and his other male favourites because the king didn't keep a diary or write personal letters. \"All we have is the word of outsiders, which is obviously open to interpretation,\" she says. But in all likelihood, given that he fathered an illegitimate child with an unknown woman, Edward II's sexuality was probably more complicated than his reputation as a \"gay king\" might suggest.\u00a0\"I think in purely physical terms, we could probably call him more bisexual than gay,\" Warner says. \"But emotionally, it strikes me that he probably was gay, because he was very, very close to his male favourites.\"\u00a0\nThis closeness almost certainly caused his downfall. According to Heyam, Edward's fundamental error throughout his reign was to grant his favourites too much power. \"He failed to realise that being king of England in the 14th Century is very much a manager's job,\" they say. \"Edward needed to keep a number of powerful nobles happy, but when he gave Gaveston power over them, he made them very angry.\" After Gaveston was murdered by a group of rival barons in 1312, Edward II made the same mistake again with Hugh Despenser the Younger, whom Warner describes as \"the last and most powerful\" of his male favourites.\u00a0\nIt's worth noting that Despenser does appear in Marlowe's play, but only as a relatively minor character called Spencer who is essentially a stand-in for Gaveston following his death. The real-life Despenser had much more agency. In 1324, amid growing tensions with France, he began to wield his influence against Queen Isabella because of her French heritage. Isabella fought back with support from her own favourite, Richard Mortimer, which ultimately led to Despenser's execution in 1325, and Edward II's forced abdication the following year. \"If he had just kept his public and private lives separate, he would probably have been fine,\" Heyam says.\nIn Marlowe's play, the fallen monarch is killed at Mortimer's behest by a red hot poker through his anus. Warner says the idea that Edward II was murdered in this way is \"almost certainly a myth\" \u2013 one Marlowe didn't invent, but definitely helped to \"popularise\". Over 430 years later, it remains a shocking image with crassly homophobic overtones. But even if Marlowe's poker scene is apocryphal, the play still has a lot to say about the consequences of intolerance. When Edward complains about being forced to \"leave my Gaveston\", the disapproving Earl of Lancaster replies derisively: \"Diablo, what passions call you these?\" His use of the Spanish word for \"devil\" is surely no accident. \"I hope audiences who see this play think deeply about what happens when you try to ban love and sublimate someone's natural way of being,\" Evans says. \"The endless cycle of violence that this can create is something we can all learn from today.\"\u00a0\nEdward II is at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon until April 5, rsc.org.uk\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Edward II: Did a gay love affair spark a 14th-Century royal crisis?19 hours agoShareSaveNick LevineShareSaveAlamyA new revival of Christopher Marlowe's pioneering play about the 14th-Century King of England puts the spotlight back on his relationship with his male \"favourite\" Piers Gaveston.This week, at its base in Stratford-upon Avon, the world-famous Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) is opening a new production of Christopher Marlowe's Edward II. Was Edward II gay?Ever since it was written, Marlowe's play has helped to cement the real-life Edward's debatable but not entirely misleading reputation as a \"gay king\". \"The actor and RSC co-artistic director Daniel Evans, who portrays Edward II in the new production, believes that Marlowe's play still feels \"radical\" in 2025. \"The earliest text we have accusing Edward of some kind of sexual transgression was written around the time Gaveston was murdered [in 1312],\" historian Kit Heyam, author of The Reputation of Edward II, 1305-1697, tells the BBC.",

I am living proof that it takes a long time but you don't need to compromise your vision,\" she added.\nIt's always difficult getting the tone of the opening performance right - but Carpenter certainly nailed the brief with her mash-up of mega-hit Espresso and recent favourite from her best-selling album, Bed Chem.\nFans of the star who have been eagerly following her Short n' Sweet Tour will have recognised some elements of it in her Brits performance - which was given a suitably British update with the opening strains of Rule Britannia and a, ahem, close encounter with a beefeater.\nCarpenter also became the first international star to accept the global success award, jokingly saying it was \"an insane honour, for such a tea-drinking country you streamed the [heck] out of espresso.\"\nWearing some lingerie that might have been a little bit too racy for the pre-watershed slot, her performance around a heart-shaped bed was energetic and embodied her cheeky style that has elevated her fame in recent months.\nBest pop act winner, Jade - of little mix Fame - attempted to top this with a performance of her song Angel Of My Dreams.\nIn it she appeared in a blonde wig and big white fur coat before disappearing briefly somewhere in a crowd of dancers and re-emerging as an angel suspended above the stage. \nSeveral artists used their winning platform to urge the powers-that-be to do more to protect artists and give them the time, space and funds to develop.\nJazz group Ezra Collective - who closed the night with an upbeat performance alongside Jorja Smith - won group of the year, with Femi Koleoso expressing that giving a young person at a youth club a trumpet, for example, could help to fix \"so many of the problems that face greater society in the UK\".\nChappell Roan, who won best international act and international song for Good Luck, Babe!, noted via a video link how she had to write \"a lot of bad songs to get to the good ones\".\nRising star winner Myles Smith - or \"The Luton Bob Dylan\", as host Jack Whitehall called him - performed his hit Stargazing and called on the government to stop treating British music as an \"after thought\" while urging the music industry itself to stick with artists past their first viral hits and tours.\nIt was also a night that marked the return of Sam Fender, with the Geordie singer-songwriter picking up the best alternative/rock act.\nHe thanked his band in his speech, saying he would just be a \"mad man shouting at walls\" without them.\nIt marks the end of a huge week for Fender, who also topped the UK album charts with People Watching - which had the biggest opening week for a British album since Harry Styles' Harry's House in 2022.\nHe topped off the evening with an emphatic performance of its title track.\nBest hip-hop winner Stormzy thanked Jesus and read a verse from the bible before explaining that he was wearing shades as he had \"mashed my eye up playing padel\".\nBest R&B act winner Raye said via video that she was \"still recovering\" from last year's event when she won a record-breaking six awards.\nDublin rock band Fontaines D.C said they were \"buzzing\" to win best international group and did so, fittingly, from Down Under.\nAnd Teddy Swims performed his hit Lose Control on a flame-filled stage - a potential fire hazard in his baggy oversized jacket - before Lola Young played her viral hit in a Messy makeshift room.\nIt's four years since Whitehall last hosted the Brit Awards - with Mo Gilligan filling the gap - and he noted how broadcasters ITV \"had to come crawling back to an ex\" in asking him back.\nHe poked fun at the stars in the audience, underlining how Charli, in true British style, \"had asked not to perform on the show so she can get drunk\".\nAnd referencing Stormzy's recent high profile adverts, he called the star \"the grime scene's Ronald McDonald - he's loving it\".\nAiming a light dig at YouTuber KSI, the host joked: \"You are as good a rapper as Aitch... from Steps\".\nHaving flown over from US filming commitments a few days ago, he showed little signs of jet lag in his bid to \"Make the Brits Great Again\", as he had joked in a pre-show video this week.\n\"If you thought Trump-Zelensky was cringe then wait until you hear me...\" he quipped.\nIt reached peak cringe though when his parents appeared alongside him in one segment, with his dad dressed as Kanye West.\nThe biggest cheer of the night came when actor Danny Dyer told Whitehall that \"the world is being run by cranks\".\nLiam Payne, who tragically died in Argentina aged 31, had a huge connection to the Brits, both as part of One Direction and as a solo artist.\nThe ceremony included a touching tribute to the star, which was a bit of a gear shift towards the end of the fun-packed show, as Whitehall queued up a sombre black and white montage of Payne's career, including music and quotes from him and his bandmates.\n\"I hope that me singing today brings enjoyment to someone,\" he was heard saying.\nSeven-time Brit winner Dua Lipa won nothing on the night despite having received four nominations.\nThere were also snubs for royal royalty The Beatles, Coldplay and The Cure, who like Dua, all lost out to Charli in various catergories.\nLet's hope they're not too Bratty about it.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'I accept what I did was awful' - 'Steve'\nWarning: this article contains offensive language\nSteve was leaving the football ground when he shouted back at some away fans. Moments later he was in handcuffs and under arrest.\nHe had shouted a homophobic slur, committing a hate crime that led to him being charged with a Section 5 Public Order offence. The case ended up in court, where he pleaded guilty, and he was banned from attending football matches in the UK for three years.\nNow Steve - not his real name as he fears for the impact on his professional and personal life - is trying to make amends after coming through a fan education programme run by anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out.\nHere he shares his story with BBC Sport.\nA lifelong football fan, Steve had just watched his side play Chelsea and was leaving the stadium.\n\"I heard Chelsea fans shouting and I shouted back, 'Oi, you Chelsea rent boys', gave them a few gestures and thought nothing of it.  I thought I was just having a bit of back and forth with the away fans,\" he said.\nWhat followed is all a bit of a blur.\n\"I walked away and then all of a sudden I was surrounded by six security guards. And then from that point, a police officer arrested me and put the cuffs on.\"\nSince January 2022, the Crown Prosecution Service has defined the \"Chelsea rent boy\" chant - aimed at the west London club's players and supporters - as a homophobic slur and says that anyone singing it is committing a hate crime and could face prosecution.\n\"I'm in my 20s and I didn't really understand that [term],\" Steve said. \"I knew there was stuff around it, but I didn't really perceive why it was homophobic.\"\nSteve was eventually referred to Kick It Out, which runs a fan education programme where offenders learn about the different types of discrimination and the impact their actions can have on victims.\n\"I accept that [what I did] was awful, and now it's about repaying that, turning that into something positive. I've had a look at myself... I'm willing to make amends,\" he said.\n\"People are going to make mistakes, but you're judged on how you then move forward.\"\nHe said the session had changed him \"massively\".\n\"It's made me aware of how there's a fine line between what's considered banter and just abuse.\"\nThe Kick It Out course is run by Alan Bush, the charity's fan education and engagement manager, who has delivered more than 400 sessions in the past five years. In that time, 40 fans were referred to him by either police or clubs for using the Chelsea slur.\n\"We can't ban our way out of discrimination and we can't just ban football fans from football. All we do is we push it back into society,\" Bush said.\n\"Football has a responsibility to educate its fans... then fans say to other fans  'you can't say that, mate,  you'll end up in court' or 'you can't say that because that's wrong'. There's a chance they report, there's a chance that they challenge. And I just think that has to be a far better than just banning people.\"\nHe added that \"the vast majority have not understood the gravity of how offensive that [chant] can be, how that can cause harassment, alarm and distress to an individual\".\nTo illustrate his point, Bush tells the offenders the story of Lee Johnson, a passionate Tottenham fan who was forced out of football for nearly a decade after hearing the Chelsea chant inside White Hart Lane as a teenager.\n\"It completely shook me to my core,\" Johnson - who is now co-chair of the Proud Lilywhites, the LGBTQ+ supporters' association of Tottenham Hotspur - told BBC Sport. \n\"It felt like all of the lights had gone out and I was just isolated by myself. It just took me straight back to when I was younger at school. 'Rent boy' was one of the things I used to get [called].\"\nJohnson had often been a target for abuse in his home town. Football used to be an escape, somewhere he could \"get lost in the magic of the game\" but hearing homophobic chanting made him question everything.\n\"I was thinking 'Am I safe here?' If people around me knew that I was gay, would they be attacking me or be verbally abusive? Would they stop singing it about Chelsea and would they start singing it about me?\" he said.\n\"People were using a term that has caused a lot of harm to me over the years. It's very traumatic. I think it was still the first half and I just said to my friend, 'I can't be here'. It was a fight or flight response. I left and I didn't come back for nearly 10 years.\"\nSince 2023, the Football Association has also been able to charge clubs if their fans sing the chant.\nSeven charges have been brought against six clubs for homophobic chanting, according to English football's governing body. The clubs, which include Wolves, Leeds and Luton have been fined a total of \u00a3415,000.\nTwo charges raised against Tottenham Hotspur following their Premier League match with Manchester United on 29 September 2024 are yet to be decided.\nThe updated FA guidance, combined with the change in law, appears to be having the desired effect.\nFigures from Kick it Out show reports of mass homophobic chanting are falling, with 17 reported incidents last season, down from 43 in the 2021-22 season.\nSteve knows he has been part of the problem.\nHe has never considered himself homophobic but since he got arrested he has been through a spectrum of emotions.\n\"Fear. Annoyance. Despair. Guilt. But then came acceptance,\" he said.\n\"My journey has sort of been about personal growth. Now I want to make a difference going forward. I want to make football a better place.\"\nHe wants to make sure other do not repeat his mistakes, adding: \"Treat everybody with respect or you'll end up like me with a ban and a criminal record.\n\"Some people who are gay have walked away from football altogether and don't feel it's safe. So, if I can just stop one person from doing that. I'll be happy. Just think before you speak.\"",

        "article_text": "For over 20 years, archaeologists in India's southern state of Tamil Nadu have been unearthing clues to the region's ancient past.\nTheir digs have uncovered early scripts that rewrite literacy timelines, mapped maritime trade routes connecting India to the world and revealed advanced urban settlements - reinforcing the state's role as a cradle of early civilisation and global commerce.\nNow they've also uncovered something even older - evidence of what could be the earliest making and use of iron. Present-day Turkey is one of the earliest known regions where iron was mined, extracted and forged on a significant scale around the 13th Century BC.\nArchaeologists have discovered iron objects at six sites in Tamil Nadu, dating back to 2,953\u20133,345 BCE, or between 5,000 to 5,400 years old. This suggests that the process of extracting, smelting, forging and shaping iron to create tools, weapons and other objects may have developed independently in the Indian subcontinent. \n\"The discovery is of such a great importance that it will take some more time before its implications sink in,\" says Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti, a professor of South Asian archaeology at Cambridge University.  \nThe latest findings from Adichchanallur, Sivagalai, Mayiladumparai, Kilnamandi, Mangadu and Thelunganur sites have made local headlines such as \"Did the Iron Age Begin in Tamil Nadu?\" The age marks a period when societies began using and producing iron widely, making tools, weapons and infrastructure.\nParth R Chauhan, a professor of archaeology at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (ISSER), urges caution before drawing broad conclusions.  He believes that iron technology likely emerged \"independently in multiple regions\".\nAlso, the \"earliest evidence remains uncertain because many regions of the world have not been properly researched or archaeological evidence is known but has not been dated properly\". \nIf the Tamil Nadu discovery is further validated through rigorous academic study, \"it would certainly rank amongst the world's earliest records\", Mr Chauhan says. Oishi Roy, an archaeologist at ISSER, adds that the find \"suggests parallel developments [in iron production] across different parts of the world\".\nEarly iron came in two forms - meteoritic and smelted. Smelted iron, extracted from ore, marked the true beginning of iron technology with mass production. The earliest known iron artefacts - nine tubular beads - were made from meteoritic iron, which comes from fallen meteorites.\nIdentifying iron-bearing rocks is the first challenge. Once located, these ores must be smelted in a furnace at extremely high temperatures to extract the metal. Without this process, raw iron remains locked within the rock. After extraction, skilled ironsmiths shape the metal into tools and implements, marking a crucial step in early ironworking.\nMost sites in Tamil Nadu where iron has been found are ancient habitation areas near present-day villages. Archaeologists K Rajan and R Sivanantham say that excavators have so far explored a fraction of over 3,000 identified Iron Age graves containing sarcophagi (stone coffins) and a wealth of iron artefacts. In the process, they uncovered hoe-spades, spears, knives, arrowheads, chisels, axes and swords made of iron.\nAt burials excavated at one site, over 85 iron objects - knives, arrowhead, rings, chisels, axes and swords - were found inside and outside burial urns. More than 20 key samples were robustly dated in five labs worldwide, confirming their antiquity.\nSome finds are particularly striking. \nHistorian Osmund Bopearachchi of the Paris-based French National Centre for Scientific Research highlights a key discovery - an iron sword from a burial site, made of ultra-high-carbon steel and dating to 13th\u201315th Century BC. \nThis advanced steel, a direct evolution of Iron Age metallurgy, required sophisticated knowledge and precise high-temperature processes.\n\"We know that the first signs of real steel production date back to the 13th Century BC in present-day Turkey. The radiometric dates seem to prove that the Tamil Nadu samples are earlier,\" he said. Ms Roy adds that the early steel in Tamil Nadu indicates the people there \"were iron makers, not just users - a technologically advanced community evolving over time\".  \nAlso, in a site called Kodumanal, excavators found a furnace, pointing to an advanced iron-making community. \nThe furnace area stood out with its white discolouration, likely from extreme heat. Nearby, excavators found iron slag - some of it fused to the furnace wall - hinting at advanced metalworking techniques. Clearly the people at the site were not just using iron, but actively producing and processing it.\nTo be sure, the Tamil Nadu excavations are not the first in India to uncover iron. At least 27 sites across eight states have revealed evidence of early iron use, some dating back 4,200 years. The latest Tamil Nadu digs pushes back the antiquity of Indian iron by another 400 years,\" archaeologist Rajan, who has co-authored a paper on the subject, told me. \n\"The Iron Age is a technological shift, not a single-origin event - it develops in multiple places independently,\" says Ms Roy, noting earlier discoveries in eastern, western and northern India.\n\"What's clear now,\" she adds, \"is that indigenous iron technology developed early in the Indian subcontinent.\"\nExperts say the excavations in Tamil Nadu are significant and could reshape our understanding of the Iron Age and iron smelting in the Indian subcontinent. Also, \"what these digs testify is to the existence of a distinctly sophisticated style of civilisation,\" notes Nirmala Lakshman, author of The Tamils - A Portrait of a Community.\nHowever, archaeologists caution that there is still a lack of excavations needed to collect fresh data from all over India. As one expert put it, \"Indian archaeology is in silent mode outside Tamil Nadu.\"\nKatragadda Paddayya, a leading Indian archaeologist, said this was \"just the starting point\".\n\"We need to delve deeper into the origins of iron technology - these findings mark the beginning, not the conclusion. The key is to use this as a premise, trace the process backward and identify the sites where iron production truly began.\"  ",

        "article_text": "I'm 48, use social media occasionally, and I'm not very tech-savvy. Until recently I'd never used Telegram.\nBut last year, after meeting the family of Ronan Kanda - the 16-year-old who was killed in a case of mistaken identity by two other teenagers who'd bought a sword and machete online - I decided to figure out how easy it was to buy a knife from social media.\nIt seemed like the children in the case were able to buy huge, deadly weapons with shocking ease.\nSo in spring 2024, I set up several social media accounts in the name of a fake 18-year-old man. He is a Londoner who is friends with a group of young men who carry knives. He thinks he needs one too, to protect himself, and he knows larger knives are more intimidating.\nI got myself a separate mobile so my new searches would not impact my usual browsing algorithms. I started searching for knives, liking and following accounts which offered content.\nThe groups contained images of young men posing with knives, videos of close-ups of the blades, and some had videos of knife fights. Very quickly my new social media accounts started showing me more similar content.\nA familiar pattern emerged. Knives were being advertised in posts on Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, with sellers directing buyers in their bio to their Telegram channels - encrypted groups where videos, photos and prices of knives for sale were openly shared.\nWithin hours of starting my searches I found and joined my first Telegram group selling banned weapons. There were zombie knives, machetes, switchblades and swords.\nTwenty-two-inch machetes cost \u00a340 and 24-inch zombie knives were \u00a350 - with new stock arriving soon. The seller was based in Walsall and promised delivery to the Birmingham area for \u00a35. Days later, a message went up saying the machetes and zombie knives had sold out.\nThen a poll went up, asking \"Should I get stab-proof vests?\" Fifty-six subscribers answered. A few weeks later, stab vests were available to buy.\nWithin a few weeks I found more than 10 social media accounts offering illegal knives for sale. It didn't take long for me to learn the slang used for terms like knife seller, flick knife and zombie knife.\nKnives were offered in a range of colours - gold, silver, red and blue being the most common. Sellers uploaded photos of their parcels, naming the courier companies they were using to \"guarantee quick delivery\". In some groups buyers had written reviews after receiving their knives - \"banging quality these\" and \"vouched - nice one bro\".\nThere were deals too. One group offered discounts on bulk buying, \u00a35 off second orders, and the chance for members to win knives and knuckledusters for free. As far as I could see, none of the groups were doing any kind of age verification.\nSome were closed down during the nine months I observed them on Telegram, including one called Shanks R Us. But most of them stayed active the whole time.\nMany routinely posted that they were out of stock, and apologised for the inconvenience.\nIn September 2024, the government introduced legislation making it an imprisonable offence to own or sell zombie-style knives and machetes. This added them to a long list of prohibited knives.\nIt's clear they are now getting harder to get a hold of.\nIn one group, the admin says they are getting zombie knives manufactured and shipped from abroad - Malaysia, Pakistan and China - and it's taking longer than usual. The admin brags that \"all [their] shipments land\", and now they're focusing on \"bulk stock for the future\u2026 meaning the knives should be cheaper\".\nBut despite this, the trade is still going strong. On 14 February, I see a message on a group that's grown from zero to 600 members in just a few months reading: \"Happy Valentine's Day to da ladies out there, grab your mans a tool for Valentine's Day, make sure he's safe.\"\nMany of the knives being sold are clearly illegal - but some aren't.\nThe sale of legal knives over Telegram is not technically forbidden, as you don't need a licence or registration to sell them. It is, however, illegal to publish material encouraging the use of a knife as a weapon.\nIn spring 2025, the Home Office intends to launch a consultation into a registration scheme for selling knives online - which would require sellers of all knives, including regular kitchen knives, to sign up.\nThe Offensive Weapons Act states that there should be a system in place for age verification on sale and for delivery, but there's no evidence that this takes place in the social media groups I've been in.\nI contacted the social media platforms to ask what they were doing to curb this harmful content.\nSnapchat said selling weapons, including knives, was explicitly banned on the platform and that it actively worked to remove such content.  \nIt said action was taken against violators of the policy - like disabling accounts. It also said it supported police investigations and had a team working around the clock to respond to authorities' data requests.\nSimilarly, TikTok said the trade of dangerous weapons was prohibited and that in the third quarter of 2024, 96% of clips that breached guidelines were removed before being reported. It said sharp knives, regardless of size, were not allowed to be sold on TikTok Shop.\nIt added it worked closely with government and police to understand changes in knife crime, and assisted police enquiries.  \nI reached out to Meta too - which hasn't yet provided a comment. Previously a spokeswoman told the Times that the promotion and sale of weapons on Meta's platforms was banned, and that such content was removed when found.\nShe added that in 2024, Meta met other tech firms, the Home Office, Ofcom and officials to understand how to work together to tackle the issue.\nTelegram - the most unregulated of all the platforms - didn't get back to me.\nTelegram is crucial as it is the place where sales of the dangerous weapons actually take place - without action by them, things might not change even if Snapchat, TikTok and Meta cracked down on harmful content.\nMurdered teen Ronan Kanda's sister told the BBC that his murderer \"didn't have any problems collecting his knife from his local post office\".\nHis mother, Pooja, was adamant that the online sale of bladed articles had played a \"crucial role\" in the tragedy. \"A 16-year-old managed to get these weapons online and sold these weapons to other people,\" she said.\nFollowing his death the government has announced a series of new measures known as Ronan's Law, including stiffer sentences for selling knives to under-18s.\n\"Out of tragedy comes a light,\" said Pooja. \"The light we all need.\"\nBut she stressed \"there's so much more we can do.\"\nRight now, it's still incredibly easy to buy lethal blades on social media.",

Clearly within that we are trying to improve every single day. \n\"People may have seen the France v Italy game and expect England to win by 50 points because we are at home. We have to be realistic as well. It's a Test match and Italy are a decent side, they are well coached and have some good players who we know a lot about.\n\"Of course it's important how we play, but our job is to win rugby games. We probably didn't give Scotland enough credit for how well they played. Would we like to throw the ball about and score eight or nine tries? Of course we would, but the reality is they are a good side and they took that away from us.\"\nSinfield's current title is skills coach, but the former rugby league international says his role is very varied, as he has also been seen working with England's kickers before they address the ball.\nMarcus Smith began the tournament as England's fly-half and main kicker but his disappointing performance from the tee against France led to namesake Fin Smith converting Elliot Daly's winning try late on.\nMarcus Smith retained the kicking duties in the victory over Scotland before Fin Smith took the responsibility for a long-range penalty from just inside the halfway line.\nAsked whether England have a main kicker, Sinfield said: \"Typically it's been Marcus for this campaign.\n\"That kick where we changed at the weekend was from bang on the halfway line and on a slight angle as well so it's understanding what people's ranges are. The guys actually made that decision on the field.\n\"The balance between them is great. They understand the team has to come first and sometimes that means some decisions are made, not just around kicking but with selection, positions people play in and the minutes they get.\"\nMarcus Smith has played the past two matches at full-back, with Fin Smith steering the attack from fly-half, but Sinfield says the aim of the decision is to utilise the Harlequins playmaker's strength in space.\n\"I think he's played in that [full-back] role a number of times for Quins,\" added Sinfield. \"He perhaps hasn't started there, but certainly gone there in games when Jarrod Evans has gone on.\n\"We know he is a world-class number 10 and part of our role as coaches is trying to get our best players on the field, and sometimes that means they have to shift positions slightly. \n\"One of Marcus' big qualities is how he beats people and what he's like in spaces that are a little bit bigger and when the gaps are a bit bigger, and trying to get him into those positions is a big part of why he was moved to 15. \n\"That's not to say it will continue or to say it will change, it's to say the fact he has some flexibility in his play is really important to us.\"",

        "article_text": "Stars, film fans and fashionistas rejoice as the biggest night in the showbiz calendar is here at last - the 97th Oscars.\nSpanish-language musical Emilia P\u00e9rez leads the way with 13 nominations, but recently saw its awards chances damaged after offensive historic tweets from its star resurfaced.\nWicked, The Brutalist, Conclave and Anora are also among the top contenders, with the race for best picture too close to call.\nUS comedian Conan O'Brien is presenting the awards from Los Angeles, with the show starting at 16:00 (PT), 19:00 (ET) and midnight (GMT).\nYou can also expect plenty of references during the night to the wildfires which devastated LA and left thousands of homes destroyed.\nHere are all the major talking points and things to look out for at the ceremony, as an eventful awards season draws to an end.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez, about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, has 13 nominations in total \u2013 including best picture, best actress (Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n) and best supporting actress (Zoe Salda\u00f1a).\nIt is the most-nominated non-English language film of all time. It's actually a French production, largely set in Mexico, with Spanish as the main language spoken. \nKarla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n's nomination made her the first trans person to be nominated in an acting category (although Elliot Page was nominated for Juno in 2008, before the actor transitioned).\nHowever, the film \u2013 which had already caused controversy in Mexico \u2013 has been beset by controversy following a social media row involving Gasc\u00f3n.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez remains strong in a couple of categories, but it's unlikely to sweep the board in the way Oppenheimer \u2013 which also had 13 nominations \u2013 did last year.\nChasing down Emilia P\u00e9rez with 10 nods is three-and-a-half epic The Brutalist, starring Adrien Brody.\nWicked also has 10 nominations, including for British actress Cynthia Erivo and her co-star Ariana Grande, while Demi Moore has the first Oscar nomination of her career for her role in The Substance.\nMeanwhile, pope selection drama Conclave has eight nominations, including best actor for its British star Ralph Fiennes.\nAll the films above are up for the coveted best picture prize, and are joined by Anora, about a New York stripper who falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nThe film, which has six nominations, leapt ahead in the race after a string of precursor wins at the Critics Choice Awards as well as two major guild ceremonies - the Directors Guild of America and Producers Guild of America Awards.\nBut there remains no consensus on what will ultimately win the top prize \u2013 with the other contenders for best picture including A Complete Unknown, Dune: Part Two, I'm Still Here and Nickel Boys.\nThis has been an unpredictable awards season, and there could still be plenty of surprises in store.\nIn the best actress category, Moore, 62, is nominated for playing a fading star who swaps her body for a younger and more beautiful version of herself in The Substance.\nBut it's a tight race.\nThere were gasps backstage at the Baftas (where I was) when Anora star Mikey Madison scooped up the best actress prize.\nIt was a big blow to the assumed Oscar momentum for Moore, and an incredible moment for Madison, who was relatively unknown before her role in Anora.\nThis is exactly the type of rags-to-riches story that awards ceremonies love \u2013 and the film itself celebrates.\nBest actor may also be up in the air. Adrien Brody is the frontrunner, with his nod for The Brutalist \u2013 but Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is his toughest competition, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.\nLast week, Chalamet's surprise SAG win shook up the race, after his somewhat eccentric awards campaign.\nIf he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner of best actor.\nIn the best supporting actor category, Kieran Culkin is the frontrunner for A Real Pain, while Zoe Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.\nIt's worth noting it's been a decade since the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite started trending, due to the lack of diversity at the 2015 Academy Awards.\nThis year, there are people of colour in both the best actress and best actor categories.\nIn fact, Sing Sing's Colman Domingo is nominated for best leading actor for the second year in a row.\nElsewhere, however, progress remains slow.\nCoralie Fargeat is the only woman to be nominated for best director, for The Substance, out of a field of five.\n\"Has there been progress, yes. Has there been enough? Absolutely not,\" April Reign, LA-based founder of the #OscarsSoWhite movement, told me.\n\"It was never just about the Oscars not being black enough. It was also about gender, age, class, sexuality and geography too.\"\n\"If we're still able to count them on one hand, then we're not there yet.\"\nMost of the nominees will be gracing the red carpet \u2013 I'm already betting we'll see more tears and hand holding from Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.\nThere had been a big question mark over whether Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n will show up after the row over her past tweets.\nHowever, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself \u2013 although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.\nPresenters include Halle Berry, Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr, Cillian Murphy, Da'Vine Joy Randolph and Emma Stone.\nThis year's Oscars race has played out against the grim backdrop of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles.\nThe nominations themselves were postponed twice due to the fires.\nThere's no doubt it's going to be hard for the awards to strike the right tone when so many people are suffering. It doesn't sit well with celebrities flaunting their wealth on the red carpet.\nCancelling the whole event, however, was \"never on the table,\" according to Lynette Howell Taylor, an LA-based British film producer and member of the Academy's board of governors, who lost her own house in the fires.\nShe told me there would \"definitely be recognition of what the city has gone through\" during the ceremony, with clear signposting of support mechanisms and ways to donate.\n\"But ultimately the show will be about the celebration of the movies of the year, like it is every year,\" she said.\nThis year, the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony.\nInstead, Wicked stars Erivo and Grande will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony, which will last a reported 10 minutes long.\nI can already see social media going into a meltdown over Defying Gravity, but it remains to be seen if the duo can recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.\nDoja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony.\nThe Academy Awards ceremony is hosted this year for the first time by comedian and podcaster Conan O'Brien.\nHe replaces US late night presenter Jimmy Kimmel, who has presented the show four times including last year.\nThe 2025 Oscars will air live on Sunday 2 March from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the ceremony has been held since 2002.\nThe show can be watched in the US on ABC and can be streamed on Hulu. It is also being broadcast around the world in more than 200 territories.\nUK viewers can watch on ITV and ITVX from 22:30 GMT.\nCynthia Erivo is the first black British woman to receive two Oscar nominations for acting, after also being nominated for Harriet in 2020.\nIf she wins best actress this time, for playing Elphaba in Wicked, she'll become an EGOT - having completed the set of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards.\nRalph Fiennes is flying the flag in the best actor category with his first nomination for 28 years. He's recognised for playing a cardinal who oversees the selection of a new Pope in Conclave.\nElsewhere, Felicity Jones is nominated for best supporting actress for The Brutalist - a decade after her first Oscar nomination - while Sir Elton John is in the best original song race.\nThe country will also be rooting for two more screen legends - Wallace and Gromit (and their makers Aardman Animations), who are hoping for their fourth Oscar.

How to watch the Oscars and who is nominated20 hours agoShareSaveNoor NanjiCulture reporter in Los Angeles\u2022@NoorNanjiShareSaveGetty ImagesMikey Madison and Demi Moore are both up for best actressStars, film fans and fashionistas rejoice as the biggest night in the showbiz calendar is here at last - the 97th Oscars.Spanish-language musical Emilia P\u00e9rez leads the way with 13 nominations, but recently saw its awards chances damaged after offensive historic tweets from its star resurfaced.Wicked, The Brutalist, Conclave and Anora are also among the top contenders, with the race for best picture too close to call.US comedian Conan O'Brien is presenting the awards from Los Angeles, with the show starting at 16:00 (PT), 19:00 (ET) and midnight (GMT).You can also expect plenty of references during the night to the wildfires which devastated LA and left thousands of homes destroyed.Here are all the major talking points and things to look out for at the ceremony, as an eventful awards season draws to an end.Which films are in the running?NetflixEmilia P\u00e9rez, starring Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, has the most nominations this yearEmilia P\u00e9rez, about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, has 13 nominations in total \u2013 including best picture, best actress (Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n) and best supporting actress (Zoe Salda\u00f1a).It is the most-nominated non-English language film of all time. Adrien Brody is the frontrunner, with his nod for The Brutalist \u2013 but Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is his toughest competition, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.Last week, Chalamet's surprise SAG win shook up the race, after his somewhat eccentric awards campaign.If he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner of best actor.In the best supporting actor category, Kieran Culkin is the frontrunner for A Real Pain, while Zoe Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.10 years since #OscarsSoWhiteIt's worth noting it's been a decade since the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite started trending, due to the lack of diversity at the 2015 Academy Awards.This year, there are people of colour in both the best actress and best actor categories.In fact, Sing Sing's Colman Domingo is nominated for best leading actor for the second year in a row.Elsewhere, however, progress remains slow.Coralie Fargeat is the only woman to be nominated for best director, for The Substance, out of a field of five. It is also being broadcast around the world in more than 200 territories.UK viewers can watch on ITV and ITVX from 22:30 GMT.British buzzGetty ImagesConclave's Ralph Fiennes has his first best actor nomination for 28 yearsCynthia Erivo is the first black British woman to receive two Oscar nominations for acting, after also being nominated for Harriet in 2020.If she wins best actress this time, for playing Elphaba in Wicked, she'll become an EGOT - having completed the set of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards.Ralph Fiennes is flying the flag in the best actor category with his first nomination for 28 years. \"It was never just about the Oscars not being black enough.",

        "article_text": "At least 40 Uyghurs have been deported to China,Thai authorities have confirmed, despite warnings from rights groups they could face possible torture and even death. \nThe group is thought to have been flown back to China's Xinjiang region on Thursday, after being held for 10 years in a Bangkok detention centre. \nChina has been accused of committing crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur population and other mostly Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang. Beijing denies all of the allegations. \nIt is the first time Thailand has deported Uyghurs since 2015. \nThe deportation has been shrouded in secrecy after serious concerns were raised by the United States and United Nations.\nThai media reported that several trucks, some with windows blocked with sheets of black plastic, left Bangkok's main immigration detention centre in the early hours of Thursday morning.\nHours later, tracker Flightrader24 showed an unscheduled China Southern Airlines flight leaving Bangkok, eventually arriving in Xinjiang. It was not immediately clear how many people had been deported. \nThe Thai government later said it had decided to send the 40 Uyghurs back to China because it was not right that they had been held for more than a decade, but that no other third country had stepped forward offering to take them. That includes Turkey, which has given Uyghurs asylum in the past. \nEight Uyghurs remain in Thailand, including five who are serving jail terms for crimes they committed while in detention. \nThe government also said that Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was given assurances that the Uyghurs would be looked after if returned to China during her recent visit to the country. \nShe did not initially confirm any deportations had taken place when asked by reporters on Thursday.\n\"In any country in the world actions must adhere to the principles of law, international processes, and human rights,\" Shinawatra said.\nBeijing said that 40 Chinese illegal immigrants were repatriated from Thailand, but refused to confirm that the group were Uyghurs. \n\"The repatriation was carried out in accordance with the laws of China and Thailand, international law and international practice,\" the foreign ministry said. \nChinese state media said the group had been \"bewitched\" by criminal organisations and were stranded in Thailand after illegally leaving the country.\nThe returned group is made up of more than 300 Uyghurs who were detained at the Thai border in 2014 after fleeing repression in Xinjiang. \nMany were sent to Turkey, while others were deported back to China in 2015 - prompting a storm of protest from governments and human rights groups.\n\"What is the Thai government doing?\" asked opposition lawmaker Kannavee Suebsang on social media on Thursday.\n\"There must not be Uyghur deportation to face persecution. They were jailed for 11 years. We violated their human rights for too long.\"\nThe detention centre where the Uyghurs - who had been charged with no crime, apart from entering Thailand without a visa - were kept was known to be unsanitary and overcrowded. Five Uyghurs died in custody.\nIn a statement on Thursday, Human Rights Watch said the group now face a high risk of torture, enforced disappearance and long-term imprisonment.\n\"Thailand's transfer of Uyghur detainees to China constitutes a blatant violation of Thailand's obligations under domestic and international laws,\" said the organisation's Asia director, Elaine Pearson.\n\"Until yesterday [Wednesday], senior Thai officials had made multiple public assurances that these men would not be transferred, including to allies and UN officials.\"\nPhil Robertson, director of the Asia Human Rights and Labour Advocates (AHRLA) group, said that the deportations \"totally destroyed\" the \"charade\" that the current Thai government was different to the previous one \"when it comes to transnational repression and cooperating with authoritarian neighbours\". \nAmnesty International described the deportations as \"unimaginably cruel\".\nOn Thursday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned Thailand for the deportation and urged \"all governments in countries where Uyghurs seek protection not to forcibly return ethnic Uyghurs to China.\"\nHe accused China of having \"committed genocide and crimes against humanity targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other members of ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang\" in a statement published online.\nThe UN said it \"deeply regrets\" the deportations, a phrase echoed by the EU.\nMeanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK disagrees \"in the strongest terms\" with Thailand's decision.\nThere are about 12 million Uyghurs, mostly Muslim, living in Xinjiang, which is officially known as the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).\nThe Uyghurs speak their own language, which is similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. They make up less than half of the Xinjiang population.\nRecent decades have seen a mass migration of Han Chinese (China's ethnic majority) into Xinjiang, allegedly orchestrated by the state to dilute the minority population there.\nChina has also been accused of targeting Muslim religious figures and banning religious practices in the region, as well as destroying mosques and tombs.\nWith additional reporting by Thanyarat Doksone in Bangkok",

The case ended up in court, where he pleaded guilty, and he was banned from attending football matches in the UK for three years.\nNow Steve - not his real name as he fears for the impact on his professional and personal life - is trying to make amends after coming through a fan education programme run by anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out.\nHere he shares his story with BBC Sport.\nA lifelong football fan, Steve had just watched his side play Chelsea and was leaving the stadium.\n\"I heard Chelsea fans shouting and I shouted back, 'Oi, you Chelsea rent boys', gave them a few gestures and thought nothing of it.  I thought I was just having a bit of back and forth with the away fans,\" he said.\nWhat followed is all a bit of a blur.\n\"I walked away and then all of a sudden I was surrounded by six security guards. And then from that point, a police officer arrested me and put the cuffs on.\"\nSince January 2022, the Crown Prosecution Service has defined the \"Chelsea rent boy\" chant - aimed at the west London club's players and supporters - as a homophobic slur and says that anyone singing it is committing a hate crime and could face prosecution.\n\"I'm in my 20s and I didn't really understand that [term],\" Steve said. \"I knew there was stuff around it, but I didn't really perceive why it was homophobic.\"\nSteve was eventually referred to Kick It Out, which runs a fan education programme where offenders learn about the different types of discrimination and the impact their actions can have on victims.\n\"I accept that [what I did] was awful, and now it's about repaying that, turning that into something positive. I've had a look at myself... I'm willing to make amends,\" he said.\n\"People are going to make mistakes, but you're judged on how you then move forward.\"\nHe said the session had changed him \"massively\".\n\"It's made me aware of how there's a fine line between what's considered banter and just abuse.\"\nThe Kick It Out course is run by Alan Bush, the charity's fan education and engagement manager, who has delivered more than 400 sessions in the past five years. In that time, 40 fans were referred to him by either police or clubs for using the Chelsea slur.\n\"We can't ban our way out of discrimination and we can't just ban football fans from football. All we do is we push it back into society,\" Bush said.\n\"Football has a responsibility to educate its fans... then fans say to other fans  'you can't say that, mate,  you'll end up in court' or 'you can't say that because that's wrong'. There's a chance they report, there's a chance that they challenge. And I just think that has to be a far better than just banning people.\"\nHe added that \"the vast majority have not understood the gravity of how offensive that [chant] can be, how that can cause harassment, alarm and distress to an individual\".\nTo illustrate his point, Bush tells the offenders the story of Lee Johnson, a passionate Tottenham fan who was forced out of football for nearly a decade after hearing the Chelsea chant inside White Hart Lane as a teenager.\n\"It completely shook me to my core,\" Johnson - who is now co-chair of the Proud Lilywhites, the LGBTQ+ supporters' association of Tottenham Hotspur - told BBC Sport. \n\"It felt like all of the lights had gone out and I was just isolated by myself. It just took me straight back to when I was younger at school. 'Rent boy' was one of the things I used to get [called].\"\nJohnson had often been a target for abuse in his home town. Football used to be an escape, somewhere he could \"get lost in the magic of the game\" but hearing homophobic chanting made him question everything.\n\"I was thinking 'Am I safe here?' If people around me knew that I was gay, would they be attacking me or be verbally abusive? Would they stop singing it about Chelsea and would they start singing it about me?\" he said.\n\"People were using a term that has caused a lot of harm to me over the years. It's very traumatic. I think it was still the first half and I just said to my friend, 'I can't be here'. It was a fight or flight response. I left and I didn't come back for nearly 10 years.\"\nSince 2023, the Football Association has also been able to charge clubs if their fans sing the chant.\nSeven charges have been brought against six clubs for homophobic chanting, according to English football's governing body. The clubs, which include Wolves, Leeds and Luton have been fined a total of \u00a3415,000.\nTwo charges raised against Tottenham Hotspur following their Premier League match with Manchester United on 29 September 2024 are yet to be decided.\nThe updated FA guidance, combined with the change in law, appears to be having the desired effect.\nFigures from Kick it Out show reports of mass homophobic chanting are falling, with 17 reported incidents last season, down from 43 in the 2021-22 season.\nSteve knows he has been part of the problem.\nHe has never considered himself homophobic but since he got arrested he has been through a spectrum of emotions.\n\"Fear. Annoyance. Despair. Guilt. But then came acceptance,\" he said.\n\"My journey has sort of been about personal growth. Now I want to make a difference going forward. I want to make football a better place.\"\nHe wants to make sure other do not repeat his mistakes, adding: \"Treat everybody with respect or you'll end up like me with a ban and a criminal record.\n\"Some people who are gay have walked away from football altogether and don't feel it's safe. So, if I can just stop one person from doing that. I'll be happy. Just think before you speak.\"",

        "article_text": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky met US President Trump in Washington on Friday to sign an agreement that would give the US access to its deposits of rare earth minerals.\nBut after Zelensky left early following a fiery exchange with Trump and Vice-President JD Vance, the White House announced that the deal had not been signed.\nZelensky previously said he hoped the \"preliminary\" agreement with the US would \"lead to further deals\", but confirmed no US security guarantees had yet been agreed - something he had been pushing for.\nTrump had said a deal would help US taxpayers \"get their money back\" for aid sent to Ukraine throughout the war, but said the responsibility of Kyiv's security should fall to Europe.\nOn Wednesday, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine and the US had finalised a version of the agreement. It was published on Friday morning.\nThe preliminary agreement envisages that an \"investment fund\" will be set up for Ukraine's reconstruction. \nShmyhal said Kyiv and Washington would manage the fund on \"equal terms\".\nAccording to the deal, Ukraine will contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas to the fund, and the fund will then invest \"to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine\".\nMeanwhile, the agreement says the US government will, subject to US law, \"maintain a long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine\".\nZelensky acknowledged the fund, but told the BBC on Wednesday it was \"too early to talk about money\". \nThe agreement states that the US will own the maximum amount of the fund allowed under US law. \nDisagreement over the terms of a minerals deal formed part of what appears to be a deepening rift between Trump and Zelensky.\nThe Ukrainian president rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (\u00a3395bn) in mineral wealth, but media reports say this demand has now been dropped.\n\"The US administration started with a deal that challenged Ukraine's sovereignty, then pushed an exploitative one that would bankrupt the country,\" Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister and head of Kyiv school of economics, told the BBC. \n\"Now, they've shifted to a reasonable deal with co-ownership and no direct claims on past aid. That could actually benefit Ukraine.\"\nOn Tuesday, Trump said the US had given Ukraine between $300bn (\u00a3237bn) and $350bn (\u00a3276bn) in aid, and that he wanted to \"get that money back\" through a deal. \nBut German think tank the Kiel Institute estimates the US has sent $119bn in aid to Ukraine.\nZelensky has been pushing for a deal to include a firm security guarantee from the US.\nBut on Wednesday, he said no such guarantee had been made. \n\"I wanted to have a sentence on security guarantees for Ukraine, and it's important that it's there,\" the Ukrainian leader explained. \nAsked by the BBC if he would be prepared to walk away from the agreement if Trump did not offer the guarantees he wanted, Zelensky said: \"I want to find a Nato path or something similar.\n\"If we don't get security guarantees, we won't have a ceasefire, nothing will work, nothing.\"\nDespite this, the published agreement says the US supports \"Ukraine's efforts to obtain security guarantees to build lasting peace\".\nHe said Ukraine would not sign the deal until Zelensky and Trump \"agree on security guarantees\" and decide on how to \"tie this preliminary agreement\" to a US security guarantee.\nTrump said on Wednesday that the US would not provide security guarantees \"beyond... very much\", adding that responsibility for this would now fall to Europe. \nBut he added that the presence of US workers on Ukrainian soil would provide \"automatic security\".\nThe prospect of a minerals deal was first proposed by Zelensky last year as a way to offer the US a tangible reason to continue supporting Ukraine.\nTrump said on Tuesday that Ukraine would get \"the right to fight on\" in return for access to its minerals and suggested the US would continue to supply equipment and ammunition \"until we have a deal with Russia\". \nThe US president has also said Russia is open to accepting European peacekeepers in Ukraine, but Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Kremlin would not consider this as an option.\nTrump had said the two would sign the deal at Friday's meeting at the White House.\nUkrainian PM Shmyhal said the US and Ukraine had prepared a final version of the agreement, though Zelensky aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said that only a framework agreement was due to be signed.\nBut nothing at all was signed during the visit, which instead saw Trump and Zelensky descend into a heated exchange in the Oval Office.\nAt one point, a furious Trump said Zelensky was not grateful enough for the US's support during the war, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three\".\nHe said Zelensky had to \"make a deal or we're out\", adding: \"You don't have the cards.\"\nZelensky said there should be \"no compromises\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nNot long after - and well ahead of schedule - the Ukrainian president was seen leaving the White House.\nThe White House then announced that the deal had not been agreed - and said Trump had decided to call off the signing ceremony himself.\nThe US president wrote on his Truth Social platform that Zelensky had \"disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office\". He added: \"He can come back when he is ready for peace.\"\nIt is now unclear when the deal might be signed, if at all.\nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.\nThis includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine also has significant deposits of titanium and lithium. It says it has substantial amounts of the world's rare earth metals - a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world - but these claims are disputed.\nAlso, some of the country's mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nThere are warnings too that a deal allowing the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth cannot happen unless the country addresses its problem with unexploded mines. \nA quarter of Ukraine's landmass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country.\nAnother issue is that it will be some time before anyone sees any material benefits from the deal.\n\"These resources aren't in a port or warehouse; they must be developed,\" says Mylovanov. \"In that sense if the US invests, it will benefit everyone.\"\nVladimir Putin has not yet addressed reports that the terms of a deal between the US and Ukraine have been agreed.\nBut on Monday evening he told state TV he was ready to \"offer\" resources to American partners in joint projects, including mining in Russia's \"new territories\" - a reference to parts of eastern Ukraine that Russia has occupied since launching a full-scale invasion three years ago.\nPutin said a potential US-Ukraine deal on rare minerals was not a concern and that Russia \"undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine\".\n\"As for the new territories, it's the same. We are ready to attract foreign partners to the so-called new, to our historical territories, which have returned to the Russian Federation,\" he added.\nCommenting on Zelensky's visit to Washington, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday: \"Whether it will be [to sign] the aforementioned agreement or something else, we'll see. There have been no official statements on this matter yet.\"",

It ripped the club apart.\"\nMillwall, who face London rivals Crystal Palace in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Saturday (12:15 GMT, live on BBC One), are still coming to terms with the loss of the popular keeper who everyone called 'Mati'.\n\"I remember seeing the news come through on social media,\" says Clarke. \"My son and I were in total shock.\"\nMillwall goalkeeper Sarkic dies aged 26\nWolves lead tributes to Matija Sarkic after death\nTen days before he died, Sarkic played for Montenegro against Belgium in a friendly in Brussels\nMarshall was at home with his partner Jasmine when his mobile phone started ringing early in the morning on 15 June 2024.\n\"It was 06:57. As I went to pick it up it rang off. It was Mati's father Bojan. I texted him 'is everything ok?' and he immediately rang back.\"\nTen days earlier Marshall had been at the King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels to see Sarkic produce a man-of-the-match performance in Montenegro's friendly against a Belgium, external side that included Kevin de Bruyne and Leandro Trossard.\nBelgium won 2-0 but Millwall's goalkeeper, who dreamed of playing in the Premier League, earned rave reviews for his display - with one report noting that it felt like Sarkic had \"come of age\".\n\"We spoke the day after the game,\" adds Marshall.\n\"We were making plans for the following season, how we were trying to push Millwall towards the Premier League and Mati towards the Premier League because that was the long-term goal.\n\"I told him to go and enjoy the summer and that we'd chat when we met up again at Millwall for pre-season training.\"\nIt was their last conversation together.\nSarkic was given permission to miss Montenegro's next game, a friendly against Georgia, to be best man at the wedding of his twin brother Oliver - the former Blackpool and Burton midfielder - in Guimaraes, northern Portugal, on 8 June.\nA week later Sarkic died in the coastal town of Budva on the Adriatic coast.\nHe had been on holiday with his partner Phoebe as well as former Aston Villa defender Oscar Borg and Borg's girlfriend.\nHis family were told he suffered sudden heart failure.\n\"After the phone call with Bojan I was traumatised,\" says Marshall. \"I broke down crying.\"\nSarkic is congratulated by his Millwall team-mates after saving a penalty at Birmingham City in September 2023\nSarkic was born in Grimsby in 1997 and spent his early childhood in London before moving to Brussels, where his father was Montenegro's ambassador.\nHe joined Anderlecht's academy at the age of eight and spent 10 years with them before returning to England in 2015 to sign for Aston Villa, where he first encountered Marshall.\n\"My first impression of Mati? A smart young man who was very clever, very well educated and who was eager to learn,\" says Marshall, who was Millwall's 2004 FA Cup final goalkeeper.\n\"Immediately we had a good rapport and a very good understanding of one another. I could see the potential in him.\"\nLoan spells at non-league Stratford Town and Havant & Waterlooville played a part in Sarkic's football education, as did a short stint at Wigan.\nBy now a pattern was beginning to emerge despite his career being at the fledgling stage.

The following day a memorial service was organised by the Football Association of Montenegro and was attended by the country's president.\nSoon afterwards Millwall, whose owner and chairman John Berylson died from injuries sustained after his car overturned in July 2023, announced they would retire Sarkic's number 20 shirt.\nWhen the players returned for pre-season training on 26 June - 11 days after their team-mate's death - they joined all club staff for a minute's silence.\nSarkic's parents, Bojan and Natalie, brothers Oliver and Danilo, and partner Phoebe, were at The Den for the visit of Watford on the opening weekend of this season when Millwall paid tribute to Sarkic.\nWatford fans unfurled a banner which read: 'RIP Matija Sarkic'.\n\"It was hugely appreciated and a class act.

        "article_text": "Ethan Kross is a world expert in the psychology of emotions, and he has identified a set of tools that can help us to tend our wellbeing.\nEver since he was a child, Ethan Kross has been \"an observer of emotion\" and the often counter-productive ways that we deal with difficult feelings. \"It seemed as if we were all just stumbling along, occasionally finding an accidental or Band-Aid solution to help us manage our emotional lives. Sometimes our improvised tools helped. Sometimes they made things worse. It seemed so haphazard, isolating, and inefficient,\" he says.\nAs a psychologist at the University of Michigan and director of the Emotion and Self-Control Laboratory, Kross hopes to change this sorry state of affairs. In his new book Shift: How to Manage Your Emotions So They Don't Manage You, he aims to equip us all with a set of tools that will help us to navigate our ups and downs more constructively.\nKross spoke to science writer David Robson about the benefits of \"negative\" feelings, creating safe spaces and emotional oases \u2013 and the surprising upsides of distraction.\nWhat are the most common misconceptions about emotions?\nOne big misunderstanding is that there are good emotions and there are bad emotions and that we should strive to live our lives free of all the bad emotions. This is an error, as far as I'm concerned: we evolved the ability to experience all emotions for a reason. Anger can motivate us to correct an injustice if there's still an opportunity to fix things. Sadness can lead us to introspect and make new meaning out of situations that have fundamentally been altered. Envy can motivate us to strive for things that we want to achieve. In the right proportions \u2013 that is such a key phrase \u2013 all emotions are useful.\nOne way of driving this point home is to think about physical pain, which is about as negative an emotional state as we can imagine. Many of us yearn to live lives free of any kind of physical pain. But some people are born without the capacity to experience pain, due to a genetic anomaly, and those kids end up dying younger than people who can experience pain. If they get their hand stuck in the fire, there's no signal that tells them to pull the hand away. The same principle is true for all our negative emotions.\nPeople often find it liberating to know that they don't have to strive to live a life without negativity. What you want to strive to achieve is just keeping these emotional experiences in check, and I think that's a much more tenable goal.\nMany people believe that their emotions are beyond their control. Where do you think this defeatist attitude comes from? And what are the consequences?\u00a0\nI think it depends on the facet of our emotional experiences that we're talking about. We often don't have control over the thoughts and feelings that are automatically triggered as we live our lives throughout the day, but we can control how we engage with those thoughts and feelings once they're activated, and that's where the promise of emotion regulation resides.\nBut if you don't think you can do something, then you're not going to make the effort to practice it. If you don't think exercising is going to make you more fit, for example, why on Earth would you devote effort to exercising? And if you don't think that you can use different strategies to manage your emotions, why would you ever avail yourself of them?\nSo how can we change our responses to difficult feelings?\nListening to music is one example of a tool that's underutilised. If you ask people why they listen to music, almost 100% of participants will say that they like the way it makes them feel. But if you then look at what people do when they are struggling with their emotions \u2013 such as the last time they were angry, anxious or sad \u2013 only a small minority report using music.\u00a0\nIt's just one category of what I call \"shifters\", which are the tools that can push our emotions around. And once you know how they work, you can be a lot more strategic in how you use them in your life.\nYou also describe how a change in environment can boost our wellbeing. We might have experienced this on holiday, but how can we apply this principle to our day-to-day lives?\u00a0\nAs you say, a lot of people feel restored when they go to an entirely different place that is free of associations with work. But we can't always take that vacation, and what I like to remind people is that there are often places locally that can shift our mood.\nWe talk a lot about getting attached to other people, and when things aren't going well, being in the presence of that figure can be a source of comfort and resilience. But it turns out we also become attached to places in our environment. Mine include the arboretum near my home, the tea house where I wrote my first book and one of my offices on campus. From the moment I am in that space, I have positive associations that help me manage my emotions.\nI think that they're not unlike the safe houses you have in spy movies or books. We all have these safe houses in our lives, and we want to be strategic about going to them when we're struggling. It's a way of managing ourselves from the outside in.\nYou can also curate your environment. We know that plants and images of green spaces can be restorative. So can photos of loved ones. We've done research where we expose people to pictures of loved ones while they're struggling with a problem. We find it speeds up the rate at which they \"repair\" following the experience.\u00a0\nIs the aim to be more conscious of what we can do to change how we're feeling \u2013 rather than just leaving it to chance?\nOne of my hopes for this book is that we can get people to be much more deliberate about incorporating these tools into our lives.\nI was surprised to find that distraction and avoidance can be a productive way of dealing with emotions. How so?\u00a0\nAvoidance \u2013 trying actively not to think about something by distracting yourself or engaging in other behaviours \u2013 is generally derided as an unhealthy tool. And there's no question that chronically avoiding things has been linked with negative outcomes; it's not an approach that I would advocate for anyone to adopt.\nBut we do not have to choose between either approaching or avoiding our emotions; we can be flexible and do both. There's research showing that people who are effective at both approaching and avoiding their emotions, expressing and suppressing, often fare well in the long term.\nWhat might that look like in our lives? Well, let's say you're triggered by something. You get emotional about an argument you have had with someone. One approach might be to address it right there at that moment, but it might make sense to take some time away from thinking about that problem or confronting it. I say that as the kind of person who, in general, does like to confront things right in the moment, just get to the bottom of it, and move on. But sometimes I've benefited from immersing myself in something totally unrelated for a day and then coming back to the problem. I might come back and realise it's not a problem at all, or I'll find that the intensity of the problem is diminished, and I can approach it from a broader perspective.\nHow should we deal with that killer of joy, social comparison?\nWe often hear that we shouldn't compare ourselves to other people. Good luck! We're a social species; part of the way we make sense of ourselves and our place in this world is to compare ourselves to others.\n\u00a0\nIt is true that we often engage in the kinds of comparisons that lead us to feel bad about ourselves, but you can reframe it in ways that make the comparison work for you rather than against you. If I find out that someone is outperforming me, I can say to myself, well, they were able to achieve that, so why can't I? Now it's almost like a target for something that I can shoot towards.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why we need to be more emotional to save the world\n\u2022 The untranslatable emotions you never knew you had\n\u2022 How climate change effects mental health\nDo you have a favourite strategy that you would typically turn to in times of difficulty?\nWhen I'm struggling, my first line of defence is to use distanced self-talk. I'll use my name and the second person pronoun \u2013 you \u2013 to silently coach myself through a problem, as if I'm advising a friend. (Read more: Illeism: The ancient trick to help you think more wisely.) And then I'll also engage in mental time travel. I'll ask myself, 'How am I going to feel about this in a day, 10 days, 10 months from now?' And I'll also go back in time. 'How does this compare to other difficult things I've been through?'\nOftentimes, those tools get me to where I want to be emotionally, but if they're not sufficient, I'll go to my emotional advisors, people in my network who are pretty skilled at empathising with me and advising me. And I'll go for a walk in a green space, or visit one of my emotional oases.\n*Ethan Kross's new book Shift: Managing Your Emotions So They Don't Manage You is published by Vermilion (UK) and Crown (US).\n** David Robson is an award-winning science writer and author.

        "article_text": "Only three Premier League goalkeepers - Ipswich's Arijanet Muric, Robert Sanchez of Chelsea and Brighton's Bart Verbruggen - have made more errors leading to goals this season than Andre Onana\nManchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana is in the spotlight again after his error led to Ipswich Town taking an early lead in their Premier League game on Wednesday evening. \nUnited rallied and eventually won the game 3-2 despite being down to 10 men, but the mistake has reignited the debate about the Cameroon international.\nThe 28-year-old endured a tough start to life at Old Trafford but appeared to have turned a corner earlier this season when he had the most clean sheets in England's top flight with six. \nHowever, four minutes in to the game against the Tractor Boys, he illustrated why United fans and pundits have persistent doubts about him.\nHe dashed to the edge of his penalty area as Patrick Dorgu ran towards him and, as the left wing-back nudged the ball towards where he expected Onana to be, it gifted Jaden Philogene with a tap-in.\nThe former Aston Villa winger later scored his second of the night from a deep cross that deceived Onana because of Liam Delap's run across him.\nSpeaking on TNT Sports, former Blackburn and Wales midfielder Robbie Savage said: \"I've got no idea why Onana is running out to that position [for the first goal]. \n\"Dorgu has got it under control, no problem at all. He shouldn't come there.\n\"You should be talking, lay it back to him on his right foot and then he can clear it. I don't know why he's come.\" \nFormer United defender Rio Ferdinand added: \"It was a terrible start. Onana doesn't need to come. The full-back is in complete control and he can just hold his ground and let him play it back to him.\"\nOn BBC Radio 5 Live, former Celtic boss Neil Lennon added: \"I don't know where Andre Onana is going. It is a shambles.\"\nUnited paid \u00a347m to sign Onana from Inter Milan in the summer of 2023 as a  replacement for four-time club player of the year David de Gea.\nBut he has largely failed to shake the view that his occasional fallibility adds to the fragility of a struggling side.\nOnana made several glaring mistakes in the Champions League last term that contributed heavily to United's early exit from the competition at the group stage. \nThere had already been notable errors against Viktoria Plzen, Brighton and Nottingham Forest this season prior to the Ipswich game as he has slipped down in the race for the Golden Glove.\nHis performance in the 1-0 defeat at Tottenham, where he pushed Lucas Bergvall's tame effort straight into the path of goalscorer James Maddison, encouraged further scrutiny.\nHis understudy, Turkey's Altay Bayindir, has played just seven times since joining in September 2023 and is yet to start a Premier League game. \nOnana's form and the reluctance to use Bayindir prompts questions about the decision to let De Gea, Dean Henderson and Czech Republic goalkeeper Matej Kovar to leave for less than half the amount Inter were paid for their goalkeeper.\nDe Gea, 34, who has won 45 caps for Spain and is now at Fiorentina in Serie A, is the obvious barometer. \nHe has a better shot save percentage than Onana - 72 compared to 65 - and has yet to make any big errors directly leading to goals, compared to three for Onana.\nIn mitigation, De Gea has faced fewer shots (90 to 111) and Onana has also had to contend with a switch in formation from 4-3-3 to 3-4-3 under a new manager in Ruben Amorim. \nThe Portuguese boss is also yet to name an unchanged starting XI in any of the 23 matches he has taken charge of and has had a habit of substituting one of his three central defenders after about an hour.\nThat can hardly help build relationships and understanding at the back and nor can Onana be blamed for some of the static defending in front of him.\nIt should also be noted Onana has at times made crucial saves this season.\nWhat's more, Fiorentina are in better form than United, challenging for a Champions League spot in Italy while United are a lowly 14th in the Premier League.\nHowever, a perhaps surprising statistic against Onana centres around passing accuracy, given he was brought in as the calatyst towards a possession-based style of play. \nDe Gea was not noted for his dexterity with his feet but trails Onana by just 1%, although he has made significantly fewer passes. His pass completion statistics in his final season at United (73%) were also higher than Onana's this year.\nFormer United goalkeeper Massimo Taibi, whose famous howler against Southampton in 1999 hastened his own departure from Old Trafford, believes Onana could be on borrowed time.\n\"I think subconsciously the United environment isn't ideal for him and when a marriage is showing cracks, it's pointless to continue,\" he told the Sun in December. \n\"I'd be straight to the point and tell him, 'Andre, you are one of the best keepers in Europe but in the Premier League, you are under-performing. Block out criticism, do some soul-searching, press the reset and go again. And if things don't change by June, move on'.\"\nOnana will perhaps be wondering if his latest error will lead to his exit from Old Trafford after just two seasons in Manchester.\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

        "article_text": "In her hometown of Lubbock, Texas, Leah, a pregnant mother, has been avoiding stores and other public spaces for the last two weeks.\nOn Wednesday, the city saw a six-year-old child who was not vaccinated against the virus die \u2013 the first US death from the measles in nearly a decade.\nWith a baby on the way, Leah could be putting her foetus at risk of health complications if she contracted the virus, despite her own vaccination. Her paediatrician also advised her to move up her older son's second shot of the vaccine - the full course for the immunisation - as the risk to his health grows.\n\"Mentally, it's taking a toll on me, thinking about not just myself and my child, but also about the people that I have to be around,\" said Leah, who declined to share her last name for privacy reasons.\nThe US declared measles \"eliminated\" from the country in 2000, but in recent years, as anti-vaccine sentiments rose, the country has seen several outbreaks of the virus.\nThe Texas outbreak began in a small Mennonite community near Lubbock, home to 260,000, and has since spread. To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said.\nOn Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents.\nPublic health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states.\n\"We just want people to be healthy, and it's definitely hard to do that when we have voices in our ears from leadership who don't share those same factual opinions,\" Leah said.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, Katherine Wells, the director of the Lubbock Public Health Department, has not had a day off.\nShe has hosted vaccine clinics to encourage people to get shots, contacted those whose children may have been exposed, and worked to educate the community about the virus.\n\"It's as stressful, if not more stressful, than it was at the beginning of the COVID pandemic,\" she told the BBC.\nMs Wells worries most about those who are not able to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which spreads easily in the air and on surfaces, and when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - also is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.\nPeople who are immunocompromised, children under the age of one and pregnant people cannot be inoculated against the measles.\nThat includes the new baby Lubbock resident Kyle Rable is expecting. His wife is nine months pregnant and plans to deliver in the same hospital where the patient died of the measles.\nMr Rable is terrified for his son's first year of life.\n\"With it spreading essentially like wildfire out here, do we just not leave our house for a year? We can't do that,\" he said.\nTo achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, said Alefiyah Malbari, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin.\nBut several western Texas communities are well below that figure, including Gaines County where the outbreak began and where only 82% of kindergartners are vaccinated.\n\"When you have that many children that are unvaccinated, measles will spread very, very easily within the community,\" said Jill Weatherhead, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine.\nNow, doctors say, parents far from western Texas are starting to worry too. Dr Malbari is getting more calls from parents anxious about protecting their children when not everyone will get the vaccine.\n\"I share that concern with them,\" said Dr Malbari.\nBefore Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine sceptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now.\nHe has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism.\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination. He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to \"do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult\" to get vaccines.\nBut since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses.\nHe also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover.\nKennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of \"informed consent\" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News reported last week.\nThe moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures  Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official.\nBut, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is \"what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination\".\nOn Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed.\nIn addition to calling the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses.\nRon Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades.\n\"It's a devastating disease,\" he said. \"And it's completely preventable.\"\nFor some expectant parents in Lubbock, Kennedy's minimisation of the outbreak has been difficult to watch.\nLeah said she knows many local parents who won't vaccinate their children because of misinformation about safety. She said news of the death has not changed their minds.\n\"If anything, it's just made them double down on their beliefs,\" she said.\nBut Ms Wells has seen at least a few encouraging signs. After the death was announced on Wednesday, around 18 people came to a vaccination clinic following many slow days.\nStill, she said, when she tells parents their children may have been exposed, some still do not want to vaccinate, including doses of the shot that can protect them after potential exposure.\n\"In Texas, vaccines are very much a choice,\" she said.\nLocal health officials are working overtime to build trust and show that the vaccine is safe and effective, Dr Cook said.\n\"We're seeing some success, but we would like to see significantly more,\" he said.  \"It would be nice to have some confidence coming out of the powers that be - at the national level - to show that this is a good vaccine.\"",

        "article_text": "Italian cuisine may be one of the most recognised and loved in the world \u2013 often imagined as a collection of ancient recipes and local traditions preserved by skilful nonnas over the centuries. But now, a food historian is exposing common myths and false stories, arguing that the Italian cuisine as we know it is barely a few decades old.\nFood is no doubt an integral part of the country's culture and identity \u2013 so much so that Italians cherish Neapolitan pizza or pasta alla carbonara as much as the great historical and artistic treasures of the boot-shaped peninsula. Tales abound of centuries-old local feuds over what city has the best filled pasta, while every local cheese or cured meat is likely to boast links to the Renaissance or the Middle Ages.\nAlberto Grandi, food historian and professor of economic history at the University of Parma, has been debunking Italian food myths for years. In 2018, Grandi published Denominazione di Origine Inventata (Invented Designation of Origin: The Lies of Marketing on Typical Italian Products) and later launched a podcast called DOI. But it was a 2023 interview with Financial Times that put Grandi's work into the spotlight and sparked wide debates across Italy.\nGrandi claimed in the interview that pasta alla carbonara was invented in Italy just after World War Two using US Army provisions like bacon and powdered egg yolks, countering the common belief that the authentic recipe includes pork jowl and Roman pecorino cheese. This theory is backed by other authors, like Luca Cesari in The Discovery of Pasta: A History in Ten Dishes, but caused outrage in a country increasingly obsessed with maintaining the lore of Italian authenticity in food. The discussion evolved into a heated Italian-American dispute about the origin of the iconic dish. \u00a0\nGrandi's latest book, La Cucina Italiana Non Esiste (Italian Cuisine Doesn't Exist), written with his podcast co-host Daniele Soffiati and published in April 2024, stirred new controversies with its provocative title.\u00a0\nThe idea that many beloved recipes and products such as cheeses or cured meats have hundreds of years of history, Grandi and Soffiati claim, is pure fantasy. Food is constantly changing and evolving. No product or recipe has always been as we know it now, and most dishes have a shorter history than most people imagine.\nGrandi argues that migration is what made Italian cuisine what it is today. Millions of people left Italy in the 19th and 20th Centuries, emigrating to South America, North America and European countries. They were leaving behind a country that was poverty-stricken, where the diet was limited to a handful of products. Pellagra, a disease caused by lack of vitamin B3, was endemic in several areas of Italy at the end of the 19th Century.\u00a0\nThe Italians who landed on New York's Ellis Island left hunger and misery behind. And it was in the \"new world\", Grandi argues, that Italian immigrants found the wealth and ingredients to create the recipes that eventually popularised Italian food worldwide.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nHowever, many Italians are not familiar with this history. They might imagine that their beloved recipes were born in Italy, passed down, unchanged, from generation to generation and eventually exported abroad by Italian migrants. \"It might seem that the rest of the world didn't know how to eat until all of a sudden Italians arrived,\" says Grandi. He believes it's pure myth \u2013 popularised by social media \u2013 that nonnas taught Americans how to cook rich, genuine Italian food.\nPizza is the most famous example of this. Born as a cheap street food in Naples, in the 19th Century it was almost synonymous with poverty and filth. Pizza is \"a crust of leavened bread dough, oven-toasted, with a sauce of a bit of everything on top\", wrote Pinocchio author Carlo Collodi in 1886. He added that pizza had \"an air of complex filth that perfectly matches that of its vendor\".\nIt was in America, says Grandi, that pizza became \"red\". While fresh tomatoes were among the original toppings, Italian immigrants to the US popularised pizza prepared with tomato sauce, a product that industrialisation made easy to access and store. And it was in the US that pizzerias really started to take off. \u00a0\nScholars call this process \"the pizza effect\": when a product leaves its place of origin, gets profoundly transformed and then returns to its place of origin to be fully embraced in a completely different form.\nGrandi also angered Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese producers when he argued that parmesan has evolved for the better over the last few decades, and the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese that was eaten in Italy 100 years ago and earlier \u2013 a smaller wheel with a black rind \u2013 is now only made in Wisconsin.\nThe shift in the Italian culinary landscape started with the rapid expansion that occurred in Italy post-WWII. The boom brought new possibilities to millions of Italians. Cars, supermarkets and refrigerators meant that people who were limited to a daily local supply could travel to restaurants, buy new products and create new recipes. Tiramisu, says Grandi, is a great example of this: a dessert created in the late 1960s that is based on supermarket ingredients and only possible with a refrigerator. \u00a0\u00a0\nWith the new products and brands also came marketing. \"Television influenced our cuisine and gastronomical identity greatly,\" says Grandi. He argues that most of Italy's gastronomic traditions were invented by food marketers. Carosello, a short television programme that aired in Italy every night from 1957 to 1977, introduced new products and brands through stories, sketches and iconic characters. Carosello provided the consumer education upon which Italian home cuisine was then built, especially by mothers and grandmothers.\nGrandi's book explains that when industry-driven growth started to lose steam in the 1970s, Italy's economy pivoted to small companies, niche products and local excellence. Thousands of protected labels and regional products emerged and Italians doubled down on gastro-nationalism.\n\"Cuisine is no longer part of our identity,\" says Grandi, \"it is our identity.\" He argues that after decades of industry decline and economic stagnation, Italians have no faith in the future \u2013 that's why they \"invent the past\".\nIn less than a century, Grandi says, Italians went from being malnourished migrants to self-appointed custodians of ancestral traditions. The obsession for tradition has sparked searches for \"true\" recipes and \"correct\" ways of consuming food. Italians are ever more adamant to say that bolognese should be called rag\u00f9 alla bolognese and never served with spaghetti. You should also never put chicken (let alone pineapple) on pizza, cook pasta alla carbonara with cream or break spaghetti in two.\n\"I always say that every time anyone in the world adds cream to carbonara, somebody in Rome dies,\" says Grandi. \"Italians used to get upset when they were defined as 'pizza, pasta, mandolin, mafia',\" he adds. \"Now it looks like it's us Italians feeding those stereotypes.\"\nSocial media seems to have contributed to popularising these attitudes. The X account Italians mad at food, launched in 2015, showcases comments of furious Italians who are outraged and offended by how people in other nations choose to eat \"their\" cuisine. The account even sells t-shirts with quotes like \"carbonara is not an opinion\" and \"you break spaghetti, you break my heart\".\nContent creators on platforms like TikTok and Instagram have popularised a genre of video content showing Italians reacting to food \"blasphemy\", with creators and celebrities vigorously showcasing their disgust and indignation \u2013 with no shortage of drama and hand gestures.\nThe popularity of these memes is now so widespread that people might think all Italians feel offended by people's choice of pasta sauce.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\n\"Food as entertainment can be triggering, especially for Italians,\" says Aurora Cavallo, a young Italian chef known as Cooker Girl, with more than 1.3 million followers on both TikTok and Instagram. \"For many people in the world, food isn't just an object but something that carries a lot of significance,\" she adds. \"In my experience, Italians can be more sensitive not just towards recipes, but also towards how food is handled on screen.\"\nGrandi's relentless debunking of Italian food myths has made many people angry over the last few years, but he is adamant that he just wants to dispute the invented history of many products and recipes, not their quality.\nAs social media demonstrates, however, some Italians have convinced themselves that food dogmas are more important than innovations or accuracy.\n\"We don't need to make up stories about Italy's amazing products,\" says Cavallo, echoing Grandi. \"We shouldn't create a situation in which changing recipes is the end of the world because that's the opposite of how Italian food came to be.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "After 25 years apart, all five original members of the British boyband Five are reuniting for a massive UK arena tour.\nThe group sold more than 20 million records in the late 1990s and early 2000s with tracks such as When The Lights Go Out, If Ya Gettin' Down and Slam Dunk (Da Funk).\nThe group - Sean Conlon, Ritchie Neville, Scott Robinson, Abz Love and Jason \"J\" Brown - haven't performed as a five-piece since they broke up in 2001, amid burnout, mental breakdown and backstage fights. \n\"This has been a long time coming and it really does feel right for all of us now,\" said Scott in a statement. \"I know I speak for all the boys when I say we can't wait to do this all over again. Hope you're ready!\"\nThe reunion announcement lands on the 25th anniversary of the band winning best pop act at the 2000 Brit Awards. \n\"We really can't wait to get back on stage together & see the fans, it's gonna go off!\" said Abz.\nFive were formed in 1997, in a gruelling audition process that saw more than 3,000 aspiring singers - including a pre-fame Russell Brand - audition for former Spice Girl managers Bob and Chris Herbert.\nThe group came together relatively naturally, however, after the members formed a unit during rehearsals and convinced record label executives with their chemistry.\n\"I remember Simon Cowell was there and he said, 'You're the band, I'm signing you to RCA Records on a five-album deal, this is happening very soon,\" Scott told journalist Michael Cragg in his book about the 2000s pop era, Reach For The Stars.\nThe group were quickly moved into a shared council house in Surrey to begin the process of bonding - but it didn't go entirely to plan.\n\"They wanted a band with edge and that's what they got,\" Ritchie said in Reach For The Stars. \n\"None of us are people that will be bossed around.

        "article_text": "Andrew Cuomo, who resigned four years ago as New York governor under a cloud of scandal, has declared he is running for mayor of New York City. \n\"Our city is in crisis,\" Cuomo posted in a 17-minute video on X, adding: \"We need government to work. We need effective leadership.\"\nIt heralds a potential political comeback in this year's election for the Democrat, who quit in 2021 amid sexual misconduct allegations and scrutiny of his handling of the Covid pandemic. \nAmerica's most populous city is in a state of political turmoil as current Mayor Eric Adams denies claims he struck a deal to help the Trump administration with migrant raids in exchange for dropping a federal corruption case against him. \nThe former governor joins an already crowded contest, which includes lawmakers, young newcomers and Mayor Adams himself, though it is Cuomo who has the most name recognition. \nThe three-term governor resigned after an investigation found he had sexually harassed 11 women, including state employees.\nThe state-led inquiry determined he had made sexual comments, inappropriately touched or groped the women and kissed them without consent.\nAt the time, President Joe Biden led calls from Democrats for the embattled Cuomo to step down, and state lawmakers raised the prospect of impeachment.\nWhen the governor left office, he denied harassing anyone, but said he wanted to \"deeply, deeply\" apologise to any women who might have been offended by his actions.\nCuomo's stunning downfall happened a year after he basked in the adulation of millions of Americans who had tuned in daily to his no-nonsense televised briefings on the coronavirus pandemic.\nBut a report in 2022 found that under his administration, the state hid at least 4,100 Covid-related nursing home deaths from the public.\nCuomo admitted to a \"delay\" in reporting, but denied allegations that his administration purposely misled New Yorkers.\nOpinion polling by New York media in recent weeks has projected that Cuomo would become frontrunner if he entered the mayoral race.\nDays before the campaign was launched, Cuomo received the surprise backing of congressman Ritchie Torres, who represents the Bronx.\n\"Andrew Cuomo has the competence to govern the city. He has the courage to stand up to extremist politics - both from the far left and far right,\" he told the New York Post.\n\"We don't need a Mr Nice Guy. We need a Mr Tough Guy.\"\nCuomo's supporters have also launched a political action committee called Fix the City, which states it aims to raise $15m (\u00a312m) for his campaign war chest.\nOne of Cuomo's former aides who accused him of sexual harassment told the New York Post on Saturday that she fears women's rights will suffer if he wins election.\n\"New York City may elect a mayor who has been rightfully accused of sexual misconduct by several young women who worked for him in up-close positions,\" said Karen Hinton.\n\"As a movement, we women haven't done enough to toughen laws to protect women from such immoral, unethical, and what should be illegal behaviour by men in positions of power, such as Cuomo.\"\nThe Democratic primary vote will take place in June. The eventual winner is expected to defeat any Republican challenger during November's election and become the city's next mayor.\nAdams has chosen to remain in the race, even while facing federal fraud, bribery and other charges. \nThe Trump administration is seeking to dismiss the charges, arguing that the charges have damaged the mayor's ability to aid the president's agenda and were politically motivated. \nThe attempt caused Manhattan's lead prosecutor and six other high-level federal prosecutors in New York to resign in protest, saying there was no legal justification for the White House directive to end the prosecution.\nMeanwhile, the judge in the case has cancelled the upcoming trial in April as he works to decide whether the case should be dropped or not. \nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul, who took over for Cuomo after he resigned, said last month that she was declining to use her authority to replace Adams, at least for now, and would instead move to limit his authority.\nAdams has denied making a \"quid pro quo\" with Trump's office to help in the removal of illegal migrants, last month calling the assertion \"silly\".\nAdams was indicted last year for allegedly accepting gifts totalling more than $100,000 from Turkish citizens in exchange for favours. He denies the charges.\nHis office has been plagued by staff departures and scandals, even before charges were pressed against him. A number of figures in his orbit have also been indicted as part of the investigation.",

        "article_text": "A trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer.\nSpeaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged \"a real trade deal\" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners. \nThe trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade. \nSir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an \"unprecedented\" second state visit to the UK.  \nReceiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a \"great honour\" and described the King as \"a wonderful man\".\nSir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was \"truly historic\". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit. \nHaving confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes.\nThe US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. \nOn the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. \nHowever, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine.\nAsked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \"backstop\". \nHe said \"nobody will play around\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals. \nThe US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\". \n\"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\" he said. \nHe later added he had \"a lot of respect\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday.\nThe UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders. \nHowever, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\". \nThe deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back. \nAfter taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\". \nReferring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. \n\"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said. \nHe said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century. \n\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said. \nTrump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union. \nHe also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.\nAsked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\"\n\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"\nIn a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\". \nSince leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.\nIn his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way.\nHowever, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems.

No cause of death was given, but police said the situation was \"suspicious enough\" to merit investigation.\nIn a statement, daughters Elizabeth and Leslie, and granddaughter Annie said: \"He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just dad and grandpa.\" \nMorgan Freeman who co-starred with Hackman in the 1992 movie Unforgiven - for which Hackman won an Oscar - described the actor as \"incredibly gifted\" while the movie's director Clint Eastwood said he was \"extremely saddened\" by the news. \nRalph Fiennes - nominated for an Oscar this year for Conclave - paid tribute to the late actor with a black and white portrait of a smiling Hackman, simply titled Gene Hackman 1930-2025. \nViola Davis called Hackman \"one of the greats\" while Tom Hanks posted on Instagram that: \"There has never been a 'Gene Hackman Type.' There has only been Gene Hackman.\"\nThe Prince of Wales also issued a statement saying he was \"so sad to hear the news\". \n\"Hackman was a true genius of film who brought each and every character to life with power, authenticity and star quality,\" added Prince William, who is also president of Bafta.\nHackman's 1978 Superman co-star Valerie Perrine labelled him \"a genius\", while the Guardian's film critic said his death \"marks the end\" of the era of American new wave cinema.\nThe Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, who worked with Hackman on the 1974 mystery thriller The Conversation, called Hackman \"a great artist\".\nIn a statement posted on Instagram, Coppola said: \"Gene Hackman a great actor, inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity.\n\"I mourn his loss, and celebrate his existence and contribution.\"\nHackman, who won two Oscars for his work on The French Connection and Clint Eastwood's Western Unforgiven, played more than 100 roles across his career.\nThey included supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s.\nPerrine, who acted opposite Hackman as his character's on-screen girlfriend Eve Teschmacher, described the late actor as \"a genius\" and one of the \"greatest to grace the silver screen\".\nShe posted on X: \"His performances are legendary. His talent will be missed.

That's how powerful an actor he was. He will be missed, but his work will live on forever.\"\nSlumdog Millionaire star Anil Kapoor also called Hackman a \"genius\" performer. \"A true legend whose legacy will live on,\" he wrote.\nAs well as his Oscar wins, Hackman also collected two Baftas, four Golden Globes and a Screen Actors Guild Award.\nThe Guardian's film critic Pete Bradshaw wrote that Hackman's death \"marks the end of one of the greatest periods of US cinema: the American new wave.\"\n\"Hackman was the gold standard for this era, ever since Warren Beatty gave him his big break with the role of Buck Barrow in Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967),\" said Bradshaw. \n\"He was the character actor who was really a star; in fact the star of every scene he was in \u2013 that tough, wised-up, intelligent but unhandsome face perpetually on the verge of coolly unconcerned derision, or creased in a heartbreakingly fatherly, pained smile.\"\nAdding: \"He wasn't gorgeous like [Robert] Redford or dangerously sexy like [Jack] Nicholson, or even puckish like [Dustin] Hoffman; Hackman was normal, but his normality was steroidally supercharged.\"\nThe critic branded his performance \"as the reckless, racist cop\", 'Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle, in William Friedkin's 1971 film The French Connection as \"unmissable\".\n",

And it was a lot of layers and nuances to the character that I could really relate to.\u201d\nThe Last Showgirl has received a mixed reception from critics, though most have praised Anderson's performance.\nThe New York Times called it \"sensitive and beguiling\" and described Anderson as \"dazzling\". But the Guardian awarded it just one star, calling it \"a big disappointment\" (although a later review bumped that up to three stars).\nMany have also described the role as Anderson's \"comeback\". She doesn't reject the term, but says she prefers to see it as \"a new chapter\".\n\"I've always been fascinated with the craft of acting,\" she said. \"[But] my personal life kind of took me off course, and I raised two beautiful boys.\"\nShe's not the only actress to be back in the spotlight this season.\nDemi Moore is nominated for best actress at the Oscars for her role in The Substance, a body horror which has revitalised her career.\n\"I'm really happy for Demi,\" Anderson said. \"I think she's earned her place. And you have to earn it. You have to fight for it.\"\nWith so many strong female protagonists in this year's films, I'm curious what Anderson now thinks of Baywatch.\nThe show has long been criticised for its portrayal of its female characters, who, many argued, were sexualised and denied meaningful plot lines.\n\"I didn't see it like that at all. I thought it was quite innocent and wholesome and, and fun to watch,\" she said.\n\"I always felt like I was surrounded by such incredible people, lifeguards that were also firemen or firewomen. It was really, really, empowering.\"\nAnderson has always been seen to embody a look that rose to prominence in the 90s - skinny, blonde, and enhanced by plastic surgery.\nBut in recent years, she has been sporting a \"no-makeup\" look, choosing instead to embrace her natural appearance.\n\"My beauty routine is rest. And so that's more important to me these days,\" she told me.\nShe said it's not that she's against makeup, but more that she thinks \"there's a time and a place\" for it.\n\"This chapter, for me, has been about self-acceptance and finding out who I am. What are my original thoughts? What do I have to give?\" she said.\n\"I know I have a lot more to give in this world, in this industry too, and I feel like even I have to remember who I am to start with and then hopefully, play characters in films and not in my personal life.\"",

Trump has lauded the \"very big agreement\" as an opportunity for the US to get its \"money back\" after funding aid to Ukraine. \nBut Zelensky has instead referred to it as a \"framework agreement\" upon which he hopes further deals can be made.\nTrump has said he wants a quick end to the war in Ukraine and has sought to reset relations with Russia. After a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the two leaders sent delegations to Saudi Arabia in bilateral talks which excluded Ukraine. \nIn response, Zelensky accused the US of helping Putin \"break out of years of isolation\" and Trump of living in a \"Russian disinformation space\". \nUkraine is a country rich in natural resources.

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

Now [it] is hard but we are doing things to achieve success in the future.\"\nUnited's inconsistency puts even more focus on the two cup competitions they remain in - they face Real Sociedad in the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie on Thursday - as it appears increasingly likely winning one of them is the only way they will qualify for European football next season.\nThe issues he is facing are so extensive, Amorim could be forgiven for wishing he had stuck to his initial demand not to leave Sporting until the end of the season.\nHowever, he does think dealing with so many problems has made him a more rounded coach.\n\"Better [coach] is hard to say, because I am not winning games,\" he said. \"But in three months here, I live certain things that I think make me a more complete manager.\n\"Sometimes you need to lose and be in a poor situation to grow. I am not going to die if I lose three games in a row. I learned that here. I can cope and maintain my energy. I am learning a lot about myself and the players - but I prefer to win games.\"\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

We're slowly bonding. Yesterday was a so-so day, just OK. But we got through all our run-plan. I was not doing set-up changes or directing where I want the car to go.\n\"Today was a bit more getting to explore a bit my interaction with my engineer.\"\nBoth Sainz and Leclerc had spins during the say - Sainz's at Turn One and Leclerc's at the final corner - just as they were starting flying laps.\nMercedes drivers George Russell and Andrea Kimi Antonelli were fourth and fifth fastest.\nMcLaren's Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris were 13th and 14th fastest.\nPre-season testing is a notoriously unreliable indicator of actual competitive performance because factors such as fuel loads and engine modes are not revealed by the teams and have a major impact on performance.\nAnd despite Sainz's fastest time, Williams team principal James Vowles underlined that his team were not fast enough to compete at the front this year.\n\"The top four are the top four,\" Vowles said. \"McLaren, Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes have all done good work over the winter.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nRed Bull's world champion Max Verstappen did not drive while team-mate Liam Lawson was in the car all day, ending up seventh fastest; Verstappen will drive on the final day on Friday.\nLeclerc said before running in the afternoon: \"It's only testing. Everyone is hiding their true performance but the feeling is pretty good. No bad surprises but too early to judge performances.\"\nNorris said in the news conference before driving in the second session: \"We have just tried to make the car quicker all round. Add more load. If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone.

        "article_text": "The legendary actor tells Katty Kay that his parents would have much rather he became an accountant or insurance broker, but finally came around when they saw him perform on stage.\nWith a shelf filled with awards, including Screen Actors Guild trophies, Emmys, a Golden Globe, a Tony and a pair of Olivier Awards, 86-year-old Sir Derek Jacobi has proven to be much more than \"the classical Shakespearean actor of our generation,\" as BBC special correspondent Katty Kay describes him during an interview at his home in London.\nSir Derek credits a serendipitous combination of luck and talent for his decades-long career, which includes roles in blockbusters like Gladiator and its 2024 sequel, and stints on sitcom Frasier, for which he won the 2001 Emmy for outstanding guest actor in a comedy series.\n\"Somehow, I was born to be an actor. That's what I feel. There was never any alternative,\" Sir Derek says about first appearing on the stage at the age of 17. He was born in north-east London to a father who ran a sweet shop and a mother who was a secretary. \"That's what I wanted. That's what I thought I could do. That's what I enjoyed.\"\nEnjoying the spotlight was just a part of his success. Sir Derek notes that after he found himself at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre (which he affectionately calls the Rep) in 1960, there wasn't anything else that matched the euphoria of basking in an audience's applause. It was a far cry from what his parents had hoped for. Like most, they'd expected their son to go into a field with stability, like accounting or insurance.\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay\nWatch\u00a0Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on\u202fYouTube.\n\"I always thought\u2026 I wanted to be an actor. I had no talent for anything else,\" he says. \"Hamlet confirmed it.\" After reciting one of the doomed prince's monologues to Kay, Sir Derek admits that most of his roles have disappeared into the ether, but the work of the Bard has stayed with him since those early performances almost 70 years ago. \"All the other parts have gone. Hamlet's still around. Shakespeare stays.\"\nSir Derek is quick to name drop some of his esteemed colleagues: Dame Maggie Smith, Sir Laurence Olivier, Dame Vanessa Redgrave, Albert Finney and Sir Robert Stephens. But he's as quick to note that he didn't have the classical training many of them had. He tells Kay that it was a bit of luck that led to his successes, which include being knighted by the late Queen Elizabeth II and earning the Danish Order of the Dannebrog.\n\"I think there's talent and I think there's luck. Without that luck, the talent isn't enough on its own,\" he says. \"You've got to have the opportunity to show you've got talent. Without that opportunity\u2026 nobody's seeing it.\"\nMore like this:\u00a0\n\u2022 It took nearly 60 years for Brooke Shields to overcome her imposter syndrome\n\u2022 Ina Garten on her internet appeal: 'Young people don't have mom in the kitchen'\u00a0\n\u2022 Olympic legend Lindsey Vonn explains the mindset of a winner\u00a0\nAnother obstacle Jacobi notes was the fact that he was never seen as classically handsome. \"They had a head start because they were nice to look at,\" he says of Stephens and Olivier, while he credits being able to hone his craft in front of an audience from the age of 17 as what set him apart. He tells Kay that luck landed him that first job and his time at the Rep stood in for drama school. \"It was a huge learning experience.\"\nAnd although Sir Derek says he hasn't stopped learning, he works at a different pace now, and has learned to find new ways of working.\n\"You slow down,\" the 86-year-old says. \"It's more difficult to remember lines. I used to have a very sharp brain. I don't anymore. That, obviously, is age.\" These days, he has some help with those lines via an earpiece just in case, with Kay likening it to a skier using a knee brace.\u00a0\n\"I've really had a charmed life,\" Sir Derek says, reflecting on his career, his long-time husband, theatre director Richard Clifford, and the fact that he can still do what he loves. Sir Derek's upcoming projects include appearances in episodes of Doctor Who Unbound and Good Omens as well as films The Vampyre: Blood & Ink, with Malcolm McDowell and action-comedy Tinsel Town, alongside Rebel Wilson and Kiefer Sutherland.\n\"I can't complain about anything in my life.\"\nInfluential with Katty Kay airs on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Italian cuisine may be one of the most recognised and loved in the world \u2013 often imagined as a collection of ancient recipes and local traditions preserved by skilful nonnas over the centuries. But now, a food historian is exposing common myths and false stories, arguing that the Italian cuisine as we know it is barely a few decades old.\nFood is no doubt an integral part of the country's culture and identity \u2013 so much so that Italians cherish Neapolitan pizza or pasta alla carbonara as much as the great historical and artistic treasures of the boot-shaped peninsula. Tales abound of centuries-old local feuds over what city has the best filled pasta, while every local cheese or cured meat is likely to boast links to the Renaissance or the Middle Ages.\nAlberto Grandi, food historian and professor of economic history at the University of Parma, has been debunking Italian food myths for years. In 2018, Grandi published Denominazione di Origine Inventata (Invented Designation of Origin: The Lies of Marketing on Typical Italian Products) and later launched a podcast called DOI. But it was a 2023 interview with Financial Times that put Grandi's work into the spotlight and sparked wide debates across Italy.\nGrandi claimed in the interview that pasta alla carbonara was invented in Italy just after World War Two using US Army provisions like bacon and powdered egg yolks, countering the common belief that the authentic recipe includes pork jowl and Roman pecorino cheese. This theory is backed by other authors, like Luca Cesari in The Discovery of Pasta: A History in Ten Dishes, but caused outrage in a country increasingly obsessed with maintaining the lore of Italian authenticity in food. The discussion evolved into a heated Italian-American dispute about the origin of the iconic dish. \u00a0\nGrandi's latest book, La Cucina Italiana Non Esiste (Italian Cuisine Doesn't Exist), written with his podcast co-host Daniele Soffiati and published in April 2024, stirred new controversies with its provocative title.\u00a0\nThe idea that many beloved recipes and products such as cheeses or cured meats have hundreds of years of history, Grandi and Soffiati claim, is pure fantasy. Food is constantly changing and evolving. No product or recipe has always been as we know it now, and most dishes have a shorter history than most people imagine.\nGrandi argues that migration is what made Italian cuisine what it is today. Millions of people left Italy in the 19th and 20th Centuries, emigrating to South America, North America and European countries. They were leaving behind a country that was poverty-stricken, where the diet was limited to a handful of products. Pellagra, a disease caused by lack of vitamin B3, was endemic in several areas of Italy at the end of the 19th Century.\u00a0\nThe Italians who landed on New York's Ellis Island left hunger and misery behind. And it was in the \"new world\", Grandi argues, that Italian immigrants found the wealth and ingredients to create the recipes that eventually popularised Italian food worldwide.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nHowever, many Italians are not familiar with this history. They might imagine that their beloved recipes were born in Italy, passed down, unchanged, from generation to generation and eventually exported abroad by Italian migrants. \"It might seem that the rest of the world didn't know how to eat until all of a sudden Italians arrived,\" says Grandi. He believes it's pure myth \u2013 popularised by social media \u2013 that nonnas taught Americans how to cook rich, genuine Italian food.\nPizza is the most famous example of this. Born as a cheap street food in Naples, in the 19th Century it was almost synonymous with poverty and filth. Pizza is \"a crust of leavened bread dough, oven-toasted, with a sauce of a bit of everything on top\", wrote Pinocchio author Carlo Collodi in 1886. He added that pizza had \"an air of complex filth that perfectly matches that of its vendor\".\nIt was in America, says Grandi, that pizza became \"red\". While fresh tomatoes were among the original toppings, Italian immigrants to the US popularised pizza prepared with tomato sauce, a product that industrialisation made easy to access and store. And it was in the US that pizzerias really started to take off. \u00a0\nScholars call this process \"the pizza effect\": when a product leaves its place of origin, gets profoundly transformed and then returns to its place of origin to be fully embraced in a completely different form.\nGrandi also angered Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese producers when he argued that parmesan has evolved for the better over the last few decades, and the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese that was eaten in Italy 100 years ago and earlier \u2013 a smaller wheel with a black rind \u2013 is now only made in Wisconsin.\nThe shift in the Italian culinary landscape started with the rapid expansion that occurred in Italy post-WWII. The boom brought new possibilities to millions of Italians. Cars, supermarkets and refrigerators meant that people who were limited to a daily local supply could travel to restaurants, buy new products and create new recipes. Tiramisu, says Grandi, is a great example of this: a dessert created in the late 1960s that is based on supermarket ingredients and only possible with a refrigerator. \u00a0\u00a0\nWith the new products and brands also came marketing. \"Television influenced our cuisine and gastronomical identity greatly,\" says Grandi. He argues that most of Italy's gastronomic traditions were invented by food marketers. Carosello, a short television programme that aired in Italy every night from 1957 to 1977, introduced new products and brands through stories, sketches and iconic characters. Carosello provided the consumer education upon which Italian home cuisine was then built, especially by mothers and grandmothers.\nGrandi's book explains that when industry-driven growth started to lose steam in the 1970s, Italy's economy pivoted to small companies, niche products and local excellence. Thousands of protected labels and regional products emerged and Italians doubled down on gastro-nationalism.\n\"Cuisine is no longer part of our identity,\" says Grandi, \"it is our identity.\" He argues that after decades of industry decline and economic stagnation, Italians have no faith in the future \u2013 that's why they \"invent the past\".\nIn less than a century, Grandi says, Italians went from being malnourished migrants to self-appointed custodians of ancestral traditions. The obsession for tradition has sparked searches for \"true\" recipes and \"correct\" ways of consuming food. Italians are ever more adamant to say that bolognese should be called rag\u00f9 alla bolognese and never served with spaghetti. You should also never put chicken (let alone pineapple) on pizza, cook pasta alla carbonara with cream or break spaghetti in two.\n\"I always say that every time anyone in the world adds cream to carbonara, somebody in Rome dies,\" says Grandi. \"Italians used to get upset when they were defined as 'pizza, pasta, mandolin, mafia',\" he adds. \"Now it looks like it's us Italians feeding those stereotypes.\"\nSocial media seems to have contributed to popularising these attitudes. The X account Italians mad at food, launched in 2015, showcases comments of furious Italians who are outraged and offended by how people in other nations choose to eat \"their\" cuisine. The account even sells t-shirts with quotes like \"carbonara is not an opinion\" and \"you break spaghetti, you break my heart\".\nContent creators on platforms like TikTok and Instagram have popularised a genre of video content showing Italians reacting to food \"blasphemy\", with creators and celebrities vigorously showcasing their disgust and indignation \u2013 with no shortage of drama and hand gestures.\nThe popularity of these memes is now so widespread that people might think all Italians feel offended by people's choice of pasta sauce.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\n\"Food as entertainment can be triggering, especially for Italians,\" says Aurora Cavallo, a young Italian chef known as Cooker Girl, with more than 1.3 million followers on both TikTok and Instagram. \"For many people in the world, food isn't just an object but something that carries a lot of significance,\" she adds. \"In my experience, Italians can be more sensitive not just towards recipes, but also towards how food is handled on screen.\"\nGrandi's relentless debunking of Italian food myths has made many people angry over the last few years, but he is adamant that he just wants to dispute the invented history of many products and recipes, not their quality.\nAs social media demonstrates, however, some Italians have convinced themselves that food dogmas are more important than innovations or accuracy.\n\"We don't need to make up stories about Italy's amazing products,\" says Cavallo, echoing Grandi. \"We shouldn't create a situation in which changing recipes is the end of the world because that's the opposite of how Italian food came to be.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Tom Pidcock is one of Britain's most successful riders in the modern era\nTom Pidcock said goodbye to Ineos Grenadiers at a training camp in December in Denia, Spain, \"on good terms\" following a career-defining three years which ended with the 25-year-old being \"no longer compatible\" with one of cycling's biggest and most successful teams.\nA couple of months later he looked a man unleashed as he blasted away from his pursuers on the second stage of his debut race for his new second-tier Q36.5 team, winning comfortably between steep sandstone rocks during the Alula Tour - a race where he would go on to win the overall green jersey.\nThe only thing missing was any of his true rivals for the big race wins this year. It made Pidcock look imperious in Saudi Arabia, but it's how he will look in Belgium and France as the season progresses that will define his year - and possibly the double Olympic mountain bike champion's road-race career.\nVery little information about how the relationship with one of Ineos' biggest talents broke down has made it outside the team bus. Which leaves many looking for clues within what both team and athlete say - even while they are trying not to say much.\n\"I think it's as simple as the word 'compatibility',\" said Ineos CEO John Allert during a pre-season press call. \"There's no guarantees in life... I think Tom and the team probably realised we'd come to a point of recognising that.\n\"I think the whole Tom topic might be one for a book in 10 years' time.\"\nIt's as telling, especially in Allert's last line, as it is diplomatic.\nThere's little doubt there was a fallout: they dropped him from competing in the final big race of last season - the Il Lombardia 'monument' classic across Italy's wealthy northern region. A one-day event Pidcock was perfect for.\nPidcock himself gave his own clues to BBC Sport during his second training camp before the new season. \"I feel fresher, more energised. I feel like it's my own journey, taking control and being in charge of my own destiny. It's a really nice feeling as well.\"\nThe past few seasons had seen Ineos shift from a winning machine to a more relaxed and autonomous environment, which would seemingly suit a young, nonchalant, multi-discipline athlete such as Pidcock.\nThey were happy to see him throw himself into a lake off a speedboat on Instagram, or fly at breakneck speed down the dirt tracks of the Alps for Olympic glory on a different kind of bike.\nBut road cycling is changing and Ineos are making a transition into a modern 'super-team'. This includes last year's introduction of performance director Scott Drawer and a search for more sponsors on top of the already substantial backing of Ineos owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, which requires a refocus on what was their original objective as Team Sky: to win the Tour de France, again and again.\nPidcock's Q36.5 team should receive an invitation to at least one Grand Tour, but it's in the one-day races above where the Briton could excel\nPidcock himself remains confident he is capable of winning a three-week race - he has won one of the hardest stages of the hardest race of them all, of course, descending his way to folklore at 100km/h before climbing Alpe d'Huez to victory during the 2022 Tour de France.\nPidcock, however, won't be there in 2025 as cycling's biggest race would have been unlikely to accept Q36.5 this year - given their current lower UCI ProTeams status, they will rely on wildcard invites to this year's biggest World Tour races.\n\"I'm happy, I've got a year out from it... a break. When I come back it'll be [with] a refreshed energy,\" he said.\nQ36.5 will make it to at least one three-week Grand Tour this year and it allows Pidcock to focus on the one-day races, where he has excelled in recent seasons.\nHis next objective must be to win one of the five 'monument' one-day races. \"Italian races, Ardennes [classics]... all these races I want to perform in, and now be a bit more focused on them.\"\nIt's a focus which begins this weekend with the spring classics 'opening weekend', the Omloop Nieuwsblad race in Belgium.\nMore clues lie within a team seemingly behind Ineos in terms of resource.\n\"This team has super-impressed me with how much knowledge there is and expertise in certain areas,\" said Pidcock. \"This is the highest standard of people I've actually ever worked with.\"\nPidcock knows he hasn't simply jumped ship and landed hastily with a minnow. There's a lot more to a team who have already won as many races this year as they had in a whole season since 2023.\nOwned by a former mining magnate, South African Ivan Glasenberg, the team - named after the high-end cycling clothing brand - have potentially very deep pockets and a few 'prestige' sponsors in a sport which still allows big spending to pay off quickly.\nThe team was born in 2023 out of the ashes of Team Dimension Data, which under many guises won several big races as a World Tour team across the previous 15 or so years, including Mark Cavendish - wearing the yellow jersey - claiming four Tour de France stage wins in 2016.\nPidcock's 2025 began with a bang with victory overall, and on the two climbing stages, at the Alula Tour in Saudi Arabia\nTeam boss Doug Ryder, a fellow South African, led that team. And while anyone would expect an employer to be excited about their new charge, Ryder's view of Pidcock is effusive.\n\"[Pidcock's] attention to detail is next-level,\" he says. \"He focuses on every millimetre. We did a nice team-building event, and it was Tom's idea, and then he wouldn't let the team pay - just those personal things are just really, really cool.\"\nQuite the team player for a man considered by some to be the opposite at Ineos. And it's likely the biggest clue of all when it comes to Pidcock's Ineos era...\n\"Within our team, he doesn't have to fight for leadership,\" concludes Ryder. \"He will be our out-and-out leader when we go to those races.\n\"He wants to be a world champion. And he wants to ride for general classification in a Grand Tour, and show that he's one of those riders that can stand tall on the podium in the highest endurance events in our sport.\"",

        "article_text": "When most of us are stressed out we're able to intuitively name the emotion because of the way it makes us feel.\nBut when Dr Krysia Waldock is struggling it can take a bit longer for the penny to drop.\nThat's because they are one of up to 10% of the population that experiences alexithymia.\nThe word alexithymia derives from Greek and translates roughly as \"no words for emotions\".\nPeople who experience the phenomenon, which is not widely known about, can have difficulties expressing their emotions, recognising their emotions and telling the difference between different emotions.\n\"For me, a lot of the time it's struggling to know how I feel,\" said Dr Waldock.\n\"So something will happen, I'll know that there is a feeling, but I don't know what it is and it'll take me a while, if at all, to figure out what I'm feeling.\"\nIdentifying stress can be particularly challenging. \n\"Sometimes when I'm stressed or anxious, for example, I feel it in my body, feel it in my jaw a lot, I'll bump into things, drop things... I'll know something's out but I won't necessarily put two and two together,\" they said.\n\"So it will either take a very long time for me to put it together or it just will not be put together at all.\"\nDr Waldock, who uses they/them pronouns, is autistic. Research suggests autistic people are up to five times more likely to experience alexithymia compared to the general population. \n\"For me, it's part of being autistic and neurodivergent,\" they said. \nAlexithymia is closely related to interoception, which is the ability to interpret and label internal signals from your body such as when you are hungry, tired or need to go to the toilet. \nDr Waldock said on occasion they do not experience hunger cues so eat at set times to ensure they do not miss meals. \nDr Waldock is a research assistant at Swansea University and is currently working on a project that aims to better understand autistic people's reproductive health experiences throughout their life.\nTheir colleague, the project's research officer Dr Rebecca Ellis, also has autism and alexithymia.\nDr Ellis said the experience of alexithymia differed from person to person and was also more common among people with anxiety and depression.\nSome people have always had alexithymia whereas others acquire it through trauma, she said. \nShe said she struggled to tell the difference between feeling anxious and excited.\n\"Both of them can feel quite similar and quite uncomfortable as well,\" she said. \n\"If I went on a rollercoaster I'm just sat there worried so why would I go on it?\"\nShe also finds it hard to tell if she is apprehensive or looking forward to something. \n\"That's a big ball of confusion for me,\" she laughed. \n\"So even if it's a lovely social event that I'm looking forward to... I'm always kind of feeling a little bit positive and maybe a little bit negative about it.\"\nBoth Dr Ellis and Dr Waldock have found ways of working with their alexithymia.\nDr Ellis said asking others questions about how they are able to identity their emotions could be useful.\n\"It can be something that you can learn to get better at,\" she said. \n\"You can get an understanding of your emotions and feelings.\"\nDr Waldock uses an app called How We Feel which lists different feelings and definitions which they can use to help identify how they are feeling. \nBoth agreed being given a non-judgmental heads up from those close to them when they were acting differently could be useful.  \nThere are no set diagnostic criteria for alexithymia so why is having a term like this useful? \n\"I think it allows you to be kinder to yourself,\" said Dr Ellis.\n\"Having that term not only means that more people than just yourself are experiencing it, but it also means that you and others can understand it a bit better too.\"\nDr Waldock agreed.\n\"As I've started learning about what it means to be autistic, and that includes experiences like alexithymia, it's really helped me get to know myself a bit better,\" they said.\n\"Growing up I was the square peg in the round hole scenario consistently whereas now I've stopped trying to push myself into that wrong hole as much.\"",

        "article_text": "Meghan's new Netflix series in which she offers cooking and home tips arrives next week. She's just the latest high-profile woman to present herself as a lifestyle guru \u2013 and divide opinion in doing so.\nThe Duchess of Sussex's lifestyle show is finally arriving on Netflix on Tuesday, after being pushed back because of the Los Angeles fires. With Love, Meghan sees her picking flowers, cooking with friends, and looking radiant in a huge, glossy Californian home.\nThe move into such well-worn domestic-goddess territory saw Meghan instantly dubbed \"the millennial Martha Stewart of Montecito\" in The New York Times. But of course, this being Meghan \u2013 the subject of a vast amount of criticism in the British media specifically and on social media generally \u2013 backlash flared the minute the trailer was released. She's flaunting her wealth, said her critics: tone-deaf. She's becoming a trad wife: bad feminist. She's fake, she just wants to sell products, she's unbearably earnest\u2026\u00a0\nAnd yet, Meghan has her fans as much as her detractors, and it's likely that With Love, Meghan will be a ratings hit for the streamer, bringing people together: not always in the way the show intends perhaps, but by persuading both those who buy into the pretty-princess fantasy \u2013 and those who may \"hate-watch\" it \u2013 to tune in, agog. \"Everyone's invited to create wonder in every moment\" \u2013 as Meghan puts it.\nThe public's feelings towards domestic goddesses \u2013 those women who sell a lifestyle, and a very particular idealised version of womanhood \u2013 have always been complex, but they may have never been more conflicted than in 2025. \"Of course, the image of the idealised woman has changed over time, and even more rapidly in recent years\" says Dr Edith Hill, an Australian academic whose research is in social media, influencers and women's bodies online. These days, Hill tells the BBC, \"there is no one ''ideal' image of a woman online, as each community and sub-community has their own version of the perfect creator.\" This means that the most famous end up both loved and loathed: figures like Meghan, Gwyneth Paltrow and Nara Smith walk the line between having devoted fanbases, and being scorned, castigated and even blamed for a wealth of societal ills.\nNara Smith is probably the most famous iteration of the most vexed contemporary version of the domestic goddess: the trad wife. Smith has 11.5 million followers on TikTok \u2013 that's a lot of people who want to watch videos from her home in Texas, where she raises kids and bakes their food from scratch. While wearing ballgowns. In a gorgeous kitchen. You could say it's aggressively aspirational \u2013 but it's also patently unrealistic. I doubt many people watching genuinely wish they too could make their toddlers homemade bubblegum while wearing a lime-green conical-bust gown. \u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How one surprising image kick-started the 1990s\n\u2022 Ten of the best TV shows to watch this March\n\u2022 Why influencers are facing a pushback\nOf course, many women do find joy and satisfaction in the kitchen \u2013 or in other traditional domestic activities, such as hosting, home-making, arranging flowers, dressing in a feminine way\u2026 there's nothing inherently \"unfeminist\" with any of that. But the broader interest in trad wives \u2013 women who espouse traditional 1950s-style family values, and dedicate themselves wholly to keeping house and raising kids \u2013 has been seen by many as a worryingly retrograde step. Less domestic goddess, more domestic servitude, is the gist of the criticism. \"There is a certain undertone from some of the more traditional creators that does lean toward very stereotypical gender roles and strong religious ideals, that can lead to the oppression of women,\" says Hill. \"It would be naive to ignore the very close line that can be drawn between that content and women's oppression.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe recent obsession with trad wives may reflect a broader disenchantment with modern lifestyles: the anxiety that what equality of the sexes actually brought us is merely drudgery for all. When two parents have to work constantly in order to have enough money to live, and women also end updoing a \"second shift\" of housework and childcare, the old model of dividing the labour might look more appealing.\nArguably, we could more accurately place the source of the problem with capitalism, rather than feminism \"gone too far\". And it is unfortunately inevitable that full-time tradwiffery requires a partner who earns a lot of money, inevitably also bringing that traditional dynamic into play: domestic bliss predicated on man-as-breadwinner, woman-as-helpmeet.\nBut as much as there is endless hand-wringing in the media over the meaning of the trad-wife phenomenon, in some ways, it's nothing new: domestic goddesses have always been a source of fascination \u2013 dismissed as retrograde by some, and yet a source of aspiration, inspiration, and even compulsion for others. Because they don't just present a certain lifestyle: they often promise that you, scruffy disorganised frazzled ordinary woman, could be a domestic goddess too, if you just do what they say. Witness: the OG DG, Martha Stewart, who made a multi-million-dollar empire out of housekeeping tips.\nStewart made her name as a hard-grafting lifestyle guru who would tell you exactly what to do, and how to do it properly, whether putting up a shelf or planning a wedding. And part of the appeal of domestic goddesses has always been this illusion of control, of solution: do this, and have a better life.\nStewart started out running a catering business in 1975, before publishing the legendary 1982 glossy how-to guide, Entertaining. It was just the starting gun of the unstoppable Martha Stewart brand, that's since flogged everything from tea towels to CBD gummies; she's published more than 100 books offering brisk guidance on gardening, hosting, cooking and homemaking. And the news that Entertaining is to be republished this year surely supports the theory that we're in a retro domestic goddess moment.\nFollowing in Martha's footsteps came another US DG who inspires a devoted following: Ina Garten aka The Barefoot Contessa. Garten just published a memoir, Be Ready When the Luck Happens, designed to persuade people that her seemingly charmed career \u2013 from running a Hamptons food store so casually chic that it featured in a Nancy Meyers movie, to fronting scores of cookery books and TV shows since the 90s \u2013 was the result of hard work and good timing, a blend of effort and effortlessness.\nGarten's recipes also straddle effort and effortlessness: she specialises in rich, indulgent, bistro-style deliciousness, and offers detailed instruction as to exactly how to achieve it. But she's won fans for her catchphrase \"store-bought is fine\": a pinch of realism amid the lifestyle gloss.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd of course, not all domestic goddesses have been about perfection or spending hours in the kitchen \u2013 in fact, many have made a career out of proffering tips and tricks to make hosting and homemaking easier. Shirley Conran, the British journalist and author \u2013 also sometimes called the \"original\" domestic goddess \u2013\u00a0 promoted the idea of women \"having it all\", and famously informed women in her 1975 pop-feminism housework manual Superwoman that \"life is too short to stuff a mushroom\". Nara Smith clearly didn't get the memo.\nThe idea of Superwoman was to liberate women from the tyranny of housework and perfection, not to be trapped by it: a domestic goddess in the 70s was the woman who had it all \u2013 job, home, marriage, kids, good sex, control of their finances, and a general air of fabulousness. The title was not actually meant to be taken seriously: \"A Superwoman isn\u2019t a woman who can do anything, but a woman who avoids doing too much,\" Conran wrote.\nAnd missing the irony has often been an issue for DGs \u2013 not least for the deliciously tongue-in-cheek Nigella Lawson, who helped popularise the term. The curvaceous, flirtatious British chef also began her career with a book full of time-saving tips and anti-perfectionist reassurance: \"Never worry about what your guests will think of you,\" she wrote encouragingly in How to Eat. \"Just think of the food. What will taste good?\"\nBut her second book in 1998 was called How to Be a Domestic Goddess \u2013 a joke that was missed, she's long insisted, and a title that now makes her cringe. \"It was supposed to be ironic,\" she told the New York Times in 2019. Today, Lawson is a full-on national treasure in the UK, but at the start of her fame, and rather like today's trad wives, she was castigated by some critics who accused her of setting back feminism. She has since countered her critics by describing baking as feminist.\nA domestic goddess became a standard to live up to, and yet another reason for women to feel inadequate. And this is the contradiction at the heart of DGs, whether they\u2019re incredibly earnest (Meghan; Gwyneth) or winkingly ironic (Lawson): while many give off an air of effortlessness and espouse mantras of ease for most women most of the time, such domestic bliss is actually not easy. Or, indeed, affordable. \"We're not in the pursuit of perfection, we're in the pursuit of joy,\" declares Meghan in the trailer for her show.\u00a0 But it's hard not to feel like it would be a lot easier to pursue joy if you lived in a Californian mansion with help. To state the obvious, an enviable, idealised lifestyle is more readily available when you don't have to stress about the bills, and instead have the free time to, say, learn to fold a napkin like an Easter bunny.\nIt is also so obvious as to be almost banal to point out that DGs are mostly very wealthy. And fortune begets fortune: all this lifestyle content is, on some level, also an advert for the DGs' product lines, whether that's Meghan's company, As Ever, selling jams, Ina's cookware, or Gwyneth\u2019s Goop empire.\nFor some, the wholesome, homespun emphasis on making preserves or crafting your own table decorations is particularly grating precisely because these women are clearly monied and leisured enough to have time for all that. Yet for others, that's what's appealing, even soothing, about watching them: we may not have a spare four hours to bake, but we can watch a four-minute video of Nara Smith baking; we may not have the money to make like Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway at the opening of the eponymous novel, and buy the flowers ourselves, but we can watch Meghan pick out blooms in a fancy florist.\n\"The domesticity is presented to us as peaceful while also fulfilling,\" says Hill, on the appeal of this sort of content, which it is so easy to be cynical about. \"Many people can relate to wanting to nourish and nurture their families, but what this looks like in reality for everyone else is at complete odds to the image we're presented through these curated narratives.\"\nPerhaps this is the key: we mustn't mistake today's goddesses with mere mortals \u2013 consider them floating fictional constructs, higher(-earning) beings. And absolutely not a yardstick against which to measure ideal femininity. \"I think we can be inspired by these women and the lives they are presenting,\" say Hill, \"while also recognising it is wholly impossible to attain.\"\nWith Love, Meghan is on Netflix from 4 March\nHolly Williams's novel, The Start of Something, is out in paperback now\u00a0\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "When Luna Sofia Miranda approached Sean Baker in a strip club in New York in 2022, she tried her best to charm him.\nBut he \"very clearly did not want to buy a lap dance,\" she says.\nMiranda, who was 23 at the time, started asking why he and his wife were there.\n\"I'm very nosy,\" she says. \"So I kept asking them questions and I finally got it out of them. They were making a film about strippers.\"\nShe told them she had studied acting, and - after a successful audition - got a call on her 24th birthday, to offer her a part in the film.\nThat film, Anora, is now seen as one of the frontrunners heading into the Oscars on Sunday.\nIt's directed by Baker, and stars Mikey Madison, who is up for best actress for her role as a New York stripper.\nMadison, 25, relied on real-life strippers to help her perfect the part.\nWhen she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.\n\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.\nThey \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.\nWe've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.\nSome praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".\nEdie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.\nTurquet, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.\nShe got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.\n\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.\n\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"\nTurquet points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.\n\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"\nBut when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.\n\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"\nBaker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.\nShe says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.\nThey connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.\nIn the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nMiranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.\n\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.\nOne of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"\nThis section contains spoilers for Anora\nMiranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.\n\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.\n\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"\nTurquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.\n\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.\n\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"\nBut overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.\n\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.\n\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"\nShe said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".\n\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"\n\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"\nFor Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.\n\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\" \nFor Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.\nIn the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.\nWe also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.\n\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.\n\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"\nWhen Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.\nFootage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.\n\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.\nNow, all eyes are on the Oscars.\nMiranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.\n\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"\nShe said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.\n\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.\n\"If this film wins an Oscar, I want to see that.\"",

And in our briefing we encourage people to listen to and understand them,\" says Rowan Beard, who runs Young Pioneer Tours, one of two Western companies which resumed trips to the country last week, after a five-year hiatus.\nNorth Korea sealed its borders at the outset of the pandemic, shutting out diplomats, aid workers and travellers, and making it nearly impossible to know what was happening there.\nSince then, it has further isolated itself from most of the world, relying on support from Russia and China. Many doubted whether Westerners would ever be allowed back.\nBut after years of cajoling and several false starts, Rowan and some other tour leaders were given the green light to restart operations. He pulled together a group of eager travellers in just five hours, desperate to not miss the opportunity. Most were vloggers and travel addicts, some wanting to tick the final country off their list, along with the odd North Korea enthusiast.\nLast Thursday the tourists, from the UK, France, Germany and Australia, drove over the border from China into the remote area of Rason for a four-night trip.\nAmong them was 28-year-old British YouTuber Mike O'Kennedy. Even with its reputation, he was startled by the extreme level of control. As with all trips to North Korea, the tourists were escorted by local guides, who followed a strict, pre-approved schedule. It included carefully choreographed trips to a beer factory, a school, and a new, fully stocked pharmacy.\nBen Weston, one of the tour leaders from Suffolk, likened visiting North Korea to \"being on a school trip\". \"You can't leave the hotel without the guides,\" he said.\n\"A couple of times I even had to let them know when I wanted to use the bathroom,\" said Mike. \"I've never had to do that anywhere in the world.\"\nDespite the chaperoning, Mike was able to spot snippets of real life. \"Everyone was working, it didn't feel like anyone was just hanging out. That was kind of bleak to see.\"\nOn his trip to the school, a group of eight-year-olds performed a dance to animations of ballistic missiles hitting targets. A video of the spectacle shows girls and boys with red neckties, singing, while explosions flare on a screen behind them.\nFor now, tourists are being kept well away from the capital Pyongyang. Greg Vaczi from Koryo Tours, the other tour company allowed back in, admits the current itinerary lacks the \"big-hitting monuments\" of Pyongyang. He suspects authorities have chosen Rason as their guinea pig because the area is relatively contained and easy to control.\nSet up as a special economic zone, to trial new financial policies, it operates as a mini capitalist enclave inside an otherwise socialist state. Chinese businesspeople run joint enterprises with North Koreans, and can travel in and out fairly freely.\nJoe Smith, a seasoned North Korea traveller and former writer for the specialist North Korea platform NK News, was there on his third trip. \"I feel like the more times you visit the less you know. Each time you get a little peek behind the curtain, which just leaves you with more questions,\" he said.\nJoe's highlight was a surprise off-agenda visit to a luxury goods market, where people were selling jeans and perfumes, along with fake Louis Vuitton handbags and Japanese washing machines, probably imported from China. Here, the tourists were not allowed to take photos - an attempt to hide this consumer bubble from the rest of the country, they suspected.\n\"This was the only place people weren't expecting us,\" Joe said. \"It felt messy and real; a place North Koreans actually go. I loved it.\"\nBut according to the experienced tour leaders, the group's movements were more restricted than on previous trips, with fewer opportunities to wander the streets, pop into a barbershop or supermarket, and talk to locals.\nCovid was often cited as the reason, said Greg from Koryo Tours. \"On the surface they are still concerned. Our luggage was disinfected at the border, our temperatures were taken, and about 50% of people are still wearing masks.\" Greg cannot work out whether the fear is genuine, or an excuse to control people.\nIt is thought Covid hit North Korea hard, though it is difficult to know the extent of the suffering.\nLocal guides repeated the government line that the virus entered the country in a balloon sent over from South Korea, and was swiftly eradicated in 90 days. But Rowan, who has been to North Korea more than 100 times, sensed that Rason had been impacted by the tough Covid regulations. A lot of Chinese businesses had closed, he said, and their workers had left.\nEven Joe, the experienced North Korea traveller, commented on how dilapidated the buildings were. \"Places were dimly lit and there was no heating, apart from in our hotel rooms,\" he said, noting a trip to a cold, dark and deserted art gallery. \"It felt like they opened the doors just for us.\"\nThe regime's photographs might make North Korea look clean and shiny, Joe said, but in person you realise \"the roads are awful, the pavements are wobbly, and the buildings are weirdly constructed\".  His hotel room was old-fashioned and filthy, he said, resembling \"his grandma's living room\". The whole window was cracked.\n\"They've had five years to fix things. North Koreans are so sensitive about what they show tourists. If this is the best they can show, I dread to think what else is out there\", he said. Most of the country is kept well hidden, with more than four in 10 people believed to be undernourished and needing help.\nOne of the few chances tourists in North Korea get to interact with local people is through their guides, who sometimes speak English. On these recent trips they were surprisingly well-informed, despite the regime's intense propaganda machine and information blockade. This is probably because they speak to the Chinese businesspeople who come and go, said Greg.\nThey knew about Trump's tariffs and the war in Ukraine - even that North Korean troops were involved. But when Joe showed a photo from Syria, his guide was unaware President Assad had been toppled. \"I carefully explained that sometimes when people don't like their leader, they rise up and force them out, and at first he didn't believe me.\"\nSuch conversations need to be delicately handled. Strict laws prevent North Koreans from speaking freely. Ask or reveal too much and the tourists might put their guide or themselves at risk.\nMike admits there were times this made him nervous. On a trip to a North Korea-Russia Friendship House, he was invited to write in the visitors' book. \"I went blank and wrote something like 'I wish the world peace.' Afterwards my guide told me that was an inappropriate thing to write. That made me paranoid,\" he said.\n\"Generally, the guides did a great job of making us feel safe. There were just a couple of moments when I thought, this is bizarre.\"\nFor Greg from Koryo Tours, these interactions bring a deeper purpose to North Korea tourism: \"North Koreans get the chance to engage with foreigners. This allows them to come up with new ideas, which, in a country this closed, is so important.\"\nBut tourism to North Korea is contentious, especially as travellers have been allowed back before aid workers and most Western diplomats, including the UK's. Critics, including Joanna Hosaniak from the Citizens Alliance for North Korean Human Rights, argue these trips mainly benefit the regime.\n\"This is not like tourism in other poor countries, where local people benefit from the extra income. The vast majority of the population don't know these tourists exist. Their money goes to the state and ultimately towards its military,\" she said.\nOne conversation has stuck in YouTuber Mike's head. During his trip to the school, he was surprised when a girl, after meeting him, said she hoped to visit the UK one day. \"I didn't have the heart to tell her that her chances were very, very slim,\" he said.",

Many more are in Scotland, where wild releases are already permitted.\nConservationists call beavers \"ecosystem engineers\" because of how they redesign where they live. The dams they build slow the flow of rivers and streams and create habitats where other creatures can thrive. They've also been credited with reducing flooding further downstream. \n\"This is an incredibly exciting moment, a real landmark for nature recovery in England,\" Tony Juniper, the head of Natural England, told me next to a beaver dam in Devon. \n\"We're bringing back a missing animal that's been absent for centuries, and an animal that we know will bring huge benefits for the rest of the wildlife that is already depleted across much of England,\" he says.\nThe beavers will be released under a licensing system overseen by Natural England. \nIt says long term plans will need to be in place to avoid impacts on farming, food production and infrastructure. \nThat's something the National Farmers Union say is vital. It wants culling beavers  to be an option if they prove disruptive.\nNFU Deputy President David Exwood said that while beavers could provide certain benefits, \"we are concerned about the negative impacts beavers can have on productive farmland, as well as the management requirements, costs and risks involved\". \n\"Beavers can flood and waterlog fields, feed on agricultural crops like maize, as well as damage and fell trees such as cricket bat willow.\"\nWe met up with Tony Juniper of Natural England at the site of the pilot project for wild beaver release in England, the River Otter catchment in Devon. Beavers first appeared here more than a decade ago - it's not clear where they came from. They may have escaped from enclosures or have been illegally released, so called \"beaver bombing\".\nSince then the wild beavers have been allowed to stay, with their impact on the landscape and the way they interact with local farmland closely monitored.\n\"All of this open water is down to the beavers,\" Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust tells me as we splash our way through the boggy land.\n\"They want this water because it makes them feel safe and secure. It means that they can transport their food as well.\"\nAlong the River Otter Mr Burgess tells me the beavers have created wetlands that now host species such as great white egrets and kingfishers. Dragonfly numbers have soared as have frogs and toads. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.\nNot everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.\nClinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running. Though broadly supportive of the beavers' return there are concerns about whether enough thought has been given to managing their impacts.\n\"We've also seen farmland flooded, we've seen properties flooded. We've seen people's trees in their gardens felled,\" says John Varley, the chief executive of Clinton Devon Estates.\n\"There are positives with the beaver, huge positives, but there's also some quite significant negatives, particularly for small farmers.\"\nScotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. In some areas the beavers have been so successful at breeding that they have had to be relocated or as a last resort culled.\nThe first wild release of beavers in England is now expected to take place in the next few days. Dr Roisin Campbell-Palmer from the Beaver Trust, which is managing the release, told the BBC the male and female had been taken from \"conflict sites\" in Scotland and were now undergoing medical checks ahead of being moved south. \nAdditional reporting by Kevin Church.",
